[00:00] Jeffrey  was  never  given  proper  life 
 advice  he's  25  years  old  and  yet  he's 
 still  lonely  broke  and  weak  he's  still
[00:07] sitting  around  waiting  for  someone  to 
 give  him  Direction  you're  wasting  your 
 life  Jeffrey
[00:15] I'd  honest  grew  up  with  two  loving 
 parents  his  father  spent  years  teaching
[00:20] him  about  the  game  of  life  so  that  he 
 knew  when  it  was  time  to  play  he'd  take 
 All  the  Right  Moves  he  lives  with
[00:26] purpose  ambition  and  drive  this  is  why 
 Adonis  is  so  successful
[00:31] number  one  start  self-improvement  now 
 when  you  look  around  and  you  see  your 
 peers  who  are  addicted  to  tick  tock  and
[00:38] porn  and  video  games  you  see  that 
 although  they  might  be  having  some  fun 
 they're  not  really  doing  much  productive 
 with  their  lives  the  thing  is  that  right
[00:44] here  right  now  the  time  that  you  spend 
 compounds  exponentially  so  if  you  spend
[00:49] an  hour  working  maybe  an  hour  exercising 
 maybe  an  hour  reading  those  things  are 
 actually  worth  so  much  more  than  an  hour
[00:55] because  you're  so  young  and  so  every 
 decision  you  make  is  kind  of  like  it's 
 bigger  than  the  decision  itself  but
[01:00] every  hour  that  your  friends  spend 
 playing  video  games  or  every  hour  that 
 they  spend  on  Tick  Tock  it's  degrading
[01:05] their  mental  health  their  physical 
 health  they're  just  feeling  lazy  you 
 know  it  [ __ ]  up  their  dopamine  and  now 
 they  can't  even  enjoy  working  or
[01:10] studying  at  this  age  one  of  the  best 
 things  that  you  can  do  is  start 
 self-improvement  and  if  you  just  click
[01:15] on  my  channel  profile  there's  a  video 
 that  presents  itself  on  my  channel  as 
 some  trailer  and  it's  a  full  guide  to
[01:20] self-improvement  it's  about  an  hour  long 
 you  can  watch  it  kind  of  like  a  Netflix 
 episode  and  it's  got  actionable  steps  so
[01:25] watch  that  video  when  you're  ready  to 
 take  some  action  life  lesson  number  two 
 be  independent  having  the  support  of
[01:30] your  parents  and  your  friends  is  amazing 
 but  this  is  the  time  to  really  start  to 
 try  and  make  some  decisions  for  yourself
[01:35] and  be  okay  with  failure  so  that  can  be 
 habit  number  three  be  okay  with  failure 
 be  okay  with  failure  and  making  mistakes
[01:42] make  some  decisions  for  yourself  like 
 what  you  want  to  eat  what  you  want  to  do 
 what  you  want  to  choose  for  your  your 
 gcses  or  your  a  levels  and  if  it's  a
[01:49] mistake  or  a  failure  that's  okay  at  this 
 age  you  need  to  have  this  lesson  that 
 it's  okay  to  mess  up  in  fact  every  great
[01:55] person  that  you  see  before  you  every 
 successful  person  every  strong  man  every 
 rich  guy  they've  made  countless  of
[02:01] mistakes  they've  had  countless  of 
 failures  I  have  a  video  on  my  channel 
 titled  I  am  a  failure  and  you  might  be
[02:07] interested  in  that  number  four  think 
 about  your  future  it's  normal  right  now 
 to  live  in  the  moment  you  know  that
[02:12] phrase  YOLO  you  only  live  once  that's 
 what  a  lot  of  people  your  age  use  as  an 
 excuse  to  just  maximize  the  pleasure
[02:18] that  they  get  today  so  you  know  oh  you 
 only  live  one  so  let's  take  drugs  let's 
 keep  playing  video  games  let's  eat  junk 
 food  YOLO  YOLO  people  do  that  because
[02:24] they  don't  consider  that  they're  still 
 gonna  be  alive  to  experience  the 
 consequences  this  life  lesson  of
[02:29] thinking  about  your  future  is  so 
 important  and  you  right  here  right  now 
 need  to  identify  that  you're  most  likely
[02:34] going  to  keep  living  on  you  you're  going 
 to  be  alive  five  years  from  now  10  years 
 from  now  you  can  be  silly  or  you  are  but 
 what  if  I  get  hit  by  a  butt  just  shut  up
[02:39] bro  come  on  let's  be  serious  you're 
 gonna  be  alive  for  a  long  time  like  what 
 age  do  you  actually  want  to  live  to 
 maybe  you've  never  even  asked  this
[02:45] question  to  yourself  before  and  you  know 
 in  your  mind  you're  just  thinking  oh 
 like  a  79  because  that's  the  average  age 
 that  you  know  a  man  lives  I  don't  know
[02:51] [ __ ]  the  average  what  age  do  you  want  to 
 live  to  100  let's  say  100  right  well 
 you've  identified  you're  going  to  be 
 alive  for  that  amount  of  time  and  so
[02:57] you've  got  to  make  sure  that  you  set 
 your  life  up  in  a  way  that  you're  still 
 having  a  good  life  because  if  you  plan 
 to  live  a  long  life  then  surely  you'll
[03:02] want  to  still  be  fit  and  healthy  and 
 Wealthy  when  you're  50  maybe  even  when 
 you're  60  you  still  want  to  be  able  to
[03:07] like  run  around  and  go  to  the  gym  most 
 people  don't  consider  this  they  don't 
 think  about  their  future  they  don't 
 think  about  the  consequences  of  their
[03:13] actions  and  so  they  do  things  that  gives 
 them  the  most  amount  of  like  pleasure 
 and  fun  and  happiness  today  which  is
[03:18] usually  just  indulging  in  things  that 
 actually  make  your  life  in  the  future 
 worse  most  people  over  indulge  in
[03:23] instant  gratification  so  they'll  spend  a 
 day  just  playing  video  games  eating  junk 
 food  taking  drugs  and  they  don't  realize
[03:28] that  that's  gonna  make  their  future 
 worse  if  this  is  you  right  here  right 
 narrow  start  to  think  about  your  future
[03:33] self  as  like  a  separate  identity  started 
 literally  start  to  like  create  this 
 image  of  your  future  self  this  guy  who
[03:39] is  you  in  the  future  see  him  in  your 
 mind  and  you  want  the  secret  to  a  good 
 life  do  whatever  it  takes  to  make  him
[03:44] grateful  for  you  when  you  look  back  to 
 your  younger  self  maybe  you  have  some
[03:49] level  of  like  self-hate  because  that 
 little  [ __ ]  didn't  study  when  he  was 
 supposed  to  he  ate  the  junk  food  he  took
[03:55] the  drugs  he  wasted  time  and  sure  you 
 know  he  was  young  and  stuff  but  like  you 
 do  have  this  level  of  like  negativity 
 towards  your  younger  self  and  that's  no
[04:01] way  to  live  that's  how  most  people  live 
 but  as  you  get  onto  self-improvement  you 
 know  you  follow  the  first  life  lesson
[04:06] that  we  talked  about  and  you  start  to  do 
 things  for  your  future  self  and  you 
 stick  to  this  as  best  as  you  can  for 
 months  or  years  eventually  you  become
[04:12] that  future  version  of  yourself  and  you 
 can't  help  but  just  look  back  to  you 
 today  and  feel  grateful  for  you  because
[04:18] you  know  for  me  it  wasn't  me  who  built 
 this  YouTube  channel  with  a  million 
 subscribers  it  wasn't  me  who  built  this
[04:24] Physique  in  the  gym  it  was  my  younger 
 self  so  when  I  think  back  about  like 
 younger  me  and  you  know  when  I  think
[04:29] about  myself  I  feel  happy  because  I  I 
 took  the  right  decisions  even  though 
 they  were  painful  at  the  time  you  know  I
[04:34] had  to  do  all  these  like  hard  work  tasks 
 and  I  had  to  go  to  the  gym  and  I  didn't 
 feel  like  it  I  did  those  hard  things  so
[04:39] that  I  today  could  enjoy  the  rewards  of 
 them  and  so  I  love  myself  I'm  so  happy 
 that  younger  me  set  me  up  for  success
[04:45] but  what  if  I  spent  the  last  two  years 
 smoking  weed  what  if  I  never  thought 
 about  my  future  well  me  today  I'd  be
[04:50] Looking  Back  thinking  come  on  man  you 
 stole  my  success  my  happiness  for  your 
 own  Indulgence  and  pleasure  and  that's
[04:55] no  way  to  live  make  sure  you  think  about 
 your  future  number  five  be  immune  to 
 negative  peer  pressure  peer  pressure  is
[05:02] when  your  friends  or  the  people  around 
 you  maybe  your  family  maybe  Society 
 maybe  the  media  maybe  YouTubers  convince
[05:08] you  to  do  something  that  probably  isn't 
 good  for  you  so  this  is  why  I've  called 
 it  negative  peer  pressure  because  some 
 peer  pressure  could  be  a  good  thing  if
[05:14] you're  all  friends  with  a  bunch  of  Rich 
 guys  and  they're  like  come  on  man  make 
 your  own  business  that's  that's  positive 
 peer  pressure  and  we  want  that  in  our
[05:19] lives  but  usually  peer  pressure  is 
 usually  quite  negative  it's  from  like 
 the  generate  friends  who  are  telling  you 
 like  oh  come  on  bro  one  more  game  bro
[05:24] don't  log  off  of  Discord  just  yet  bro 
 one  more  game  or  if  you're  a  little  bit 
 older  and  you're  taking  drugs  it's  all 
 going  bro  just  have  a  smoke  bro  just
[05:30] just  have  a  smoke  a  lot  of  young  guys 
 fall  victim  to  peer  pressure  why  because 
 we're  lonely  as  [ __ ]  and  the  thing  is  as
[05:36] humans  we  are  tribe  creatures  like  we 
 are  like  supposed  to  be  in  a  try  we're 
 supposed  to  be  around  other  people  and
[05:42] so  when  we're  so  lonely  and  we  see  the 
 way  to  actually  have  a  vibrant  social 
 life  it's  to  be  degenerate  with  the
[05:47] degenerates  is  to  be  playing  video  games 
 with  the  video  games  is  to  be  taking 
 drugs  with  the  drug  addicts  like
[05:52] sometimes  we  just  fall  victim  to  this 
 because  we'd  rather  have  this  negative 
 consequence  of  you  know  taking  drugs
[05:57] than  just  being  lonely  like  loneliness 
 is  one  of  the  worst  things  that  can 
 happen  but  sometimes  it  can  be  better  to
[06:03] be  alone  honestly  it's  pretty  much 
 always  better  to  be  alone  than  it  is  to 
 be  surrounded  by  bad  people  who  don't
[06:09] even  like  you  who  don't  even  want  the 
 best  for  you  make  sure  you  stay  immune 
 to  the  negative  peer  pressure  that  can
[06:14] come  from  some  you  know  people  from  your 
 friends  your  family  from  even  the  media 
 broke  if  you  go  onto  Tick  Tock  right  now
[06:19] without  anything  if  you  listen  to  songs 
 on  Spotify  you're  experiencing  some 
 level  of  peer  pressure  you're  hearing
[06:24] these  rappers  talk  about  making  money 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  taking  drugs  killing 
 people  and  you  might  think  oh  you  know
[06:29] it  doesn't  do  anything  to  me  the  thing 
 is  it  does  slightly  really  change  what 
 you  desire  if  you  every  day  you  listen
[06:34] to  some  degenerate  content  you  listen  to 
 like  you  know  degenerates  talking  about 
 like  some  female  rappers  they're  [ __ ]
[06:39] making  this  stuff  yeah  [ __ ]  it  [ __ ]  off 
 you  listen  to  her  like  talking  about 
 like  getting  [ __ ]  down  by  her  drug
[06:44] dealer  or  something  like  that  like  it  is 
 Gonna  Change  you  as  a  person  it 
 absolutely  will  like  you  must  have  this
[06:49] humility  to  admit  like  you're  not  some 
 rock  solid  bulletproof  person  who  these
[06:54] outside  influences  can't  change  you  at 
 all  I  will  admit  right  now  like  I've 
 been  on  self-improvement  for  a  while  I'm 
 kind  of  you  know  confident  quite
[06:59] independent  guy  the  outside  world  still 
 influences  me  heavily  so  if  you're  quite 
 a  young  impressionable  teenager  you
[07:04] should  just  take  some  moments  the  next 
 time  you're  about  to  consume  some  kind 
 of  content  or  the  next  time  you're  about
[07:09] to  speak  to  someone  and  just  ask 
 yourself  what  is  your  life  going  to  be 
 like  if  you  become  just  like  this  person 
 if  you've  got  a  friend  who  smokes  weed
[07:15] all  the  time  and  you  know  you  always 
 smoke  with  them  like  you're  gonna  become 
 like  that  friend  he's  probably  getting 
 bad  grades  he's  probably  going  to  be 
 broke  all  of  his  life  you  don't  want  to
[07:21] be  like  that  if  you're  watching  contents 
 from  inspiring  strong  masculine  men 
 Honestly  by  following  it  you're  probably
[07:27] gonna  become  more  like  that  if  you 
 follow  Andrew  Tate  and  he's  saying  yeah 
 get  into  this  gym  men  do  push-ups  and
[07:32] make  money  you're  probably  going  to 
 become  a  little  bit  more  like  Tate  every 
 time  if  you  watch  my  videos  and  I  tell 
 you  about  mental  health  and 
 self-improvement  you're  probably  going
[07:37] to  become  a  little  bit  more  like  me  if 
 you  listen  to  [ __ ]  little  Naz 
 twerking  on  the  devil  if  you  watch  like
[07:42] this  degenerate  content  then  you're 
 probably  going  to  become  more  like  that 
 and  leading  on  from  that  life  lesson 
 number  six  is  to  not  change  your
[07:48] principles  to  fit  in  you  have  inside  of 
 you  some  core  values  and  principles  most 
 likely  that  your  parents  put  inside  of
[07:53] you  or  maybe  your  religion  or  anyone  who 
 is  quite  important  to  you  and  sometimes 
 you  can  become  very  aware  that  you've
[07:58] started  to  sacrifice  your  principles  and 
 your  values  to  try  and  fit  in  around 
 those  people  maybe  you  know  there's  an
[08:03] element  of  peer  pressure  there  it'd  be 
 so  worth  your  time  right  here  right  now 
 to  just  pause  the  video  and  just  ask
[08:08] yourself  what  do  you  value  what  are  your 
 principles  do  you  really  value  honestly 
 well  if  you  respect  yourself  then  you
[08:14] can't  be  friends  with  Liars  do  you 
 really  value  discipline  well  then  if  you 
 respect  yourself  you  can't  be  friends
[08:19] with  someone  who  isn't  disciplined  or  at 
 least  trying  to  become  disciplined  you 
 know  being  friends  with  someone  who's 
 not  very  disciplined  but  it's  trying  it
[08:25] fair  enough  but  being  friends  with 
 someone  who  doesn't  even  care  about 
 discipline  he  just  wants  to  play  video 
 games  and  eat  junk  food  is  you  two  don't
[08:30] match  if  there  few  minutes  of  this  video 
 is  really  relevant  to  you  and  you  know 
 you're  thinking  about  some  particular 
 friends  right  now  I  have  a  video  on  my
[08:36] second  Channel  called  they're  not  your 
 friends  and  you  might  be  interested  in 
 that  if  you  just  search  Hamza  they're
[08:41] not  your  friends  on  YouTube  you'll  be 
 able  to  see  it  number  seven  earn  respect 
 there's  a  few  ways  to  earn  respect  and
[08:46] they're  very  practical  the  fastest  way 
 to  earn  the  respect  of  someone  instantly 
 literally  the  moment  that  they  look  at
[08:52] you  is  to  literally  just  be  bigger  be 
 physically  bigger  as  a  man  like  the 
 bigger  you  are  as  a  man  in  terms  of
[08:57] muscle  will  get  you  the  respect  of  other 
 guys  now  you  don't  need  to  be  some  like 
 big  steroid  beat  head  or  something  but 
 if  you're  pretty  skinny  right  now  or
[09:02] you're  skinny  fat  or  you're  just  fat  the 
 thing  is  when  someone  instantly  looks  at 
 you  their  respect  for  you  is  not  going
[09:07] to  be  high  honestly  I'm  just  going  to 
 say  this  right  now  I'm  gonna  tell  you  my 
 at  least  truth  and  maybe  this  is 
 relevant  for  other  people  if  I  see  some
[09:12] skinny  guys  like  I  don't  I  don't  respect 
 them  straight  away  if  I  see  some  fat  guy 
 I  don't  respect  him  if  I  see  some  guy 
 who's  in  shape  there's  an  instant  level
[09:18] of  respect  and  like  this  sort  of  like 
 almost  like  a  level  of  admiration 
 Ramirez  fair  enough  he's  put  in  some
[09:23] work  if  you  want  that  kind  of  effect 
 from  people  as  soon  as  they  look  at  you 
 they  literally  just  respect  you  and  even 
 girls  as  well  you  need  to  just  go  to  the
[09:29] gym  start  doing  some  resist  distance 
 training  which  essentially  means  like 
 body  weight  exercises  weight  lifting  or
[09:34] calisthenics  you're  the  kind  of  things 
 that  you  do  like  for  Reps  for  sets  and 
 you  use  weight  or  something  those  are
[09:39] the  things  that  will  build  muscle  and 
 when  you  build  muscle  you  get  so  much 
 more  respect  it's  the  single  greatest 
 thing  you  can  do  I  have  like  three
[09:44] workout  routines  that  you  can  find  in 
 the  description  as  well  after  that  you 
 can  continue  to  Skyrocket  how  much
[09:49] respect  you're  getting  from  people  by 
 the  work  that  you  do  and  the  success 
 that  you've  built  up  you  see  life  is  a 
 masculine  man  is  all  about  just  work  in
[09:55] the  modern  day  there's  a  lot  of  feminine 
 men  out  there  who  are  trying  to  escape 
 work  and  you  know  that  you  don't  like 
 working  you  just  want  to  play  you  just
[10:01] want  to  like  you  know  just  chill  and  be 
 lazy  that's  a  trait  of  feminine  men  who 
 try  and  like  you  know  avoid  work  a
[10:06] masculine  man  craves  work  it's  just  fun 
 as  [ __ ]  it's  the  only  thing  that  you 
 really  want  to  spend  your  time  doing  and 
 so  other  masculine  men  judge  each  other
[10:11] on  the  work  that  the  person  does  and  the 
 amount  of  success  that  they've  built  up 
 so  if  you  do  want  to  get  the  respect  of 
 masculine  men  work  and  build  something
[10:17] successful  number  eight  give  respect  now 
 if  you  want  the  respect  of  other  people 
 well  we  all  do  if  you're  the  person  who
[10:23] gives  respect  to  other  people  and  not 
 you  know  not  in  a  fake  way  don't  just 
 respect  someone  for  no  reason  but  if 
 you're  open  with  how  much  you  admire  and
[10:30] respect  someone  and  you  told  them  I 
 respect  you  for  that  wow  you've  got  such 
 a  nice  physique  yeah  respect  man  I've 
 got  a  lot  of  respect  for  that  discipline
[10:36] well  everyone  wants  respect  so  you're 
 giving  people  what  they  want  this  is  a 
 fundamental  principle  of  social  skills
[10:41] so  if  you  want  to  be  more  socially 
 connected  with  other  people  give  them 
 what  they  want  they  want  some  praise
[10:46] they  want  acknowledgment  for  the  things 
 that  they've  worked  hard  on  especially 
 men  especially  masculine  men  masculine 
 men  are  quite  independent  and  you  know
[10:52] they  just  work  on  their  own  things 
 anyway  so  they  don't  need  this  but  if 
 you  do  compliment  a  masculine  man  for
[10:57] the  work  and  the  success  that  he's  built 
 trust  me  I  want  to  say  like  he  will 
 appreciate  it  heavily  and  he  will 
 remember  you  don't  do  this  in  a  way  to
[11:02] kiss  us  like  I'll  do  this  and  hopefully 
 they'll  like  me  but  just  do  it  because 
 you  actually  really  do  respect  the  guy
[11:07] so  make  sure  you  don't  do  this  in  a  fake 
 way  where  you  know  there's  someone  that 
 you  don't  even  like  you  don't  even 
 respect  but  you're  just  like  practicing
[11:12] this  anyway  literally  go  and  find  the 
 guys  that  you  look  up  to  go  and  find  the 
 guys  that  you  respect  maybe  it's  Andrew 
 say  maybe  to  Me  Maybe  it's  like  some
[11:18] other  role  model  that  you  know  and 
 literally  just  comment  message  them 
 email  them  and  just  tell  them  like  yeah 
 like  I  respect  the  work  that  you've  done
[11:23] and  you  know  I've  watched  you  for  a 
 while  like  when  you  say  these  things  the 
 guy  at  the  top  who  seems  like  this  big 
 guy  like  bro  he  crumbles  and  he's  like
[11:28] suddenly  he  just  seems  like  a  human 
 figure  when  you're  speaking  to  him  like 
 you're  a  man  and  it's  a  nice
[11:33] transformation  for  you  to  go  through  as 
 well  because  your  identity  changes  when 
 you're  the  guy  telling  someone  like 
 Andrew  T  like  yeah  like  you  I  really
[11:38] respect  you  suddenly  you're  not  like 
 some  like  little  follower  fan  or 
 anything  like  he's  gonna  look  at  you 
 like  you're  a  man  number  nine  don't  be
[11:44] afraid  of  outgrowing  your  friends  so 
 this  is  somewhat  similar  to  the  elements 
 of  peer  pressure  that  we  covered  but
[11:50] this  is  something  that  a  lot  of  young 
 guys  who  are  consuming  this  kind  of 
 content  go  through  there's  an  issue  with
[11:55] the  friends  that  you  have  when  you're 
 young  you  know  can  you  guess  what  it  is 
 there  is  one  huge  issue  that  it's  so 
 obvious  it  seems  like  you  and  your
[12:01] friends  became  friends  because  of  the 
 people  you  are  and  you  know  you  like 
 each  other  you  didn't  actually  honestly
[12:06] the  biggest  reason  why  you  become 
 friends  when  you're  young  with  someone 
 else  is  literally  just  because  you  go  to
[12:11] the  same  school  together  it's  as  simple 
 as  that  you  literally  just  become 
 friends  with  people  that  you  have  to  sit 
 next  to  it's  just  like  how  co-workers
[12:17] are  friends  it's  like  yeah  yeah  like  if 
 you  don't  hang  out  outside  of  school 
 like  significantly  then  they're  not  even
[12:22] friends  to  begin  with  just  the  same  as 
 their  co-workers  if  they  don't  hang  out 
 outside  of  work  then  they're  not  friends 
 to  begin  with  but  let's  say  that  there
[12:27] is  a  good  group  of  friends  that  you  have 
 right  now  and  you've  already  started  to 
 feel  this  this  concept  of  like  yeah 
 you're  almost  outgrowing  them  they're
[12:33] still  acting  like  little  [ __ ]  boys 
 playing  video  games  eating  junk  food 
 like  children  and  you  actually  want  to 
 start  looking  into  like  business  and
[12:39] being  productive  and  your  friends  find 
 that  like  gay  for  some  reason  they're 
 just  called  it  gay  or  they  call  it  weird 
 like  oh  why  are  you trying  so  hard  or
[12:44] something  it's  okay  to  abandon  people 
 like  I  know  that  sounds  like  really  sad 
 and  stuff  but  honestly  like  a  lot  of
[12:50] successful  people  have  done  this  as  you 
 improve  and  people  in  your  life  just 
 stay  the  same  it's  like  you're  no  longer 
 relatable  and  so  when  you  do  respect
[12:57] yourself  enough  to  not  waste  time  with 
 people  that  you  don't  even  enjoy  being 
 around  anymore  you  take  a  big  step  back 
 from  it  now  you  don't  have  to  do  this  in
[13:03] some  cringe  way  where  you  message  them 
 the  last  message  oh  goodbye  everyone  but 
 just  slowly  just  distance  yourself  you
[13:08] know  the  the  group  chat's  popping  right 
 now  on  Discord  or  Whatsapp  or  whatever 
 or  SnapChat  don't  open  it  you  know  oh
[13:13] you're  gonna  come  online  today  bro  don't 
 reply  see  them  in  school  or  Whatever 
 Whenever  you  usually  see  them  and  you 
 know  just  be  kind  of  nice  to  them  but
[13:19] just  focus  on  your  work  on  your  studies 
 whatever  and  slowly  and  surely  they'll 
 just  kind  of  like  move  on  without  you 
 and  you'll  realize  that  honestly  you
[13:24] were  never  that  close  anyway  like  they 
 just  moved  on  from  like  easily  half  the 
 guys  in  your  friendship  group  don't  even
[13:29] care  about  you  at  least  one  of  the guys 
 in  the  that  actively  dislikes  you  and 
 there's  usually  just  one  friend  who
[13:34] likes  you  but  who  might  be  like  just  not 
 on  your  level  anymore  and  he's  usually 
 the  one  I  really  recommend  trying  to
[13:39] bring  on  to  self-improvement  so  you 
 probably  have  one  guy  who's  actually 
 like  really  [ __ ]  nice  and  like  you 
 know  you  actually  get  along  with  each
[13:44] other  there's  no  like  ill  feelings 
 there's  no  time  where  he's  like  made  fun 
 of  you  or  anything  that's  usually  the 
 guy  that  I  recommend  like  yeah  like
[13:49] broke  any  amounts  of  self-improvement 
 send  him  some  of  these  videos  tell  him 
 to  stop  meditating  tell  them  stop 
 getting  into  the  gym  he  might  do
[13:54] oftentimes  what  really  happens  is  like 
 the  guy  who's  listening  to  this  tries  to 
 get  his  friend  onto  self-improvements
[13:59] being  productive  and  then  his  friend 
 just  doesn't  and  then  their  relationship 
 diffuses  anyway  I've  honestly  never  met
[14:04] really  anyone  who's  successfully  been 
 able  to  like  get  their  friends  onto 
 self-improvements  because  I  think  it's  a
[14:09] very  individual  solo  Journey  you  really 
 have  to  desire  this  by  yourself  life 
 lesson  number  10  show  gratitude  and
[14:16] especially  to  your  parents  a  lot  of 
 young  guys  don't  actually  do  this  like 
 this  is  the  age  when  you  really  start  to
[14:21] want  to  take  a  big  step  away  from  your 
 parents  control  and  you  want  to  be  your 
 own  man  and  you  know  at  the  start  of 
 this  this  video  I  did  tell  you  yeah  be
[14:27] independent  but  with  being  Independence 
 you  can  still  be  very  grateful  for  your 
 parents  especially  I  only  ever  showed
[14:33] gratitude  to  my  parents  when  I  was 
 around  23  years  old  and  through  all  My 
 Teenage  life  I  was  so  convinced  they
[14:38] were  bad  people  I  hated  them  because  you 
 know  they'd  shout  at  me  and  they  were 
 controlling  and  you  know  sometimes  like
[14:43] there  was  abusive  stuff  going  on  and  so 
 I  only  ever  saw  my  parents  negatively  it
[14:48] was  only  years  later  where  I  actually 
 began  to  like  relate  to  them  you  know  I 
 started  working  full  time  and  when  I
[14:53] worked  like  a  shitty  full-time  job  I 
 literally  just  looked  at  my  father  in  a 
 different  way  and  I  just  thought  like 
 holy  [ __ ]  this  man  has  devoted  his  life
[14:59] to  us  like  I  needed  to  to  work  full  time 
 first  to  be  able  to  relate  to  my  father
[15:04] who  was  working  full-time  to  provide  for 
 the  family  for  like  you  know  20  years 
 working  two  jobs  and  suddenly  I  started
[15:09] to  realize  like  wait  he  has  to 
 absolutely  love  us  if  he's  worked  like 
 that  to  provide  for  us  that's  when  I
[15:15] became  grateful  I'm  glad  that  I  became 
 grateful  for  them  at  this  moments  and  we 
 were  able  to  improve  our  relationship
[15:20] but  some  part  of  me  does  wish  like  what 
 if  I  just  was  grateful  10  years  earlier 
 imagine  how  different  our  relationship
[15:25] would  have  been  so  this  is  a  message  to 
 you  right  now  no  matter  how  you  feel 
 about  your  parents  I  guarantee  these
[15:30] things  that  you  can  be  grateful  for  and 
 especially  right  now  if  you  are  so 
 certain  that  there's  nothing  to  be 
 grateful  for  I  really  really  urge  you  to
[15:36] just  sit  down  and  spend  half  an  hour  on 
 this  if  you  can  just  like  trust  what  I'd 
 say  and  just  blindly  try  it  this  will
[15:41] literally  change  your  life  forever  sit 
 down  with  a  document  open  on  your  PC  or 
 your  notepad  on  your  phone  and  just  ask
[15:46] what  could  I  be  grateful  for  my  parents 
 and  the  first  few  answers  will  literally 
 take  a  while  and  you'll  be  so  pissed  off
[15:51] thinking  yeah  and  you'll  write  some  like 
 condescending  sarcastic  [ __ ]  or 
 something  oh  yeah  I'm  grateful  that  they 
 abused  me  like  if  you  really  dedicate
[15:57] yourself  to  this  and  really  try  and  do 
 it  seriously  your  life  will  never  be  the 
 same  afterwards  because  I  did  it  and  you 
 know  I  I  was  joking  around  I'm  glad  my
[16:04] dad  slapped  me  like  he  was  such  a  bad 
 person  like  I  mentioned  I  started 
 writing  some  good  things  and  then  I 
 started  writing  like  I'm  grateful  that
[16:09] my  father  worked  60  to  80  hours  a  week 
 every  single  week  for  as  long  as  I  can
[16:14] remember  when  I'd  wake  up  early  to  go  to 
 school  he  was  already  out  working  I'd 
 come  back  home  he'd  still  be  at  work
[16:19] he'd  come  home  from  work  when  it  was 
 dark  at  like  6  p.m  7  P.M  stay  up  for 
 like  one  hour  two  hours  then  go  to  bed
[16:24] and  do  it  again  why  to  provide  for  his 
 family  I  was  certain  there  was  nothing 
 to  be  grateful  for  took  me  20  minutes  to
[16:30] come  with  that  and  then  I  realized  oh  he 
 loved  me  all  this  time  life  lesson 
 number  11  take  responsibility  and
[16:37] ownership  of  everything  that  happens 
 it's  very  easy  for  you  right  now  since 
 you  are  quite  young  to  not  take
[16:42] ownership  of  certain  things  so  if 
 there's  a  problem  that  happens  if 
 there's  an  accident  if  you  know 
 something  messes  up  it's  very  easy  for
[16:47] you  right  now  to  just  kind  of  you  know 
 push  off  the  blame  a  little  bit  to 
 someone  else  and  to  say  oh  you  know  it's
[16:52] um it's  the  school's  faults  that  I've 
 been  getting  bad  grades  oh  you  know  it's 
 my  parents  fault  that  I'm  fat  oh  you 
 know  it's  my  parents  my  mom's  fault  that
[16:58] I'm  not  muscular  because  she  won't  let 
 me  get  protein  powder  so  easy  for  you  to 
 blame  someone  else  but  the  teenagers  who
[17:03] go  on  to  become  strong  successful  Men 
 start  to  take  ownership  of  everything 
 and  this  might  piss  you  off  a  little  bit
[17:08] because  you  might  be  sat  here  right  now 
 saying  but  no  no  but  it  really  is 
 someone  else's  faults  and  the  thing  is
[17:13] objectively  by  the  the  objective  truths 
 of  the  universe  it  might  be  someone 
 else's  fault  but  you  don't  gain  anything
[17:18] from  saying  that  you  see  you  gain  the 
 most  when  you  take  total  ownership 
 control  and  responsibility  of  every
[17:25] situation  in  your  life  so  why  not  try 
 that  next  time  something  like  [ __ ] 
 happens  next  time  you  get  bad  grades  or 
 the  next  time  shutters  or  whatever  it  is
[17:32] blame  it  on  yourself  in  a  mature  way  I'm 
 responsible  for  that  and  I'm  gonna  try 
 my  best  not  to  let  that  happen  again
[17:37] lesson  number  12  have  some  humility  now 
 humility  is  the  skill  of  disobeying  your
[17:43] ego  your  ego  is  this  thing  inside  of  you 
 that  thinks  you're  so  amazing  everyone 
 else  is  is  really  bad  you're  better  than
[17:49] everyone  else  and  that  you  don't  really 
 need  to  learn  anything  else  like  you're 
 already  so  great  ego  is  what  leads  a  lot
[17:55] of  people  to  initial  success  you  know 
 because  they  believe  yeah  I'm  so  great 
 and  so  they  end  up  making  some  progress
[18:00] but  then  they  actually  get  complacent 
 and  they  fail  after  that  so  this  is  when 
 you  see  someone  who's  gotten  100K
[18:05] subscribers  or  500k  and  then  their 
 Channel  just  dies  or  disappears 
 afterwards  it  was  ego  ego  is  the  thing
[18:10] that  convinces  you  that  you  don't  really 
 need  to  learn  or  develop  anything  in 
 terms  of  becoming  more  successful  right
[18:15] you  probably  don't  even  realize  that  you 
 have  this  massive  ego  that  you  know  oh 
 yes  you're  so  amazing  guess  where  you
[18:20] actually  got  it  from  it's  so  interesting 
 guess  where  you  got  massive  ego  from 
 this  idea  of  like  yeah  you're  so  amazing
[18:25] you  don't  need  to  change  yourself  from 
 the  politically  correct  like  Western 
 Society  you  know  this  sort  of  like 
 society  that  tells  little  boy  boys  and
[18:31] little  girls  yeah  you're  so  amazing 
 here's  a  participation  trophy  you're  so 
 amazing  you're  you're  a  superstar  you 
 don't  need  to  change  anything  about
[18:36] yourself  and  so  these  kids  are  growing 
 up  with  this  weird  self-image  which  is 
 so  heightened  and  eventually  when
[18:41] reality  hits  them  and  they  realize  like 
 yeah  they're  not  that  great  this  is  when 
 depression  occurs  it's  actually  more
[18:46] valuable  for  you  to  think  to  yourself 
 like  yep  I'm  not  that  great  right  now 
 but  I  strive  to  become  it  I'm  not  that
[18:51] advanced  and  my  skills  aren't  that  high 
 right  now  but  I'll  keep  learning  and 
 I'll  keep  improving  so  when  you  develop
[18:56] the  skill  of  humility  that's  when  you 
 start  to  see  these  holes  inside  of  you 
 and  you  start  to  like  just  not  in  a
[19:01] self-deprecating  way  but  almost  in  a 
 level  of  awareness  and  Analysis  you  look 
 at  some  of  your  weaknesses  and  you  think
[19:06] yourself  yeah  I  could  improve  that  part 
 of  me  my  social  skills  aren't  that  great 
 because  if  they  were  I'd  have  more
[19:11] friends  so  I  need  to  improve  my  social 
 skills  I'll  read  some  books  on  that  you 
 know  what  like  I'd  really  like  a
[19:16] girlfriend  but  girls  don't  seem 
 attracted  to  me  for  some  reason  I'll 
 start  researching  what  girls  are 
 actually  attracted  in  and  maybe  I'll
[19:21] start  like  going  to  the  gym  more  and 
 I'll  get  more  like  fit  and  I'll  look 
 better  maybe  I'll  learn  like  how  to 
 actually  date  and  speak  to  girls  better
[19:27] because  I'm  probably  not  that  good  at  it 
 just  yet  with  that  skill  of  humility 
 you'll  actually  go  on  to  make  more
[19:32] progress  life  lesson  number  13  don't 
 Focus  too  much  on  the  past  so  maybe 
 you're  watching  this  and  quite  often  you
[19:38] recap  some  mistakes  that  you  made  in  the 
 past  so  before  I  just  said  you  know 
 successful  men  make  a  lot  of  mistakes
[19:43] and  that's  fine  well  the  thing  is  the 
 successful  man  who's  made  these  mistakes 
 and  failures  he  doesn't  look  back  with
[19:48] this  sense  of  like  depression  and 
 sadness  all  the  time  but  I've  seen  a  lot 
 of  teenagers  do  this  especially  with
[19:53] grades  you  look  back  at  the  past  that 
 you  didn't  really  study  that  well  and 
 then  you  get  some  bad  grades  and  you 
 keep  looking  back  and  you  keep  feeling
[19:58] like  [ __ ]  because  of  it  it  was  nothing 
 to  serve  you  this  is  one  of  the  reasons 
 why  I  really  like  one  of  Andrew  Tate's
[20:03] mindsets  where  he  says  that  there's  no 
 reason  having  beliefs  that  don't  serve 
 you  you  should  only  keep  in  mind  the
[20:08] things  that  actually  help  you  and  if 
 looking  back  to  some  mistake  or  some 
 failure  keeps  making  you  feel  bad  and
[20:14] not  in  any  kind  of  like  encouraging  way 
 there's  no  value  in  doing  that  it's  just 
 like  self-deprecating  it's  literally
[20:19] just  self-harm  at  that  point  try  your 
 best  not  to  look  back  into  the  past  and 
 the  way  you  do  that  is  by  working  as
[20:25] hard  as  you  possibly  can  on  the  presence 
 instead  of  even  spending  five  minutes 
 feeling  depressed  about  something  that
[20:30] happened  been  a  while  ago  like  some  girl 
 broke  up  with  you  or  you  got  rejected  or 
 you  got  bad  grades  go  and  spend  those
[20:35] five  minutes  reading  a  book  and  studying 
 and  working  out  at  least  that's  going  to 
 create  something  different  for  you  and
[20:40] so  leading  on  to  this  number  14  stop 
 worrying  about  the  future  again  a  bunch 
 of  young  students  have  this  where  you
[20:46] know  you're  so  scared  of  this  upcoming 
 exam  and  it's  so  like  there's  so  much 
 pressure  and  the  thing  is  I  don't  even 
 blame  you  I'm  a  very  big  advocate  for
[20:52] talking  about  the  issues  of  the 
 education  system  I  think  it's  a  corrupt 
 silly  stupid  inhumane  system  that  you  go
[20:58] through  and  you  have  to  go  to  school  as 
 a  child  honestly  in  one  of  my  like 
 long-term  goals  has  been  to  like  reform
[21:03] the  education  system  because  I  just  I 
 think  it's  [ __ ]  the  school  system 
 honestly  the  fact  that  you  go  through  so
[21:08] much  pressure  and  so  much  stress  at  such 
 a  young  age  to  prepare  for  these  like 
 [ __ ]  one  day  you  know  like  just  one
[21:13] specific  exam  that  you've  got  to 
 remember  all  this  [ __ ]  for  then  you've 
 just  got  to  forget  everything  you  just 
 learned  to  remember  something  for  the
[21:19] next  exam  it's  so  like  the  systems  are 
 stupid  but  either  way  worrying  about  the 
 future  is  not  going  to  help  you  now  the
[21:24] system  is  stupid  and  you  know  leave  it 
 to  me  I'll  try  and  change  it  for  you  but 
 right  here  right  now  you  worrying  about
[21:29] the  future  is  not  gonna  say  of  you  in 
 any  positive  way  you  should  prepare  for 
 the  future  you  know  you've  got  some
[21:34] upcoming  exams  so  study  today  you  want 
 to  get  a  girlfriend  later  on  in  the 
 future  when  you've  got  more  free  time
[21:39] we'll  start  to  go  to  the  gym  right  now 
 and  you  know  get  more  in  shape  and  you 
 know  build  some  muscle  cut  down  some
[21:44] body  fat  look  good  smell  good  prepare 
 for  the  future  but  worrying  for  it  well 
 there's  no  value  in  that  is  there
[21:49] there's  no  benefit  to  yourself  and  I  get 
 it  because  I'm  quite  a  warrior  myself  I 
 have  a  tendency  to  feel  quite  anxious  at
[21:55] things  that  could  happen  and  I  worry 
 about  you  know  situations  not  happening 
 in  my  favor  so  I  get  it  like  it  just
[22:00] happens  automatically  doesn't  it  you 
 don't  actually  sit  there  thinking  oh 
 yeah  I'm  gonna  go  panic  about  the  future 
 right  now  it  just  you  know  pops  into
[22:05] your  mind  the  way  to  control  your  mind 
 you  know  I've  told  you  a  lot  about  stop 
 worrying  about  the  future  or  the  past  or
[22:11] you  know  like  a  lot  of  like  mindset 
 things  the  way  to  change  your  mind  and 
 how  it  thinks  is  to  just  forcefully
[22:16] manually  think  the  thoughts  that  you 
 want  so  maybe  your  mind  is  automatically 
 you  know  regurgitating  the  thoughts
[22:22] about  the  upcoming  exam  and  you're 
 feeling  anxious  again  just  manually  say 
 the  words  in  your  brain  like  I'm  gonna
[22:27] prepare  for  it  I'm  not  gonna  waste  any 
 time  just  worrying  right  now  I'm  gonna 
 go  and  study  right  now  for  an  extra  10 
 minutes  today  that's  going  to  make  a
[22:32] difference  life  lesson  15  be  present 
 presence  is  when  you're  totally  focused
[22:37] in  the  Here  and  Now  rather  than  in  your 
 mind  somewhere  else  so  oftentimes  you 
 can  just  find  yourself  deep  in  thought
[22:42] about  something  instead  of  actually  just 
 experiencing  real  life  as  we  are  today 
 maybe  you've  been  watching  this  video
[22:47] and  you've  barely  even  been  hearing  my 
 words  because  in  your  own  brain  is  like
[22:52] irrelevant  thoughts  sometimes  it  can  be 
 so  hard  to  catch  yourself  when  you're  so 
 deep  in  thought  and  only  when  you  do
[22:57] catch  yourself  you'll  realize  like  [ __ ] 
 like  I  haven't  been  present  for  the  last 
 like  10  minutes  I've  just  been  AFK  you
[23:02] know  the  phrase  AFK  away  from  keyboard 
 most  people  are  AFK  and  there's  no  way 
 to  live  like  you'll  probably  see  this  in 
 some  of  your  friends  who  are  really
[23:07] addicted  to  video  games  and  social  media 
 and  you'll  see  this  in  a  lot  of  girls  as 
 well  who  are  addicted  to  tick  tock
[23:12] they're  literally  just  AFK  as  you  speak 
 to  them  like  their  attention  spans  all 
 [ __ ]  like  that  you  see  their  eyes  like 
 fully  in  away  from  them  and  everything
[23:17] the  cure  to  this  and  honestly  the  cure 
 to  a  lot  of  problems  is  meditation  I
[23:22] have  a  10  minute  follow  along  meditation 
 it's  easy  as  hell  to  do  literally  10 
 minutes  and  I'll  have  like  a  card  pop-up 
 and  you  can  follow  with  that  number  16
[23:28] learn  from  the  mistakes  of  others  men 
 learn  from  their  mistakes  but  a  wise  man
[23:33] learns  from  the  mistakes  of  others  so  if 
 you  want  to  be  this  wise  man  seek  out 
 the  advice  and  the  mentorship  of  men  who
[23:39] have  probably  experienced  the  path  that 
 you  want  to  go  down  and  there's  no 
 better  time  in  history  to  have  this 
 desire  you  can  literally  go  onto  YouTube
[23:45] and  find  someone  who's  already  achieved 
 the  life  that  you  want  and  chances  are 
 he's  already  got  a  podcast  where  he's
[23:50] speaking  for  like  50  hours  just  talking 
 about  his  life  and  the  problems  that  he 
 went  through  and  the  mindset  that  caused
[23:55] him  to  be  successful  it's  such  an 
 amazing  time  this  is  why  like  podcasts 
 and  books  and  YouTube  videos  are  so
[24:00] valuable  because  you  can  literally  just 
 find  the  kind  of  mind  that  you  want  to 
 be  like  and  just  learn  directly  from  him 
 and  so  the  mistakes  that  he  talks  about
[24:05] you  can  just  try  and  avoid  and  save 
 yourself  some  time  on  the  journey  so  if 
 you  see  on  my  YouTube  channel  we  have
[24:10] like  700  videos  and  at  the  start  of 
 every  single  video  after  the  Jeffrey  and 
 Adonis  intro  I  tell  you  my  mistake
[24:16] that's  relevant  to  the  video  title  so 
 maybe  it's  a  video  about  obsession  over 
 a  girl  too  much  well  in  that  video  I'll
[24:21] tell  you  about  the  exact  story  where  I 
 obsessed  over  a  girl  too  much  and  why  it 
 was  a  mistake  because  probably  chances 
 are  she  didn't  like  me  back  and  I  just
[24:26] wasted  time  and  then  I  try  and  convince 
 you  to  not  make  the  same  mistake  as  me 
 that  means  that  I  wasted  months  of  my
[24:32] time  you  know  being  obsessed  with  some 
 girl  who  didn't  like  me  and  by  you  just 
 watching  a  10  minute  video  you  could 
 probably  save  those  months  of  pain
[24:37] yourself  I  think  that  concept  of 
 learning  from  another  man  that's  like 
 such  an  incredible  thing  that  we  can  do
[24:42] with  the  internet  because  before  this 
 the  only  kind  of  life  lessons  you  could 
 get  was  from  the  village  Elders  in  our
[24:47] tribe  and  now  you  can  get  the  life 
 lessons  as  we're  covering  in  this  video 
 from  a  guy  who  might  be  across  the  globe
[24:52] from  you  number  17  stand  up  straight 
 with  your  shoulders  back  this  is  a 
 chapter  from  Jordan  Peterson's  Book  12
[24:58] rules  for  life  and  I  really  like  it  and 
 it  goes  way  deeper  than  just  body 
 language  and  posture  and  the  short
[25:03] version  is  that  the  better  your  body 
 language  the  happier  you're  gonna  be  the 
 more  dopamine  you're  gonna  produce  the 
 more  serotonin  you're  going  to  produce
[25:09] and  even  the  more  testosterone  you're 
 going  to  produce  a  lot  of  guys  with  like 
 [ __ ]  up  for  sure  literally  showing
[25:14] that  they  are  like  a  weak  man  and  when 
 you  show  that  to  the  world  the  world 
 responds  to  you  as  if  you  know  you're 
 some  weak  fragile  man  who's  got  like
[25:20] [ __ ]  up posture  and  when  the  world 
 responds  to  you  like  you're  a  weak  man 
 well  then  the  inside  of  you  literally 
 changes  to  that  like  if  everyone  treats
[25:26] you  like  a  beta  male  little  [ __ ]  the 
 testosterone  is  going  to  go  down  so  when 
 you  walk  into  a  new  place  or  just  24  7.
[25:31] keep  your  posture  as  good  as  you  can 
 naturally  make  it  number  18  talk  loudly 
 and  confidently  now  you  don't  need  to
[25:37] overdo  this  and  start  shouting  at  people 
 you're  not  trying  to  like  fake  a  deep 
 voice  like  this  or  anything  don't  be 
 stupid  with  it  but  there's  a  lot  of
[25:42] young  guys  who  talk  very  timidly  like 
 they'll  be  speaking  like  this  they'll  be 
 hiding  their  breath  away  oh  yeah  yeah 
 yeah  you  know  there's  a  lot  of  like  us
[25:48] like  those  phrases  which  just  reeks  of 
 like  a  lack  of  confidence  as  a  young  man
[25:53] this  is  the  time  now  to  start  developing 
 your  speech  and  your  personality  to  be 
 this  guy  who  speaks  like  I  am  today  like
[25:58] I'm  not  you  know  overly  doing  it  I'm  not 
 purposely  trying  to  you  know  act 
 confident  or  anything  now  sure  I'm
[26:03] speaking  a  little  bit  more  louder  than  I 
 normally  would  just  you  know  because 
 we're  recording  a  video  and  everything 
 but  if  you  can  speak  like  this  you'll  be
[26:08] able  to  convey  your  message  across  and 
 people  will  actually  be  able  to  listen 
 to  you  and  they'll  have  fun  listening  to
[26:13] you  no  one  likes  listening  to  a  guy  who 
 speaks  like  a  little  [ __ ]  and  I  don't 
 say  this  to  be  offensive  but  you  know  a 
 lot  of  guys  speak  so  timidly  like  they
[26:19] have  no  balls  and  they  just  speak  like 
 you  know  with  fleeting  eye  contact 
 speaking  to  the  ground  instead  of  to  you
[26:24] look  them  in  the  eye  and  speak  loud 
 enough  that  they  could  still  hear  you  if 
 they  were  stored  one  feet  further  the
[26:30] back  number  19  have  patience  for  a  lot 
 of  the  things  that  you  want  to  do 
 whether  it's  build  a  great  body  or  you
[26:36] know  try  and  start  some  businesses  make 
 some  money  or  get  some  good  grades  it 
 takes  quite  a  lot  of  time  to  do  this
[26:41] stuff  this  is  something  that  a  lot  of 
 guys  struggle  with  a  lot  of  guys  don't 
 have  the  ability  to  be  patient  and  so
[26:46] they  end  up  trying  something  not  seeing 
 the  results  fast  enough  and  then  just 
 giving  it  up  and  then  they  try  something 
 else  and  then  they  try  something  else
[26:51] they've  got  the  shiny  object  syndrome 
 that  stems  from  impatience  if  you  can  be 
 the  guy  who  sticks  to  something  that  you
[26:57] know  that  you'll  want  to  do  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  and  you're  patient  with  it 
 you'll  get  the  results  for  me  that  was 
 weightlifting  and  building  a  muscular
[27:03] aesthetic  strong  body  I  started  at  age 
 17  and  literally  saw  myself  still  age  60
[27:08] age  70  being  muscular  and  strong  and 
 still  going  to  the  gym  I  had  this  level 
 of  patience  so  I  knew  that  okay  I  don't
[27:13] have  to  like  get  the  fastest  results 
 possible  nine  years  later  and  I'm  still 
 training  consistently  I  had  the  patience
[27:19] for  the  results  and  sure  like  you  know 
 my  progress  has  been  quite  slow  in  terms 
 of  the  gym  progress  but  I've  never  quit
[27:24] and  I  Foster  past  a  lot  of  people  who 
 had  better  genetics  than  me  or  higher 
 testosterone  or  started  in  like  a  better 
 place  or  trained  better  than  me  just
[27:30] because  I  was  patient  with  it  if  you're 
 patient  and  you  just  stick  to  something 
 for  the  long  term  you'll  often  get
[27:35] better  results  than  the  guy  who's  even 
 genetically  superior  but  he  just  hasn't 
 trained  for  that  long  life  lesson  number
[27:40] 20  start  learning  about  making  money  and 
 finances  right  now  when  I  was  a  teenager
[27:45] none  of  this  even  occurred  to  me 
 honestly  like  I  just  went  through  the 
 normal  school  system  just  thinking  yeah 
 well  you  know  right  now  we're  in  high
[27:50] school  then  we'll  go  to  college  or 
 university  and  you  know  I'll  get  a 
 degree  and  like  I  never  even  realized 
 that  even  when  I  was  a  teenager  and  I
[27:56] was  in  school  I  could  start  learning 
 about  these  things  right  now  in  the 
 single  greatest  way  to  do  this  is  to
[28:01] read  books  there's  absolutely  no  better 
 way  to  start  learning  about  how  to  make 
 money  than  to  literally  just  read  some 
 of  the  most  core  books  I  have  a  list  of
[28:07] all  of  the  self-help  books  that  I 
 recommend  which  is  in  the  description  of 
 this  video  number  21  develop  valuable
[28:12] skills  now  you  probably  heard  this 
 phrase  before  you've  probably  heard  a 
 bunch  of  YouTubers  tell  you  oh  yeah  I 
 develop  skills  but  they  never  go  into
[28:18] more  detail  than  that  and  so  you  just 
 hear  this  cool  sounding  phrase  okay  yeah 
 I  should  develop  skills  and  you  don't 
 even  know  what  the  [ __ ]  it  even  means  or
[28:24] what  to  do  so  skills  are  things  that  we 
 all  have  and  we  all  do  but  of  course 
 when  you  develop  a  skill  then  it  gets
[28:29] better  right  so  it's  almost  most  of  the 
 same  concept  as  skills  in  a  video  game 
 like  we  all  start  with  the  same  kind  of
[28:34] skills  that  we  all  have  you  know  the 
 attack  skill  the  strength  skill  the 
 magic  skill  the  the  hit  point  skill  we
[28:39] all  have  the  same  skills  but  then  of 
 course  what  you  focus  on  and  level  up 
 gets  better  and  you  get  more  rewards
[28:44] from  it  and  real  life  is  exactly  the 
 same  so  the  skills  that  we  have  for 
 example  are  communication  influence
[28:49] sales  dating  confidence  mental  strength 
 physical  strength  all  of  these  things 
 are  literally  the  skills  that  we  can
[28:54] develop  and  so  there's  some  valuable 
 skills  that  you  can  start  to  develop 
 right  now  and  I'd  say  the  one  that  I 
 would  just  recommend  to  you  is  social
[29:00] skills  so  social  skills  is  the  skill 
 that  you  use  when  you're  speaking  to 
 other  people  and  a  lot  of  young  guys  or
[29:05] just  a  lot  of  guys  or  a  lot  of  people  in 
 general  have  such  poor  social  skills 
 they've  got  weird  social  mannerism
[29:11] they're  just  like  not  confident  fleeting 
 eye  contact  weird  body  language  like 
 they're  just  AFK  or  something  they  just
[29:16] talk  weird  they  ask  weird  questions  like 
 they  don't  even  know  how  to  like  be  in  a 
 normal  conversation  and  then  they  just
[29:21] feel  lonely  after  that  so  social  skills 
 is  the  first  skill  that  I  think  you 
 should  start  with  and  there's  no  greater 
 book  to  do  that  than  how  to  win  friends
[29:27] and  influence  people  that  box  Linked  In 
 the  description  along  with  all  the  other 
 books  but  also  I  have  a  full  guide  to
[29:32] this  book  that  I'll  have  linked 
 somewhere  as  a  card  I  forgot  what  number 
 we're  on  I  think  that  was  20  so  21  can 
 be  a  suggestion  from  someone  in  our  live

 of  this  video  deal  right  now  click  on 
 that  Discord  server  link  right  now  I've
[30:32] just  got  a  suggestion  from  one  of  the 
 guys  watching  this  live  stream  his  name 
 is  the  board  teen  and  he  said  another
[30:37] life  lesson  is  figuring  out  how  to  look 
 better  now  your  looks  your  physical 
 looks  like  your  appearance  is  so  much
[30:43] more  important  than  you've  been  made  to 
 believe  because  there's  this  advice  that 
 feels  really  good  which  is  you  know 
 you're  so  you're  so  valuable  you're  such
[30:49] a  beautiful  young  man  like  you  know  your 
 mom's  saying  this  you're  like  oh  yeah 
 it's  a  you're  such  a  beautiful  young  man 
 you're  so  handsome  like  bro  chances  are
[30:54] you  you're  not  honestly  chances  are 
 you're  actually  not  that  attractive  if 
 you  are  attractive  right  now  you  would 
 know  you  would  literally  have  all  of  the
[31:00] girls  messaging  you  you  would  have  an 
 abundance  of  girls  who  were  interested 
 in  you  who  wanted  to  date  you  who  maybe 
 wanted  to  get  like  even  more  sexual  with
[31:06] you  if  you  were  attractive  chances  are 
 you're  just  not  that  physically 
 attractive  just  yet  too  many  guys 
 overlooked  this  with  this  attitude  of
[31:11] like  oh  but  I  don't  care  what  anyone 
 thinks  of  me  and  I've  always  found  that 
 so  weird  so  many  teenagers  are  adopting
[31:16] this  mindset  of  like  oh  I  don't  care 
 what  anyone  thinks  that's  so  so 
 unnatural  think  about  it  we're  tribal
[31:21] creatures  of  course  we  care  what  other 
 people  in  our  tribe  think  about  us  the 
 people  in  your  school  or  who  you've  got
[31:26] on  social  media  or  your  family  or  your 
 friends  their  opinions  of  you  should 
 actually  matter  like  I  know  like  I  know
[31:31] I'm  the  first  person  who's  ever  said 
 this  to  you  but  the  people  around  you 
 their  opinion  should  matter  to  you  you
[31:36] should  care  what  people  think  about  you 
 I'm  literally  the  only  person  on  the 
 internet  who  actually  says  this  everyone 
 else  is  giving  you  this  cringe  Sigma
[31:42] male  personality  like  oh  yeah  I  don't 
 care  what  anyone  thinks  I'll  just  die  of 
 loneliness  by  myself  I  don't  care  if  I
[31:47] don't  get  invited  to  parties  I  don't 
 care  if  I  don't  have  any  like  shut  up 
 what  a  sad  way  to  live  bro  like 
 literally  the  better  way  to  live  is  to
[31:53] care  what  the  most  valuable  the  most 
 like  upstanding  people  of  your  tribe 
 think  about  it's  normal  and  it's  good  to
[31:59] want  to  be  acknowledged  by  your  tribe  of 
 being  like  a  good  young  man  and 
 improving  your  looks  is  one  of  the  best
[32:04] ways  that  you  can  do  that  the  single 
 greatest  way  to  improve  your  looks  is  to 
 build  your  aesthetic  body  to  get  that 
 lean  [ __ ]  boy  Tick-Tock  boy  kind  of
[32:10] physique  again  those  three  workout 
 routines  are  linked  in  the  description 
 if  you  follow  those  routines  and  you 
 keep  going  to  the  gym  and  you  start
[32:16] eating  a  little  bit  cleaner  and  you 
 start  packing  onto  like  lean  muscle  mass 
 you're  gonna  significantly  improve  how
[32:21] hot  you  look  one  final  Life  Lesson  by 
 Clay  is  learn  to  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
[32:27] there's  a  reason  why  I  end  every  single 
 one  of  my  videos  with  that  phrase  and 
 you  can  go  and  check  bro  you  can 
 literally  go  click  on  any  video  and  I've
[32:32] ended  the  video  by  saying  do  the  hard 
 work  especially  when  you  don't  feel  like 
 it  that  phrase  do  the  hard  work
[32:38] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 encapsulates  the  meaning  of  discipline 
 discipline  is  the  single  most  important
[32:44] thing  that  men  need  masculine  men  if  you 
 want  to  become  a  masculine  strong 
 successful  man  you  need  discipline  you
[32:51] need  to  go  and  do  the  work  that  is 
 required  of  you  even  when  you  don't  feel 
 like  doing  it  too  many  young  guys  are  so
[32:57] invested  in  their  emotions  and  their 
 feelings  and  I  don't  blame  you  because 
 you're  being  told  by  all  these  like 
 these  manipulative  people  that  young  men
[33:03] should  be  emotional  that  you  should  be 
 in  touch  with  oh  shut  up  you're  being 
 told  this  stuff  by  people  who  want  you
[33:08] to  be  weak  the  thing  is  the  girls  who 
 tell  you  like  oh  yeah  but  men  should  be 
 emotional  men  should  cry  bro  they're  not
[33:13] [ __ ]  guys  who  cry  simple  as  that 
 they're  not  [ __ ]  the  guys  who  are 
 like  being  little  [ __ ]  next  to  them 
 simple  as  that  bro  the  people  who  told
[33:18] you  like  oh  men  should  be  emotional 
 they're  not  going  to  respect  you  when 
 you  take  the  day  off  work  because  you 
 didn't  feel  like  it  they're  gonna 
 respect  the  strong  man  who's  built  a
[33:24] successful  business  and  become  rich 
 because  he  was  disciplined  they're  gonna 
 respect  the  athletes  who  goes  and  trains 
 in  the  rain  in  the  cold  when  doesn't
[33:30] feel  like  it  everyone  respects 
 discipline  but  in  the  modern  day  they're 
 trying  to  take  discipline  out  of  young 
 men  because  they  want  you  to  be  weak  and
[33:35] controllable  and  we  can  get  into  the 
 conspiracy  theories  there  but  that  was 
 why  23  life  lessons  for  teenagers  share
[33:40] this  video  if  you've  got  any  other 
 teenage  friends  and  click  and  watch  this
