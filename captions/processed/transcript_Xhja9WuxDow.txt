[00:00] Jeffrey  is  surely  going  to  impress  her 
 now  okay  what  what  should  I  say  okay
[00:05] okay  don't  screw  this  up  Jeffrey  he 
 walks  over  to  her  he  Taps  her  on  her 
 shoulder  she  turns  around  and  instantly
[00:11] looks  at  him  in  disgust  and  she  walks 
 away  oh  you've  messed  up  again  Jeffrey
[00:16] Adonis 
 Adonis  has  a  Charming  charismatic  effect
[00:21] on  people  you  can't  help  but  just  like 
 him  instantly  why  is  this  you  look  at
[00:27] Adonis  from  head  to  toe  and  that's  when 
 you  realize  I  remember  being  a  bit 
 younger  maybe  age  17  and  getting
[00:34] introduced  to  this  girl  in  this  party 
 she  was  polite  for  like  you  know  a 
 minute
[00:39] what  do  you  study  and  then  just  Slumber 
 shoulders  seemed  bored  by  my  answers  to
[00:45] her  questions  and  you  know  my  questions 
 to  her  just  kind  of  turn  around  and 
 pretty  much  ignored  me  for  the  rest  of 
 the  night  and  you  know  didn't  really
[00:50] look  at  me  for  a  long  time  I  felt  like  I 
 never  really  got  a  fair  chance  with 
 people  it  felt  like  perhaps  my  first
[00:55] impression  that  was  coming  across  wasn't 
 very  positive  for  some  reason  I  couldn't
[01:00] figure  out  why  I  was  like  well  you  know 
 I'm  really  funny  and  I've  been  going  to 
 the  gym  now  like  oh  why  aren't  people
[01:05] taking  me  seriously  that  was  the  kind  of 
 problem  I  was  experiencing  a  while  ago 
 and  now  now  it  feels  like  I  get  the
[01:10] benefit  of  the  doubt  now  it  feels  like 
 people  like  me  without  really  knowing  me 
 where  I'm  in  right  now  is  an  Airbnb  in
[01:16] London  and  when  I  booked  this  place  the 
 woman  who  you  know  her  profile  it  shows 
 like  she  owns  this  place  she  messaged  me
[01:22] saying  oh  like  her  brother  will  come 
 like  let  me  in  and  show  me  around  and  I 
 was  with  my  girl  as  well  we  got  the  Uber 
 to  the  building  you  know  with  the  law
[01:27] suitcases  we're  stood  outside  and  I  see 
 this  guy  walk  up  and  he  just  instantly 
 knows  it  was  me  even  though  there  was
[01:32] other  people  around  and  literally  the 
 first  thing  that  he  said  to  me  was  he  he 
 said  his  sister's  name  I  won't  say  the
[01:37] name  but  he  said  like  oh  yeah  my  sister 
 said  that  you're  really  attractive  come 
 on  come  on  I'll  show  you  in  one  of  the 
 first  things  he  said  to  me  just  randomly
[01:42] with  a  massive  smile  on  his  face  and 
 already  seeming  like  warm  and  receptive 
 to  me  was  like  his  sister  had  told  him
[01:48] that  I  was  attractive  because  I  had  his 
 sister  the  Airbnb  host  on  WhatsApp  and 
 on  WhatsApp  I'll  show  you  my  my  WhatsApp
[01:54] picture  it's  like  a  picture  of  me  sure 
 that  stood  next  to  my  girl  it  gives  me  a 
 sense  of  like  pre-selection  there's 
 seven  key  reasons  why  people  dislike  you
[02:00] immediately  and  the  strategy  to  overcome 
 this  is  to  present  a  great  first 
 impression  the  first  reason  and  the
[02:06] worst  reason  why  someone  will  dislike 
 you  straight  away  bro  if  you're  a  victim 
 to  this  you  need  to  change  literally  you
[02:11] need  to  stop  watching  the  video  even  if 
 it's  bad  for  my  YouTube  AdSense  Revenue 
 whatever  retention  rate  or  some  [ __ ]  you
[02:16] need  to  stop  the  video  and  fix  this 
 problem  right  now  the  first  reason  why 
 people  dislike  you  immediately  is 
 because  of  poor  hygiene  if  you  have  long
[02:22] dirty  fingernails  bad  oh  [ __ ]  me  bro  you 
 can  be  as  ugly  as  you  want  bro  honestly 
 you  can  be  as  ugly  as  you  want  you  can
[02:27] be  fat  you  can  be  skinny  you  can  have 
 like  shitty  hair  whatever  bro  if  you 
 stink  that's  a  violation  that  is  a
[02:32] violation  of  everyone  else's  human 
 rights  next  to  you  if  you  stink  you  need 
 to  fix  that  [ __ ]  immediately  and  then 
 you  need  to  like  up  your  hygiene  and
[02:38] make  sure  like  your  hair  doesn't  look 
 greasy  and  then  put  in  some  extra  time 
 to  make  sure  that  your  hygiene  isn't 
 just  acceptable  but  actually  really  good
[02:44] bro  you  don't  want  a  girl  who's 
 attracted  to  up  until  she  smells  you  or 
 she  notices  something  about  you  which
[02:49] just  looks  unclean  and  that  turns  it  off 
 that's  like  the  worst  reason  to  ever 
 turn  a  girl  off  the  second  reason  why
[02:55] people  might  dislike  you  straight  away 
 and  this  one's  kind  of  harsh  but  it  is 
 it  is  true  it's  your  physique  it's  your
[03:00] aesthetic  it's  how  you  look  at  your  body 
 shape  if  you  have  the  body  of  a  man  who
[03:05] is  lazy  people  can't  help  but  not  to 
 respect  you  as  much  as  there's  this  fat 
 positive  everyone's  beautiful  movements
[03:12] the  thing  is  like  the  majority  of  people 
 don't  have  much  respect  for  a  fat  person 
 or  a  really  skinny  guy  because  it  just
[03:18] shows  that  you  lack  the  discipline  to 
 improve  that  part  of  yourself  the 
 specific  way  to  improve  this  is  to  build
[03:23] your  aesthetic  body  and  I've  got  a 
 program  Linked  In  the  description  for 
 that  if  you're  interested  the  third
[03:28] reason  why  people  dislike  you 
 immediately  which  is  somewhat  similar  to 
 the  first  two  reasons  is  your  clothes
[03:33] and  your  fashion  style  especially  if 
 those  clothes  are  dirty  stained  creased
[03:39] or  smell  you  can  see  a  lot  of  this  comes 
 back  to  that  Primal  [ __ ]  of  like  do  you 
 stink  bro  if  you  stink  we  need  to  fix
[03:45] that  I'm  not  trying  to  be  offensive  bro 
 we  need  to  fix  that  ASAP  take  a  moment 
 right  now  to  just  visualize  yourself  as
[03:50] a  girl  you  know  you're  just  a  normal 
 girl  you  get  100  matches  on  Tinder  a  day 
 you  get  500  DM  you  know  what  I  mean  and
[03:55] then  see  you  come  up  and  approach  her 
 and  just  notice  what  you're  wearing  is 
 it  attractive  is  it  unattractive  does  it
[04:01] look  fashionable  have  you  spent  some 
 time  improving  your  clothing  this  is 
 something  I'll  be  totally  honest  that
[04:06] that  I  haven't  spent  too  much  time  on 
 and  I've  never  really  cared  about 
 fashion  much  but  just  a  few  months  ago 
 for  one  of  the  first  times  of  my  life  I
[04:12] spent  like  a  lot  of  money  on  clothes  I 
 spent  500  pounds  literally  I  don't 
 usually  ever  spend  money  like  500  pounds
[04:17] it's  not  a  crazy  amount  for  a  lot  of 
 people  it  is  for  me  because  I'm  used  to 
 buying  stuff  pre-owned  I'm  not  gonna  lie
[04:22] to  you  like  I  literally  bought  like 
 trainers  and  shirts  and  hoodies  and  even 
 pants  and  [ __ ]  pre-owned  work  so  for  the
[04:28] first  time  just  a  few  months  ago  I 
 budgeted  500  pounds  that  I  would  spend 
 on  a  new  pair  of  trainers  that  didn't 
 have  a  hole  in  them  and  a  couple  of  like
[04:33] gym  outfits  wearing  that  has  gotten  me 
 so  many  more  compliments  from  other 
 people  the  fourth  reason  why  you  might
[04:38] feel  like  you're  not  really  getting  a 
 fair  chance  with  someone  and  you  know 
 they  seem  to  dislike  you  straight  away 
 is  weird  social  mannerisms  and  this
[04:45] one's  quite  a  hurtful  one  to  me  for  me 
 to  mention  and  especially  I'm  just  gonna 
 tell  you  the  truth  I'm  gonna  sound  like
[04:50] an  awful  person  for  this  I  do  meetups 
 with  my  boys  quite  often  so  I'll  you 
 know  I'll  announce  I'm  in  this  city  I'm
[04:55] in  this  country  come  and  meet  me  boys 
 let's  go  like  chill  and  you  know  go  in 
 the  park  or  like  do  some  push-ups  or 
 some  [ __ ]  for  a  while  usually  around  20
[05:01] of  the  guys  who  come  to  my  meetups  have 
 like  weird  social  mannerism  to  the  point
[05:06] that  it's  very  hard  to  connect  with  them 
 and  I  don't  say  this  to  be  offensive  I'd 
 say  this  because  we're  here  to  improve
[05:11] but  essentially  what  I  mean  by  weird 
 social  mannerisms  is  like  they  don't  act
[05:16] normal  perhaps  it's  like  fleeting  eye 
 contact  or  just  no  eye  contact  at  all 
 and  talking  to  you  whilst  like  looking
[05:22] away  or  you  know  just  constantly  like 
 touching  their  face  when  they  speak  to 
 you  and  like  hiding  that  their  mouth  or
[05:27] some  [ __ ]  of  course  that's  like  it's 
 kind  of  messed  up  why  we  have  these 
 things  generally  if  someone's  got  like 
 this  weird  social  mannerism  it's  because
[05:32] they've  been  conditioned  in  that  way 
 punished  or  rewarded  by  their  parents 
 but  it  is  something  that  you  will  be
[05:37] judged  on  do  you  seem  normal  in  social 
 situations  you  don't  have  to  be  like 
 this  amazingly  social  guy  who's  really
[05:43] loud  and  confident  and  extroverted  you 
 don't  have  to  be  like  that  you  can  still 
 maintain  your  your  style  but  do  you  just
[05:48] seem  weird  do  you  make  people  feel  like 
 a  little  bit  uncomfortable  just  ask 
 yourself  that  question  it  takes  a  lot  of
[05:54] humility  but  perhaps  this  could  be  what 
 you're  missing  out  on  right  now  and  I 
 don't  blame  you  honestly  if  this  is  what 
 you're  experiencing  you  feel  kind  of
[06:00] weird  next  to  other  people  I  don't  blame 
 you  because  of  the  modern  day  bro  like 
 the  social  skills  are  so  [ __ ]  up 
 aren't  they  everyone's  spending  all  all
[06:06] their  social  life  just  online  and  so 
 when  you  do  meet  in  person  it's  like 
 you're  not  really  used  to  that  when  I 
 meet  someone  who's  got  weird  social
[06:11] mannerisms  I  know  for  100  certainty  that 
 that  person  doesn't  play  any  kind  of 
 physical  sport  and  that  they  don't  have
[06:17] like  physical  friends  being  like  nerds 
 on  the  computer  and  even  if  you're 
 working  on  something  productive  it's
[06:22] like  that's  awesome  you  know  you're 
 working  on  something  nice  but  that  will 
 [ __ ]  up  your  social  mannerisms  you  need
[06:27] to  go  and  do  some  kind  of  physical 
 Sports  where  other  guys  like  wrestling 
 you  pushing  you  throwing  but  like  you 
 know  a  ball  at  you  or  something  and  that
[06:32] like  it  just  opens  up  your  body  so  much 
 more  anyone  who's  who  hasn't  done  some 
 kind  of  physical  training  just  appears
[06:38] like  odd  in  his  body  it's  like  he 
 doesn't  know  the  controls  on  like  how  to 
 move  properly  I  know  the  reason  why
[06:44] people  might  dislike  you  straight  away 
 when  you  might  not  even  realize  this  you 
 don't  seem  happy  and  you  don't  really
[06:49] smile  a  lot  of  guys  think  that  they're 
 supposed  to  be  this  kind  of  Sigma  male 
 who's  like  proper  serious  and  I  see
[06:54] these  cringe  videos  pop  up  on  YouTube 
 where  you're  supposed  to  like  be 
 rejecting  of  other  people  and  you're
[06:59] supposed  to  pretend  like  you  don't  care 
 about  them  bro  I  tried  this  I  tried  this 
 I'm  telling  you  right  now  right  this  is
[07:04] what  I  used  to  do  to  try  and  impress 
 women  if  there  was  a  all  that  I  wanted 
 to  hook  up  with  like  you  know  some  cute 
 girl  in  the  gym  or  some  [ __ ]  or  she'd  be 
 walking  past  instead  of  looking  at  her
[07:10] holding  eye  contacted  smiling  and  you're 
 not  going  to  speak  to  her  I  would 
 pretend  I  wasn't  looking  at  her  and  just
[07:15] pull  like  this  like  [ __ ]  boy  face  like 
 looking  away  like
[07:20] I  would  be  doing  [ __ ]  cringe 
 I  would  literally  like  in  the  club  I  see
[07:25] the  girl  that  I  really  want  to  get  I 
 just  walk  past  it
[07:31] well  just  look  at  people  bro  look  at 
 someone  acknowledge  their  existence  and
[07:36] smile  and  the  second  part  of  this  is 
 don't  restrain  your  laughter  it  is  so 
 sad  seeing  someone  in  a  social  situation
[07:42] hiding  their  laughter  behind  their  hand 
 or  like  you  know  trying  to  like  downplay 
 it  do  you  think  the  king  would  hide  his
[07:48] laughter  imagine  the  most  powerful  man 
 of  all  of  society  the  king  would  he  hide 
 his  laughter  behind  his  hand  would  he
[07:53] like  just  like  giggle  underneath  his 
 breath 
 no  the  king  would  literally  be  shut  back
[07:59] with  his  like  bulging  stomach  because 
 he's  just  ate  a  large  part  of  the  ball 
 and  he'd  be  laughing  with  like  fully
[08:05] he'd  be  laughing  with  like  a  stupid 
 laugh  they'd  be  laughing  with  like  full 
 intensity  you  wouldn't  be  like  hiding  it
[08:11] behind  his  hand  man  and  the  final  reason 
 why  I  can  think  off  why  someone  might 
 dislike  you  straight  away  you  might  be
[08:16] coming  across  as  fake  and  I'm  not  sure 
 if  this  is  applicable  to  a  lot  of  people 
 but  I  found  people  in  customer  service
[08:22] roles  really  have  this  when  I  checked  in 
 to  a  hotel  that  I  was  staying  in  a 
 couple  of  weeks  ago  the  receptionist
[08:28] there  like  I  couldn't  help  but  dislike 
 her  even  though  she  was  being  like 
 polite  to  me  I  couldn't  help  it  because
[08:33] she  just  had  like  this  fake  like  like 
 sneaker  would  call  them  Bots  like  she 
 had  this  like  bot  personality  where  like
[08:38] she  wasn't  even  a  real  person  she  was 
 just  following  the  script  of  like  her 
 her  employers  put  onto  her  she  wasn't  a
[08:44] bad  person  and  I  wasn't  rude  to  her  or 
 anything  but  I  just  I  couldn't  help  but 
 like  not  be  able  to  relate  or  respect
[08:50] her  because  of  that  kind  of  personality 
 that  she  had  with  you  have  to  like  hide 
 your  real  personality  because  you  don't
[08:55] really  think  it's  appropriate  we've  run 
 over  seven  reasons  why  people  might 
 dislike  you  straight  away  you  might  be
[09:00] sitting  here thinking  wait  wait  that's 
 too  much  I'm  not  gonna  change  myself  why 
 would  I  change  so  much  about  myself  just 
 to  make  people  like  me  is  it  really  a
[09:06] lot  to  tell  you  like  oh  yeah  by  the  way 
 bro  just  um  you  know  maybe  just  just
[09:11] smell  your  armpits  and  just  just  see  if 
 you  like  the  smell  like  is  there  so  much 
 to  tell  you  yeah  like  brush  your  teeth
[09:17] twice  twice  a  day  bro  like  you  know 
 where  where  clean  clothes  that  don't 
 have  stains  on  them  I  don't  want  to  be
[09:22] condescending  but  like  a  lot  of  like 
 other  guys  have  this  energy  where 
 they're  like  oh  well  I'm  not  gonna 
 change  anything  about  myself  oh  I  don't
[09:27] care  about  anyone  else  I  don't  care  if 
 people  uh  view  me  or  I  don't  care  what 
 people  think  about  me  ah  yeah  I  don't
[09:32] care  about  other  people's  opinions  I 
 hear  that  so  much  in  this  modern  day  so 
 many  guys  will  say  this  maybe  you've
[09:37] said  this  before  like  oh  well  I  don't 
 care  about  other  people's  opinions  that 
 doesn't  make  sense  that's  not  a  human
[09:42] thing  to  say  we  are  tribal  creatures  I 
 might  be  one  of  the  first  people  you've
[09:47] ever  heard  say  this  especially  of  like 
 influences  on  YouTube  say  this  I  might 
 be  the  first  person  to  say  this
[09:53] I  care  what  other  people  think  of  me  I 
 care  that  doesn't  mean  I'm  weak  that
[09:58] doesn't  mean  that  I'm  like  any  you  know 
 insult  it  means  that  I'm  human  and  I'm
[10:03] in  touch  with  this  natural  part  like 
 this  natural  evolutionary  trait  inside
[10:08] of  me  where  we  care  what  our  tribe 
 thinks  of  us  of  course  we  do  we  care 
 about  our  tribe  thinks  that's  how  we
[10:14] were  able  to  get  to  this  Advanced 
 civilization  stage  and  since  you 
 understand  this  since  you  understand 
 that  yeah  like  it  is  a  normal  thing  to
[10:20] care  what  people  think  about  us  it 
 should  be  an  area  of  your 
 self-improvement  something  like  [ __ ]
[10:25] like  why  am  I  not  getting  a  fair  chance 
 with  some  people  why  was  there  that  one 
 person  who  seems  to  just  dislike  me
[10:30] straight  away  and  you  know  if  there  was 
 just  one  person  maybe  it's  just  them  but 
 if  you're  consistently  meeting  people 
 who  don't  really  seem  happy  like  that
[10:36] happy  to  meet  you  perhaps  it's  you  and 
 we  should  take  the  responsibility  for
[10:41] this  instead  of  complaining  and  putting 
 the  responsibility  on  other  people  and 
 saying  oh  it's  them  I  don't  care  about 
 what  they  think  and  I  just  think  yeah
[10:46] [ __ ]  it  like  I  want  a  better  life  I  want 
 people  to  like  me  I  want  more  friends  I 
 want  more  girls  [ __ ]  it  I'll  improve
[10:51] this  part  of  me  there's  a  mindset  that 
 you  should  hold  which  is  very  empowering 
 and  I  gave  this  to  my  friend  Sam  who
[10:56] really  was  experiencing  some  of  these 
 things  that  we  talked  about  today  what  I 
 told  him  was  just  this  piece  of  advice
[11:01] present  your  best  self  to  the  world  when 
 you  step  foot  out  of  your  room  present
[11:06] your  best  self  to  the  world  take  two 
 minutes  to  look  at  yourself  in  the 
 mirror  do  your  hair  make  sure  there's
[11:11] nothing  in  your  teeth  or  in  your  nose 
 clean  up  your  face  make  sure  there's  no 
 like  random  like  just  [ __ ]  on  your  face
[11:16] present  your  best  self  to  the  world 
 because  you  never  know  who  you're  gonna 
 meet  imagine  if  the  one  day  you  go  out
[11:21] and  you  stink  it  was  the  day  you  were 
 gonna  meet  like  the  girl  that  you  were 
 gonna  end  up  dating  bro  imagine  bro
[11:26] imagine  the  day  that  you  were  like  you 
 know  fate  would  have  aligned  for  you  to 
 go  and  meet  the  girl  of  your  dreams  and
[11:32] you  just  stank  that  day  bro 
 oh  my  come  on  bro  do  it  for  you  bro
