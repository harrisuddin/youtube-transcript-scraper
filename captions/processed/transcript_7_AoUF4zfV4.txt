[00:00] jeffrey  believes  the  fitness  youtubers 
 when  they  say  that  there's  no  such  thing 
 as  a  perfect  diet  and  so  jeffrey  follows
[00:05] the  fitness  youtubers  advice  to  eat  junk 
 food  as  long  as  it  fits  his  macros 
 jeffrey  gets  fat  and  honest
[00:11] adonis  has  been  shredded  for  years  it's 
 not  even  difficult  to  stay  lean  when  he 
 eats  the  perfect  diet  the  peasants
[00:17] around  him  look  in  confusion  but  adonis 
 continues  to  feast  all  of  the  fitness 
 youtubers  you  see  are  complete  [ __ ]
[00:23] they  say  there's  no  such  thing  as  the 
 perfect  diet  that's  [ __ ]  i'm  gonna 
 show  you  exactly  what  the  perfect  diet 
 is  right  now  my  name  is  hamza  i  help
[00:28] young  men  go  through  the  jeffrey  to

[00:33] around  here  scroll  down  right  now  click 
 on  the  subscribe  and  the  post 
 notification  button  if  you  want  to  join 
 in  on  the  cult  my  diet  has  been
[00:39] horrendous  because  i  trusted  these  guys 
 on  the  internet  these  [ __ ]  told 
 me  you  can  eat  whatever  you  want  you  can
[00:44] eat  all  the  junk  food  as  long  as  it  fits 
 your  macros  i  trusted  them  because  of 
 that  i've  never  even  considered  the
[00:49] difference  that  food  has  on  our  health 
 when  i've  done  the  most  basic  research 
 it  hurts  me  to  think  that  i  was  stupid
[00:55] enough  to  follow  fitness  youtubers  that 
 it  hurts  me  to  think  that  my  boys  who 
 are  watching  this  video  who  support  my
[01:00] channel  who  are  in  my  cult  have  taken 
 the  stupid  advice  that  i  have  from  these 
 big  ass  fitness  youtubers  because  i'm
[01:05] telling  you  right  now  none  of  those 
 people  are  healthy  just  because  they've 
 got  muscle  and  they're  like  shredded 
 does  not  mean  they're  healthy  and  it
[01:10] does  not  mean  that  they  will  still  be 
 alive  10  to  15  years  from  now  a  lot  of 
 those  [ __ ]  are  gonna  get
[01:15] diabetes  very  soon  and  i've  said  this  a 
 few  times  i'll  still  keep  saying  it 
 you're  going  to  start  seeing  them 
 literally  die  like  you're  going  to  see
[01:21] big  fitness  youtubers  start  to  die  in 
 the  next  10  years  because  of  the 
 stupid-ass  diet  that  they're  on  and  i
[01:26] followed  that  advice  every  single  day 
 while  i  was  eating  junk  the  amount  of 
 junk  food  i  was  eating  i  was  going  to
[01:31] mcdonald's  i've  literally  got  a  video  of 
 the  viral  semi-viral  video  that  i 
 released  the  aesthetic  body
[01:37] guide  and  i  literally  said  oh  i  eat  junk 
 food  every  day  i  go  to  mcdonald's  every 
 single  day  i  used  to  like  that  was  not
[01:43] an  exaggeration  it  was  every  single  day 
 i was  eating  that  bro  because  all  macros 
 are  you  know  if  all  calories  are  the
[01:48] same  just  eat  your  macros  why  would  i 
 eat  clean  like  what's  the  reason  of 
 eating  clean  what's  the  reason  of of
[01:54] thinking  about  health  if  all  macros  are 
 the  same  you  may  as  well  eat  whatever 
 you  want  right  and  so  i  have  always
[01:59] struggled  with  binge  eating  to  the  point 
 that  it  makes  me  cry  the  fitness 
 transformation  like  my  body
[02:04] transformation  is  one  of  the  most 
 important  things  to  me  and  feeling  that 
 you  don't  have  any  control  over  your
[02:09] diet  which  you  probably  can  relate  to 
 like  you  you  want  to  improve  your  diet 
 you  just
[02:14] keep  on  making  the  same  mistakes  it's 
 because  the  food  that  the  the  people
[02:19] online  like  they're  supposed  to  help  you 
 the  food  that  these  people  are 
 suggesting  for  you  to  eat  one  it  makes 
 them  more  money  you  know  they  get  more
[02:25] views  if  it's  the  guy  who's  jacked  and 
 he's  got  the  picture  of  the  cereal  and 
 he  says  oh  what  i  eat  in  a  day  full  day 
 of  eating  as  a  fitness  person  like
[02:31] but  two  that  food  is  literally  addictive 
 the  reason  why  you  keep  finding  yourself
[02:36] just  freaking  up  on  your  diet  is  because 
 you're  literally  addicted  to  junk  food 
 and  you're  surrounded  by  a  culture  that 
 promotes  it  it  took  me  a  while  like  i
[02:42] went  through  a  very  life  ch  like  i  had 
 to  change  my  life  to  change  my  diets  it
[02:47] wasn't  the  other  way  around  i  had  to 
 truly  like  i  had  to  move  out  of  this 
 [ __ ]  city  i  could  move  back  into  my 
 parents  house  i  had  to  severely  reduce
[02:53] how  much  i  use  the  internet  i  don't 
 watch  youtube  videos  i  especially  don't 
 watch  fitness  youtubers  i  had  to  reduce
[02:59] all  of  this  and  start  looking  at  like 
 real  nutritional  research  and  every 
 single  time  i'd  look  through  i'd  just  be
[03:04] thinking  like  those  those  fitness 
 youtubers  like  they  they  have  no  clue 
 what  they're  talking  about  saying  that
[03:10] all  calories  are  the  same  that  you  can 
 eat  700  like  these  [ __ ]  dead 
 ass  eat  hundreds  of  grams  of  sugar  per
[03:17] day  and  they're  like  oh  but  if  it  fits 
 your  macros  and  so  just  over  a  year  ago 
 i  truly  started  to  transform  my  diet  i
[03:22] did  some  crazy  things  to  do  this  over 
 the  last  year  the  whole  year  i  have  had
[03:27] visible  abs  like  there  is  not  one  point 
 over  the  whole  year  that  i've  not  had 
 visible  abs absolutely  this  is  unheard
[03:32] of  for  me  i've  gotten  lean  before  but  i 
 would  literally  get  lean  like  here's  a 
 few  pictures  of  me  and  uni  and
[03:37] everything  i  would  get  lean 
 and  i  would  just  start  to  gain  the 
 weight  back  because  you  can  force
[03:42] yourself  to  get  into  the  calorie  deficit 
 but  eventually  you  know  it  gets  quite 
 like  restrictive  you've  got  2  000
[03:48] calories  a  day  you  want  to  eat  more  and 
 the  moment  i  start  eating  more  i  just 
 start  binge  eating  again  and  so  i  would 
 get  lean  i'd  do  all  that  work  and  then
[03:53] i'd  lose  the  physique  that  i  was  like 
 really  proud  to  build  up  until  the  last 
 year  where  now  i  i  promise  you  this  is
[03:59] the  truth  i  can  control  my  body  fat 
 percentage  i  have  full  control  over  my 
 diet  now  because  you  don't  get  a  feeling
[04:05] of  uncontrollable  urges  and  cravings 
 when  you  eat  the  food  that  i'm  about  to 
 suggest  to  you  in  the  perfect  diet  the
[04:10] perfect  diet  has  four  factors  it 
 maximizes  muscle  growth  it  minimizes  fat
[04:15] loss  it  improves  your  health  and  it 
 feels  sustainable  if  you  find  a  diet 
 that  has  all  four  you  will  become  a 
 millionaire  let's  break  that  down
[04:21] maximizing  muscle  growth  comes  from  a 
 diet  in  the  macronutrients  that  are  high 
 in  protein  high  in  complex  carbs  not
[04:26] [ __ ]  carbs  not  [ __ ]  carbs  we're  not 
 going  to  eat  sugar  not  simple  carbs  high 
 in  complex  carbs  and  moderate  fats  so  we
[04:33] need  protein  around  the  clock  to 
 maximize  muscle  protein  synthesis  and 
 you  can  imagine  this  is  like  the  process
[04:38] of  turning  protein  into  muscle 
 very  very  stupidly  simplified  and  this
[04:43] is  how  it  works  once  we  eat  protein  this 
 ability  to  make  muscle  is  elevated  but
[04:48] it's  like  a  wave  and  it  starts  going 
 down  after  we've  a  protein  and  if  we  eat 
 more  protein  it  goes  up  what  we'd  like
[04:53] to  do  is  keep  this  elevated  through  the 
 entire  day  next  we  want  complex  carbs
[04:58] around  our  workouts  this  will  increase 
 glycogen  and  that  pretty  much  makes  you 
 stronger  and  just  perform  better  in  the
[05:03] gym  which  will  mean  more  muscle  gain 
 finally 
 finally  we
[05:08] we  want  moderate  fats  we're  not  going  to 
 do  the  full  keto  [ __ ]  we  just  want 
 moderate  fats  which  will  just  make  sure 
 that  all  of  our  hormones  and
[05:13] testosterone  are  regulated  and  then  in  a 
 nice  healthy  level  we'll  break  this  down 
 in  more  detail  soon  the  second  part  of
[05:19] the  perfect  diet  comes  from  minimizing 
 fat  gain  and  this  comes  from  fasting
[05:24] there  is  no  better  way  to  structure  your 
 diet  than  fasting  fasting  means  to  not 
 eat  certain  things  most  people  think
[05:30] that  it's  calories  most  people  think 
 that  you  fast  from  calories  that's 
 [ __ ]  we  fast  from  carbs  maybe  fats
[05:35] and  not  calories  especially  not  protein 
 so  the  issue  that  most  people  have  most 
 bodybuilders  if  you're  into  building
[05:40] muscle  if  you've  been  lifting  weights 
 for  a  while  the  issue  that  you  may  have 
 had  with  fasting  with  intermittent
[05:45] fasting  is  that  you  don't  get  protein 
 and  these  guys  are  telling  you  okay  wake 
 up  don't  eat  protein  don't  eat  any
[05:50] calories  for  for  a  couple  more  hours 
 till  2  pm  but  then  you  missed  the  muscle 
 protein  synthesis  window  that  we  talked
[05:55] about  before  so  we're  going  to  couple  a 
 few  things  and  we're  going  to  do  what  i 
 call  protein  intermittent  fasting  we're
[06:01] going  to  do  intermittent  fasting  where 
 we  wake  up  and  we  just  don't  eat  for  a 
 couple  of  hours  so  we  have  like  just  an 
 eight  hour  window  for  our  calories  but
[06:07] we're  also  gonna  have  scoops  of  whey 
 protein  any  kind  of  protein  powder 
 throughout  our  fasting  window  so  that
[06:12] our  protein  synthesis  gets  elevated  and 
 we  also  get  the  most  of  the  benefits
[06:17] from  fasting  so  this  is  exactly  what  you 
 do  you  wake  up  and  you  immediately  go 
 and  have  a  scoop  of  protein  like  so  many
[06:23] people  say  that  this  would  break  the 
 fast  i  don't  think  so  we  are  not  fasting 
 from  calories  we're  fasting  from  carbs
[06:29] when  you  just  have  a  single  scoop  of 
 protein  powder  you  get  literally  like 
 one  gram  of  carb  in  there  and  if  you  mix
[06:34] it  with  water  as  well  so  we're  gonna 
 wake  up  and  have  a  scoop  of  whey  protein 
 and  then  two  to  three  hours  we're  just 
 gonna  do  some  work  stay  focused  two  to
[06:40] three  hours  later  we're  gonna  go  and 
 have  another  scoop  do  some  more  work  two 
 to  three  hours  later  have  another  scoop
[06:45] then  we're  probably  gonna  start  our 
 eating  window  after  about  six  hours  of 
 waking  up  and  we've  had  like  two  to 
 three  scoops  of  protein  during  this  time
[06:51] now  we're  going  to  be  close  to  our 
 workout  time  so  our  pre-workout  meal  the
[06:56] meal  that  we  eat  an  hour  or  two  before 
 we  go  to  workout  will  be  high  in  complex 
 carbs  moderate  in  protein  it  doesn't
[07:02] need  to  be  high  in  protein  because  we've 
 just  had  a  bunch  of  protein  scoops  and 
 it's  going  to  be  about  moderate  in  fats
[07:07] too  and  then  post-workout  so  the  meal 
 that  we  eat  half  an  hour  to  one  hour  to 
 two  hours  after  our  workout  is  going  to
[07:12] be  pretty  much  the  same  we're  going  to 
 go  into  more  detail  of  exactly  what  you 
 should  eat  but  this  is  the  structure  of 
 the  perfect  diet  we're  gonna  wake  up  do
[07:19] intermittent  fasting  but  also  get  scoops 
 of  whey  protein  during  the  fasting 
 window  when  we  break  off  fast  we're
[07:24] gonna  make  sure  that  we  get  complex 
 carbs  before  and  after  our  workout  so 
 that's  two  things  checked  off  the
[07:29] perfect  diet  already  and  we  have  two 
 more  we've  got  to  make  sure  this  perfect 
 diet  optimizes  our  health  and  it  also
[07:34] feels  sustainable  to  optimize  our  health 
 health  in  terms  of  diet  gets  very 
 confusing  and  no  one  really  knows 
 exactly  what  health  really  means  when
[07:41] you  really  think  about  your  health  in 
 terms  of  diet  what  like  what  are  you 
 thinking  because  most  people  will  still 
 think  it's  fat  loss  but  we've  just  cut
[07:46] we've  covered  the  fat  section  so  health 
 is  actually  about  your  gut  microbiome
[07:51] it's  like  the  second  brain  of  our  body 
 the  foods  that  optimize  and  keep  our  gut 
 healthy  we  can  say  are  healthy  foods  i'm
[07:58] gonna  have  a  big  list  of  healthy 
 ingredients  but  in  general  it's 
 it's  kind  of  like  the  unsexy  answer  is
[08:03] that  it's  a  lot  of  vegetables  and  fruits 
 and  like  natural  unprocessed  non-garbage
[08:09] food  you  don't  see  mcdonald's  in  there 
 you  don't  see  v  shred  pizza  shuts  up  bro 
 it's  literally  just  like  the  one  base
[08:15] ingredients  that's  the  phrase  i've 
 always  said  is  generally  if  you  eat  the 
 base  ingredients  you  will  stay  healthy
[08:21] the  base  ingredient  is  what  you're 
 looking  for  so  instead  of  looking  for 
 like  chips  and  if  you  go  into  the  frozen
[08:26] section  in  some  like  dumbass  supermarket 
 they're  selling  chips  and  it's  got  a 
 bunch  of  different  ingredients  it's  been
[08:31] processed  already  the  main  ingredient 
 that  you  wanted  was  potatoes  now  if  you 
 look  for  the  ingredient  list  on  potatoes
[08:36] there  isn't  one  they  literally  don't 
 have  an  ingredient  list  there  why 
 because  the  ingredient  in  potatoes  is
[08:41] potato  potato  potato  what  you'd  like  to 
 find  is  a  bunch  of  foods  like  this  where
[08:46] there  is  no  ingredient  list  it  is 
 literally  just  the  base  food  generally 
 that  stuff  is  healthy  so  here  is  where
[08:51] people  start  asking  for  the 
 macronutrient  split  even  though  it's 
 been  covered  a  million  times  people
[08:56] always  ask  me  how  many  how  many  grams  of 
 protein  how  many  this  i  don't  agree  with 
 the  standard  advice  that  people  give  you 
 so  you  already  know  the  advice  that
[09:01] you've  been  given  one  gram  of  protein 
 per  pound  of  body  weight 
 it's  pretty  stupid  device  doesn't  really
[09:07] work  for  most  people  because  a  200  pound 
 guy  should  generally  not  be  eating  200 
 grams  of  protein  unless  he's  a  jacked
[09:13] bodybuilder  one  gram  of  protein  per 
 pound  of  body  weight  doesn't  work  what  i 
 would  say  instead  is  eat  into  the  range
[09:18] of  120  grams  of  protein  to  about  180 
 grams  of  protein  if  you  end  up  inside  of
[09:24] this  range  fine  like  what  we  care  more 
 about  is  that  you  get  relatively  close
[09:29] to  the  ideal  number  like  you  get  close 
 enough  to  a  range  of  it  then  to 
 specifically  say  okay  i'm  165  pounds  so
[09:35] i  should  hit  165  grams  of  of  protein  and 
 honestly  i've  even  changed  the  way  that
[09:40] i  track  food  and  i  suggest  you  to  do 
 this  don't  even  track  macros  i  don't 
 think  there's  that  much  of  a  benefit  to
[09:46] making  sure  that  you  get  the  absolute 
 most  optimum  amount  of  carbs  and  fats 
 you  know  the  split  of  the  percentage
[09:51] splits  that  reduces  the  fourth  part  of 
 the  perfect  diet  which  is  sustainability
[09:57] because  the  easier  way  to  wrap  your  mind 
 around  all  this  is  to  think  okay 
 you  have  x  calories  let's  say  you've  got
[10:02] 2 2000  calories  it's  easier  to  say 
 you've  got  2  000  calories  get  into  the 
 range  of  120  to  180  grams  of  protein
[10:10] anywhere  around  this  range  in  this  range 
 is  going  to  be  good  enough  and  then 
 think  purely  about  just  filling  up  the
[10:15] 2000  calories  with  the  huge  list  of 
 ingredients  here  so  you  might  be  looking 
 at  this  list  of  ingredients  and  feeling
[10:21] a  little  bit  okay  confused  like  okay  um 
 like  how  would  i  make  this  into  a 
 realistic  meal  literally  choose  a  couple
[10:26] of  them  which  you  think  you  know  would 
 pair  well  together  and  just  make  them 
 together  put  them  all  onto  a  plate  like
[10:31] you  don't  have  to  make  a  pre-designed 
 meal  that  normal  people  eat  like  we
[10:36] don't  need  like  the  name  of  a  meal  that 
 normal  people  eat  on  the  normal  diets  we
[10:41] can  have  a  meal  which  is  lentils  and 
 potatoes  we  can  have  a  meal  which  is 
 yogurt  and  raspberries  oats  and  nuts  now
[10:48] because  we've  gave  you  the  flexibility 
 to  just  say  okay  reach  this  many 
 calories  with  roughly  this  much  protein
[10:54] and  you  know  what's  inside  the  calories 
 if  you  pick  from  this  ingredient  list 
 it's  going  to  be  healthy  you  now  have
[10:59] the  flexibility  to  look  at  this  list  and 
 just  kind  of  see  which  one  you  feel  like 
 having  today  and  that's  actually  the
[11:04] more  healthy  way  to  do  things  because 
 long  story  short  in  terms  of  our  gut 
 health  it's  better  to  eat  like  different
[11:11] things  quite  different  things  because  a 
 variety  it's  kind  of  like  cliche  terms 
 but  like  a  variety  of  fruits  and
[11:16] vegetables  is  the  best  for  your  health 
 it's  not  exactly  the  best  for  in  terms 
 of  just  you  know  consistency  knowing
[11:21] that  you've  got  the  exact  same  meal 
 every  day  i  prefer  to  do  that  personally 
 i  prefer  to  deliciously  just  have  these
[11:26] same  meals  every  single  day  but  in  terms 
 of  maximizing  health  it's  better  to  just 
 rotate  a  bunch  of  these  ingredients
[11:31] around  like  you've  got  your  list  you've 
 got  your  calories  you  know  roughly  how 
 much  protein  to  have  and  maybe  you  need
[11:37] to  get  like  a  couple  more  scoops  of 
 protein  in  there  you go  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
