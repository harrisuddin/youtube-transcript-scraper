[00:00] jeffrey's  breathing  so  heavily 
 [Music]
[00:05] close  your  goddamn  mouth  jeffrey  and 
 breeze  from  your  nose  does  geoffrey  not 
 realize  the  negative  consequences  of
[00:10] mouth  breathing  a  recessed  jawline  and 
 ill  health  jeffrey  needs  to  learn  how  to
[00:15] mew  adonis 
 adonis  breeds  like  a  king  through  his
[00:20] nose  deeply  his  tongue  is  pressed 
 against  the  roof  of  his  mouth  to  create 
 the  perfect  breathing  posture  this
[00:26] results  in  adonis  having  the  perfect 
 sharp  jawline  that  all  men  want  i  don't
[00:31] want  to  waste  your  time  like  most 
 youtubers  do  the  way  to  mute  properly  is 
 to  first  start  off  with  nasal  breathing
[00:36] breathing  through  your  nose  literally  24 
 7  even  when  you're  in  the  gym  and  even 
 when  you're  asleep  to  do  this  you'll
[00:42] literally  have  to  tape  your  mouth  shut 
 when  you  go  to  bed  i've  done  this  every 
 single  night  for  years  and  you  can  see 
 the  progress  of  my  jawline  because  of
[00:48] this  as  a  kid  and  teenager  i  was  always 
 a  mouth  breather  because  i  would 
 struggle  breathing  from  my  nose  i  always
[00:53] had  like  allergies  we  always  had  pets  we 
 had  hamsters  and  rabbits  and  so  i  would 
 always  have  like  a  nasally  blocked  nose
[00:59] which  made  it  hard  to  breathe  i  was  the 
 kind  of  kid  who  would  sneeze  like  10 
 times  in  her  you  know  like  most  normal
[01:04] people  literally  go  like  a  chew  when 
 they  sneeze  like  one  sneeze  maybe  two  i 
 was  the  kind  of  one  who  would  have  like
[01:10] like  10  times  everyone's  just  looking  at 
 you  weird  in  your  class  and  perhaps 
 because  of  this  mouth  breathing  and
[01:15] these  allergies  that  i  had  i  had  quite 
 weak  features  so  even  when  i  was  like  16 
 years  old  i  had  these  like  big  puffy
[01:21] childish  cheeks  weak  recessed  jawline 
 doesn't  look  sharp  at  all  i  remember 
 being  maybe  18  or  19  years  old  and
[01:27] searching  for  advice  on  youtube  like  how 
 to  make  your  jawline  better  that's  when 
 i  stumbled  upon  mewin  and  i'm  going  to
[01:32] teach  you  right  now  the  single  best 
 mindset  that's  going  to  help  you  to  go 
 forward  from  this  the  mindset  that
[01:37] really  helped  me  that  got  me  to  like  the 
 progress  that  i've  made  so  far  was 
 convincing  myself  that  this  is  the  right
[01:42] way  to  breathe  and  live  for  the  rest  of 
 my  life  so  it  doesn't  have  to  be  perfect 
 right  now  i  simply  have  to  start  making
[01:48] some  progress  using  the  concept  of 
 progressive  overload  right  now 
 understanding  that  six  months  from  now
[01:53] or  a  year  from  now  or  five  years  from 
 now  i'm  gonna  get  better  and  better  at 
 mewing  so  i  didn't  obsess  over  it  or  the
[01:59] results  that  you  know  like  a lot  of 
 people  try  and  do  these  like  mewing 
 challenges  or  anything  i  never  had  that 
 cringe  goal  of  like  90  day  mewing  that
[02:04] kind  of  [ __ ]  i  literally  just  said 
 to  myself  okay  this  is  how  i'm  gonna 
 breathe  for  the  rest  of  my  life  and  i 
 started  visualizing  myself  as  being  like
[02:10] a  nasal  breather  especially  when  i  was 
 in  the  gym  as  well  you  can  see  pictures 
 of  my  jawline  and  the  progress  that
[02:15] seems  to  have  come  from  ewing  over  the 
 years  body  fat  percentage  definitely 
 plays  a  big  part  in  like  you  know  your
[02:21] jawline  and  the  progress  pictures  that 
 i've  got  but  you  can  almost  see  that  my 
 skull  seems  to  have  been  reshaped  it
[02:27] said  that  with  mewing  it  will  cause  like 
 forward  growth  of  your  skull  and  that's 
 literally  what  it  looks  like  in  these 
 pictures  i  remember  people  from  high
[02:33] school  saying  that  i  look  so  different  i 
 left  my  hometown  looking  like  this  at 
 age  18  and  came  back  like  one  or  two
[02:39] years  later  with  almost  a  different  face 
 oh  bubba  hamza  but  hamza  this  this  might 
 not  work  for  me  it's  only  genetics  maybe
[02:46] you  know  what  i'm  not  gonna  lie  to  you 
 genetics  probably  do  play  a  part  but  is 
 there  any  progress  that  we  can  make  yes
[02:51] and  so  we  may  as  well  continue  doing 
 this  and  it's  also  the  healthier  way  to 
 live  and  breathe  so  you  may  as  well
[02:56] implement  this  advice  and  just  brainwash 
 yourself  to  believe  like  yep  this  isn't 
 genetics  and  i  can  definitely  make  a
[03:01] difference  in  my  jawline  in  the  book 
 oxygen  advantage  by  patrick  mcewen  he 
 says  that  breathing  through  your  nose  is
[03:06] the  correct  healthy  way  to  breathe  at 
 all  times  so  this  is  exactly  how  you 
 meal  with  like  no  bs  like  very  easy  to
[03:12] understand  explanation  because  a  lot  of 
 those  videos  i  watched  didn't  really 
 help  me  they  over  complicated  it  simply
[03:18] we  need  to  first  start  with  just 
 breathing  to  our  nose  so  this  is  already 
 like  progressive  overload  for  a  lot  of 
 people  close  your  mouth  breathe  your
[03:24] nose 
 you  might  be  watching  this  thinking  like 
 okay  what  the  [ __ ]  like  tell  me  how  to 
 actually  move  but  for  a  lot  of  people
[03:29] they  will  literally  just  struggle  with 
 breathing  through  their  nose  normally 
 you'll  hear  them  like
[03:34] like  making  weird  noises  like  this 
 they'll  be  struggling  they'll  get  out  of 
 breath  if  you  struggle  with  literally
[03:39] just  breathing  through  your  nose  this  is 
 like  level  one  and  you  have  to  practice 
 level  one  before  we  can  go  on  forward 
 now  try  this  close  your  mouth  and
[03:45] swallow  the  spit  that's  in  your  mouth 
 and  however  your  mouth  ends  up 
 especially  your  tongue  keep  it  like  that
[03:51] as  soon  as  you  swallow  that  spit  or 
 maybe  some  water  whatever  has  happened 
 so  you  know  your  tongue  will  be 
 automatically  pressed  at  the  roof  of
[03:57] your  mouth  this  is  the  correct  viewing 
 posture  keep  it  like  that  so  this  is  the 
 easy  cue  to  get  into  the  muting  posture
[04:06] you  swallow  and  you  keep  everything 
 there  anytime  you're  unsure  if  you're 
 mew  incorrectly  all  you  have  to  do  is 
 literally  just  swallow  your  spit  swallow
[04:12] some  water  and  you'll  automatically  be 
 in  the  correct  position  have  the 
 discipline  to  hold  that  position  of  your 
 mouth  and  especially  your  tongue  most
[04:18] people  stop  here  and  wonder  why  they 
 don't  make  much  progress  that's  because 
 they  may  be  removing  best  case  scenario
[04:23] for  half  of  the  day  if  you  really  want 
 to  speed  up  the  results  you  have  to  be 
 mewing  at  night  time  to  and  most  people
[04:28] don't  so  most  people  because  of  our 
 modern  world  because  of  like  pollution 
 and  soft  food  and  you  know  like  the
[04:33] modern  [ __ ]  that  makes  us  weak  we 
 automatically  start  mouth  breathing  at 
 night  time  this  is  gonna  sound  crazy  but
[04:38] the  way  to  mew  at  night  time  you  have  to 
 force  your  lips  closed  so  that  your  body 
 automatically  just  makes  you  breathe
[04:43] from  your  nose  so  it  does  sound  crazy 
 but  start  going  to  sleep  tape  in  your 
 mouth  the  majority  of  people  will  never
[04:49] do  this  and  they'll  complain  and  say 
 like  our  mewing  doesn't  work  but  this  is 
 the  true  way  there  is  a  certain  kind  of 
 tape  that  you  can  get  which  is  totally
[04:55] safe  to  use  that  book  that  i  mentioned 
 before  patrick  mcewen's  oxygen  advantage 
 he's  recommended  it  there  that's  where  i
[05:00] got  it  the  tape  is  called  my  [ __ ]  what's 
 it  called  micropore  tape  in  fact  let  me
[05:05] show  you  mine  here  it  is  so  it's  called 
 micropore  tape  search  it  up  on  like
[05:10] amazon  or  ebay  or  go  to  some  shops  they 
 should  just  buy  it  from  amazon  i  don't 
 have  like  an  affiliate  link  or  anything 
 but  like  just  buy  it  like  this  safe  to
[05:16] put  on  it's  very  like  thin  tape  like  you 
 can  almost  see  through  it  get  like  a 
 little  bit
[05:22] so  i  go  to  sleep  every  single  night  with 
 a  little  bit  of  tape  like  this  just  over 
 my  lips  you  can  see  like  at  first  it
[05:27] sounds  kind  of  scary  you're  like  wait 
 you're  gonna  tape  your  mouth  shut  what 
 if  you  like  suffocate  or  anything  but 
 you  can  see  when  it's  like  this  you  can
[05:33] break  free  if  you  did  need  to  like  you 
 know  actually  breathe  through  your  mouth 
 you'd  automatically  be  able  to  like  open
[05:38] it  up  no  problem 
 you  might  think  okay  well  then  that's 
 not  gonna  do  anything  that  small  bit  of
[05:44] resistance  on  your  lips  actually  causes 
 your  body  to  somehow  automatically  just
[05:49] be  okay  with  nasal  breathing  this  is  the 
 single  best  thing  that  i've  done  to  like 
 automatically  adjust  to  nasal  breathing
[05:55] and  mewing  more  often  just  keeping  my 
 mouth  up  at  night  time  it's  like  i'm 
 just  better  at  being  able  to  breathe
[06:00] from  my  nose  now  now  the  one  final  piece 
 of  advice  that  i  want  to  leave  you  with 
 is  that  it's  very  easy  to  you  know  think
[06:05] about  mewing  and  think  oh  well  it's  not 
 going  to  work  it's  not  going  to  work  for 
 me  and  i  did  have  that  mindset  for  a
[06:10] little  while  but  i  want  to  help  you 
 counter  it  with  the  power  of  belief  so 
 the  power  of  belief  the  way  you  think  is
[06:16] extremely  extremely  powerful  it's  the 
 placebo  effect  if  we  think  like  you  know
[06:22] when  you  take  like  a  pill  the  placebo 
 effect  is  that  we  could  take  a  pill  that 
 doesn't  have  any  kind  of  medication  but
[06:28] the  doctor  tells  us  it's  got  medication 
 in  and  it  will  literally  work  so 
 whatever  we  believe  ends  up  happening
[06:34] so  why  not  just  believe  for  your  benefit 
 why  not  just  say  to  yourself  you  know  if 
 you're  having  doubts  and  you're  thinking
[06:39] wait  this  isn't  gonna  work  it's  not 
 gonna  work  for  me  why  not  just  think  in 
 terms  of  your  benefit  instead  of  against
[06:44] you  why  not  just  arrogantly  think  like 
 yep  yes  it  is  it's  gonna  work  viewing  is 
 gonna  give  me  a  fantastic  jawline  it's
[06:50] gonna  improve  my  health  i'm  gonna  see 
 visible  gains  in  my  jawline  three  weeks 
 from  now  why  not  convince  yourself  of
[06:55] that  and  then  just  see  what  happens 
 because  when  when  you  add  the  power  of 
 leaf  i  know  it  sounds  kind  of
[07:00] wishy-washy  spiritual  and  stuff  and  i'm 
 not  usually  that  kind  of  guy  i'm  usually 
 like  a  very  like  practical  no  bs  telling
[07:05] me  the  facts  and  figures  and  type  of 
 [ __ ]  but  this  the  way  you  think 
 something  will  happen  what  you  expect
[07:10] will  happen  it  often  does  happen 
 visualize  mewing  working  for  you  and 
 that  you'll  live  like  this  forever
[07:16] visualize  yourself  old  and  you're 
 exercising  and  you're  still  muting  at 
 that  point  you're  literally  50  years  old
[07:21] 60  70  years  old  still  mu  and  still 
 breathing  from  your  nose  and  you're 
 actually  really  good  at  breathing  from 
 your  nose  at  that  point  whereas  everyone
[07:27] else  your  age  is  like  panting  and  their 
 mouth  breathing  like 
 just  going  up  a  flight  of  stairs  i  hope
[07:32] that  helps  you  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
