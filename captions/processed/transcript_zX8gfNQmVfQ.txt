[00:00] just  speak  to  a  Jeffrey 
 Jeffrey's  had  a  crush  on  Jessica  for  so
[00:05] long  but  he  just  can't  muster  up  the 
 courage  to  speak  to  her  he  stares  at  her 
 in  class  every  single  day  what  do  you
[00:12] think  happens  next 
 she  gets  a  boyfriend  Jeffrey's  so  upset
[00:18] he  should  have  just  talked  to  her  Adonis 
 Adonis  understands  women  just  like
[00:23] Pakistan  I'm  tired  of  you  doing  the  tax 
 one  bro  just  like  Pakistani  men  and  know 
 how  to  avoid  taxes  donnish  understands
[00:30] women  just  like  Jeffrey  understands  the 
 female  characters  on  League  of  Legends 
 obsessively  his  conversations  with  women
[00:36] are  full  of  sexual  tension  excitement 
 and  interest  I  was  in  Army  Cadets  when  I
[00:43] was  a  teenager  and  inside  you  know  you'd 
 go  for  like  training  to  train  to  be  in 
 the  Army  when  you're  14  years  old  you'd
[00:49] go  and  like  learn  how  to  like  do  knots 
 and  ties  and  stuff  there  was  a 
 particular  part  where  it  would  be  sat 
 almost  like  a  classroom  and  the
[00:54] instructor  in  front  of  us  would  be 
 teaching  us  like  the  phonetic  alphabets 
 a  for  Alpha  B  for  beta  I  couldn't  even
[01:00] focus  on  what  he  was  saying  because  my 
 eyes  were  just  glued  onto  the  girl  that 
 I  had  a  crush  on  bro  she  was  so  [ __ ]
[01:05] cute  bro  I  had  such  a  big  crush  on  this 
 girl  who  was  in  Army  Cadets  with  me  and 
 I  said  nothing  to  her  day  in  and  day  out
[01:12] every  time  like  it  was  time  to  go  to 
 Cadets  maybe  two  three  times  a  week  I 
 would  literally  just  kind  of  like  stare 
 at  her  and  I  would  do  this  which  makes
[01:18] me  so  [ __ ]  cringe  now  instead  of 
 saying  anything  I  would  literally  be  sat 
 there  in  the  classroom  room  tilted  back 
 on  my  chair  and  biting  my  pen  lid  I'll
[01:25] be  doing  this  whilst  looking  at  her
[01:30] let's  go  like  this  bro 
 and  I  had  no  [ __ ]  confidence  enough
[01:35] to  speak  to  her  I  thought  this  was  game 
 I  thought  like  I  was  maybe  14  at  the 
 time  but  I  thought  this  was  game  bro  I
[01:41] thought  I  looked  like  smooth  and  like 
 hot  as  [ __ ]  and  everything  doing  this 
 and  eventually  there's  this  big  events 
 for  Cadets  where  hundreds  of  us  from
[01:46] different  groups  different  detachments 
 go  and  like  meet  up  in  like  this  big 
 city  and  there's  like  some  big  compound
[01:51] that's  been  reserved  for  us  and  it's 
 like  this  organized  thing  where  there's 
 gonna  be  like  a  big  dance  like  a  ball  at 
 the  end  that  we've  all  got  like  suits
[01:57] and  dresses  for  and  everything  and  I 
 remember  one  of  our  instructors  one  of 
 like  the  sort  of  female  sort  of  more
[02:02] senior  girls  who  were  still  like  you 
 know  quite  young  she  randomly  just  asked 
 me  once  like  oh  Hamza  look  would  you  go 
 to  the  dance  with  her
[02:07] um  yeah  yeah  of  course  I  would  yeah  what 
 happened  was  that  she  had  the  other  girl
[02:12] that  I  like  she  had  like  no  one  else  to 
 go  with  and  you  know  I'm  last  place  but 
 yeah  it's  fine  bro  like  if  she's  stuck 
 with  me  it's  fine  a  day  into  this  sort
[02:18] of  big  event  she  just  kind  of  like  in 
 front  of  everyone  kind  of  says  that  she 
 has  a  crush  on  someone  else  and  that  she
[02:23] wants  to  go  out  with  him  and  even  one  of 
 like  my  friends  there  as  well  said  oh 
 but  what  about  hamster  like  he  said  you
[02:28] know  you  should  go  out  you  should  go 
 with  Amazon  and  she's  like  yeah  yeah  and 
 I  was  like  oh  no  don't  worry  about  me
[02:33] like  should  go  you  should  go  with  that 
 guy 
 oh  man  maybe  your  father  or  your  uncle
[02:39] hasn't  told  you  this  just  yet  but 
 fortune  favors  the  Bold  you  can't  be  shy 
 around  women  you  need  to  grab  whatever
[02:45] confidence  you  have  whatever  level  of 
 Courage  that  you  have  and  just  take 
 action  and  say  something  and  be  honest
[02:50] that  you  like  this  girl  being  shy  and 
 being  you  know  taking  your  time  with  it 
 it  makes  you  just  seem  less  attractive
[02:55] and  I  know  what  you're  thinking  and  you 
 could  probably  relate  to  you  know  my 
 story  but  I  don't  know  but  you  know  it 
 doesn't  feel  right  and  it's  not  the
[03:00] right  time  I'm  gonna  wait  for  the  right 
 time  to  say  something  but  the  thing  is 
 when  you're  like  a  certain  level  of  guy 
 when  you  don't  have  that  much  of
[03:05] experience  with  girls  or  you're  not  that 
 confident  you're  always  gonna  feel  this 
 level  of  resistance  before  you're  about
[03:10] to  like  speak  to  a  girl  and  tell  her 
 that  you  like  her  courage  is  when  you 
 feel  that  feeling  of  fear  but  you  do  the
[03:16] thing  anyway  you  have  to  understand  that 
 you  have  inside  of  you  this  emotion 
 that's  telling  you  like  oh  no  but  it's 
 going  to  be  scary  if  we  talk  to  her  but
[03:22] you  can  do  the  action  even  if  you  feel 
 this  emotion  you  don't  need  to  feel 
 absolutely  fine  to  go  speak  to  her  you
[03:29] just  need  to  do  the  action  no  matter 
 what  you're  feeling  girls  are  attracted 
 to  like  courageous  confident  guys  who
[03:34] even  if  they're  experiencing  some  kind 
 kind  of  negative  fearful  emotion  do  the 
 hard  work  anyway  and  you  might  be
[03:40] thinking  I'm  scared  of  rejection  well 
 yeah  of  course  you  are  rejection  is  like 
 a  totally  scary  thing  but  only  really
[03:46] for  the  first  50  rejections  of  your  life 
 by  now  you  watching  this  you  probably 
 experience  rejection  maybe  10  times  in
[03:52] your  entire  life  maybe  20  times 
 obviously  online  texting  [ __ ]  like  you 
 know  some  girl  that  you've  never  even
[03:57] met  before  on  Tinder  or  something  stops 
 replying  to  your  message  that  doesn't 
 count  but  like  a  real  rejection  of  you 
 walking  up  to  a  girl  saying  something  in
[04:03] the  sense  that  you  like  her  and  then  her 
 saying  oh  no  sorry  I've  got  a  boyfriend 
 most  young  guys  have  only  been  rejected 
 like  three  times  and  it  hurts  so
[04:09] significantly  but  the  pain  of  rejection 
 starts  up  here  and  it  goes  down 
 dramatically  with  every  single  one  that
[04:14] you  get  and  I  promise  you  that  any  of 
 the  guys  who  are  slightly  older  than  you 
 who  are  quite  experienced  with  women  and 
 you  know  who  get  like  quite  a  lot  of
[04:20] girls  have  been  rejected  by  10  times  as 
 many  as  you  can  think  honestly  I  may 
 have  been  rejected  by  probably  close  to
[04:26] 300  400  500  somewhere  around  that  range 
 in  person  in  person  and  that's  not  even
[04:31] including  like  the  random  times  like 
 some  girl  on  Instagram  or  Tinder  that 
 like  doesn't  reply  to  your  message  to  be 
 good  with  girls  honestly  a  lot  of  it's
[04:37] just  quantity  it's  just  a  lot  of 
 practice  how  is  it  that  girls  actually 
 want  you  to  talk  to  them  they  just  want
[04:42] you  to  like  be  honest  and  upfront  with 
 what  you  actually  want  from  us  so  many 
 guys  especially  the  younger  guys  who
[04:47] don't  have  much  confidence  like  you  go 
 about  it  in  this  like  just  this  [ __ ] 
 kind  of  way  where  you  just  kind  of  act 
 like  you  don't  really  like  her  for  what
[04:53] for  what  reason  what  gain  is  there  for 
 you  to  pretend  that  you  don't  really 
 like  it  and  that  you've  got  no  interest 
 in  it  you  know  there's  the  kind  of  cool
[04:59] Chad  looking  guy  who  doesn't  act  but 
 just  that  isn't  really  that  interested 
 in  her  and  that's  kind  of  attractive  but
[05:04] when  it's  inauthentic  when  you  are 
 actually  obsessively  thinking  about  this 
 girl  and  you  try  and  act  too  cool  and
[05:09] like  pretend  like  oh  I'm  not  gonna  speak 
 to  her  like  I'm  gonna  wait  till  the 
 right  time  it's  not  attractive  bro  and 
 the  reason  why  we  do  that  the  reason  why
[05:15] we  don't  go  and  speak  to  these  girls  is 
 because  we're  just  scared  of  rejection 
 because  we're  scared  of  like  the  bad 
 thing  that  could  happen  because  we  feel
[05:20] quite  fearful  you  can't  be  scared  of 
 rejection  because  regret  hurts  more  than 
 rejection  not  speaking  to  that  girl  that
[05:26] you  randomly  see  that  one  time  that  you 
 could  have  called  approach  hurts  more 
 than  you  just  going  up  to  speak  to  her 
 and  her  just  saying  oh  sorry  I've  got  a
[05:32] boyfriend  so  what  should  you  actually 
 say  when  you're  next  to  a  girl  that  you 
 probably  we  already  know  the  advice  oh
[05:37] you  should  ask  questions  and  you  should 
 be  interested  in  them  that  advice  is 
 like  really  basic  and  the  guys  who
[05:42] follow  it  end  up  feeling  that  they're  in 
 an  interview  with  the  girl  and  you 
 probably  felt  this  too  you've  probably 
 felt  that  you've  been  in  this  one-sided
[05:47] conversation  where  you're  asking  her 
 questions  and  she's  answering  and  it 
 just  feels  like  an  interview  maybe  she's
[05:52] asking  you  the  question  out  of  like 
 politeness  you  say  like  oh  what's  your 
 favorite  type  of  music  and  she  says  oh 
 yeah  like  drum  and  bass  what's  your
[05:58] favorite  type  of  music  yeah  well  I 
 really  like  90s  bro  and  the  conversation 
 you  know  for  a  fact  is  not  the  kind  of
[06:04] one  that  she's  having  with  Chad  so  what 
 conversation  are  these  girls  actually 
 having  which  sexually  excites  them  and
[06:09] it's  definitely  not  the  kind  of  one  that 
 you're  having  which  just  feels  like  an 
 interview  this  is  exactly  what  you  do
[06:14] instead  of  asking  questions  and  making 
 your  conversation  with  her  kind  of  like 
 an  interview  you  instead  tease  her
[06:19] teasing  a  girl  is  far  far  more  enjoyable 
 than  going  through  like  this  dry  boring
[06:25] ass  interview  questions  about  what  kind 
 of  music  do  you  like  you  tease  her  in 
 almost  like  a  slightly  mocking  tone  with 
 like  a  slight  insult  you  don't  want  to
[06:31] just  tease  her  by  saying  oh  yeah  you're 
 a  fat  [ __ ]  some  [ __ ]  but  you  want  to 
 tease  her  in  a  way  that's  quite  clear
[06:36] really  like  not  true  so  it's  not  going 
 to  hurt  her  feelings  for  example  with  my 
 girl  now  that  I'm  dating  for  our  first
[06:41] date  we  sat  in  a  cafe  together  and  we 
 both  had  like  a  hot  drink  and  we  were  in 
 Thailand  right  so  we  met  in  Thailand 
 she's  wearing  like  this  beautiful  black
[06:47] dress  and  this  one  Cafe  was  pretty  warm 
 so  she  started  to  sweat  as  you  know  it's 
 normal  to  do  in  Thailand  and  I  just
[06:52] started  making  fun  of  her  for  sweating  I 
 was  oh  you  did  squat  in  the  in  the 
 bathroom  like  to  warm  up  before  he  comes 
 speaking  to  me  and  stuff  and  you  know
[06:57] she  had  like  a  bit  of  sweat  and  wiping 
 it  off  her  and  said  oh  you're  so  sweet 
 you  know  just  teasing  around  with  that 
 that  made  our  conversation  flow  so  well
[07:04] to  the  point  that  I  was  leaving  Thailand 
 that  same  day  by  the  way that  was  my 
 last  day  on  Thailand  I  literally  just 
 had  like  a  last  minute  date  with  this
[07:09] girl  it  was  so  good  she  was  meant  to 
 stay  in  Thailand  with  a  brother  for  like 
 months  in  the  future  we  had  such  a  good
[07:14] time  together  on  that  day  that  she 
 literally  left  her  travels  early  came 
 back  to  the  UK  to  be  with  me  so  I  made
[07:20] such  a  great  impression  on  our  first 
 date  because  I  focus  entirely  on  this 
 kind  of  teasing  light-hearted  Vibe  is
[07:25] Sexual  Energy  before  getting  into  the 
 more  sort  of  serious  conversation  oh 
 [ __ ]  me  holy  [ __ ]  bro  when  I  was  in
[07:30] university  I  was  a  [ __ ]  boy  right  I  was 
 good  at  sleeping  with  girls  from  like 
 Tinder  and  clubs  and  everything  and  me
[07:35] and  my  one  friend  Levi  we  went  out  onto 
 this  club  night  inside  the  club  you  know 
 we  kissed  girls  and  stuff  but  none  of
[07:40] the  girls  like  were  coming  out  with  us 
 but  we  leave  the  club  we're  about  to  go 
 home  we've  got  an  Uber  and  we  see  these 
 two  like  cute  looking  like  bro  sexy
[07:46] looking  girls  like  hot  looking  girls  it 
 was  very  interesting  because  the  two 
 girls  we  saw  were  like  exactly  our  type
[07:51] so  we  go  up  and  start  spitting  game  to 
 these  girls  and  we  start  telling  them  oh 
 you're  not  coming  to  Aruba  come  back  to 
 our  place  and  everything  we  all  have
[07:56] like  music  we  got  drinks  and  everything 
 and  the  girls  are  weighing  it  up  now 
 yeah  go  on  the  girls  are  vibing  us  right 
 so  we  bring  both  girls  back  to  our
[08:02] apartments  and  I  started  kissing  my 
 girlfriend  with  a  black  haired  girl  and 
 I  bring  her  into  my  room  and  out  of 
 nowhere  bro  the  other  girl  walks  in  just
[08:09] kind  of  like  not  interested  she  walks  in 
 stops  me  and  my  girl  and  kind  of  tells 
 my  girl  come  on  Luke  we're  going  I'm
[08:15] like  what  the  [ __ ]  so  what  you  know  like 
 why  is  my  friend  not  held  it  down  come 
 on  bro  just  take  care  of  your  girl  for 
 like  another  five  minutes  bro  all  I
[08:21] needed  was  five  minutes  bro  he  sat  there 
 on  his  bed  just  looking  defeated  on  my 
 bro  what  the  [ __ ]  all  you  have  to  do  was 
 just  like  keep  her  busy  like  if  you're
[08:26] not  gonna  [ __ ]  fine  but  like  I  was 
 about  to  bro  what  the  [ __ ]  like  why  is 
 your  girl  coming  to  my  room  and 
 interrupted  me  and  taking  her  away  and
[08:32] they  just  went  home  now  and  he  just 
 looks  at  me  he's  like  oh  bro  I've  got  no 
 [ __ ]  game  like  he  usually  is  kind  of
[08:38] a  smooth  guy  but  this  is  literally  what 
 happened  this  guy  brings  his  girl  into 
 his  room  and  they  sit  there  with  like
[08:43] the  bright  light  on  no  music  playing  or 
 anything  they  just  sat  there  at  the  edge 
 of  his  bed  and  he's  just  asking  her
[08:48] interview  questions  so  like  uh  what  kind 
 of  music  do  you  like
[08:53] come  around  some  of  his  girl  just  got 
 bored  with  the  conversation  literally 
 stood  up  left  him  came  inside  my  room 
 just  said  oh  yeah  come  on  we're  leaving
[08:58] you  can't  be  asking  girls  these  boring 
 ass  questions  I  know  that  sort  of
[09:03] conventional  advice  tells  you  that  you 
 should  take  an  interest  in  the  girl  and 
 you  should  ask  her  about  her  Hobbies  bro 
 girls  don't  want  to  speak  about  their
[09:08] Hobbies  that's  boring  as  [ __ ]  they  want 
 you  to  tease  them  to  have  like  a  little 
 bit  of  playful  banter  to  like  play
[09:14] wrestle  with  each  other  they  want  you  to 
 speak  about  like  your  work  which  you're 
 extremely  passionate  and  ambitious  about 
 do  you  want  to  know  one  of  the  single
[09:20] conversations  that  I've  had  which  has 
 increased  a  girl's  attraction  to  me  to 
 the  sky  limit  is  with  this  girl  when  I
[09:25] told  her  about  my  plans  for  YouTube  with 
 my  leadership  of  this  movement  and  I 
 looked  her  in  the  eyes  and  said  that  I'm 
 going  to  the  top
[09:30] do  you  want  to  join  me  imagine  how 
 [ __ ]  interesting  how  emotional  that
[09:35] makes  a  woman  feel  when  you  speak  to  her 
 in  a  certain  way  well  you  don't  just  ask 
 these  little  like  you  know  silly 
 questions  like  oh  did  you  do  the
[09:41] homework  today  what's  your  music  typo 
 like  just  this  like  little  weak  ass  bait 
 of  mail  sorry  boy  kind  of  like
[09:46] conversations  and  instead  you  speak  to 
 her  like  a  man  and  a  man  either  speaks 
 to  a  woman  with  like  so  much  ambition
[09:51] and  tells  her  yes  like  I'm  gonna  make  it 
 I'm  gonna  I'm  gonna  be  so  successful  or 
 he  speaks  to  her  like  he's  almost  like
[09:56] playing  around  with  her  and  he's  just 
 kind  of  like  laughing  around  with  it 
 he's  teasing  her  and  stuff  he  doesn't 
 take  us  too  seriously  honestly  most  of
[10:02] the  conversations  that  I  have  with  my 
 girl  it's  just  me  just  teasing  her  and 
 that  like  I  see  her  so  bubbly  so  like 
 goofy  so  like  laughing  with  me  am  I
[10:08] pushing  her  onto  the  bed  and  everything 
 and  they  like  that  stuff  they  don't  want
