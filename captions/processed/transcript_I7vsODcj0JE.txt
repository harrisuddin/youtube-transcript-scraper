 self-improvements  right  Jessica's  just

 Adonis 
 Adonis  is  at  work  serving  more  customers
[00:21] in  his  business  and  his  phone  vibrates 
 it's  Anastasia  but  Adonis  doesn't  even 
 hear  it  his  phone  isn't  even  on  him  once
[00:28] he's  completed  two  90-minute  deep  work 
 sessions  he  goes  to  the  gym  first  and 
 then  he  sees  the  text  from  Anastasia  he
[00:35] smiles  what  a  great  woman  ask  yourself 
 this  question  and  really  be  honest  are 
 you  ready  for  a  relationship  if  you  are
[00:41] then  now  is  the  time  to  really  think 
 about  the  character  and  the  traits  of 
 the  girl  that  you  want  to  date  but  you
[00:47] should  also  just  take  some  time  to  think 
 of  the  negative  things  that  you  don't 
 want  in  a  relationship  so  he  has  nine
[00:52] red  flags  that  I  can  think  of  that  you 
 might  just  want  to  consider  number  one 
 if  she  doesn't  believe  in  your  work  a
[00:58] masculine  man  experiences  Freedom 
 through  his  work  and  when  you  get  those 
 things  and  you  especially  become  more
[01:03] masculine  it  becomes  so  important  to 
 have  a  feminine  Woman  by  your  side  who 
 believes  in  your  work  if  you  are  with  a
[01:09] girl  right  now  who  doesn't  really  care 
 about  the  thing  that  you  do  your  work 
 your  studies  that  big  goal  that  you  have
[01:14] you  might  not  be  that  compatible  you 
 want  her  to  be  your  number  one  biggest 
 fan  and  you  want  her  to  be  your
[01:20] cheerleader  if  she  doesn't  really  care 
 or  take  much  of  an  interest  in  your  work 
 you  might  just  want  to  evaluate  some
[01:25] things  the  second  red  flag  that  I  am 
 sure  literally  100  of  guys  and  even 
 girls  would  agree  on  is  your  partner
[01:31] being  addicted  to  social  media  now  we 
 know  the  dangers  of  social  media  we  know
[01:36] that  it  literally  just  [ __ ]  up  a 
 person's  mental  health  but  it  will  also 
 create  a  huge  negative  impact  on  your
[01:42] relationship  because  when  she  is  on 
 social  media  when  she's  Snapchatting 
 some  random  people  and  some  of  them  are
[01:47] guys  when  she's  following  50  100  200 
 attractive  guys  on  Instagram  and  she's 
 seen  all  these  like  fitness  models  she
[01:53] can't  help  but  compare  you  to  them  and 
 100  We  should  strive  for  competition  we 
 should  you  know  keep  working  on
[01:58] ourselves  but  social  media  starts  to 
 create  like  this  unfair  comparison  you
[02:03] know  that  Grass  Is  Always  Greener  you 
 don't  want  a  girl  who's  just  constantly 
 looking  at  guys  who  are  more  attractive
[02:08] than  you  more  successful  than  you  guys 
 that  she  can't  really  even  get  anyway 
 but  her  brain  just  can't  help  looking  at
[02:14] you  and  just  comparing  you  to  like  the 
 the  tick  tock  boy  that  she's  following 
 or  the  guy  that  like  she  says  it's  just
[02:19] a  friend  on  Snapchat  I  think  social 
 media  breeds  just  the  worst  kind  of  like 
 person  and  at  least  for  me  you  may  want
[02:26] to  implement  this  or  maybe  not  this  is 
 an  iron  rule  for  me  that  the  girl  that  I 
 date  has  no  social  media  presence  she
[02:32] can  have  a  very  limited  private  account 
 on  Instagram  or  on  Facebook  or  you  know
[02:37] WhatsApp  is  fine  obviously  but  she  is 
 not  having  like  some  kind  of  public 
 Instagram  page  where  random  people  can
[02:42] follow  her  and  see  her  pictures  she's 
 not  having  like  a  [ __ ]  Snapchat  or 
 especially  not  you  can  say  this  is  crazy 
 or  whatever  but  she's  not  having  Tick
[02:48] Tock  downloaded  on  a  phone  that  is  like 
 an  absolute  like  if  my  girl  downloaded 
 tiktok  and  refused  to  like  delete  it  if
[02:53] you  know  I  I  sold  it  like  wait  that's 
 weird  you  can't  like  you  shouldn't  have 
 that  and  she  refused  I  would  break  up
[02:58] with  her  on  the  spot  that's  how  serious 
 I  am  about  social  media  and  I  know  a  lot 
 of  people  think  I'm  crazy  but  once
[03:03] you've  done  a  little  bit  more  research 
 into  these  social  media  apps  and  how 
 they  [ __ ]  up  a  person's  mental  health
[03:08] they  just  [ __ ]  the  entire  person's  mind 
 as  you  become  more  of  like  a  prominent 
 successful  man  you  start  to  have  like  a
[03:14] zero  tolerance  for  anything  that  starts 
 to  like  strip  your  data  away  from  you 
 maybe  you're  not  at  that  point  just  yet
[03:19] but  like  hopefully  you  can  kind  of  you 
 know  learn  from  me  in  this  sense  just 
 know  that  as  you  become  more  successful 
 you  become  very  very  exclusive  with  the
[03:26] apps  that  you  download  because  you  don't 
 want  your  data  being  stolen  I  have  a 
 friend  who's  younger  than  me  and  is 
 worth  literally  more  than  10  million
[03:32] dollars  and  I  have  to  give  props  to  Iman 
 because  he's  teaching  this  kind  of  like 
 knowledge  on  how  to  become  more
[03:37] masculine  how  to  make  more  money  for 
 free  and  I'm  even  gonna  join  him  in  an 
 event  like  the  first  time  I'm  doing  like
[03:42] a  guest  speaking  collaboration  it's  the 
 top  Link  in  the  description  you'll  learn 
 how  to  become  more  free  become  more
[03:47] masculine  and  to  make  more  money  and  I 
 think  a  huge  element  of  why 
 relationships  and  dating  seem  so  [ __ ]
[03:52] in  this  modern  day  is  mostly  because  of 
 social  media  and  so  if  you're  dating  a 
 girl  and  to  her  it's  like  crazy  that
[03:57] you'd  even  suggest  that  deletes  it  she's 
 almost  voluntarily  harming  your 
 relationship  just  for  the  dopamine  that
[04:03] she  can  get  from  this  now  she's  not  a 
 bad  person  for  this  honestly  she's  not  a 
 bad  person  she's  just  an  addict  and  I
[04:08] know  that  sounds  like  an  insult  but  it 
 is  the  case  she  is  literally  just  an 
 addict  who  doesn't  realize  how  bad  that
[04:13] thing  is  for  the  relationship  just  the 
 same  as  an  alcoholic  who  can't  stop 
 drinking  it's  the  exact  same  effect  and
[04:19] I'm  spending  so  long  on  this  second  red 
 flag  just  because  this  is  I  think  is  the
[04:24] single  worst  one  that  you  could  have  in 
 a  girl  that  you're  dating  I  I  think  that 
 this  is  something  that  is  worth  you
[04:29] putting  your  foot  down  and  actually 
 having  like  a  just  a  golden  rule  that 
 you  follow  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 that  you  will  not  date  any  girl  who's
[04:35] addicted  to  social  media  perhaps  you  can 
 have  an  account  perhaps  that's  fine  but 
 she  cannot  be  a  girl  who's  on  it  for
[04:40] more  than  an  hour  a  day  red  flag  number 
 three  she's  not  grateful  now  gratitude 
 is  an  amazing  life-changing  skill  that
[04:47] we  can  all  level  up  we  can  express  more 
 gratitude  we  can  take  time  to  for 
 example  journal  the  things  that  we're
[04:52] grateful  for  or  we  can  write  letters  of 
 gratitude  and  that's  an  amazing  thing  to 
 have  in  a  relationship  you  want  your
[04:58] girl  to  feel  grateful  for  you  for  her 
 family  for  everything  around  her  for  the 
 smallest  things  for  you  know  the
[05:04] waitress  or  the  waiter  that  comes  and 
 serves  you  guys  in  a  restaurant  you 
 don't  want  her  to  be  ungrateful  now  she
[05:09] doesn't  have  to  be  extremely  you  know 
 like  weirdly  randomly  grateful  fine  but 
 you  don't  want  her  to  be  an  ungrateful 
 person  you  don't  want  her  to  be  entitled
[05:15] because  when  someone  is  entitled  man  or 
 woman  it  does  start  to  just  destroy 
 elements  of  the  relationship  Dale
[05:21] Carnegie  is  one  of  the  most  important 
 self-improvements  writers  like  self-help 
 writers  and  he  said  before  that  like
[05:26] praise  and  encouragement  are  just 
 vitally  needed  in  relationships  praise
[05:31] is  kind  of  like  oxygen  for  plants  he 
 gave  an  analogy  like  that  which
[05:36] essentially  insinuated  like  praise  is 
 absolutely  essential  for  cultivating
[05:41] good  relationships  and  so  you  want  the 
 girl  that  you're  dating  to  be  able  to 
 feel  grateful  for  the  things  that  you  do
[05:46] with  her  and  for  her  red  flag  number 
 four  I'm  gonna  get  a  little  bit  more 
 controversial  with  these  ones  now
[05:51] because  I  could  create  like  a  very 
 politically  correct  video  and  it 
 probably  it  would  get  more  views  and 
 more  people  would  like  me  if  I  just  told
[05:57] you  like  you  know  the  basic  advice  but 
 I'm  going  to  start  to  get  into  the  real 
 controversial  stuff  which  a  lot  of 
 people  won't  actually  speak  to  you  about
[06:03] but  I'm  going  to  speak  to  you  as  if 
 you're  just  my  little  bro  and  I'm  going 
 to  tell  you  like  if  you  told  me  that  you 
 like  this  girl  and  that  you're  starting
[06:08] to  date  her  seriously  and  you  showed  me 
 a  picture  of  her  for  example  I  will  tell 
 you  the  truth  it  is  a  red  flag  when  a
[06:14] girl  has  colorful  hair  and  lots  and  lots 
 of  piercings  this  is  controversial  as 
 [ __ ]  because  seems  like  wait  why  is  that
[06:19] a  red  flag  generally  a  woman  dying  her 
 hair  to  these  like  abnormal  hair  colors 
 like  red  or  blue  or  pink  and  also  having
[06:26] like  a  bunch  of  piercings  that  kind  of 
 action  correlates  a  lot  with  her  being 
 more  promiscuous  that  should  be  a  red
[06:32] flag  in  itself  to  be  honest  I'm  not 
 gonna  lie  to  it  is  a  woman  who's 
 promiscuous  a  woman  who  has  slept  around 
 it  and  sort  of  like  dated  a  lot  of  guys
[06:38] that  is  the  single  greatest  red  flag  for 
 the  overwhelming  majority  of  men  who 
 have  the  confidence  to  admit  it  to
[06:44] themselves  but  we're  not  really  allowed 
 to  speak  about  this  now  women  are 
 allowed  to  say  this  about  us  women  are 
 allowed  to  say  like  oh  if  he's  a  [ __ ]
[06:50] boy  you  know  if  he  [ __ ]  lots  of  girls 
 I'm  not  interested  fair  enough  and 
 they're  you  know  fair  enough  if  you're 
 not  attracted  to  a  kind  of  like  I'm
[06:55] saying  this  to  a  woman  if  she's  not 
 attracted  to  the  guy  who's  sleeping 
 around  yeah  fair  enough  okay  you're 
 empowered  to  have  that  decision  then  we
[07:00] should  also  be  empowered  to  know  that 
 the  majority  of  guys  can't  really  take  a
[07:06] girl  seriously  when  she  has  had  a 
 promiscuous  past  which  sucks  because 
 it's  in  her  past  maybe  she's  changed  but
[07:11] if  she  slept  around  with  a  bunch  of  guys 
 if  she's  like  been  [ __ ]  by  like  some 
 guys  that  you  know  or  if  she's  got  like
[07:17] a  bit  of  a  reputation  about  her  if  she's 
 done  some  like  very  degenerate  thing 
 like  [ __ ]  two  different  guys  in  the
[07:23] same  day  it  was  you  know  just  something 
 like  that  which  like  gives  you  a  gut 
 punching  feeling  if  like  I  know  this
[07:28] video  is  getting  all  muddled  up  but  like 
 you  can  see  this  is  the  point  which  we 
 really  need  to  talk  about  most  of  the
[07:33] biggest  worst  red  flags  in  women  really 
 do  come  down  to  her  sexual  history  and
[07:39] like  the  actions  that  she's  been  which 
 relate  to  that  so  red  flag  number  four 
 was  like  piercings  and  tattoos  but  we'll
[07:44] just  move  on  to  Red  Flag  number  five 
 which  is  promiscuity  sexual  history 
 sexual  past  and  like  just  specifically
[07:50] like  we're  not  we're  not  shaming  them  we 
 are  not  shaming  them  we're  not  saying 
 that  they're  bad  people  we're  just
[07:55] saying  that  at  least  you  know  for  me  and 
 potentially  for  you  because  we  seem  to 
 be  kind  of  similar  it's  just  not
[08:00] something  that  we  can  find  acceptable  in 
 a  relationship  it's  just  not  something 
 that  makes  us  feel  good  it  is  something
[08:06] that  makes  us  feel  bad  some  people  might 
 say  that  we're  insecure  for  this  we're 
 insecure  or  we've  got  like  small  dick
[08:11] energy  on  they'll  try  and  shame  us  for 
 having  this  opinion  but  it  is  kind  of 
 like  a  universal  feeling  for  just  men  to
[08:17] feel  a  little  bit  like  just 
 reports  disgusted  whenever  you  hear  like
[08:22] your  girl's  sexual  history  now  I'm  not 
 talking  about  some  random  girl  that  you 
 know  you  just  want  to  [ __ ]  as  well  I'm 
 not  talking  about  that  I'm  talking  about
[08:27] a  girl  that  you  really  want  to  fall  in 
 love  with  and  have  children  with  and  you 
 know  you  want  to  take  Serious  it  [ __ ]
[08:32] hurts  bro  because  when  I  was  19  and  I 
 got  into  my  first  ever  serious 
 relationship  for  girl  I  lost  my
[08:37] virginity  to  she  was  four  years  older 
 than  me  she  was  23.  so  I'm  19.  she's  23. 
 I'm  literally  doing  the  sexual  stuff  for
[08:43] the  first  time  ever  and  she  wasn't  she'd 
 had  from  what  I  remember  two  boyfriends 
 before  me  and  also  she  said  two  hookups
[08:49] as  well  so  two  boyfriends  two  hookups 
 she  had  a  body  count  of  four  at  23  which 
 isn't  bad  at  all  honestly  that's 
 actually  like  on  the  low  end  four  guys
[08:55] that  she  had  slept  with  at  age  23  and 
 you  know  what  was  very  interesting  which 
 I  think  will  explain  to  us  that  this  is
[09:00] not  insecurity  I  never  once  felt 
 negative  about  the  two  boyfriends  that 
 she  had  had  before  me  and  obviously  she
[09:06] would  have  like  slept  with  them  I  never 
 really  thought  about  those  guys  honestly 
 it  never  like  played  on  my  mind  but  I'm
[09:12] gonna  tell  you  the  truth  which  might  you 
 know  make  someone  laugh  at  me  knowing 
 that  my  first  ever  girlfriend  who  I  lost
[09:17] my  virginity  to  who  you  know  was  my 
 every  when  I  was  19  years  old  knowing 
 that  she  had  had  two  hookups  before  me
[09:22] two  guys  that  shadow  one  night  stand 
 with  two  guys  that  had  [ __ ]  her 
 without  even  like  knowing  her  much  that
[09:27] broke  my  [ __ ]  heart  that  really  gave 
 me  like  a  gut  punch  feeling  that 
 whenever  I  would  think  about  it  and  I
[09:32] would  think  about  it  often  I  would  be  in 
 pain  and  when  I  did  hear  about  this  like 
 I  could  never  like  look  at  her  the  same
[09:39] way  and  I  don't  think  it's  insecurity 
 because  I  didn't  feel  that  way  about  her 
 previous  boyfriends  that's  the  thing 
 it's  like  if  a  girl  has  gotten  into  like
[09:45] a  very  serious  loving  relationship  and 
 then  it  doesn't  work  out  and  obviously 
 she  had  sex  with  a  guy  it's  like  if  for
[09:50] some  reason  that  doesn't  like  hurt  us 
 anywhere  near  as  much  as  just  like 
 visualizing  your  girl  like  getting
[09:55] dressed  up  with  her  friends  shaving  and 
 then  going  out  to  like  get  [ __ ]  by 
 some  random  guy  that  she  didn't  even
[10:01] like  like  and  uh  to  then  just  like  do 
 the  [ __ ]  what  you  know  the  like  the  sort 
 of  Walk  of  Shame  home  I'm  not  saying
[10:07] that  you  know  she's  be  shameful  but  like 
 that  hurts  us  a  lot  more  than  we  think 
 that  she  just  replied  to  some  random 
 guys  DMS  and  he  [ __ ]  her  the  same
[10:13] night  that  hurts  us  a  lot  more  than 
 thinking  that  she  just  had  a  boyfriend 
 before  us  then  red  flag  number  six  and
[10:18] this  is  a  very  personal  one  for  me  but  I 
 think  again  a  lot  of  guys  could  relate 
 and  it's  very  similar  to  what  we've  just 
 discussed  and  this  is  also  one  that  a
[10:24] lot  of  girls  hate  me  for  and  this  red 
 flag  is  that  she  has  promiscuous  friends 
 so  I've  spoke  about  this  before  and  I've
[10:30] received  quite  a  lot  of  like  hate 
 comments  saying  like  oh  how  can  you 
 judge  her  on  you  know  some  other  people 
 how  is  like  the  people  that  is  in  her
[10:35] life  that's  not  her  fault  but  like  it  is 
 you  know  me  and  you  we  hold  ourselves 
 accountable  and  we  say  to  each  other  we
[10:40] are  the  average  of  the  five  people  that 
 we  spend  time  with  we  say  that  phrase  to 
 ourselves  don't  we  go  the  average  of  the
[10:45] people  that  you  spend  time  with  and  so 
 if  I  can  criticize  you  like  the  young 
 man  watching  this  if  I  can  criticize  you
[10:50] for  being  friends  with  some  loser  who's 
 kind  of  dragging  you  down  and  you  know 
 we  should  of  course  try  to  bring  our
[10:56] friends  up  but  let's  say  this  guy  is 
 like  totally  fine  with  being  a  Jeffrey 
 he's  unambitious  he  doesn't  even  care 
 he's  like  being  mean  to  you  and
[11:01] everything  he's  like  roasting  you  if  you 
 keep  being  friends  with  him  the  thing  is 
 like  I  am  somewhat  allowed  to  like  view
[11:07] you  a  bit  negative  for  that  because  I'm 
 thinking  okay  his  friends  you  know  your 
 friend  is  a  Jeffrey  but  then  if  you're
[11:12] still  really  good  friends  with  him  then 
 you're  probably  a  bit  of  a  Jeffrey  too 
 you  have  to  be  right  well  your  girl  can 
 seem  like  a  really  good  girl  to  you  but
[11:19] if  you  can  see  the  behaviors  of  her 
 friends  and  her  friends  are  really 
 [ __ ]  and  they're  on  like  Tinder  and 
 they're  going  out  and  hooking  up  with  a
[11:25] bunch  of  guys  the  thing  is  that  your 
 girl  to  be  friends  with  that  kind  of 
 person  has  to  have  some  things  in
[11:30] similarity  she  has  to  be  somewhat 
 similar  to  that  and  you  best  believe 
 that  her  promiscuous  friends  are  gonna
[11:36] encourage  her  to  be  more  promiscuous 
 it's  just  how  it  works  and  so  we  are 
 very  like  judged  on  this  and  I  really
[11:41] don't  want  to  come  across  as  some  guy 
 who  like  hates  women  or  anything  but 
 like  this  is  something  that  is  very  like
[11:46] core  to  me  because  I  am  very  like 
 authentic  with  the  way  that  I  feel
[11:51] around  women  and  I  used  to  hide  that  a 
 long  time  ago  with  that  same  girl  that  I 
 dated  like  it  broke  my  heart  and  it  gave
[11:56] me  this  this  gut  pain  like  this  [ __ ] 
 pain  this  lump  in  my  throat  when  I'd
[12:01] heard  these  details  about  the  first  girl 
 that  I  dated  at  age  19  but  I  kept  it  to 
 myself  because  I  didn't  want  to  come
[12:06] across  as  like  you  know  insecure  or  you 
 know  hurts  I  wanted  to  like  be  really 
 stoic  I  was  never  able  to  express  these
[12:11] emotions  and  like  my  friends  didn't 
 understand  or  anything  I've  got  to  this 
 level  of  development  and  like  confidence
[12:16] and  you  know  Independence  in  myself  now 
 where  like  if  I  feel  a  level  of  like 
 repulsed  to  a  girl  because  I  do  not  hear
[12:22] something  of  a  past  or  I  see  that  her 
 friends  are  like  quite  low  quality 
 people  who  you  know  taking  drugs  or
[12:28] something  then  like  I  hold  that  true 
 does  that  make  sense  like  I  stay 
 authentic  to  this  feeling  I  don't  push 
 it  down  because  some  other  people  tell
[12:34] me  that  I'm  being  like  sexist  about  it 
 because  if  that's  how  I  feel  then  that 
 is  clearly  a  part  of  my  values  and  we
[12:39] should  always  stick  to  our  values  and  so 
 the  sixth  red  flag  is  such  a 
 controversial  one  because  you  must  know
[12:45] that  if  she  has  friends  who  sleep  around 
 or  do  some  kind  of  activity  that  you 
 really  don't  like  like  it  is  going  to  be
[12:51] influencing  your  girl  now  chances  are  if 
 your  girl  like  really  falls  in  love  with
[12:56] you  she  will  be  more  influenced  by  you 
 than  she  would  be  by  her  female  friends 
 but  it's  still  just  a  massive  extra  risk
[13:03] to  add  to  your  relationship  and  so  the 
 next  red  flag  red  flag  number  seven  is 
 very  similar  to  the  these  yes  again  and
[13:08] this  red  flag  is  that  she  drinks  does 
 drugs  or  that  she's  in  a  very  degenerate
[13:13] environment  and  the  reason  for  this  is 
 twofold  right  one  this  is  just  you  know 
 bad  habits  it's  like  drinking  taking
[13:18] drugs  staying  up  late  partying  and  stuff 
 those  are  like  somewhat  bad  habits  and 
 you  know  they  can  be  fine  in  moderation
[13:23] but  generally  we  do  see  them  as  like  bad 
 and  some  gratification  dopamine 
 activities  but  again  it's  controversial
[13:30] as  [ __ ]  but  these  things  drinking  taking 
 drugs  partying  and  going  to  nights  out 
 and  stuff  those  things  generally  do  lead
[13:35] to  the  earlier  issues  of  promiscuously 
 if  a  woman  is  going  on  a  bunch  of  nights
[13:40] out  into  you  know  the  club  are  we  bad 
 people  for  saying  like  we'd  probably 
 trust  her  less  the  thing  is  you  know
[13:45] it's  nice  to  be  able  to  feel  like  you 
 can  trust  your  partner  fine  but  the 
 thing  is  I  think  and  this  is 
 controversial  as  [ __ ]  but  I  think  you
[13:50] kind  of  have  to  be  a  little  bit  of  a 
 broken  man  to  trust  a  woman  who  is  doing 
 these  things  like  you  know  she's  going
[13:56] out  partying  and  clubbing  I  think  you 
 have  to  be  a  little  bit  broken  as  a  man 
 to  trust  your  woman  when  she's  going  out 
 as  into  these  environments  because  bro
[14:02] those  environments  the  drinking 
 environment  the  drug  environment  parties 
 nightclubs  those  invite  environments  are
[14:08] where  people  [ __ ]  those  environments  are 
 where  people  cheat  to  think  that  you're 
 like  you're  the  girl  who's  your
[14:13] everything  the  girl  you're  in  love  with 
 is  getting  into  those  environments  or 
 she  wants  to she  wants  to  go  partying
[14:18] and  enjoy  herself  there's  reasons  for 
 that  now  it  can  be  a  fun  environment  to 
 go  and  you  know  just  let  loose  and  just
[14:24] go  wild  and  you  know  enjoy  yourself  and 
 drink  and  stuff  but  generally  that 
 environment  is  quite  fun  because  of  the
[14:30] inclination  that  someone  of  the  opposite 
 sex  is  there  does  that  make  sense  it's 
 like  before  a  party  or  a  nightclub  both
[14:36] the  guy  and  the  girl  spend  quite  a  lot 
 of  time  getting  ready  and  like  and  it's 
 a  very  horny  Primal  environment  and  this
[14:42] is  where  like  the  cheating  happens  this 
 is  where  like  the  [ __ ]  happens  for  a 
 lot  of  people  this  is  where  people  [ __ ]
[14:47] and  to  think  that  like  you'd  be  okay 
 with  your  girl  to  go  in  this  environment 
 because  you're  also  confident  I  don't
[14:52] think  it's  confidence  I  just  think  it's 
 it's  like  stupidity  or  ignorance  I 
 personally  would  never  accept  that  if  a
[14:58] girl  who  I  was  dating  wanted  to  go  on  a 
 night  out  or  a  party  or  something  it's 
 like  straight  away  like  I  wouldn't  even 
 like  say  that  she  couldn't  go  if  she  was
[15:04] serious  about  wanting  to  go  it's  like  it 
 would  just  show  that  we're  not 
 compatible  because  I  don't  do  that  stuff 
 anymore  now  I  have  done  and  so  if  she's
[15:10] done  those  things  previously  it's  kind 
 of  like  you  know  I  still  don't  like  it 
 but  fair  enough  I  I  did  them  previously
[15:15] but  if  she  wants  to  do  them  now  if  she 
 wants  to  go  to  some  like  [ __ ]  party 
 or  something  I  said  bro  that's  that's 
 not  me  and  so  clearly  we're  not
[15:21] compatible  I  I  would  end  with  a  girl 
 right  there  right  then  and  I  have  done 
 this  previously  two  years  ago  or  one  and
[15:26] a  half  years  ago  I  dated  a  girl  who 
 still  wanted  to  go  on  to  like  girls 
 nights  out  and  go  drinking  with  their
[15:31] friends  and  I  ended  up  right  there  and 
 it  was  painful  as  [ __ ]  and  I  was  called 
 controlling  I  was  called  a  groomer  I  was
[15:37] called  manipulative  I  was  gaslit  the 
 [ __ ]  from  this  girl  her  family  from  like 
 people  in  the  comments  when  I  spoke
[15:42] about  it  on  YouTube  but  I  look  back  to 
 that  moment  one  and  a  half years  ago 
 when  I  broke  up  a  relationship  just
[15:47] because  she  wanted  to  go  out  drinking 
 with  her  friends  and  I  bro  I  know  I  did 
 the  right  thing  red  flag  number  eight
[15:52] she  has  a  bad  relationship  with  her 
 parents  and  especially  her  father  now  a
[15:57] girl  can  quite  often  fall  out  with  her 
 mom  and  you  know  get  like  angry  at  each 
 other  that  sometimes  does  happen  and  it
[16:02] is  a  little  bit  normal  but  the 
 relationship  that  she  has  with  her 
 father  is  particularly  interesting  and
[16:07] as  you  guys  little  bit  older  you'll 
 really  really  value  like  this  this 
 indicator  of  like  the  quality  of  this
[16:13] girl  is  you'll  look  at  their 
 relationship  and  particularly  which  is 
 painful  to  say  it's  controversial  again 
 but  like  you're  particularly  look  if  the
[16:19] father  is  even  in  the  home  which  it's  so 
 [ __ ]  weird  but  like  the  majority  of 
 girls  that  you  may  date  their  parents
[16:25] may  not  be  together  and  their  father 
 will  not  be  in  the  home  and  this  is  a 
 general  statement  which  I'm  about  to  say 
 it's  controversial  again  so  it's  one  of
[16:31] those  things  that  we're  not  supposed  to 
 talk  about  but  generally  how  your 
 parents  interacted  with  you  and  each
[16:37] other  when  you  were  a  child  is  also  the 
 kind  of  Love  That  We  crave  when  we're 
 older  so  so  if  the  girl  that  you  like  if
[16:43] her  parents  split  up  when  she  was  young 
 and  she  saw  for  example  her  mom  break  up 
 with  her  father  and  kick  him  out  of  the
[16:49] house  and  then  she  saw  for  example  her 
 mum  stop  bringing  in  boyfriends  who  were 
 railing  her  like  if  she  saw  that  stuff
[16:55] she's  not  bound  you  know  she's  not 
 destined  to  live  the  same  life  but  we  do 
 generally  crave  the  kind  of  familiar
[17:01] love  that  we  saw  in  our  parents  honestly 
 even  though  it  sounds  [ __ ]  up  it's 
 like  once  you've  learned  this  fact  maybe
[17:06] you're  thinking  wait  no  no that's  not 
 true  or  something  once  you  really  learn 
 this  fact  and  you  open  your  brain  up  to
[17:11] just  seeing  this  in  the  real  world 
 you'll  see  how  [ __ ]  this  actually  is 
 you  will  see  people  who  will  literally 
 get  into  the  exact  same  kind  of
[17:17] relationship  as  their  parents  even 
 though  that  person  hated  the 
 relationship  that  their  parents  were  and
[17:22] you  will  see  a  girl  who  was  raised  by  a 
 single  mother  end  up  becoming  a  single 
 mother  herself  you  will  see  a  boy  who
[17:27] was  raised  by  an  abusive  father  become 
 an  abusive  father  himself  it  takes  a 
 great  deal  of  self-improvement  to  change
[17:33] this  honestly  it  takes  like  changing 
 your  life  you  don't  realize  like  how 
 deep  into  your  psyche  you  have  to  go  to
[17:40] like  stop  the  the  future  trajectory  of 
 becoming  more  like  your  parents  and 
 trust  me  when  I  say  not  that  I'm  better
[17:45] than  anyone  else  both  but  like  I  have 
 put  in  a  lot  of  effort  into  my 
 self-improvement  journey  a  lot  and  I  am
[17:50] still  not  certain  that  I  won't  end  up 
 like  my  parents  I  have  the  humility  to 
 admit  that  right  now  that  I've  like  been
[17:55] on  self-improvement  full  time  and  I 
 still  I'm  not  certain  that  I  will  not
[18:00] end  up  like  my  parents  so  if  I'm  saying 
 that  bro  if  I'm  saying  that  and  I've 
 like  literally  I've  been  like  employed
[18:06] like  it's  my  business  to  to  Beyond 
 self-improvement  full-time  there's  not 
 many  people  who  are  improving  as  like  as 
 fast  as  I  am  because  I  don't  have  a  job
[18:12] like  this  is  my  job  my  job's  just  being 
 on  self-improvement  right  so  there's  not 
 many  people  who  can  match  my  rates  of
[18:17] like  you  know  discovering  yourself  and 
 everything  and  chances  are  that  when  you 
 meet  your  woman's  family  or  you  kind  of 
 hear  about  them  she  will  end  up  being
[18:23] very  similar  to  her  mother  and  red  flag 
 number  nine  this  took  me  a  while  to 
 realize  even  though  it's  just  common
[18:29] sense  she's  a  bit  of  a  loser  now  I  don't 
 say  that  to  be  disrespectful  but  if  we
[18:34] categorize  or  Define  what  being  a  loser 
 means  we'd  probably  say  like  yes  being  a 
 Jeffrey  being  someone  who  doesn't  really
[18:39] do  anything  with  their  lives  who  eats 
 junk  food  who  maybe  takes  drugs  who  just 
 spends  all  day  watching  Netflix  or
[18:45] scrolling  on  their  phone  the  thing  is  we 
 have  almost  like  a  detest  especially  if 
 we  are  Jeffrey  right  we  don't  want  to  be
[18:50] like  Jeffrey  anymore  we  don't  want  to  be 
 losers  anymore  we  don't  even  want  to  be 
 friends  with  losers  anymore  we  don't 
 like  guys  who  are  Jeffries  or  losers
[18:56] because  we've  just  got  not  much  to 
 relate  to  them  right  what's  interesting 
 is  that  a  lot  of  guys  don't  hold  that
[19:01] same  standard  with  the  girls  that  they 
 date  and  I  was  just  like  this  I  got  onto 
 self-improvement  and  started  doing  all
[19:07] of  the  good  habits  meditating  reading 
 studying  working  hard  on  a  business 
 going  to  the  gym  eating  clean  stopping
[19:13] porn  and  video  games  and  just  watching 
 random  [ __ ]  on  Netflix  or  on  TV  I  did 
 all  that  and  I  didn't  really  hold  the
[19:19] girls  that  I  would  date  onto  the  same 
 standards  I  remember  I  dated  like  a 
 couple  of  girls  who  like  it  kind  of  took
[19:24] me  a  while  to  realize  like  oh  yeah  like 
 she's  kind  of  like  a  Jeffrey  like  and  it 
 just  made  me  cringe  when  I  thought  like
[19:29] she  literally  just  spends  her  days  on 
 social  media  and  just  watching  Netflix 
 but  I  never  really  considered  that  I
[19:34] should  hold  her  to  a  higher  standard 
 just  like  I  would  myself  or  my  male 
 friends  just  because  it  seems  like  a  lot
[19:39] of  girls  just  do  live  like  a  Jeffrey 
 like  a  Jessica  don't  they  do  they  just 
 kind  of  like  just  go  on  Tick  Tock  every
[19:44] day  and  that's  a  red  flag  because  if  you 
 did  respect  yourself  if  younger  me 
 respected  himself  if  we  were  truly
[19:50] masculine  men  like  the  superior  kind  of 
 man  if  we  were  like  that  we  would  not 
 settle  for  mediocracy  into  our  lives  we
[19:57] could  not  expect  anything  less  than 
 Excellence  from  anyone  in  our  life  and 
 if  you  respect  yourself  that  much  you
[20:03] wouldn't  even  consider  being  in  a 
 relationship  with  the  kind  of  girl  who 
 like  you  realize  like  she  doesn't
[20:08] actually  have  that  many  good  habits  and 
 she  just  like  wakes  up  late  and  this 
 reminds  me  of  a  story  so  after  that  you 
 know  the  first  girl  that  I  dated  when  I
[20:14] was  19  years  old  me  and  her  eventually 
 broke  up  and  around  like  one  and  a  half 
 months  after  I  remember  I  started  seeing
[20:19] like  the  second  girl  that  I'd  ever  slept 
 with  and  this  girl  like  it  was  so  weird
[20:24] because  I  didn't  realize  at  the  time  but 
 like  I  kind  of  rebound  I  didn't  know 
 what  rebound  was  but  rebounding  is  kind
[20:29] of  like  you  know  when  you're  going 
 through  heartbreak  and  you  kind  of  like 
 attach  yourself  to  a  new  person  and  so 
 this  random  like  other  girl  I  eventually
[20:35] like  started  dating  her  and  sleeping 
 with  her  and  I  remember  telling  my 
 friend  like  overall  she's  she's  perfect 
 this  girl  like  this  this  new  girl  is  so
[20:41] perfect  oh  my  God  she's  so  amazing  and 
 my  friend  was  just  always  like  he  never 
 really  spoke  to  me  about  this  but  I
[20:46] remember  he'd  always  just  give  me  like  a 
 weird  look  like  oh  yeah  and  I  remember 
 that  this  second  girl  that  I  ever  slept
[20:52] with  when  I  was  like  19  years  old  who  I 
 started  to  date  she  was  like  a  total 
 Jeffrey  and  I  don't  say  this  to  insult 
 her  but  like  with  her  I  literally  got
[20:58] depressed  because  spending  time  with  her 
 and  him  like  you  know  she  would  do  no 
 good  habits  she  would  do  nothing
[21:03] productive  with  the  day  she'd  literally 
 just  kind  of  like  sit  around  and  just 
 watch  Netflix  and  food  I  remember  there
[21:08] were  so  many  days  that  me  and  this  girl 
 would  literally  just  order  food  at  like 
 1am  2  A.M  eat  till  like  3  A.M  literally
[21:14] just  eating  food  watching  [ __ ]  on  like 
 our  phones  and  laptops  I  remember  so 
 often  that  when  I  would  sleep  around  her
[21:19] place  like  her  student  accommodation 
 we'd  both  wake  up  at  like  3  P.M  bro  we'd 
 literally  wake  up  at  3  P.M  I  check  my
[21:24] phone  and  instantly  just  feel  depressed 
 like  the  entire  day  is  just  [ __ ]  gone 
 I've  got  to  go  to  the  gym  and  by  the
[21:29] time  I'm  finished  with  the  gym  it's 
 gonna  be  dark  outside  I  remember  just 
 feeling  so  [ __ ]  depressed  and  like 
 but  thinking  this  girl  was  so  perfect
[21:34] and  I  wish  someone  just  kind  of  sat  me 
 down  like  a  big  brother  just  sat  me  down 
 and  said  okay  evaluate  her  habits  really
[21:39] tell  me  what  are  our  habits  like  because 
 if  I  actually  answer  that  question  and  I 
 said  okay  um  she  uh  she  likes  to  eat
[21:47] food  she  likes  to  stay  up  late  she  likes 
 to  watch  stuff  on  Netflix  she  likes  to 
 gossip  and  get  into  drama  with  her
[21:53] friends  and  she  likes  to  party  and  go 
 out  and  take  some  drugs 
 if  I  thought  about  this  critically  I
[21:59] would  have  probably  ended  that  sort  of 
 dating  situation  a  lot  faster  and  I  wish 
 someone  really  told  me  about  that  red
[22:05] flag  I  really  hope  this  video  doesn't 
 come  across  as  like  me  hating  on  women 
 because  I've  done  a  lot  of  videos  where
[22:10] I  talk  about  like  you  know  we  should 
 strive  to  be  better  men  for  the  sake  of 
 attracting  like  good  women  into  being 
 like  a  better  fathers  and  partners  for
[22:16] them  and  I  know  that  people  can  take 
 like  a  message  quite  wrong  and  so  I 
 really  hope  that  doesn't  happen  because 
 it  is  important  to  empower  young  men
[22:23] especially  and  just  kind  of  pass  down 
 some  like  male  wisdom  to  them  and  just 
 tell  them  like  oh  yeah  like  you  know
[22:28] just  from  me  personally  to  you  like 
 these  are  some  of  my  learning  lessons 
 with  women  they're  probably  not  facts
[22:34] you  know  all  the  red  flags  that  I've 
 told  you  probably  not  a  fact  but  just 
 this  is  my  wisdom  my  experience  passing 
 on  to  you  just  so  you  can  like  equip
[22:39] yourself  with  some  more  knowledge  and  it 
 might  help  you  you  remember  that  rich
