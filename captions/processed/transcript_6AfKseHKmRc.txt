[00:00] Jeffrey's  not  sure  if  this 
 self-improvement  thing  is  actually  going 
 to  work  for  him  he  wants  to  be  on  nofap
[00:05] but  he  can  only  manage  a  few  days  at  a 
 time  before  he  relapses  again  so  clearly 
 this  isn't  gonna  work  meditation  nah  nah
[00:11] I  don't  think  it'll  work  journaling  no 
 exercise  yeah  like  I  went  to  the  gym  uh
[00:16] two  to  go  scrolling  on  Instagram  yes 
 please  watching  both  videos  on  YouTube 
 sure  but  in  three  times  when  he's  reset
[00:22] his  streak  because  you  know  it's  already 
 at  zero  so  you  may  as  well  go  again  yeah 
 why  not  he's  doing  all  of  the  bad  habits
[00:28] he  doesn't  feel  motivated  to  do  anything 
 and  perhaps  that's  just  because  he's 
 Friday's  dopamine  receptors  bad  at
[00:33] Jeffrey  Adonis 
 Adonis  started  his  self-improvement 
 journey  young  years  of  good  habits
[00:39] developed  Adonis  to  be  the  kind  of  man 
 that  we  would  aspire  to  be  because  just 
 look  at  him  he  looks  amazing  he  feels
[00:45] amazing  his  life  is  amazing  and  it  has 
 all  come  from  self-improvement  in  this 
 video  I'm  not  going  to  tell  you  about  my
[00:51] story  I'm  going  to  tell  you  about  the 
 story  of  Sam  who  was  my  first  video 
 editor  for  this  channel  we  have  five 
 video  editors  now  I  hired  him  in
[00:57] December  2020  and  Sam  was  a  Jeffrey  when 
 I  hired  some  I  promise  you  that  this  is
[01:02] the  truth  and  I  don't  even  say  this  to 
 be  insulting  to  him  he  was  a  total 
 Jeffrey  he  was  a  full-time  live  streamer
[01:09] on  Twitch  which  meant  that  he  was 
 playing  video  games  for  around  12  hours 
 a  day  four  five  six  times  a  week  imagine
[01:15] that  bro  he  was  live  streaming  on  Twitch 
 playing  video  games  for  honestly  like  I
[01:20] checked  sometimes  he  had  like  eight 
 viewers  for  eight  viewers  for  literally 
 about  12  hours  a  day  alright  so  my  dad
[01:26] just  told  me  I'm  adopted  guys  he  was 
 skinny  didn't  even  exercise  at  all 
 didn't  eat  right  or  anything  Sam  was
[01:31] clinically  depressed  he  was  on 
 antidepressants  he  was  just  not  enjoying 
 any  part  of  life  but  by  editing  my
[01:36] self-improvement  videos  and  getting 
 closer  and  closer  to  me  he  naturally 
 just  became  more  like  me  because  you
[01:41] know  the  phrase  you're  the  average  of 
 The  Five  People  You  spend  time  with  well 
 it  really  worked  for  some  by  spending 
 time  with  me  Sam's  life  got  better
[01:47] because  he  got  onto  self-improvement 
 started  weightlifting  and  everything  by 
 me  spending  time  with  Sam  my  life  got  so
[01:52] much  [ __ ]  worse  I'm  come  on  man  the 
 first  part  of  self-improvement  that  we 
 got  someone  to  was  exercising  and  I 
 remember  that  he  didn't  even  have  the
[01:57] confidence  to  go  to  the  gym  like  he  just 
 did  it  was  impossible  for  him  to  go  to 
 the  gym  he  had  like  intense  social
[02:02] anxiety  so  he  couldn't  even  like  step 
 outside  of  his  house  so  he  was  literally 
 doing  like  this  shitty  home  workouts 
 push-ups  with  his  knees  on  the  floor
[02:07] negative  pull-ups  like  when  you  can't 
 even  do  a  pull-up  so  you  have  to  step  on 
 a  chair  first  and  already  cheat  your  way
[02:12] there  and  then  you  just  kind  of  like 
 fall  down  and  that  gives  you  like  a 
 little  bit  of  the  gains  I  had  so  I'm 
 doing  this  kind  of  workout  for  a  couple
[02:17] of  months  and  we  got  closer  and  closer 
 hopping  onto  like  video  calls  and 
 eventually  we  became  quite  good  friends 
 and  he  became  kind  of  like  my  right  hand
[02:22] man  in  this  entire  YouTube  channel  this 
 movements  he's  the  guy  that  I  go  to  to 
 help  me  make  decisions  and  he  really
[02:28] proved  himself  to  me  so  we  spent  more 
 and  more  time  together  eventually  some 
 got  more  and  more  confident  because  he 
 was  on  self-improvement  he  was  working
[02:34] out  a  little  bit  and  he  signed  up  to  gym 
 nearby  which  was  a  huge  step  for  him 
 because  he  literally  wasn't  leaving  his
[02:39] house  before  then  my  boys  first  gym 
 session  is  down  on  the  [ __ ]  stack  I
[02:44] don't  want  to  give  me  a  better  workout 
 the  machines  or  my  anxiety  but  either 
 way  feels  [ __ ]  great  man  I  wanted  to
[02:50] go  to  the  gym  since  I  was  13.
[02:55] I'm  quite  old  enough  to  go  then  and  by 
 the  time  I  was  old  enough  I  was  crippled 
 with  stuff  but  I  did  it
[03:02] I  did  it  like  literally  seriously  like 
 he  was  already  past  the  age  of  school 
 and  everything  he  was  staying  inside  of
[03:07] his  house  every  day  and  so  him  signing 
 up  to  the  gym  and  going  to  the  gym  was 
 like  a  big  thing  I  literally  remember 
 needing  to  like  prep  him  for  this  to
[03:13] teach  him  like  okay  this  is  what  you  do 
 in  the  gym  you  go  there  to  get  onto  this 
 machine  you  do  this  you  make  sure  you 
 wipe  your  sweat  that  I'll  teach  you  them
[03:18] like  the  social  mannerisms  of  like  how 
 to  be  outside  you  have  to  learn  this 
 [ __ ]  bro  he  got  consistent  in  the  gym  he
[03:23] made  some  friends  there  started 
 practicing  his  social  skills  that  he  was 
 learning  from  my  videos  and  I  would  tell 
 him  yeah  just  trying  to  speak  to  someone
[03:29] in  the  gym  you  know  just  like  just  ask 
 them  how  many  sets  they've  got  left  and 
 slowly  and  surely  he  started  getting 
 more  popular  he  made  some  friends  he
[03:34] started  going  out  to  like  clubs  and 
 parties  and  stuff  and  you  know  doing 
 some  like  sort  of  degenerate  habits  but 
 then  he  even  gave  all  that  up  became  so
[03:40] much  more  productive  more  work  focused 
 eating  cleaner  reading  reaching  more 
 levels  of  success  and  then  he  took  a  big
[03:45] step  by  my  side  he  took  his  first  ever 
 plane  flight  at  the  age  of  22  me  and  him 
 flew  out  to  Amsterdam  and  we  threw  out  a
[03:51] bunch  of  our  team  members  and  we  met  up 
 there  to  celebrate  I  booked  out  a 
 penthouse  for  our  team  and  that  was  a
[03:56] big  move  for  him  to  literally  take  a 
 plane  we  have  a  sick  time  there  he's 
 developing  more  and  more  confidence  he's 
 getting  way  more  into  like  weightlifting
[04:02] really  wanting  to  build  physique  and 
 then  we  take  even  a  bigger  trip  to 
 Thailand  all  the  way  across  the  world
[04:07] and  I  remember  that  that  was  such  a  big 
 PR  for  him  that  he  literally  broke  down 
 multiple  times  just  on  the  flight  and
[04:13] everything  I  literally  saw  him  like  just 
 seeming  so  like  empty  and  like  [ __ ]  like 
 you  know  shelled  up  because  we  just  took
[04:18] the  biggest  [ __ ]  flight  of  his  life 
 and  even  of  mine  12  hours  away  but  in 
 Thailand  he  started  getting  more 
 confident  training  Muay  Thai  even
[04:24] attracting  girls  we  met  with  the  guys 
 jack  and  Bill  that  Sam  really  bonded 
 with  we've  come  back  home  from  Thailand
[04:29] and  since  then  about  three  months  ago 
 because  I  was  been  putting  in  the 
 [ __ ]  grind  the  reason  why  I'm  telling 
 you  this  story  is  because  I  want  you  to
[04:34] imagine  this  before  and  after  before  is 
 it  a  man  a  boy  21  years  old  live
[04:40] streaming  video  games  for  12  hours  a  day 
 on  Twitch  to  eight  viewers  intense 
 social  anxiety  not  going  outside  just
[04:46] skinny  as  [ __ ]  depressed  clinically 
 depressed  and  I  forgot  to  mention 
 actually  that  sometime  near  the  start  of 
 this  year  Sam's  clinical  depression  was
[04:52] cured  and  he  no  longer  needed 
 antidepressants  anymore  because  he  was 
 now  on  self-improvement  and  actually
[04:57] living  like  how  you're  supposed  to  live 
 till  the  after  where  he's  in  shape  he's 
 in  fantastic  shape  actually  working  hard
[05:03] he  doesn't  play  video  games  at  all 
 anymore  and  he  actually  quite  is  like 
 against  them  the  same  way  that  I  am
[05:08] because  he's  realized  how  much  of  a  hook 
 they  had  over  him  he's  becoming 
 successful  he's  became  a  man  I  put  him
[05:13] through  the  rite  of  passage  myself  I 
 literally  baptized  him  like  I  took  him 
 to  a  waterfall  in  Thailand  we  did  this 
 incredibly  hard  like  journey  and  I
[05:19] literally  [ __ ]  baptized  Sam 
 underneath  water  and  told  him  that 
 you're  a  man  now  we're  gonna  baptize  him
[05:24] God  Jack  you  baptize  him  baptized 
 [Applause]
[05:30] bananas
[05:37] oh 
 you're  right  you're  about  now  what's  the
[05:42] passage  I  know  it  was  only  like  you  know 
 it  was  just  goofy  [ __ ]  like  you  know  you 
 and  your  friend  next  to  the  waterfall
[05:47] that  you  grab  his  skull  and  put  it  into 
 the  water  and  I  was  just  like  oh  you're 
 a  man  now  but  like  it  was  true  he 
 legally  turned  into  a  man  when  he  was  18
[05:53] years  old  but  he  actually  turned  into  a 
 man  in  the  last  one  year  being  on 
 self-improvement  there  are  so  many  guys
[05:59] who  are  just  shut  indoors  feeling 
 hopeless  feeling  like  they  can't  really 
 get  out  of  the  the  ruts  that  they're  in
[06:04] nothing  really  seems  to  be  enjoyable 
 it's  this  feeling  of  this  Bleak  dark 
 gray  depressive  nihilistic  just
[06:11] emptiness  purposelessness  no  real 
 enjoyment  only  stimulation  and  so  many
[06:16] guys  can  relate  to  that  you  see  the 
 modern  world  has  really  really  [ __ ] 
 over  men  younger  men  particularly  and
[06:22] it's  time  that  you  get  a  reminder 
 perhaps  this  may  be  one  of  the  first 
 times  you've  been  told  this  it's  time
[06:27] that  you  get  reminded  that  you  are  part 
 of  the  warrior  class  do  you  know  in  like 
 Finance  money  [ __ ]  there's  always  like
[06:32] working  class  business  class  upper  class 
 there's  a  class  that  isn't  really  spoke 
 about  and  that  is  the  warrior  class  it
[06:37] is  younger  you  see  younger  men  are  the 
 most  powerful  of  any  generation  young
[06:43] men  are  what  cause  revolutions  and  Wars 
 young  men  are  what  cause  buildings  to  be 
 built  perhaps  it's  sexist  but  maybe  it's
[06:49] just  factual  when  you  drive  on  a  big 
 Motorway  100  of  the  people  who  made  this
[06:54] Motorway  are  men  when  you  see  a  big 
 building  100  of  the  builders  are  men 
 this  is  not  downplaying  women  or  saying
[06:59] that  there  but  I'm  not  talking  about 
 women  we're  just  hyping  up  men  right  now 
 because  it's  time  that  you  got  hyped  up
[07:04] and  you  realized  and  you  actually  heard 
 from  maybe  the  first  time  in  so  long  of 
 the  potential  that  you  have  young  men
[07:09] are  the  strongest  people  of  humanity  the 
 amount  of  potential  that  you  have  to
[07:15] change  your  life  and  it's  so  sad  to  see 
 that  potential  being  wasted  it's  so  sad 
 to  see  that  potential  being  manipulated
[07:21] and  stolen  from  you  by  these  evil 
 companies  that  want  to  just  sap  your 
 attention  into  them  porn  [ __ ]  porn
[07:27] imagine  how  evil  that  [ __ ]  company  of 
 PornHub  is  Facebook  meta  Instagram 
 Snapchat  Tick  Tock  they  know  what
[07:33] they're  doing  they  know  that  they  have 
 [ __ ]  your  life  they  know  that  they 
 have  [ __ ]  your  brother's  life  they 
 have  [ __ ]  your  male  friend  life  only
[07:39] fans  chances  are  if  you're  watching  me 
 intently  right  now  you  want  to  improve 
 you  want  to  experience  a  better  life  you
[07:46] don't  just  want  to  give  up  but  you  just 
 don't  really  know  what  to  do  or  how  to 
 do  it  to  actually  make  real  progress
[07:52] because  you've  been  told  this  [ __ ] 
 before  you've  been  told  to  maybe  take  a 
 break  from  video  games  to  maybe  stop
[07:57] watching  porn  to  maybe  go  to  the  gym  and 
 eat  cleaner  Foods  you've  been  told  that 
 but  for  some  reason  you  just  can't 
 really  seem  to  do  it  you  might  have  a
[08:03] feeling  that  you're  supposed  to  stay 
 stuck  like  this  wrong  go  and  look  at  the 
 comments  of  any  one  of  my  videos  I  urge
[08:10] you  to  do  this  now  you  can  pause  this 
 video  go  and  look  at  the  comments 
 underneath  this  video  go  onto  my  channel 
 on  like  10  different  videos  go  and  look
[08:15] at  the  comments  you  will  see  something 
 very  different  from  any  other  YouTube 
 channel  the  majority  of  comments  are 
 people  literally  saying  Hamza  you've
[08:21] saved  my  life  I  was  gonna  kill  myself 
 your  videos  have  saved  my  life  I'm  13 
 years  old  and  I've  had  a  porn  addiction
[08:26] for  three  years  and  I've  cured  it  now 
 because  I've  been  watching  your  videos 
 hamster  our  generation  of  young  men  have
[08:31] felt  so  hopeless  so  nihilistic  so 
 depressed  so  stuck  like  this  for  so  long
[08:37] till  now  because  we  know  what  cures  all 
 of  these  problems  we  know  what  fixes
[08:42] depression  we  know  what  gets  a  young  man 
 out  of  a  rot  and  actually  being 
 productive  we  know  what  causes  a  young
[08:47] man  to  get  this  Burning  Desire  inside  of 
 him  where  he  thinks  [ __ ]  I  want  to  take 
 some  responsibility  for  my  life  make
[08:52] some  money  help  my  family  and  actually 
 experience  like  a  good  life  it's 
 self-improvements  improving  yourself  in
[08:58] as  many  ways  as  possible  especially  your 
 mental  health  it  took  some  less  than  six
[09:03] months  to  cure  his  depression  that  he 
 thought  he  was  going  to  have  for  life 
 why  was  he  depressed  they  don't  want  me 
 to  tell  you  about  this  bro  I  might  get
[09:08] canceled  for  this  [ __ ]  because  I'm 
 telling  you  like  oh  maybe  depression's 
 not  like  I'm  not  being  under  10  saying
[09:13] depression  it's  not  real  I  think  it  is 
 real  but  I  think  people  think  that  it's 
 something  that  they're  just  supposed  to 
 be  stuck  with  and  they  don't  realize
[09:18] like  this  is  so  condescending  but  you'll 
 only  kind  of  believe  this  when  you've 
 experienced  it  yourself  the  reason  why 
 you're  depressed  is  just  because  you
[09:23] don't  live  like  a  normal  healthy  human 
 being  how  could  you  not  be  depressed 
 when  you  wake  up  and  just  stare  at  your
[09:28] phone  how  could  you  not  be  depressed 
 when  you  masturbate  five  times  a  day 
 three  times  a  day  every  single  day  for 
 years  you're  convinced  in  your  brain  and
[09:34] your  body  and  your  soul  that  you're 
 getting  laid  that  you're  experiencing 
 love  and  intimacy  and  every  single  day
[09:39] you  keep  waking  up  alone  how  could  you 
 not  be  depressed  how  could  you  not  be 
 depressed  when  you  go  onto  Instagram  and 
 you  see  people  who  are  better  than  you
[09:44] how  could  you  not  be  depressed  when  you 
 see  a  bleak  future  ahead  with  a  career 
 that  isn't  part  of  your  purpose  how
[09:49] could  you  not  be  depressed  when  you're 
 like  20  years  old  and  at  this  point 
 every  man  in  your  bloodline  has  had
[09:54] children  apart  from  you  how  could  you 
 not  be  depressed  when  70  80  90  of  men
[10:00] have  literally  no  love  no  intimacy  no 
 affection  in  their  lives  how  could  you 
 not  be  depressed  when  the  last  time  you
[10:05] climbed  a  tree  was  10  years  ago  how 
 could  you  not  be  depressed  when  you 
 don't  jump  over  a  puddle  when  you  don't
[10:10] jump  in  the  puddle  like  you  used  to  as  a 
 child  when  the  things  that  we  do  for  fun 
 these  days  are  literally  just  staring
[10:15] into  our  [ __ ]  phones  whereas  we  used 
 to  go  out  as  children  and  play  for 
 football  and  run  on  our  bikes  and  push
[10:20] each  other  into  mud  and  we  don't  do  that 
 [ __ ]  though  because  you  know  it's 
 inappropriate  for  an  adult  to  be  acting 
 that  way  I  don't  mean  to  be
[10:25] condescending  bro  but  honestly  you  want 
 to  cure  your  depression  in  20  minutes  go 
 outside  and  climb  a  tree  and  go  as  high
[10:30] as  you  possibly  can  and  I  guarantee  you 
 will  have  the  biggest  smile  on  your  face 
 and  you  know  why  you  don't  hear  advice 
 like  this  because  no  one  gets  the  profit
[10:36] from  it  no  YouTube  company  no  influence 
 against  a  profit  from  you  meditating  and 
 improving  your  mental  health  and  going
[10:41] outside  and  actually  acting  like  you're 
 supposed  to  being  amongst  nature  is  it 
 any  surprise  where  the  majority  of  us
[10:47] feel  so  bad  because  of  the  way  that  we 
 live  you  know  so  many  young  men  out 
 there  are  feeling  so  hopeless  you're
[10:52] part  of  the  lucky  ones  you  know  why 
 because  you're  watching  this  video  and 
 in  the  next  30  seconds  I'm  gonna  instill 
 more  hope  into  you  than  you've  ever  had
[10:57] before  remember  that  we've  done  all 
 these  bad  habits  for  years  and  years  and 
 years  and  years  self-improvement  with
[11:02] counteract  that  within  two  months  Max 
 within  two  weeks  you  will  see  a 
 significant  Improvement  to  your  life
[11:07] self-improvement  is  all  about  delaying 
 grassification  doing  the  hard  thing  now 
 so  that  our  life  is  better  in  the  future
[11:13] exercising  now  so  that  we're  more  fit  in 
 the  future  eating  clean  now  even  though 
 that  meal  doesn't  taste  as  nice  because
[11:18] it's  healthy  because  it's  not  as 
 pleasurable  but  your  life  gets  better  in 
 the  future  you  keep  doing  all  of  these 
 good  habits  that  make  your  future  life
[11:24] better  and  eventually  it  is  the  future 
 eventually  you  become  your  future  self 
 and  all  you  can  do  is  stand  there  with  a
[11:29] 10  out  of  10  physique  with  your 
 girlfriend  that  you  love  by  your  side 
 and  you  just  have  this  [ __ ]  sense  of 
 self-love  thinking  my  younger
[11:35] self-sacrificed  for  me  I  sit  before  you 
 today  as  I  guy  who's  built  his  dream 
 physique  my  dream  life  digital  Nomad
[11:42] successful  all  these  like  good  things  I 
 could  say  about  myself  I've  achieved  my 
 dream  life  of  course  there's  more  to  go 
 the  reason  why  I've  achieved  this  not
[11:48] because  I've  done  anything  I  didn't  do 
 anything  my  younger  self-sacrificed  for 
 me  how  could  I  not  be  so  excited  how
[11:55] could  I  not  have  so  much  self-love  if  my 
 younger  self-sacrifice  and  delayed 
 gratification  for  me  but  on  the  other
[12:01] hand  how  could  you  not  feel  like  total 
 [ __ ]  how  could  you  not  be  depressed
[12:06] because  your  younger  self  took  from  you 
 he  sacrificed  you  for  his  pleasure  your
[12:11] younger  self  ate  that  junk  food  knowing 
 that  you  would  have  extra  body  fat  your 
 younger  self  masturbated  knowing  that
[12:17] you  would  feel  more  shame  your  younger 
 self  played  thousands  of  hours  of  video 
 games  knowing  that  you  would  have  less
[12:22] success  in  your  life  lower  grades  how 
 could  you  not  be  depressed  how  could  you 
 not  be  nihilistic  how  could  you  not  have
[12:28] this  sense  of  self-hatred  when  your 
 younger  self  took  from  you  will  your 
 future  self  the  man  that  you'll  become  a
[12:34] year  from  now  two  years  from  now  be 
 thinking  the  same  thing  about  you  think 
 about  this  think  of  about  your  2023  2024

 now  think  about  that  version  of  yourself 
 is  he  thinking  about  you  and  thinking
[12:45] that  you're  an  [ __ ]  is  he  thinking 
 about  you  and  thinking  [ __ ]  you  stop  it 
 please  because  you  know  exactly  what  it
[12:51] is  that  you  need  to  do  and  if  you  don't 
 do  the  right  things  your  future  self  is 
 gonna  hate  you  your  future  self  is  going
[12:57] to  think  about  you  today  just  like  you 
 do  with  your  younger  self  and  you  wish 
 your  younger  self  just  studied  a  little 
 bit  harder  and  stopped  eating  that  junk
[13:02] food  and  stop  taking  those  drugs  if  your 
 future  self  is  going  to  think  the  same 
 thing  about  you  bro  time  to  change  time
[13:07] to  get  fed  up  time  to  get  like  annoyed 
 pissed  off  aggressive  angry  at  Living 
 this  way  you  should  have  fear  that  your
[13:13] future  self  is  gonna  feel  this  way  about 
 you  you  should  do  everything  you  can 
 whatever  pops  into  your  mind  any  ideas
[13:19] that  you  get  to  set  up  your  future  self 
 to  have  a  better  life  what  could  you  do 
 what  sacrifices  could  you  make  today
[13:25] that  your  future  self  is  gonna  look  back 
 at  you  and  think  thank  you  I  can't 
 believe  you  did  that  for  me  I  went
[13:30] through  a  lot  bro  I  struggled  a  lot  I 
 had  really  bad  mental  health  for  most  of
[13:35] my  life  especially  17  18  19  years  old  I 
 went  through  some  traumatic  [ __ ]  I  had 
 experienced  child  abuse  from  my  parents
[13:41] I  got  attacked  by  a  racist  who  tried  to 
 stab  me  I  went  through  some  like  bad 
 [ __ ]  bro  I  was  addicted  to  weed  people
[13:47] say  you  can't  be  addicted  to  weed  bro  I 
 was  I  was  eating  junk  food  Benji  and 
 everything  I  hated  my  life  and  I
[13:52] remember  this  moment  like  the  one  thing 
 I  was  doing  productive  was  just  going  to 
 the  gym  but  even  I  stopped  that  I 
 remember  this  moment  just  looking  at
[13:58] myself  in  the  mirror  and  just  thinking 
 like  what  the  [ __ ]  the  one  thing  I  had 
 going  for  me  was  my  physique  and  I've
[14:03] started  to  ruin  it  because  I'm  just 
 eating  junk  food  and  I  started  to  get 
 this  feeling  of  like  hatred  towards 
 myself  over  you  know  the  actions  that
[14:09] I'd  taken  over  the  last  three  six  nine 
 months  and  something  just  clicked  I  just 
 got  interested  in  this  concept  of
[14:14] thinking  wait  I  hate  my  younger  self 
 right  now  because  he  sacrificed  me  but 
 what  if  I  sacrifice  myself  for  my  future
[14:21] self  my  younger  self  sacrificed  me 
 because  he  wanted  to  eat  that  junk  food 
 what  if  I  eat  healthy  and  sacrifice
[14:27] pleasure  today  for  my  future  self  so 
 that  he  can  have  a  six-pack  and  that's 
 exactly  what  I  did  that's  exactly  what
[14:32] Sam  did  that's  exactly  what  you  would  go 
 on  to  do  you  have  inside  of  you  Warrior 
 blood  for  you  to  be  alive  today  bro  you
[14:38] your  ancestors  were  badass  that  means 
 that  you  have  the  genetic  capability  to 
 be  badass  to  achieve  success  to  work
[14:44] hard  to  dominate  your  future  self  is 
 just  waiting  for  you  today  to  tap  into 
 that  and  it's  not  going  to  be  easy
[14:49] you're  not  just  suddenly  going  to  get 
 consistent  in  going  to  the  gym  or 
 meditating  eating  clean  you  know  you're 
 just  not  just  suddenly  going  to  start
[14:54] doing  it  every  single  day  you  could  try 
 to  go  into  the  gym  right  now  maybe 
 you'll  go  for  two  days  and  then  you'll 
 take  like  three  days  off  you  could  try
[14:59] getting  on  nofap  right  now  maybe  you'll 
 do  it  for  two  days  and  you'll  say  like  a 
 week  off  that's  normal  but  if  you  stay
[15:04] on  this  path  and  you  keep  sacrificing 
 for  your  future  self  you're  gonna  get 
 closer  and  closer  to  that  ideal  place
[15:09] which  is  just  extreme  consistency  of  all 
 the  good  habits  you  want  your  future
[15:14] self  to  be  proud  of  you  so  just  ask 
 yourself  this  when  you  go  about  your  day 
 just  ask  yourself  what  can  I  do  that
[15:19] would  make  my  future  self  grateful  for 
 me  and  also  if  you've  got  the  gut  the 
 balls  to  do  this  also  go  about  your  day
[15:25] saying  if  I  do  this  thing  that  I  feel 
 like  doing  that  I  have  this  craving  for 
 like  video  games  porn  drugs  junk  food
[15:31] how  will  my  future  self  feel  about  me  if 
 he's  gonna  feel  shame  guilt  let  down  I'm 
 not  gonna  do  that  to  him  it's  time  for
