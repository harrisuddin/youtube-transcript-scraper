[00:00] Jeffrey  looks  back  at  his  pudgy  unshaven 
 feminine  face  in  his  greasy  mirror  is
[00:05] that  really  me  he's  barely  able  to 
 believe  how  he  looks  if  only  Jeffrey 
 followed  the  advice  in  this  video  he
[00:10] would  be  able  to  instantly  improve  his 
 attractiveness  but  instead  of  paying 
 attention  to  this  video  Jeffrey  goes
[00:16] straight  to  the  comments  and  he  looks  at 
 the  suggested  videos  Jeffrey  Focus  you 
 need  this  Adonis
[00:22] Adonis  looks  in  the  mirror  aside  Jeffrey 
 he  Grooms  his  masculine  face  with  a 
 chiseled  jawline  he  looks  like  a
[00:28] different  species  of  animal  next  to 
 Jeffrey  but  he  didn't  always  look  like 
 this  there  was  once  a  time  when  younger
[00:33] dies  wasn't  even  attractive  at  all  he 
 used  to  cope  and  say  that  he  didn't  care 
 about  how  he  looked  but  as  time  went  on
[00:38] and  Adonis  got  older  and  more  mature  he 
 realized  that  it  was  okay  to  take  pride 
 in  his  appearance  he  wanted  to  look
[00:45] professional  have  you  started  watching 
 these  kinds  of  videos  just  because  you 
 want  to  look  better  mainly  because  you
[00:50] just  want  to  track  girls  most  guys  won't 
 ever  have  the  confidence  to  admit  this  I 
 may  be  one  of  the  first  people  who  look 
 at  you  and  hold  their  hands  up  and  say
[00:56] yes  when  I  was  17  18  bro  I  was  horny  as 
 and  I  wasn't  getting  any  matches  on 
 Tinder  so  guess  what  I  did  I  went  on  my
[01:02] own  journey  to  improve  my  looks  because 
 it  became  apparent  to  me  that  how  you 
 look  is  greatly  going  to  determine  how
[01:07] many  girls  are  into  you  and  today  I'm 
 going  to  give  you  three  hacks  that  you 
 can  use  instantly  like  this  isn't  some 
 long-term  thing  like  oh  yeah
[01:13] these  are  things  that  you  could 
 literally  do  before  school  or  work  or 
 going  out  to  a  social  event  today  and
[01:19] I'm  gonna  make  a  promise  to  you  if  you 
 do  all  three  of  these  especially  the 
 last  one  you  will  go  up  at  least  one
[01:25] point  out  of  ten  that  means  that  if 
 you're  currently  a  5  out  of  10  you'll  go 
 to  a  six  out  of  ten  and  you  might  be
[01:30] thinking  well  you  know  that  okay  that's 
 kind  of  nice  that's  not  so  huge  is  it 
 but  you  must  understand  that  a  lot  of 
 guys  don't  actually  know  this  but  guys
[01:35] who  have  experienced  a  good  dating  life 
 know  this  getting  girls  is  always 
 exponential  based  on  your  improvements
[01:41] so  going  from  a  five  to  a  sexual  thing 
 like  oh  yeah  maybe  I'll  get  like  10  more 
 no  no every  point  that  you  go  up  from 
 one  to  ten  well  ten  times  the  amount  of
[01:48] attraction  that  you  get  from  girls  so  of 
 course  you  know  a  one  out  of  ten  guy 
 gets  no  attraction  from  girls  and  so 
 when  he  becomes  a  two  out  of  ten  ten
[01:53] times  zero  is  still  kind  of  zero  but 
 then  there  becomes  a  point  where  you 
 know  you're  somewhat  of  an  average  guy
[01:58] between  four  or  five  or  six  out  of  ten 
 and  I  know  the  rating  scale  is  kind  of 
 like  autistic  at  all  or  out  of  time  but
[02:03] like  it's  a  good  way  for  us  to 
 understand  what  we're  talking  about  if 
 you're  like  let's  say  an  average  guy 
 you're  a  five  out  of  ten  maybe  there's 
 one  girl  who  shows  you  like  a  pretty
[02:09] good  level  of  Interest  per  year  isn't 
 there  maybe  yeah  well  if  you  become  a 
 six  out  of  ten  suddenly  for  that  year
[02:14] that  you  are  a  six  there  will  be  10 
 girls  who  show  you  an  interest  the 
 world's  men  honestly  about  90  of  men
[02:20] would  be  happy  with  that  90  of  men  would 
 be  totally  happily  and  fulfilled  wait  10 
 girls  I'm  not  saying  you  know  the  10
[02:25] girls  date  you  will  marry  you  or  sleep 
 with  you  or  anything  but  at  least  they 
 actually  actively  like  texting  you  back 
 and  meeting  you  for  a  date  which  a  lot
[02:30] of  guys  would  be  happy  for  but  imagine 
 if  you  go  then  from  a  six  to  a  seven  and 
 the  ten  times  Rule  still  applies  you
[02:36] have  10  girls  who  are  showing  you 
 interest  really  replying  back  really 
 engaging  with  you  really  going  on  dates 
 with  you  when  you  were  six  it's  up  to  a
[02:42] hundred  when  you're  a  seven  it's  up  to  a 
 thousand  when  you're  in  it  it's  up  to  10 
 like  literally  I  know  this  seems  silly
[02:47] and  a  lot  of  guys  wouldn't  believe  this 
 because  a  lot  of  guys  overly  rate 
 themselves  you  might  be  thinking  yeah 
 but  I'm  already  a  seven  and  I  don't  get
[02:52] like  a  thousand  girls  into 
 you're  probably  not  seven  bro  I  used  to
[02:57] think  when  I  was  what  would  I  rate 
 myself  when  I  was  in  second  year  of  uni 
 so  this  was  like  my  [ __ ]  boy  days 
 probably  like  a  6.5  if  you  include  a  six
[03:04] pack  in  stuff  yeah  probably  about  6.5  I 
 think  most  people  maybe  would  agree  that 
 you  know  somewhere  around  the  six  to
[03:09] seven  range  when  I  look  like  that  right 
 I  was  six  foot  one  and  the  thing  is  the 
 amount  of  attraction  that  I  got  then 
 when  I  looked  like  that  there  was  a
[03:15] point  where  I  couldn't  even  believe  it 
 but  rewind  a  year  and  you  know  I  had 
 slightly  less  muscle  from  maybe  slightly
[03:20] higher  body  fat  maybe  you  know  like 
 worse  clothes  and  everything  so  my  first 
 year  of  uni  and  it  was  like  night  and
[03:25] day  and  then  rewind  another  year  and  it 
 was  just  such  a  total  difference  you 
 must  understand  that  this  is  all
[03:30] exponential  we're  gonna  go  over  the 
 three  ways  to  instantly  improve  your 
 looks  make  sure  you  don't  skip  around 
 you  will  probably  benefit  from  all  three
[03:36] the  first  way  is  to  improve  your  hair 
 and  yeah  it  sounds  kind  of  funny  coming 
 from  a  guy  who  doesn't  really  have  much 
 right  now  but  I've  just  trimmed  it  all
[03:41] off  there  was  a  time  when  I  was  honestly 
 all  the  way  through  High  School  15  16 
 17.  and  I  had  no  clue  at  all  how  some
[03:48] guys  had  really  attractive  like  good 
 looking  hair  and  why  mine  didn't  look  so 
 good  like  all  of  my  hair  in  like  high 
 school  it  was  just  like  not  styled  I
[03:54] didn't  understand  you  know  what  how  this 
 even  works  like  how  to  even  have 
 attractive  hair  no  one  you  don't  get  a
[03:59] class  in  it  in  school  maybe  you've  never 
 sat  down  to  like  you  know  type  how  to 
 have  attractive  hair  like  I  needed  a 
 beginner's  tutorial  so  I'm  gonna  give
[04:04] this  to  you  right  now  if  you  have  very 
 short  hair  like  mine  obviously  this 
 there's  obviously  not  much  you  can  do 
 right  now  I'm  growing  mine  a  little  bit
[04:09] longer  but  if  you've  got  a  bit  more  like 
 length  the  way  to  make  your  hair 
 attractive  if  there's  just  one  thing 
 well  this  too  right  just  in  case  it's
[04:15] your  bottom  20  percenter  make  sure  your 
 hair  is  like  clean  and  stuff  make  sure 
 it  doesn't  have  like  [ __ ]  doo-doo  in
[04:20] it  or  something  some  guys  need  to  hear 
 this  honestly  like  probably  not  you 
 because  you're  already  on 
 self-improvement  but  some  guys  are  gross 
 and  so  that's  the  first  key  is  just  okay
[04:25] have  a  shower  but  then  after  that  most 
 guys  probably  60  70  of  guys  could  get  an
[04:30] instant  booster  attractiveness  with  one 
 quick  tip  it  costs  like  maybe  five 
 dollars  and  it  lasts  literally  for
[04:35] months  go  to  a  store  and  buy  any  kind  of 
 hair  product  you  need  to  find  the  one 
 that  fits  for  you  but  what  a  hair
[04:40] product  does  whether  it's  called  like 
 gel  or  wax  or  like  Pomade  or  some  [ __ ] 
 you  know  you  just  go  to  like  the  men's
[04:45] hair  section  in  a  shop  you'll  be  able  to 
 find  it  right  when  you  do  what  it  does 
 you  put  it  onto  your  fingers  you  mix  it 
 around  and  then  it's  got  like  this  kind
[04:50] of  like  hearty  texture  that  when  you  put 
 it  into  your  hair  you  can  now  control 
 how  your  hair  stays  a  lot  of  guys  didn't
[04:56] know  this  and  I  personally  didn't  know 
 this  so  I  used  to  go  to  school  I'm  not 
 even  joking  right  I've  never  told  this 
 story  before  but  before  school  or
[05:01] college  you  know  I  look  at  myself  in  the 
 mirror  and  I  wanted  to  style  my  hair  and 
 I  didn't  realize  that  you  use  a  product 
 for  this  my  hair  like  normally  didn't
[05:06] look  so  good  so  what  I  would  do  is  I'd 
 wet  my  hands  with  water  style  my  hair 
 and  it  looked  kind  of  nice  and  then  go
[05:12] to  school  expecting  it  to  stay  like  that 
 you  know  I'd  be  in  class  and  stuff 
 whatever  then  I  go  to  the  toilet  and  be 
 like  my  hair  looks  like  [ __ ]  because
[05:18] it's  not  styled  I've  only  put  water  in 
 it  and  obviously  it  dries  out  like  but 
 every  time  I'd  go  to  the  toilet  wet  my 
 hands  and  that  would  probably  last
[05:24] literally  like  five  minutes  barely  and 
 then  it  just  goes  back  you  need  to  use 
 some  kind  of  product  the  one  that  I  use
[05:29] is  v05  Clay  something  like  that  it 
 doesn't  even  matter  which  one  I  use  if  I 
 was  you  and  you  might  be  annoyed  because
[05:34] this  is  gonna  cost  you  maybe  like  20  but 
 if  I  was  you  I  would  go  to  the  men's 
 hair  section  and  I  would  buy  like  four
[05:39] different  ones  it's  a  gel  there's  a  wax 
 there's  this  one  there's  this  one  four 
 completely  different  ones  go  home  try 
 one  on  see  how  it  feels  see  how  it  looks
[05:45] take  a  shower  clean  it  all  off  try 
 another  one  you  do  this  once  and  you 
 spend  20  and  you  spend  like  half  an  hour 
 just  to  seeing  which  one  you  literally
[05:50] know  which  products  you  use  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  like  I  did  this  once  five 
 years  ago  and  I  literally  all  is  buy  the
[05:55] same  one  no  matter  which  country  I'm  in 
 I'll  always  go  and  find  the  same  product 
 and  it  literally  works  amazingly  for  me
[06:00] so  I  never  have  like  this  decision 
 fatigue  of  thinking  like  which  one 
 should  I  go  which  one  should  I  below 
 this  one  this  is  this  gel  is  too  white
[06:06] you  know  I  never  have  that  anymore  by 
 styling  your  hair  trust  me  when  I  say 
 like  this  alone  could  probably  even  get
[06:11] you  one  point  out  of  ten  but  if  you're 
 like  younger  me  you  might  be  listening 
 to  this  right  now  in  cringing  I  think 
 like  wait  this  is  all  gay  why  would  I
[06:17] style  my  hair  that's  gay  I  used  to  think 
 that  right  I  used  to  think  I  know  it's 
 gay  it's  for  girls  and  stuff  why  would  I 
 do  that  I  then  realized  I  put  two  and
[06:22] twos  together  then  I  thought  okay  how  am 
 I  seeing  improving  my  hair  as  gay  as  a 
 bad  thing  when  that  would  improve  my
[06:27] attractiveness  and  that  would  get  me 
 more  girls  once  I  connected  the  dots  and 
 I  was like  oh  yeah  like  then  it  can't  be
[06:32] gay  it  can't  be  bad  because  I  want  to 
 get  [ __ ]  bro  I'm  horny  as  [ __ ]  bro  so 
 I  was like  okay  come  on  that  was  what 
 convinced  me  because  before  this  I  had
[06:38] kind  of  that  sort  of  you  know  masculine 
 locker  room  kind  of  thing  of  like  oh 
 yeah  that  you  know  why  would  you  style 
 your  hair  it  doesn't  make  any  sense  but
[06:43] this  is  how  I  was  able  to  convert  into 
 this  idea  and  since  then  it's  like  I 
 can't  imagine  not  putting  less  stuff
[06:48] into  my  obviously  again  my  hair's  really 
 short  right  now  but  I  can't  imagine  like 
 not  putting  stuff  into  my  hair  and  not 
 styling  it  it's  like  you  instantly  just
[06:54] look  better  you  look  way  room  if  you've 
 got  slightly  longer  hair  than  mine  if 
 you're  not  putting  something  in  it  in
[06:59] the  morning  I  promise  you  it's  not  going 
 to  look  good  most  guys  if  you  just  wake 
 up  and  maybe  if  you  just  take  a  shower 
 or  something  some  guys  don't  even  take  a
[07:04] shower  and  you  just  step  out  the  door 
 your  hair  isn't  as  attractive  as  it 
 could  be  and  you  don't  even  realize  just 
 how  much  this  actually  improves  your
[07:10] attractiveness  and  if  we  want  to  test 
 this  go  and  look  at  every  single 
 celebrity  every  male  influencer  every
[07:15] YouTuber  every  guy  who's  in  the  public 
 light  style  hair  every  single  one  of 
 them  even  the  guys  who  have  messy  hair
[07:20] have  meticulously  styled  it  like  that 
 you  will  never  see  a  guy  who's  in  the 
 public  light  who's  you  know  quite  famous
[07:26] or  something  who's  going  out  with  like 
 bed  hair  unless  the  only  times  you  do 
 see  that  sometimes  and  when  is  it  when 
 like  their  life  has  been  [ __ ]  and
[07:32] they've  got  a  DUI  for  like  running  over 
 a  family  or  some  [ __ ]  either  going  to 
 court  and  you  see  like  a  bad  picture  of 
 a  celebrity  and  [ __ ]  that's  what  your
[07:37] hair  looks  like bro  you  walk  into  school 
 or  into  work  looking  like  these 
 celebrities  like  mug  shot  after  like
[07:42] they  have  to  go  to  court  and  [ __ ]  man 
 and  in  terms  of  actually  getting  the 
 product  and  style  in  your  hair  I  watched 
 a  bunch  of  like  random  Youtube  tutorials
[07:48] and  none  of  them  even  helped  me  they 
 were  all  just  over  complicated  the 
 process  I  wanted  like  the  brain  dead 
 easy  way  so  this  is  literally  what  you
[07:54] do  right  you  go  to  the  shopping  other 
 thing  right  either  it's  gel  wax  it 
 doesn't  matter  buy  it  put  it  onto  this 
 mix  it  a  little  bit  like  this  and
[07:59] literally  just  style  your  hair  how  you 
 normally  would  like  want  to  make  it  look 
 good  usually  for  most  guys  if  you've  got
[08:05] like  short  to  medium  hair  you  literally 
 just  style  it  and  push  it  into  One 
 Direction  like  this  or  you  put  it  onto 
 your  things
[08:10] like  this  like  push  down  like  the  little 
 sides  a  bit  you  know  there's  a  bit 
 sticking  up  there  as  you  push  that  down
[08:15] when  you  have  this  stuff  in  your  hands 
 you  can  literally  like  decide  you  know 
 which  part  of  your  hair  is  where  so  it's 
 like  nice  and  boom  it's  looking  good  the
[08:20] second  way  to  instantly  improve  your 
 looks  is  with  what  you  wear  now  most 
 guys  aren't  On  My  Level  so  I  wear  a
[08:25] bathroom  everywhere  even  when  I'm  going 
 to  the  gym  even  when  I'm  in  business 
 meetings  and  so  obviously  you  can't 
 really  compete  with  this  level  of  attire
[08:31] but  if  you  did  want  to  wear  a  bathrobe 
 then  obviously  you  become  a  tense  true 
 you  know  my  fashion  sense  was  bad
[08:36] because  it  was  aligned  with  my  views  on 
 hair  which  was  like  wait  why  would  I  buy 
 new  clothes  that's  gay  and  it's
[08:41] expensive  so  I  used  to  think  these 
 things  when  I  was  15  16.  and  truthfully 
 I  was  deeply  insecure  because  I  would
[08:48] say  these  things  like  I  would  say  these 
 in  my  mind  or  you  know  I  would  just 
 never  go  shopping  I  had  these  beliefs 
 right  and  yet  in  my  mind  honestly  I'd  be
[08:54] admiring  like  the  attractive  guy  who 
 looked  good  who  had  good  hair  who  had 
 good  fashion  he  was  wearing  good  clean
[08:59] clothes  and  I'd  be  sat  there  with  like 
 the  creased  shirt  that  was  in  the  bottom 
 of  my  wardrobe  you're  like  the  pile  in
[09:04] your  [ __ ]  wardrobe  like  there's  a  few 
 things  hung  up  and  then  there's  just  the 
 pile  and  like  I  pick  out  a  shirt  there 
 that  usually  looks  good  it's  creased  but
[09:09] I  don't  even  realize  and  you're  just  not 
 presenting  your  best  self  to  the  world 
 do  you  think  the  men  you  look  up  to  are
[09:14] not  thinking  about  what  they  were  you 
 think  Tristan  Tate  or  Andrew  Tate  are 
 waking  up  going  to  the  Wardrobe  seeing  a
[09:19] big  pile  on  the  floor  and  rooting 
 through  it  for  like  a  little  shitty  like 
 crease  crunchy  shirt  obviously  not
[09:24] you've  got  to  care  about  how  you  dress 
 and  a  lot  of  guys  just  don't  because  we 
 just  don't  know  what  the  [ __ ]  to  do 
 honestly  because  no  one's  actually  told
[09:29] you  you  know  your  mum  bought  you  some 
 shitty  clothes  that  you  didn't  even  look 
 good  in  that  you're  like  hudgy  little 
 fat  titties  man  titties  and  like  your
[09:35] lower  belly  fat  was  sticking  out  of  your 
 skinny  arms  and  stuff  and  so  you've 
 never  been  able  to  really  like  what  to
[09:40] buy  so  this  is  what  you  do  hopefully 
 you've  already  been  going  to  the  gym  for 
 a  little  bit  and  you've  been  building 
 some  muscle  and  reducing  your  body  fat
[09:46] the  best  way  to  look  good  in  clothes  is 
 actually  to  look  good  naked  first  so 
 what  you  need  to  do  for  the  long  term
[09:51] right  I'm  just  going  to  briefly  say  is 
 build  an  aesthetic  body  you  need  to  do 
 the  kind  of  workouts  that  literally 
 build  your  body  to  look  good  I've  linked
[09:57] seven  free  workouts  in  the  description 
 of  this  video  next  you  need  to  go 
 shopping  for  clothes  that  look  good  and 
 I'm  just  going  to  tell  you  the  truth  I
[10:02] mostly  just  wear  gym  clothes  everywhere 
 you  want  to  find  your  style  so  some  guys 
 really  like  dressing  professionally  you
[10:07] see  like  the  Tates  and  you  know  these 
 professional  men  they  literally  seem  to 
 wear  a  suit  like  everyone  what  like 
 they're  in  the  gym  wearing  a  suit  and
[10:12] [ __ ]  there's  other  guys  who  wear  like 
 smart  casual  my  friend  Sam  wears  colored 
 shirts  with  like  smarter  jeans  and 
 everything  here's  the  thing  about
[10:17] improving  how  you  dress  you  don't  have 
 to  change  the  kind  of  things  that  you 
 wear  you  just  have  to  wear  the  better  of
[10:23] the  same  thing  so  for  example  if  you  are 
 someone  who  totally  relates  and  totally 
 desires  to  dress  smart  and  you  want  to
[10:28] wear  shirts  and  tucked  in  pants  and 
 stuff  then  find  a  way  to  get  closer  and 
 closer  to  your  ideal  like  fashion  sense
[10:33] to  take  a  picture  of  the  best  guy  that 
 you  see  so  you  go  Google  Tristan  Tate 
 suits  and  you  start  to  take  inspiration
[10:38] from  like  the  things  that  he's  got  there 
 and  the  best  thing  that  you  can  do  is 
 try  and  buy  the  exact  same  kind  of  set
[10:43] or  color  or  style  but  you  see  that's  if 
 you  actually  like  that  style  already 
 because  here's  the  issue  of  the  guy  like
[10:48] me  and  maybe  like  you  when  I  was  growing 
 up  and  I  really  wanted  to  improve  how  I 
 dress  and  I  would  search  online  all  of 
 these  guys  with  skinny  necks  who  don't
[10:54] even  go  to  the  gym  we're  giving  this 
 advice  of  like  oh  yeah  just  go  to  this 
 shop  and  just  buy  like  seven  pairs  of 
 chinos  and  buy  like  this  checkered  shirt
[10:59] and  tuck  it  in  and  stuff  and  what  was 
 happening  was  that  most  people  were 
 giving  advice  for  their  fashion  sense
[11:04] and  not  for  yours  so  by  taking  a  random 
 person's  advice  online  they'll  end  up 
 looking  and  feeling  weird  because  you're
[11:10] not  supposed  to  be  the  kind  of  guy  who 
 wears  those  kinds  of  clothing  so  for  me 
 personally  the  thing  is  I  might  look
[11:15] good  in  a  suit  but  I  don't  want  to  wear 
 one  I  might  look  good  wearing  smart 
 clothes  tucked  in  Chino
[11:21] I  might  look  good  like  that  but  guess 
 what  I  don't  want  to  wear  one  bro  I 
 don't  like  it  this  other  guys  would 
 really  like  that  they  should  do  that  but
[11:27] for  me  I  like  wearing  gym  clothes  so 
 first  of  all  step  one  of  improving  well 
 Step  Zero  is  first  go  to  the  gym  at
[11:32] least  don't  be  fat  try  and  reduce  your 
 body  fat  that's  like  the  long-standing 
 step  one  is  to  choose  and  to  figure  out
[11:37] what  kind  of  clothes  you  actually  like 
 because  if  you  like  and  feel  good 
 wearing  the  smart  kind  of  clothes  then
[11:42] maybe  you  want  to  do  that  if  you  like 
 and  feeling  good  wearing  more  of  the 
 comfy  casual  clothes  you  still  want  to 
 do  that  that's  still  step  one  right  but
[11:47] then  step  two  is  once  you've  defined 
 which  kind  of  clothing  you  like  we  need 
 to  find  the  best  kind  of  clothing  in
[11:52] that  category  because  for  my  life  I've 
 always  wanted  like  a  comfy  or  casual 
 clothes  and  yeah  I  was  always  wearing
[11:57] like  the  [ __ ]  version  of  these  I  was 
 always  wearing  like  these  [ __ ]  random 
 brands  that  you  buy  for  like  five  pounds 
 and  as  there  it  just  doesn't  look  good
[12:02] or  anything  it's  not  like  tapered  down 
 correctly  I  was  buying  like  these 
 weirdly  like  thin  no  style  whatsoever
[12:08] like  jogger  pants  which  just  left  like  a 
 [ __ ]  ugly  ass  dick  print  and  moving 
 everything  so  then  what  I  did  to  improve
[12:14] my  fashion  sets  I  knew  okay  I  like 
 wearing  gym  clothes  you  go  to  the  best 
 gym  clothing  store  that  there  are  around
[12:19] or  you  know  if  you  really  like  wearing 
 small  clothes  and  you  go  to  those 
 clothes  and  you  go  try  on  a  bunch  of 
 things  and  the  best  advice  I  can  give
[12:24] you  that  really  improve  my  look  is  that 
 you  want  to  find  sets  that  go  together 
 assets  means  like  pants  and  shirt  right
[12:30] it's  always  better  to  wear  the  same  ones 
 so  you  get  a  set  which  is  like  black 
 night  shorts  and  black  night  shirt  it's 
 together  you  buy  that  and  you  look  so
[12:36] much  better  than  buying  like  a  random 
 one  and  a  random  one  and  a  random  one 
 and  a  random  one  so  this  is  exactly  what
[12:41] I  would  do  if  I  was  starting  again  and 
 I'm  actually  going  to  do  this  soon  save 
 up  a  little  bit  of  budget  right 
 obviously  it's  dependent  for  me  the 
 budget  might  be  a  few  hundred  pounds  for
[12:47] you  it  might  be  25  pounds  right  go  to 
 the  store  that  you  can  afford  that  has 
 the  kind  of  style  of  clothes  that  you 
 like  try  on  a  bunch  of  things  and  the
[12:53] best  thing  you  can  do  pick  out  the 
 pre-made  set  of  the  outfit  and  buy  like 
 five  of  them  seven  of  them  not  the  same
[12:58] one  if  you  want  but  like  so  for  example 
 I  buy  this  you  know  Black  Knights  shorts 
 sure  then  I  buy  another  one  this  is  like
[13:03] a  gray  under  armor  hoodie  and  pants  for 
 example  and  you  buy  them  and  then  when 
 I'm  going  to  the  gym  or  I'm  doing 
 anything  else  I'd  always  just  wear  the
[13:09] same  set  over  and  over  again  and  you 
 look  so  much  better  and  the  same  with 
 for  example  a  suit  or  some  smart
[13:14] clothing  you  could  do  some  mix  and 
 matching  if  you  want  but  the  best  look 
 really  comes  is  when  you  get  the  suit 
 together  you  get  the  pants  that  goes
[13:19] with  the  Blazer  that  goes  with  the  shirt 
 and  then  you  you  wear  that  look  whenever 
 it's  applicable  for  the  environment  that
[13:24] you  go  in  it  because  for  the  longest 
 time  in  my  own  personal  like  fashion 
 journey  I  literally  just  got  the  clothes
[13:29] like  you  know  my  Mumbo  I  bought  some 
 random  clothes  here  some  random  t-shirt 
 here  some  random  pants  here  and  I  wore
[13:34] individual  clothing  that  I  thought  was 
 nice  so  for  example  I  wore  the  same 
 jeans  that  I  always  wear  then  I  wore  a
[13:39] shirt  that  I  liked  and  then  the  next  day 
 I  wore  some  shorts  that  I  like  and  then 
 I  wore  a  shirt  with  it  which  I  liked  and 
 it  was  always  mixed  and  matched  and  it
[13:45] always  just  didn't  really  look  like  it 
 went  together  up  until  I  discovered  this 
 concept  of  like  buying  a  set  and  wearing
[13:50] that  and  it's  like  since  then  since  my 
 like  college  Years  and  University  years 
 since  I've  started  doing  this  and  I  just
[13:56] wear  like  the  same  kind  of  like  double 
 clothing  you  know  pant  shirt  that's  been 
 made  to  go  together  I  think  I  look  a  lot
[14:01] better  so  you  can  Implement  that  bro 
 pause  the  check  this  is  you  right  now 
 bro 
 posture  check  and  that  is  actually  the
[14:07] third  way  to  instantly  improve  your 
 looks  fix  your  posture  this  I  can  just 
 go  over  very  very  quickly  because  so
[14:12] many  guys  have  made  videos  on  this  I've 
 made  a  bunch  of  videos  my  body  language 
 and  posture  if  you  have  the  posture  of  a
[14:17] beta  male  of  a  weak  man  of  a  slouched 
 man  people  are  gonna  treat  you  like  that 
 to  instantly  improve  your  attractiveness
[14:22] literally  just  straighten  it  up  and  this 
 is  the  rule  that  I  followed  for  so  long 
 that  I'm  just  going  to  leave  you  with
[14:27] your  posture  and  your  body  language 
 should  be  so  straight  and  confident  that 
 you  actually  get  some  like  negative
[14:32] thoughts  about  it  thinking  that  you're 
 doing  too  much  that  shows  that  you've 
 actually  improved  it  enough  because  our
[14:37] postures  you  know  our  modern  posture 
 even  if  you're  not  someone  who's  got 
 like  extreme  like  forwardness  or 
 anything  oh  modern  posture  is  so  [ __ ]
[14:42] that  once  you  have  good  posture  it 
 actually  feels  a  little  bit  normal  but 
 that  is  actually  a  good  level  to  be  on
[14:48] even  if  you  might  think  oh  that  [ __ ] 
 from  school  or  from  your  workplace  who 
 bullies  you  who's  not  even  a  friend  who 
 you  know  he  might  make  fun  of  you  like
[14:53] your  sit-ups  right  it's  like  who  gives  a 
 [ __ ]  he's  gonna  make  fun  of  you  anyway 
 right  so  at  that  point  it's  like  just  by 
 sitting  up  straight  and  by  you  know
[14:59] walking  straight  with  your  chest  out  and 
 you  walk  in  with  your  chest  first  with 
 your  chin  a  little  bit  higher  your 
 shoulders  back  you  want  it  to  feel  a
[15:04] little  bit  a  little  bit  force  a  little 
 bit  too  far  and  that  is  the  correct
[15:09] level  to  hold  click  and  watch  this  video 
 right  now  do  the  hard  work  especially 
 when  you  don't  feel  like  it  mwah
