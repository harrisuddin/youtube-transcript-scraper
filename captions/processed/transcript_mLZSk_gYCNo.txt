[00:00] Jeffrey  is  clueless  he  has  been  speaking 
 to  Jessica  for  ages  but  he  still  hasn't 
 made  his  move
[00:05] [Music] 
 come  on  Jeffrey  the  signs  are  right 
 there  she  likes  you
[00:12] oh  no  it's  too  late  Jeffrey  she  has  a 
 boyfriend  now
[00:18] he  cries  in  his  room  for  days  and  days 
 weeks  and  weeks  months  and  months  if
[00:23] only  he  could  have  seen  the  signs  Adonis 
 Adonis  has  seen  what  it's  like  when  a
[00:29] woman  is  infatuated  with  a  man  after  all 
 he  was  raised  by  parents  in  a  beautiful
[00:34] loving  marriage  and  he  saw  how  his 
 mother  acted  around  his  father  and  so 
 going  out  into  the  world  he  knows  with
[00:40] almost  perfect  accuracy  when  a  woman 
 likes  him  congratulations  Adonis 
 Anastasia  is  now  yours  a  worthy  Queen
[00:47] for  the  tribe  listen  to  this  there's  a 
 three-step  process  that  will  probably 
 eliminate  all  of  the  problems  you're
[00:53] having  with  your  date  in  like  Just  Three 
 Steps  step  one  improve  yourself  become 
 more  attractive  more  successful  be 
 better  with  girls  and  stuff  step  two  be
[00:59] aware  of  the  hidden  signs  of  when  a  girl 
 likes  you  which  we're  going  to  cover  in 
 this  video  and  then  step  three  know  how
[01:04] and  when  to  make  a  move  which  I've 
 covered  in  previous  videos  we  can  have 
 it  called  pop  up  on  screen  if  you  want
[01:09] to  watch  that  when  I  was  21  years  old 
 and  I  was  in  my  second  year  of 
 University  there  was  a  female  friend 
 that  I  had  who  was  in  the  same  like
[01:14] classes  as  me  so  we  both  studied 
 psychology  and  I  had  been  friends  with 
 her  like  you  know  like  friends  like  yo
[01:19] you  see  each  other  in  classroom  abuse 
 each  other  on  a  night  out  and  like  if 
 the  opportunity  arose  I  would  I  wouldn't
[01:24] ever  say  that  there  was  like  sexual 
 tension  because  I  wasn't  really  aware  of 
 it  I  was  almost  like  too  scared  to  you
[01:29] know  even  pursue  anything  even  though 
 like  I  didn't  really  have  feelings  for 
 her  but  like  you  know  I  would  have 
 smashed  but  like  it  wasn't  never  very
[01:34] clear  but  then  things  changed  on  her 
 birthday  and  she  invited  me  to  like  come 
 celebrate  in  a  club  with  her  and  her
[01:39] friends  and  I'm  out  there  we're  like 
 drinking  dancing  and  stuff  and  it's  out 
 of  nowhere  like  you  know  the  eye  contact 
 starts  and  just  suddenly  something
[01:45] clicked  and  I  was  like  oh  yeah  like  of 
 course  she  likes  me  like  I  had  missed 
 all  these  previous  signs  in  classic  you
[01:50] know  she's  texting  me  and  she  wants  to 
 like  hang  out  or  something  and  I'm  just 
 treating  her  like  a  friend  without 
 really  realizing  like  yeah  like  she  was
[01:55] sexually  interested  in  me  and  like  I 
 would  have  [ __ ]  bro  and  so  on  that 
 night  we  hook  up  it  was  like  one  of  the
[02:00] hottest  experience  I'm  not  gonna  lie 
 because  we  studied  in  the  same  class  and 
 so  what  would  happen  is  like  would  be 
 sat  in  our  lecture  just  you  know  paying
[02:06] attention  to  the  [ __ ]  lecturer  the 
 professor  or  something  sending  each 
 other  a  text  like  you  know  she  sat  maybe 
 10  meters  that  way  in  this  big  lecture
[02:11] hall  like  what  you're  doing  after  this 
 nothing  what  about  you  come  back  to  mine 
 we've  got  like  a  half  an  hour  break  one
[02:16] hour  break  between  lecture  and  the  next 
 lecture  we  go  back  to  my  place  which  is 
 nearby  I  start  having  sex  and  come  back
[02:21] like  it  was  a  very  like  nice  experience 
 to  have  with  this  girl  and  it  only 
 really  happened  because  eventually  I
[02:26] picked  up  the  hidden  in  the  signs  that 
 she  actually  liked  me  and  she  was 
 sexually  interested  in  me  so  right  now 
 there  might  be  a  girl  who's  actually
[02:31] into  you  but  your  brain  hasn't  even  like 
 comprehended  the  situation  so  there's 
 potentially  like  something  that  you
[02:37] could  get  out  of  this  there's  five 
 hidden  sides  that  a  girl  likes  you  and 
 number  one  and  my  favorite  is  that  she 
 makes  strong  eye  contact  now  once  you
[02:44] get  more  and  more  experience  with  girls 
 you  kind  of  realize  that  if  she  holds 
 your  eye  contact  chances  are  like  at
[02:49] least  you  know  you've  got  your 
 opportunity  to  like  shoot  your  shot  and 
 go  speak  to  it  but  when  you're  first 
 starting  off  and  you  know  you're  not  so
[02:54] confident  or  clued  up  with  girls  just  a 
 girl  kind  of  like  looking  at  you  as  she 
 talks  to  you  doesn't  feel  like  oh  yeah
[02:59] that's  her  invitation  saying  yeah  she 
 finds  you  hot  or  anything  but  genuinely 
 like  if  a  girl  holds  your  eye  contact
[03:04] with  like  really  good  strong  icons  like 
 it  gives  you  the  open  door  to  at  least 
 like  escalate  and  ask  things  further  now
[03:09] the  opposite  of  this  is  very  true  if  a 
 girl  has  like  very  fleeting  eye  contact 
 she  doesn't  really  look  at  you  imagine 
 she  walks  in  and  she  doesn't  even  look
[03:14] at  you  at  all  then  it's  like  well  she's 
 probably  not  interested  but  when  a  girl 
 for  example  walks  into  the  room  and
[03:19] literally  holds  your  eye  contact  with 
 like  a  big  smile  and  says  hello  it's 
 like  at  the  very  least  there's  something 
 going  on  there  the  second  sign  that  she
[03:25] might  be  interested  in  you  but  this  is  a 
 really  like  weird  one  that  we've  got  to 
 take  serious  and  a  lot  of  guys  [ __ ]
[03:30] this  one  up  actually  the  second  sign  is 
 that  she  sends  you  enthusiastic  replies 
 through  like  text  messaging  or  you  know
[03:36] Snapchat  or  whatever  the  reason  why  this 
 is  a  hidden  sign  that  she  likes  shoes 
 because  it  shows  the  level  of  interest
[03:41] that  you  know  she's  replying  to  you  and 
 obviously  if  she  wasn't  replying  to  you 
 at  all  then  that  would  be  very  clear 
 that  she's  not  into  you  but  we  need  to
[03:46] be  careful  here  because  a  lot  of  girls 
 will  just  reply  to  like  all  the  messages
[03:51] they  get  and  it's  very  easy  to  be  you 
 know  kind  of  like  a  young  guy  kind  of 
 Clueless  with  girls  to  have  like  some
[03:56] hot  girl  that  you're  interested  in  just 
 send  you  a  reply  and  you're  like  yes 
 well  you  know  she  might  oh  God  she  text 
 me  or  her  but  like  if  you  showed  it  like
[04:02] you  know  your  older  brother  who  was 
 better  with  girls  he'd  be  like  why  are 
 you getting  so  excited  like  she  sent  you 
 like  a  one-word  message  bro  there  was  a
[04:07] girl  one  of  the  first  girls  that  I  ever 
 matched  with  on  Tinder  when  I  was  like 
 literally  16  17  years  old  one  of  the
[04:12] first  girls  that  I  ever  even  like  didn't 
 fully  like  had  a  text  conversation  with 
 and  I  remember  this  girl  just  fully  like 
 strung  me  along  but  like  I  didn't  really
[04:18] know  what  was  happening  because  she 
 would  reply  to  my  messages  with  like  one 
 or  two  Word  answers  and  I  carried  you
[04:23] know  like  there's  a  lot  of  guys  do  like 
 carry  the  conversation  so  this  was  a 
 while  ago  but  I  I  literally  remembered 
 like  there  was  this  one  girl  that  was
[04:28] obsessed  with  and  I  would  literally  be 
 texting  her  stuff  like  oh  hey  Lego  what 
 have  you  been  up  to  and  she  just  replied 
 with  like  TV  comma  you  like  that  this
[04:35] was  our  conversation  like  every  day  and 
 I  was  like  so  happy  oh  my  God  she 
 replied  oh  wow  like  just  because  she
[04:40] replies  does  not  mean  that  she's  into 
 honestly  this  is  kind  of  like  [ __ ]  to 
 say  but  like  a  lot  of  girls  literally
[04:45] just  like  having  notifications  on  their 
 phone  honestly  like  a  lot  of  people  are 
 just  [ __ ]  up  in  the  head  and  so  a  lot 
 of  girls  and  guys  too  get  their  sense  of
[04:51] validation  from  just  the  amount  of 
 notifications  that  they  have  on  their 
 phone  and  you'll  know  this  is  the  case 
 where  if  you  kind  of  subtly  see  her  go
[04:57] onto  Snapchat  she'll  have  like  10 
 unopened  snaps  there  I've  not  used 
 Snapchat  in  a  while  and  like  I  don't
[05:02] date  any  women  who've  got  social  media 
 but  I  remember  when  I  was  back  in  that 
 sort  of  like  normal  people  scene  of 
 having  social  media  like  this  is
[05:07] offensive  to  say  but  like  the  girls  I 
 knew  instantly  who  weren't  [ __ ]  were  the 
 ones  who  had  Snapchat  and  Instagram  and
[05:12] everything  and  they  just  had  one  open 
 message  after  unopened  message  like  10 
 messages  that  they've  not  opened  for 
 like  two  days  and  what  it  essentially
[05:17] means  is  that  they're  just  stringing 
 along  some  chump  who's  like  waiting  for 
 his  reply  so  obviously  you  don't  want  to
[05:22] be  in  that  situation  but  you  also  don't 
 want  to  be  in  the  situation  when  a 
 girl's  texting  you  enthusiastically  and
[05:27] you  think  that  that's  like  the  sign  for 
 you  like  you  know  like  hopefully  oh  yeah 
 she  likes  me  it's  very  interesting  you
[05:32] know  I've  just  told  you  about  like  she's 
 got  a  tent  on  open  SnapChat  there  was  a 
 girl  like  I  was  hooking  up  with  through 
 the  lockdown  yeah  like  I  disobed
[05:37] lockdown  who  gives  a  [ __ ]  bro  I  was 
 [ __ ]  this  girl  in  the  woods  like 
 multiple  times  a  week  in  2021  and  you
[05:43] know  she  was  like  the  girl  who  I  saw 
 like  all  these  unopened  snapchats  on  her 
 phone  and  everything  I  just  thought  yeah 
 that's  like  some  DJ  and  [ __ ]  like  [ __ ]
[05:49] texting  this  way  I  remember  that  this 
 same  girl  had  a  guy  who  was  almost  like 
 this  is  kind  of  bad  today  but  almost
[05:54] like  the  beta  male  version  of  me  like 
 she  showed  me  pictures  like  me  and  her 
 were  just  hooking  up  right  so  I  was 
 literally  just  like  the  chat  in  this
[05:59] situation  but  he  looked  like  a  verse 
 version  of  me  but  he  just  wasn't  like 
 cool  about  it  he  was  getting  so  over
[06:04] excited  about  the  enthusiastic  messages 
 so  they  were  having  like  their  long  text 
 conversations  she'd  put  me  on  her
[06:09] Snapchat  story  like  us  doing  silly  [ __ ] 
 were  out  at  night  time  or  something  and 
 she's  like  pulled  up  my  shirt  like  I  was 
 very  lean  I  had  like  Rock  Solid  ads  so
[06:15] she'd  put  onto  a  Snapchat  story  like 
 pulling  up  my  hoodie  or  something  and 
 showing  my  abs  like  whoa  like  whatever 
 and  the  same  guy  would  reply  like  when
[06:20] me  and  her  were  out  like  literally  just 
 about  to  have  sex  in  like  the  woods  of 
 the  car  or  something  why  are  you  going
[06:25] out  with  this  guy  like 
 they  had  been  texting  for  a  while  they 
 had  I  believe  like  a  42-day  Snapchat
[06:30] streak  like  when  you  send  someone  a 
 message  every  single  day  on  Snapchat 
 it's  like  you  get  like  an  emoji  or  some 
 [ __ ]  so  this  hidden  sign  is  you  know  a
[06:36] girl  texts  you  back  enthusiastically  but 
 we  have  to  be  very  careful  because  it 
 can  mean  that  she's  into  but  it  can  also
[06:42] just  mean  that  she's  just  [ __ ] 
 playing  you  along  just  because  she  likes 
 like  just  having  some  validation  and 
 like  you  know  the  extra  notification
[06:47] dopamine  from  you  so  you've  got  to 
 figure  out  right  here  right  now  which 
 one  are  you  are  you  the  guy  who  she's 
 texting  enthusiastically  because  she
[06:52] actually  really  likes  you  and  she's  like 
 down  to  me  or  are  you  the  guy  who  she's 
 enthusiastically  texting  you  just
[06:57] because  she  likes  having  notifications 
 let's  move  on  and  talk  about  the  third 
 hidden  sign  that  a  girl  likes  you  and
[07:02] this  is  one  that  a  lot  of  guys  don't 
 actually  pick  up  on  and  it's  that  she 
 invades  your  personal  space  and  she 
 makes  almost  unnecessary  physical
[07:08] contact  so  in  other  words  like  she  gets 
 physically  just  close  to  you  maybe  she 
 like  touches  your  arm  and  she  talks  you
[07:13] know  you  make  her  laugh  and  she  goes 
 like 
 a  lot  of  guys  are  quite  jumpy  I'm  not
[07:18] gonna  lie  like  if  a  girl  or  even  like  a 
 guy  touches  like  most  guys  haven't 
 actually  been  touched  and  I  don't  say
[07:23] that  and  like  oh  you  said  touch  thing  oh 
 that's  funny  you're  beautiful  or  some 
 [ __ ]  like  I'm  actually  saying  like  most 
 guys  don't  get  enough  physical  touch  in
[07:29] their  life  something  just  like  [ __ ] 
 weirdly  like  stiff  and  just  like  weirdly 
 like  AFK  in  their  own  bodies  and  so  a
[07:34] lot  of  guys  when  a  girl  is  touching  them 
 and  stuff  that's  one  of  the  best  signs 
 you're  gonna  have  honestly  I  remember 
 when  I  used  to  go  to  clubs  you  know  I'd
[07:40] be  in  the  smoking  area  talking  to  girls 
 that  I  wanted  to  hook  up  with  there  and 
 then  in  that  night  and  I  would  know  for 
 certain  which  girl  I  was  eventually
[07:45] going  to  go  and  sleep  with  that  same 
 night  because  when  we'd  be  talking  she'd 
 be  like  way  more  touching  me  than  other
[07:50] girls  so  some  girls  will  talk  to  you 
 like  this  like  [ __ ]  masculine  ass 
 like  yeah  well  well  what  are  you
[07:55] studying  uni  yeah  like  you  know  some 
 girls  will  talk  to  you  like  that  and  all 
 the  girls  will  be  probably  cute  and 
 literally  like  touching  you  laughing
[08:00] like  you'll  make  them  laugh  they'll  like 
 put  their  hand  like  this  a  little  bit 
 like  that's  one  of  the  best  signs  you 
 can  have  but  a  lot  of  guys  don't  pick  up
[08:05] on  it  because  they're  just  so  [ __ ] 
 like  weird  and  their  bodies  bro  if  a 
 girl  is  touching  you  in  a  good  positive 
 way  and  she  just  finds  a  reason  to  get
[08:10] close  to  you  to  touch  you  until  I  put 
 her  hand  like  this  so  she  does  this  when 
 all  this  stuff  like  that's  such  a  good
[08:15] sign  that  she's  actually  more  into  you 
 than  you  realize  is  because  the  opposite 
 of  this  is  also  very  true  if  a  woman  is
[08:20] not  into  you  at  all  she  will  try  her 
 absolute  best  to  stay  a  little  bit
[08:25] further  away  from  you  and  like  not  touch 
 you  at  all  and  you  might  be  wondering  oh 
 wait  what  about  her  sort  of  you  know 
 personal  individual  differences  what  if
[08:30] oh  you  know  she's  you  were  she  told  me 
 that  she  just  doesn't  like  getting 
 hundreds  bro  I'm  telling  you  right  now
[08:35] some  girl  who  tells  you like  oh  I  don't 
 like  being  hug  is  like 
 she  doesn't  like  being  hugged  by  you  bro 
 oh  I  don't  like  being  touched  by  people
[08:41] she  doesn't  like  being  touched  by  you 
 honestly  like  I'm  sorry  to  say  that  bro 
 but  it's  the  truth  it's  like  yeah  you 
 know  people  can  be  very  different  some
[08:46] people  can  like  being  hugged  some  people 
 might  not  like  it  but  generally  if  she 
 like  doesn't  like  being  physical  around
[08:51] you  at  all  and  you  make  her  jump  when 
 you  accidentally  touched  her  or 
 something  she's  probably  not  that 
 interested  and  even  if  she  was  let's  say
[08:56] she's  just  got  this  like  weird  you  know 
 jumpy  physical  thing  where  like  she 
 can't  be  physical  with  someone  why  would
[09:01] she  be  interested  in  a  girl  like  that 
 anyway  man  like  I  think  being  physical 
 with  the  girl  that  you're  eventually 
 gonna  date  is  so  [ __ ]  important  and
[09:06] if  there  is  a  girl  who's  like  oh  well  I 
 don't  like  being  touched  by  people  it's 
 like  come  on  man  if  you  respect  yourself
[09:11] you  probably  get  out  of  that  situation 
 the  fourth  sign  that  a  girl  likes  you  is 
 the  kind  of  conversation  you'll  have  and 
 it's  that  she'll  share  some  intimate
[09:17] emotional  Parts  about  her  so  she'll  open 
 up  and  she'll  tell  you  things  about  like 
 her  dreams  her  failure  she'll  tell  you
[09:23] about  her  family  she'll  start  to  open  up 
 a  little  bit  and  I  remember  the  first 
 night  I  ever  met  my  girl  we  were  in 
 Thailand  so  we  were  both  like  traveling
[09:29] around  Thailand  separately  we  ended  up 
 meeting  up  and  she  came  over  to  my  Villa 
 on  like  literally  the  last  night  before
[09:34] me  and  my  friend  Sam  we're  gonna  fly  out 
 of  Thailand  so  you  know  it  was  like  a 
 little  leaving  party  of  like  5  five  six 
 people  she  came  over  and  I  remember  that
[09:40] our  first  conversation  did  so  well  just 
 because  you  know  we  started  opening  up  a 
 little  bit  and  we  spoke  about  like
[09:45] self-improvement  and  everything  you  know 
 she  was  like  so  interested  in  what  I  was 
 saying  and  then  I  remember  like  she  kind
[09:50] of  hinted  at  some  like  mental  health 
 issue  a  little  bit  like  not  like  of  now 
 but  like  obvious  you  know  something
[09:55] she'd  experienced  previously  when  she 
 was  a  little  bit  younger  I  feel  like 
 having  bad  mental  health  and  that's 
 something  I'm  very  interested  in  like  I
[10:01] love  speaking  about  mental  health  and 
 you  know  it  means  a  lot  to  me  so  when  I 
 asked  her  another  question  and  she  was 
 like  oh  no  like  I  don't  really  like  you
[10:06] know  like  I  don't  really  open  up  about 
 that  stuff  but  then  the  next  day  when  I 
 saw  her  again  and  she  literally  opened
[10:11] up  and  fully  told  me  like  deep  stuff  as 
 I  broke  him  on  I  knew  right  there  right 
 then  they're  like  okay  she's  got  to  be
[10:16] very  interested  in  me  if  she's  just 
 opened  up  about  something  serious  and  so 
 you  can  maybe  keep  that  story  in  mind  if
[10:21] there's  a  girl  who  opens  up  to  you  about 
 something  that  she  probably  wouldn't  you 
 know  broadcast  to  other  people  that  can
[10:26] be  a  sign  that  she  likes  you  and  she 
 trusts  you  and  she  sees  something  like 
 kind  of  secure  with  you  now  on  the  other
[10:31] hand  it  can  also  be  girls  who  are  just 
 quite  open  and  you  know  they're  just 
 loud  with  this  sort  of  intimate  moments 
 and  you  know  there's  the  kind  of  people
[10:36] who  will  openly  post  on  Instagram  about 
 their  family  problems  or  something  so 
 that's  a  person  who's  like  very  very
[10:41] open  so  maybe  then  opening  up  to  you  is 
 not  as  special  as  it  could  be  but  it's 
 just  something  to  keep  in  mind  if  she
[10:46] does  get  into  these  deep  conversations 
 with  you  chances  are  she  likes  you  more 
 than  just  like  an  NPC  that  she's  just
[10:51] met  the  fifth  hidden  sign  that  a  girl 
 likes  you  is  that  she  will  talk  about
[10:56] you  to  her  friends  her  female  friends 
 and  so  this  is  going  to  be  the  case 
 where  like  a  girl  likes  you  imagine
[11:01] she's  in  your  class  in  school  or  in  your 
 workplace  she  likes  you  you  know  she's 
 eyeing  you  up  a  little  bit  but  you  don't
[11:06] even  realize  she'll  speak  about  you  to 
 her  friends  like  oh  did  you  see  that  guy 
 but  you  won't  really  know  about  this
[11:11] because  her  friends  probably  won't  run 
 over  and  like  straight  away  tell  you 
 unless  if  you  get  a  little  bit  closer  to
[11:16] a  friend  so  I  remember  this  happening  I 
 remember  in  University  there  was  like  a 
 group  of  like  Pakistani  like  loud  girls
[11:22] who  came  in  late  and  everything  but  they 
 were  like  pretty  attractive  I  didn't 
 know  this  at  the  time  but  like  it  turned 
 out  they  were  almost  like  a  little  bit
[11:27] obsessed  with  me  and  I  didn't  really 
 know  this  but  I  literally  like  the  story 
 that  this  one  girl  told  me  I  was  like 
 holy  [ __ ]  these  girls  were  obsessed  with
[11:33] me  for  a  long  time  and  I  didn't  even 
 realize  so  hopefully  you  can  like  learn 
 from  my  mistakes  here  because  I  could 
 have  capitalized  on  this  way  better  but
[11:39] eventually  like  I  ended  up  messaging  one 
 of  the  girls  on  Instagram  she  comes  over 
 and  like  you  know  things  get  a  little 
 bit  heated  but  just  like  talking  like
[11:45] afterwards  she  tells  me  about  her 
 friends  and  everything  and  she's  like  oh 
 yeah  like  one  of  my  friends  was  telling 
 me  like  that  one  time  that  you  like
[11:50] dropped  a  pen  next  to  her  what  like  oh 
 yeah  like  you  know  like  essentially  she
[11:55] told  me  a  story  that  was  of  significance 
 to  her  and  her  friends  that  like  I 
 dropped  a  pen  next  to  them  and  I  like
[12:00] just  picked  it  back  up  and  they're  like 
 oh  my  god  oh  like  he  dropped  the  bed 
 next  to  us  oh  like  this  is  one  that  I
[12:05] missed  myself  so  maybe  it's  something 
 somehow  you  can  find  that  the  girl  that 
 you're  interested  in  has  been  talking
[12:10] about  you  to  her  female  friend  so  I 
 don't  know  how  you  do  this  maybe  you'll 
 go  speak  to  her  female  friends  or  become
[12:15] more  friendly  with  them  she 
 that  probably  won't  work  because  like
[12:20] the  girls  will  like  conserve  their 
 secrets  but  if  for  example  inhibitions 
 are  lowered  if  for  example  you're  like
[12:25] 18  21  you're  going  out  drinking  and  you 
 see  that  girl  that  you're  interested  in 
 you  see  her  friends  and  you  end  up  you
[12:30] know  just  vibing  with  them  they  will 
 probably  encourage  you  to  do  this  so 
 this  is  probably  the  more  realistic
[12:35] scenario  if  you  get  into  more  of  like  a 
 sexual  more  mature  environment  like 
 going  out  to  a  club  or  a  party  and  you
[12:40] see  for  example  there's  your  girl  in  her 
 group  of  friends  and  you  end  up  just 
 vibing  with  her  friends  you  may  be
[12:45] drinking  or  something  dancing  and  stuff 
 then  eventually  her  friends  might  be 
 like  oh  yeah  like  have  you  spoke  to 
 Sarah  today  like  that's  the  sign  bro
[12:50] that's  literally  him  saying  like  go 
 speak  to  her  stop  being  a  dumbass  go 
 speak  to  her  right  now  bro  come  on  now
[12:56] you've  heard  these  hidden  signs  that  a 
 girl  might  be  into  you  but  there  could 
 be  a  chance  that  you're  sat  here  and  you
[13:02] have  this  almost  limiting  belief  where 
 you  think  that  a  girl  who's  into  you  is 
 just  being  friendly  because  chances  are
[13:09] you've  grown  up  without  much  female 
 attraction  and  the  way  that  we've  been 
 conditioned  and  you  know  like
[13:14] brainwashed  and  you  know  like  influence 
 to  navigate  our  relationships  with  women 
 has  been  made  so  like  depolarized  and
[13:20] demasculine  you  know  it's  like  we're 
 kind  of  pushed  to  like  not  be  upfront 
 with  a  girl  that  we're  into  aren't  we
[13:25] we're  kind  of  pushed  to  be  more  like 
 passive  these  days  and  to  not  pursue 
 it's  almost  seen  as  a  bad  thing  to  go  up 
 and  speak  to  the  girls  it's  like  oh  wow
[13:31] looks  that's  like  socially  weird  or 
 anything  so  chances  are  you  might  even 
 have  like  this  [ __ ]  up  belief  in  your 
 mind  with  a  girl  who  is  into  you  you
[13:37] just  think  she's  just  being  friendly 
 just  because  you've  been  raised  in  a  way 
 to  believe  that  like  men  and  women  are
[13:42] supposed  to  be  friends  and  like  we  can 
 do  everything  each  other  can  or  maybe  an 
 even  sadder  notes  is  that  you  just  don't
[13:47] even  believe  that  women  could  be 
 attracted  to  you  maybe  you've  kept  in 
 mind  this  belief  that  you  are  just
[13:52] simply  not  attractive  to  girls  and  so 
 you  literally  have  convinced  yourself 
 that  any  of  these  signs  don't  mean
[13:57] anything  and  maybe  you've  been  watching 
 this  video  thinking  oh  the  last  sign 
 doesn't  mean  oh  this  one  doesn't  know 
 this  one  doesn't  women  are  attracted  to
[14:02] me  maybe  you've  just  convinced  yourself 
 that  you're  ugly  and  girls  aren't 
 attracted  to  you  and  I  did  the  exact
[14:07] same  thing  bro  I  fully  had  convinced 
 myself  when  I  was  growing  up  that  I  was 
 ugly  that  you  know  if  I  was  brown  skin
[14:12] I'm  Pakistani  so  I  thought  girls  weren't 
 attracted  to  like  Pakistan  oh  there's  no 
 way  like  every  girl  thinks  I'm  a 
 terrorist  these  were  dead  ass  real
[14:18] thoughts  that  I  had  about  myself  I 
 literally  thought  I  was  like  so  ugly 
 when  I  looked  back  and  I  was  like  when  I
[14:23] was you  know  15  16  17  18  like  I  wasn't 
 very  very  hot  but  I  wasn't  ugly  as  well 
 I  wasn't  like  you  know  two  out  of  ten  or
[14:28] some  [ __ ]  like  I  wasn't  ugly  but  I 
 had  this  false  belief  that  I  was  and  so 
 I  acted  like  it  and  so  when  there  were
[14:34] literally  was  you  know  girls  like  I 
 could  have  dated  when  I  was  in  high 
 school  or  a  little  bit  older  there  was 
 girls  who  were  into  me  who  I  found  out
[14:40] later  on  they  were  into  me  but  I  just 
 simply  didn't  even  see  the  signs  because 
 I  had  convinced  myself  that  no  girls 
 could  be  into  me  because  I  was  ugly  and
[14:46] you  know  I  was  brown  skinned  and  girls 
 don't  like  brown  guys  and  this  honestly 
 gets  so  much  deeper  than  just  you  know 
 this  like  surface  level  video  we  know
[14:51] this  video  is  going  to  perform  well 
 that's  why  I've  titled  it  and  the  five 
 hidden  signs  like  it's  a  very  like 
 clickbait  topic  you  know  this  video  it
[14:56] goes  so  much  deeper  because  so  many  guys 
 don't  even  realize  girls  could  be  into
[15:01] them  like  you've  been  totally  convinced 
 that  you're  just  one  of  those  guys  who's 
 never  gonna  get  lazy  who's  never  gonna
[15:06] get  girls  and  stuff  I  think  this  guy's 
 so  much  more  serious  when  you  start  to 
 think  like  this  is  probably  because  you
[15:11] haven't  had  like  a  very  masculine 
 present  father  because  if  you  really  had 
 like  a  masculine  prison  father  and  you
[15:16] know  he  was  very  loving  to  all  towards 
 his  wife  your  mother  then  you  would  have 
 like  seen  how  it  is  to  navigate
[15:21] relationships  with  women  but  we  don't 
 really  see  that  these  days  some  parts  of 
 the  world  are  so  messed  up  with  like  you
[15:27] don't  see  fathers  in  the  home  you  just 
 see  like  your  single  mother  struggling 
 to  raise  you
[15:32] and  then  at  school  you  don't  really  see 
 this  you're  not  promoted  to  be  like 
 quite  masculine  and  forward  with  your
[15:38] intentions  like  every  man  has  before  us 
 and  so  I  think  young  men  are  very 
 clueless  when  it  comes  to  dating  I  think
[15:43] this  is  such  an  important  topic  that  we 
 talk  about  because  I  wish  when  I  was  a 
 little  bit  younger  I  had  like  an  older
[15:49] like  you  know  role  model  like  a  big 
 brother  figure  that  like  actually  taught 
 me  these  things  from  his  experience  I
[15:55] think  it's  so  valuable  for  you  to  keep 
 these  kind  of  hidden  signs  in  mind  and 
 to  get  even  better  at  like  picking  up  on
[16:00] these  like  little  clues  that  girls  are 
 into  because  it  compounds  like  it  all 
 snowballs  and  gains  momentum  that  the
[16:05] better  you  get  at  navigating  your 
 relationships  with  women  then  the  better 
 women  you  start  to  attract  after  that
[16:11] and  so  I  think  this  is  such  a  valuable 
 skill  that  we  should  be  like  adding  into 
 our  self-improvement  journey  like  you
[16:17] know  we  go  into  the  gym  to  improve  our 
 fitness  we  meditate  to  improve  our 
 mental  health  I  think  a  pillar  of  our 
 self-improvement  should  be  dating  love
[16:23] and  relationships  and  the  skill  of  being 
 better  around  women  a  lot  of  guys 
 disagree  with  me  and  they  think  you
[16:29] should  just  forget  about  women  and  you 
 should  you  know  women  or  horrible  women 
 are  all  trash  like  focus  on  yourself 
 King  I  never  related  to  that  bro  because
[16:35] inside  of  me  I  have  this  authentic 
 desire  for  love  for  relationships  for 
 sex  for  dating  to  like  partner  up  with  a
[16:41] woman  I've  always  had  that  desire  and 
 those  times  when  I  listen  to  these  guys 
 of  these  Sigma  male  grind  set  type  of 
 guys  it's  like  oh  you  know  just  focus  on
[16:46] yourself  King  like  oh  women  aren't 
 worthy  it's  like  I  was  just  less  happy 
 less  productive  weirdly  like  obsessed
[16:53] over  girls  feeling  kind  of  [ __ ]  because 
 I  didn't  have  women  in  my  life  and 
 everything  I'm  way  happier  and  way  more 
 fulfilled  and  just  feel  like  free  now
[16:59] that  I've  gave  myself  permission  to  like 
 level  up  my  skill  with  women  and  it's 
 still  something  that  I'm  learning  right
[17:04] now  click  and  watch  this  video  right  now 
 do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah
