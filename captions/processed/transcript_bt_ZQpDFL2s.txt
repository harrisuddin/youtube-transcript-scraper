[00:01] EVE to me is basically freedom, 
it’s a giant open universe where you can do 
whatever you want.
[00:09] You can have really relaxed slow
paced stuff where you can take it easy.
[00:15] Or you could be on the edge of your seat, shaking, making split second decisions.
[00:24] This is EVE. You know it’s a crazy universe 
where anything can happen, and however you want to do it, go for it.
[00:33] I would describe myself
as a kind of a freedom fighter. My very first character was 
a Minmatar character
[00:39] because they just seemed like the coolest,
you know, most brutal people, and I was like, I want to be that guy.
[00:47] I started out doing the missions in hi-sec, and I wanted to be 
on the side of the people
[00:52] who were fighting against 
the oppression, against the bad guys, and once I learned that
you can basically help them
[00:58] and fight the other factions, that’s all I wanted to do.
[01:06] It’s a very satisfying feeling you know, starting out at the bottom 
and working my way up,
[01:12] getting to more, you know,
advanced situations, bigger ships, bigger enemies 
and all that kinda cool stuff.
[01:33] The ship that I wanted to sit in
more than anything was the Paladin, which is the Amarrian marauder.
[01:40] It was red and gold and it had the lasers, and you know, massive firepower, 
incredible capabilities.
[01:48] I wanted to sit in that thing, 
I wanted to fly, I wanted to undock.
[01:53] It’s like a project and you’re kind of 
putting the pieces together by getting the skills ready for 
the ship and all the modules.
[01:59] You’ve got to get
the money to afford it. You’ve got a dream that you want
and that ship basically is the dream.
[02:08] And once you finally get into
it there’s no greater feeling. I was lovestruck when I sat
in that thing and undocked.
[02:15] You know, with that ship 
I could take on anything.
[02:27] There’s so many
different forms on PvE, trying to wrap your head
around it, you’ve got a ton to do.
[02:35] All the options are there, it’s just a matter of going out 
and whatever fits your play style,
[02:40] whatever you feel
is the best thing to go after.
[02:50] Basically just jump into
whatever catches your attention.
[02:55] It’s a huge universe, there’s a
lot in it, get out there and try it.
