[00:00] Jeffrey's  just  about  to  post  his 
 comments  he's  road  to  your  beautiful  to
[00:05] a  girl  on  Instagram  and  he's  gonna 
 comment  it  publicly
[00:10] Jeffrey  I'm  not  sure  that's  a  good  idea 
 and  he  sweated  and  he's  shaking  and  his
[00:16] heart's  beating  fast  and  his  finger  goes 
 down  to  post 
 and  then  suddenly
[00:21] someone  stops  him  someone  saves  him  from 
 embarrassing  himself  who  could  it  be
[00:27] Adonis 
 it  only  sees  young  Jeffrey  making  the
[00:32] mistake  there's  so  many  young  guys  make 
 publicly  commented  on  a  girl's  picture
[00:38] and  saying  you're  beautiful  or  even 
 worse  pretending  to
[00:43] like  something  about  that  girl  which 
 isn't  her  appearance  and  so  they  comment 
 oh  wow  nice  nice  plant  pot  in  the
[00:50] background  oh  whoa  is  that  is  that  a 
 poster  behind  you  this  band  because  I
[00:57] like  this  but  they  don't 
 Dennis  is  Gonna  Save  Jeffrey
[01:03] and  so  day  by  day  Adonis  teaches  Jeffrey 
 exactly  how  to  master  the  art  of
[01:10] compliments  in  a  woman 
 and  it  works
[01:16] Jeffrey  actually  gets  his  first  ever 
 girlfriend 
 and  he  gets  to  live  this  terrific  life
[01:23] of  beautiful  memories 
 their  first  date  their  10th  date  the
[01:29] hundredth  dates 
 is  genuinely 
 actually  really  happy  with  himself
[01:38] and  so  one  day  Jeffrey  is  in  a  beautiful 
 restaurant  with  a  waterfall  View
[01:44] sat  with  his  woman 
 with  this  new  self-image  as  this  guy
[01:49] who's  actually 
 intelligent  and  wise  and  mature  and
[01:56] sophisticated  he's  got  a  beautiful  woman 
 on  his  arms  who  actually  really  likes 
 him
[02:04] and  in  this  restaurant  on  this  day 
 the  corner  of  his  eye  Jeffrey  spots
[02:10] Adonis  just  reading  a  newspaper  to  the 
 side
[02:15] and  Donna  sees  Jeffrey  and  this  woman 
 and  they  both  just  give  each  other  a
[02:20] little  nod 
 I'm  going  to  tell  you  about  my  first
[02:25] ever  cold  approach  so  if  you  visualize 
 me
[02:30] awkward 
 skinny  fat  little  brown  kid 
 who's  traumatized  is  watching  because
[02:36] like  cold  approach  videos  on  YouTube 
 I'll  go  up  and  compliment  her  that's  a
[02:41] really  really  good  idea 
 right  okay  so  I'm  gonna  try  this 
 me  and  one  of  my  friends  go  to  the  town
[02:48] center  we  take  the  bus  there  and 
 everything 
 and  I'm  already  nervous  by  the  way
[02:55] we're  walking  around  you  know  Alhambra 
 there's  a  girl  there  no  no  no  she's 
 she's  busy  no  no  she's  she's  ugly  like
[03:01] she  wasn't  ugly  oh  no  she's  uh  she's 
 working  no  she  wasn't  working  there  just 
 excuse  after  excuse  after  excuse  finally
[03:07] it's  almost  time  for  us  to  leave  we've 
 been  walking  around  for  like  two  hours 
 like  Predators  looking  for  like  women  to
[03:13] practice  on  it  I  mean  it  sounds  kind  of 
 crazy  I'm  only  16  okay  so  it's  not  that
[03:18] bad  but  eventually  I'm  just  thinking 
 like 
 I  think  I'm  just  gonna  do  it  my  friend 
 has  walked  up  a  little  bit  and  he  hasn't
[03:24] even  realized  that  I've  slowed  down 
 inside  of  this  shop  to  my  right  there's
[03:29] like  a  clothes  shop  there's  like  a 
 female  uh  assistant  you  know  who's
[03:34] working  there  she's  just  kind  of  like 
 stood  at  the  front  just  waiting  for 
 someone  to  come  in  to  greet  them  or 
 whatever  and  I  think  that  this  is  it  so
[03:41] I  literally  just  walk  in  again 
 skinny  fat  awkward  traumatized  16  year
[03:46] old  me  walking  already  nervous  and  stuff 
 oh 
 I  just  wanted  to  you're  you're  beautiful
[03:53] sorry
[03:58] I  literally  apologized 
 I  walked  out  you  know  in  a  second  of
[04:05] awkwardness  I  didn't  even  look  behind  me 
 I  didn't  even  wait  you  know  to  to  hear
[04:11] her 
 response  or  anything 
 a  few  seconds  of  awkwardness  and  and  you
[04:16] know  some  weird  kind  of  Shame  for  you 
 know  not  being  super  confident  with  what 
 I  did  but  then  after  that  I  actually
[04:21] started  to  feel  pretty  good  and  when  I 
 told  my  friend 
 um  he  had  stopped  and  he  looked  at me  he
[04:26] was  like  why  did  you  go  in  there  did  you 
 did  you  speak  to  her  I  said  yeah  I  did  I 
 said  she  was  beautiful  I  said  no  no  you
[04:31] didn't  like  we're  actually  kind  of  Happy
[04:39] and  you  know  it  was  on  the  same  day 
 when  I  was  still  16  years  old  literally
[04:44] the  same  day  that  we  ended  up  getting 
 the  bus  back  towards  his  house  and  on
[04:49] the  bus  there  was  two  girls  there 
 and  we  literally  thought  we  should  like 
 you  know  carry  on  the  momentum  we  end  up
[04:56] our  stop  was  the  next  one  but  then  the 
 bus  stopped  and  they  were  getting  off  so 
 we  pretty  much  followed  them  off  the  bus
[05:02] for  like  it  was  only  like  an  extra  it 
 was  only  like  broke  cold  approaching
[05:07] makes  you  [ __ ]  weird  but  it  makes  you 
 do  some  crazy  [ __ ]  like  yeah  so  we're 
 following  these  girls  off  the  bus  and
[05:17] um 
 it's  literally  only  like  an  extra  two 
 minute  walk  away  for  us  so  it's  kind  of 
 worth  it  I  guess  but  yeah  we  we  end  up
[05:23] going  off  and  the  momentum's  just  inside 
 of  me  and  so  it  was  so  much  easier  for
[05:29] me  to  kind  of  like  you  know  we  walked  in 
 front  of  the  girls  for  a  second  then  I 
 just  you  know  got  a  little  bit  more 
 confident  I  stopped  and  just  said  oh
[05:34] excuse  me  like  do  you  go  to  our  school  I 
 thought  I  recognized  it's  I  wasn't 
 smooth
[05:39] but  I  did  say  something  like  oh  you  know 
 do  you  go  to  law  school  I  didn't 
 recognize  you  or  does  your  sister  go  to
[05:44] oh  okay  but  you  you  so  where  are  you 
 from  what  are  you doing  today  and  I'm 
 pretty  sure  I  ended  up  getting  her
[05:50] number  which  was  the  first  cold  approach 
 number  that  I  had  ever  gotten  on  my
[05:56] first  ever  day  second  approach 
 the  momentum  carried  me  there  and  I  had
[06:02] a  really  good  mindset  about  this  where  I 
 didn't  feel  like  this
[06:09] huge  amount  of  like  shame  and  regret  and 
 you  know  a  lot  of  guys  will  go  out  there 
 to  cold  approach  and  they  feel  horrible
[06:15] after  they've  been 
 um  rejected  I  had  one  friend  who  I  was 
 kind  of  like  coaching
[06:21] and  when  he  went  and  he  was  honestly 
 quite  frankly  a  Chad  I'm  not  even  taking 
 the  piss  this  is  what  like  a  lot  of
[06:27] people  online  don't  realize  even  Chads 
 are  struggling  these  days  so  this  guy's 
 six  foot  two  attractive  guy  he  was
[06:33] getting  into  the  gym  and  everything  nice 
 style  and  he  ends  up  going  out  to  cold 
 approach  and  I  speak  to  him  the  next  day
[06:39] and  he's  like  I  got  [ __ ]  black  pilled 
 he's  like  no  I  will  never  go  out  and
[06:44] approach  again  I  will  net  no  I  will 
 never  do  I  might  wait  what  happened  it's 
 like  bro  like  he  spoke  like  four  women
[06:50] and  he  got  rejected  he  said  even  the  fat 
 [ __ ]  rejected  me  that  was  his  words 
 right  and  obviously  it  can  be  quite  like
[06:56] a  black  pill  moment  to  go  in  cold 
 approach  and  try  and  compliment  a  woman 
 and  she  doesn't  take  it  well  and  maybe
[07:01] you've  complimented  a  woman  online  or  in 
 school  these  days  it  seems  to  be  all
[07:06] online  and  she  leaves  it  on  red  or  she 
 ignores  it  or  worst  of  all  she  can  kind
[07:12] of  tell  that  she's  probably 
 screenshotted  it  and  she  sent  it  to 
 group  chat  of  people  that  you  know  and
[07:18] it  feels  really  awkward 
 that's  what  we're  going  to  cover  today
[07:23] I'm  going  to  try  and  help  you  to  master 
 the  art  of  complimenting  a  woman  now
[07:29] there  is  an  actionable  step  for  you 
 because  this  is  an  actionable  video 
 the  actionable  step  is  that  when  you  are
[07:35] ready  whilst  watching  this  video 
 you  must  go  and  actually  use  what  you're
[07:40] learning  here  that  means  that  there's 
 gonna  be  a  point  in  listen  up  okay 
 there's  gonna  be  a  point  in  this  video
[07:46] that  Something's  Gonna  click  for  you  and 
 your  brain  will  literally  start  to
[07:51] process  exactly  what  you  could  say  to 
 someone  and  it  seems  like  it  would  be
[07:56] effective  at  that  point 
 it  is  your  duty  to  stop  watching  the 
 video  and  go  and  do  that  thing  if  it's
[08:03] possible  if  obviously  it's  like  9  p.m 
 right  now  and  you  don't  want  to  you  know 
 you're  not  gonna  go  in  like 
 find  Our  House  in  the  night  obviously
[08:09] but  if  it's  online  for  example  if  that's 
 what  your  brain  is  processed  oh  yeah  I 
 could  send  her  this  message  this  girl
[08:14] that  I'm  speaking  to  do  it  immediately 
 it  serves  you  more  if  you  go  and  take
[08:20] action  even  though  it  might  be  bad  for 
 like  my  YouTube  metrics  if  you  like 
 pause  the  video  or  something  I'm  hoping
[08:25] that  you  come  back  and  finish  the  video 
 because  there'll  be  lots  of  extra  tips 
 and  the  last  chapter  that  we're  going  to
[08:30] cover  is  kind  of  Juicy  as  well  don't 
 jump  over  there  just  yet  let's  go  in 
 order  and  let's  start  first  of  all  with
[08:36] the  power  of  genuine  genuine  compliments 
 what's  the  actual  reason  why  we're  going
[08:42] to  be  complimenting  women  most  guys  get 
 this  wrong  because  most  guys  chances  are 
 you're  looking  at  this  quite  in  this
[08:48] binary  masculine  way  of  like  okay 
 complimenting  is  something  good  that  I
[08:54] can  do  why 
 think  about  it  why  do  you  actually  think 
 that  complimenting  a  woman  is  a  good
[08:59] thing  and  don't  don't  [ __ ]  by  the 
 way  because  this  is  when  every  guy  will 
 start  to  [ __ ]  answers  you'll  you'll
[09:05] know  if  you're  a  guy  who's  generally 
 like  a  little  [ __ ]  low  testosterone 
 because  you'll  start  to  cope  right  now 
 and  say  oh  yeah  because  you  know  I'm
[09:10] just  spreading  love  enjoy  like  bro  be 
 authentic  do  you  genuinely  care  about 
 spreading  love  and  joy  or  are  you  just
[09:16] trying  to  [ __ ]  are  you  just  trying  to 
 like  you  know  get  a  girl's  number  but  be 
 honest  which  one  is  it  don't  don't  lie
[09:22] for  most  guys  it's  gonna  be  here  right 
 we're  not  this  spiritually  enlightened 
 guy  who's  given  his  gift  to  everyone
[09:27] would  love  to  be  there  but  you  need  to 
 be  authentic  right  now  the  reason  why 
 you're  considering  complimenting  a  woman
[09:32] is  because  you  want  something  out  of  her 
 that's  gross  this  is  why  you've
[09:37] struggled  with  complimenting  girls  so 
 far  because  you're  gross 
 I  bet  you  didn't  expect  like  a  [ __ ]
[09:43] YouTuber  to  just  look  at  you  and  say 
 you're  gross  you  know  why  you're  gross 
 is  because  you're  trying  you're  needy
[09:48] you're  trying  to  get  something  out  of 
 the  act  of  complimenting  and  praising  a 
 woman  you're  trying  to  get  by  giving
[09:58] that's  not  fair  the  point  of  the  the 
 compliment  is  truly  to  give  to  her  but
[10:04] most  guys  have  it  in  their  mind  of  what 
 they  want  by  giving  this  compliment  and
[10:09] when  you  are  like  that  your  compliments 
 come  off  as  extremely  needy  so  if  you
[10:14] struggled  in  the  past  with  this  if 
 you've  gave  cringe  compliments  if  you 
 complimented  a  girl  and  she's  not
[10:19] replied  online  I  guarantee  it's  because 
 you  didn't  actually  just  want  to  give 
 the  compliments  you  wanted  her  reply  of
[10:27] course  you  did  that's  not  a  terrible 
 thing  right  it's  just  that  you  use 
 compliments  as  a  tool  in  your  your  like
[10:32] dating  toolbox  but  that's  not  the  way  to 
 really  go  about  it  the  compliment  is
[10:37] kind  of  like  a  gift  to  a  feminine  woman 
 and  so  this  is  what  I've  learned  from 
 the  book
[10:43] the  way  of  the  superior  man  by  David 
 data  so  in  this  book  in  chapter  17  I
[10:49] believe  it  is 
 it  chapter  17  let's  see 
 chapter  17  yes  I've  read  this  book  so
[10:56] many  times  I  know  the  chapters  By 
 Numbers  chapter  17  is  titled  praise  her
[11:01] and  I'm  going  to  read  you  a  little  part 
 of  this
[11:06] praise  magnifies  the  quality  of  your 
 woman  that  you  praise
[11:11] what  this  means  is  it's  like  positive 
 reinforcements
[11:16] you're  so  beautiful  when  you  smile  it's 
 much  more  effective  than  you're  so  ugly
[11:22] when  you  frown 
 praise  is  literal  food  for  feminine
[11:27] qualities  if  you  want  your  woman  to  grow 
 in  her  Radiance  health  happiness  love
[11:33] beauty  power  and  depth  then  praise  these 
 qualities  praise  them  daily  a  number  of
[11:39] times 
 praise  is  kind  of  like 
 your  tool  not  even  at  all  praise  is
[11:47] almost  like  a  watering  can 
 visualize  a  watering  can  you  can  use  for
[11:52] plants  and  when  you  water  the  plant  it 
 grows  but  when  you  praise  a  woman  you're
[11:58] watering  the  parts  of  her  that  you've 
 just  praised  so  that  they  grow  so  I'm
[12:03] just  going  to  give  you  a  very  quick  tip 
 here  by  the  way  an  actionable  step  this 
 is  why  you  should  never  ever  compliment
[12:09] a  woman  on  Instagram  ever  again  you  know 
 why 
 praise  is  positive  reinforcements
[12:15] what  you're  actually  doing  is  positively 
 reinforcing  her  to  keep
[12:20] posting  onto  Instagram 
 because  you  reinforce  the  behavior  when
[12:25] you  praise  when  you  compliment  a  woman 
 you  simply  just  reinforce  the  behavior 
 that  she's  doing  and  so  when  you  see  her
[12:31] post  on  Instagram  and  you  comment  or  you 
 DM  or  you  mention  it  to  her  the  next  day 
 you  see  her
[12:36] your  like  you're  positively  reinforcing 
 her  to  keep  posting  onto  Instagram 
 that's  probably  not  what  you  want  right
[12:42] it's  probably  the  opposite  you  probably 
 wanted  to  post  Less  on  Instagram  don't 
 you 
 the  way  you  you  compliment  a  woman  is
[12:48] you  really  think  to  yourself  What  is  the 
 characteristic  the  trait  the  behavior
[12:54] that  not  just  for  me  but  for  her  would 
 be  better  if  it  grew
[13:00] it  could  be  her 
 acting  feminine
[13:05] and  this  is  exactly  what  I  did 
 and  so  with  my  girl  she  had  like  you
[13:10] know  these  moments  of  being  very  very 
 feminine  and  she  was  like  cute  and  she'd 
 draw  me  stuff  and  when  I  saw  that  I
[13:16] thought  okay  that's  a  really  cool 
 Behavior  she  just  drew  like  there  was  a 
 time  when  I  was  like  um  on  my  laptop  or
[13:22] something  watching  like  some  kind  of 
 educational  business  thing  she's  just 
 off  to  my  side  she  wants  my  attention
[13:27] but  I'm  kind  of  focused  on  this  and 
 she's  just  kind  of  drawing  she's  like 
 look  I  drew  you  this  and  it's  just  like 
 a  nice  flower  and  I  praised  her  like  a
[13:33] crazy  amount  for  this  and  I'm  genuinely 
 seeing  her  smile  go  bigger  and  bigger 
 and  she's  almost  like  a  little  girl
[13:39] and  I'm  telling  you  right  here  right  now 
 one  by  one  every  single  time  she  showed
[13:44] me  this  like  feminine  arts  and  crafts 
 like  making  stuff  for  me  I've  praised
[13:49] her  like  crazy 
 to  the  point  that  she's  made  me  like 
 some  really  cool  stuff  like  this  she's
[13:54] literally  made  this  entire  thing 
 this  is  like  a  pla  plant  pot  made  from
[14:00] clay  and  it's  got  a  lion  at  the  front  of 
 it  my  name  means  lion  if  you  go  and  like
[14:05] check  on  Google  Hamza  translates  to  like 
 lion  or  Brave  line  it's  a  cool  last  name
[14:10] isn't  it  and  so  she's  literally  done 
 that  and  then  also  since  I'm  lying  I 
 call  her  Kitty  and  then  she  Drew  this
[14:16] she  um  painted  this  for  me  little  Cactus 
 pot  with  little  kitties  on  it
[14:22] and  she  also  like  got  me  in  the  cactus 
 as  well  and  I  told  her  this  is  probably 
 one  of  the best  gifts  I've  ever  gotten 
 just  because  like  I  just  it  just  keeps
[14:28] it  just  stays  on  my  desk  and  I'm  on  my 
 desk  like  10  hours  a  day  so  I  really 
 like  it  I  was  broke  imagine  that  imagine
[14:33] if  your  girl's  making  you  like  this  type 
 of  stuff  where  she's  literally  spent 
 like  hours  drawing  these  cute  little
[14:39] cats  and  everything  look  at  that
[14:44] praise  got  us  here 
 and  so  she  gave  me  those  you  know  the
[14:49] plan  part  she  gave  me  the  the  pencil 
 part  and  I'm  literally  thinking  to 
 myself  well  like  chapter  17  in  this  book
[14:55] praising  a  woman  is  you  is  so  effective
[15:00] and  then  I  go  downstairs 
 into  the  kitchen
[15:06] and  there's  my  mom  just 
 cooking  in  the  kitchen  like  I  always  see
[15:12] her 
 almost  like  a  sad  look  on  her  face  and 
 I'm  realizing  like
[15:17] she  doesn't  get  praised  anywhere  near  as 
 much  as  she  should  do
[15:22] you  know  it's  so  easy  when  someone  is  so 
 consistent  in  the  things  they  do  for  you
[15:28] to  just  get  adjusted  to  it  and  to  not 
 remember  to  be  grateful  for  it
[15:35] but  there's  something  that  a  woman  is 
 doing  for  you  maybe  it's  a  mother  maybe 
 it's  your  mother
[15:41] now  you  could  go  in  Praise 
 so  I  don't  know  how  applicable  this  is 
 for  you  right  now  but  an  actionable  step
[15:47] which  will  actually  help  you  still  get 
 girls 
 it's  the  go  and  think  of  a  praise  for
[15:54] your  mother 
 now  you  know  there  could  be  a  guy  oh  no 
 but  my  my  mother's  a  crack  addict  or
[16:01] something  okay  okay  but  for  the  majority 
 of  us 
 there  could  be  some  kind  of  praise  for
[16:07] your  mother  and  even  if  your  mother's 
 passed  away  you  could  still  kind  of 
 visualize  one  if  you  just  close  your
[16:13] eyes  right  now  and  think  about  the 
 things  that  your  mother  has  done 
 consistently  for  you  to  the  point  that 
 you've  adjusted  so  much  to  it  that  it
[16:19] just  kind  of  feels  like  normal  life  that 
 she  does  that  thing  so  for  me  it's  it's 
 cooking  like  she's  literally  in  the
[16:24] kitchen  right  now  as  we  speak 
 it's  also  washing  the  clothes  and 
 putting  them  into  my  room
[16:29] taking  care  of  the  house 
 these  things  you  only  really  notice  when 
 the  person  kind  of  stops  doing  them
[16:36] but  they're  doing  it  every  day  and  if 
 it's  a  woman  a  feminine  woman  you 
 praising  her  for  it  in  the  right  way
[16:43] will  make  her  like  so  bubbly  and  you 
 know  why  this  will  help  you  get  girls
[16:48] even  though  it's  with  your  woman  with 
 your  mother 
 because  the  way  that  you  praise  your
[16:53] mother  will  also  work  for  the  way  that 
 you  should  praise  like  the  girl  that  you
[16:58] want  to  or  are  already  dating  it's  the 
 same  way  praise  doesn't  have  to  be 
 sexual  although  we  will  talk  through
[17:04] like  sexual  compliments  later  in  this 
 video  don't  skip  that  just  yet  you  horny 
 [ __ ]  but  like  there's  one  that
[17:10] you  could  probably  generate  for  your 
 mother  in  your  mind  right  now  and  I'd 
 say  this  is  an  actionable  stuff  that  if 
 you  really  want  this  video  to  help  you
[17:16] and  genuinely  change  your  life  in  your 
 family  life  which  is  [ __ ]  awesome  for 
 a  video  to  do  when  you  really  think
[17:21] about  how  nice  that  would  like  of  an 
 impact  that  would  be  on  your  life  to 
 have  like  a  one  percent  happier  family
[17:28] really  just  think  of  one  praise  that  you 
 could  give  your  mother
[17:35] and  go  and  give  it 
 right  now
[17:41] right  here  right  now
[17:49] you  don't  even  need  to  pause  the  video 
 because  I'll  go  and  do  it  right  now
[18:04] foreign
[18:57] that's  what  we  call  an  actionable  step 
 if  you  didn't  go  and  do  that  you're  a
[19:02] [ __ ]  and  this  is  your  last  chance 
 before  we  move  on  if  you  haven't  went 
 down  and  spoke  to  your  mother  go  and  do 
 that  right  now  I  went  down  with  a
[19:08] massive  smile  on  my  face  and  and  hugged 
 her  and  she  was  like oh  what  is  it 
 Mother's  Day
[19:16] and  then  I  just  um I  just  told  this 
 truth  I'm  recording  this  video  I'm 
 telling  everyone  that  they  should  praise
[19:21] their  mothers  because  of  how  hard  like 
 their  mothers  probably  work 
 and  I  said  like  you  know  you're  always
[19:26] cooking  and  you  um I'm  out  of  breath 
 we're  running  up  the  stairs  for  you  uh
[19:31] you  take  care  of  the  house  and 
 everything  and 
 um 
 yeah  she's  just  she  sat  there  like  in
[19:36] the  sun  just  smiling  right  now  so  that's 
 all  it  takes  that's  literally  all  it
[19:41] takes  and  if  you've  got  the 
 the  experience  of  giving  your  mother  a
[19:46] compliment  like  that 
 you're  going  to  be  better  at 
 complimenting  a  woman  100  obviously  your
[19:52] mother's  a  woman  but  like  complimenting 
 the  woman  that  you  want  to  date  of 
 course  you  will  because  the  compliment
[19:57] like  the  nature  of  the  praise 
 is  the  same  and  the  reason  why  I  suggest
[20:04] for  you  to  almost  like  give  one  to  your 
 mother  first  is  because  you  don't  really 
 want  anything  out  of  it  you're  lit  you
[20:10] just  want  to  make  her  feel  kind  of  nice 
 right 
 that's  exactly  why  you  should  compliment
[20:15] a  woman  even  the  woman  that  you  want  to 
 date  and  the  woman  that  you  want  to 
 sleep  with  it  should  be  in  the  same
[20:20] energy  that  you'll  give  to  your  mother 
 in  the  sense  that  like  you  just  want  to 
 make  her  smile  and  and  know  that  you
[20:26] appreciate  something  about  her 
 that's  how  you  give  like  a  genuine
[20:31] compliments 
 now  you  might  ask
[20:36] but  wouldn't  I  be  a  Sim  if  I 
 complimented  a  woman  on  something  like 
 this  wouldn't  be  wouldn't  I  be  seen  as  a
[20:43] simp  and  so  we're  gonna  have  an  entire 
 section  in  this  video  of  how  to  avoid 
 complimenting  like  a  simp
[20:49] now  here  is  a  rule  that  I  think  you 
 should  follow  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 if  you  aren't  with  her
[20:56] in  a  relationship  dating  whatever  if 
 you're  not  with  her 
 do  not  compliment  her  appearance  do  not
[21:03] compliment  anything  about  her  looks 
 use  that  rule  so  let's  say  there's  a
[21:09] girl  in  your  workplace  or  your  class 
 it's  so  easy  for  like  the  beta  male
[21:14] version  of  you  it's  a  compliment  and 
 probably  you'll  never  have  the 
 confidence  to  actually  say  that  she's
[21:19] you  know  beautiful  or  anything  but 
 you'll  say  some  stuff  like  oh  yeah  that 
 that  dress  looks  nice  or  you  know  that 
 the  stickers  you  have  on  your  bag  are
[21:25] really  no  no  nothing  about  looks  the 
 reason  why  you  can  set  this  rule  is  one 
 you'll  seem  a  lot  less  like  a  simp  who's
[21:32] commenting  underneath  her  pictures  wow 
 you  know  you  look  incredible  oh  yeah 
 it's  a  nice  nice  smile  babe  and  also  too
[21:38] it  makes  you  work  harder  to  actually  see 
 for  yourself  okay  apart  from  her  beauty
[21:43] what  do  you  actually  like  about  her 
 because  if  you  look  like  if  you  use  this 
 rule  you'll  realize  that  you  don't
[21:49] sometimes  there's  nothing  of  a  girl  that 
 you  actually  appreciate  it's  just  that 
 she's  kind  of  nice  looking  that's  it  but
[21:55] if  you  like  if  you  made  this  rule  that 
 you  can't  compliment  a  woman  unless 
 you're  with  her  on  her  looks  you'll
[22:00] realize  you'll  turn  into  a  lot  less  of  a 
 simp  this  is  the  problem  with  simping  is
[22:05] just  that  all  guys  are  basing  it  on  her 
 looks  or  they're  almost  giving  like  a
[22:10] fake 
 um  fake  compliment  which  is  not  on  her 
 look  so  for  example  we've  got  the  rule
[22:15] that  you  can't  compliment  a  woman  on  her 
 looks  unless  you're  actually  like  with 
 her  maybe  you're  on  a  date  okay  that's
[22:20] fine  but  if  she's  like  some  random  girl 
 that  you've  barely  ever  spoke  to  or  some 
 girl  in  your  class  who's  not  really
[22:25] interested  in  you  complimenting  on  other 
 looks  is  going  to  seem  a  bit  like  cringe
[22:31] at  the  same  time  don't  just  then  think 
 okay  well  you  know  I'll  just  send  her  a 
 message  on  her  only  fans  oh  you've  got  a
[22:38] lovely  smile  I  can  imagine  some  like 
 some  simply  guide  like  doing  that  of
[22:43] like  you  know  to  some  girls  literally 
 there  bent  over  with  some  massive 
 [ __ ] 
 like  you  know  doing  something  sexual  and
[22:50] this  guy  is  compensated  like  oh  yeah 
 you've  got  a  really  lovely  smile  like 
 that's  still  being  a  weirdo  okay  so  the
[22:56] idea  is  if  you  compliment  the  way  that 
 she  looks  it's  usually  not  gonna  be  a
[23:02] good  thing  if  you  are  just  like  very 
 soon  getting  to  know  her  or  slash  like
[23:08] don't  even  know  her  at  all  if  you're  in 
 a  relationship  with  her  100  compliments 
 her  beauty  in  my  opinion  like  if  you
[23:14] want  a  fast  tip  the  fastest  and  like  one 
 of  the  best  kind  of  compliments  you  can
[23:19] have  which  is  such  a  boyish  one  with  a 
 girl  that  you're  you're  actually  with 
 it's  the  just  wolf  whistle  utter
[23:25] literally  just  fully  like  check  her  out 
 she's  walking  away  from  you  I  think  I 
 said  this  once  recently  she's  walking
[23:30] away  from  you 
 stare  at  her  ass  and  wolf  whistle  with 
 like  a  like  a  boyish  smile  on  your  face
[23:36] and  I  guarantee  she  will  have  like 
 literally  the  the  most  giddy  girl  kind
[23:42] of  response  to  that  if  you're  with  the 
 girl  if  you're  not  with  the  girl  then
[23:47] probably  don't  do  that  because  you  know 
 some  girls  can  be  offended  at  it  you 
 might  not  pull  it  off  in  the  right  way
[23:52] if  you're  not  with  her  then  just  go  with 
 compliments  which  would  make  her  feel
[23:59] good  for  the  sake  of  just  making  her 
 feel  good  and  I'll  tell  you  about  this
[24:04] so  I  go  to  the  gym  at  the  same  time 
 every  single  day  and  often  I'll  see  the
[24:09] same  kind  of  people  around  me  and 
 there's  a  girl  I  see  who's  always  there 
 at  the  same  time  as  me  consistently
[24:14] every  day  and  she  stays  for  a  quite  a 
 long  time  like  a  solid  hour  and  a  half 
 or  something  and  she's  usually  there
[24:20] before  I  even  get  in  so  she's  probably 
 there  for  even  longer  and  she's  grinding 
 it  out  but  she's  she's  got  a  very  like
[24:25] lovely  personality  she's  kind  of  like 
 dancing  and  stuff  and  whatever  right 
 so  I  see  her  she's  doing  a  normal
[24:31] workout  I'm  doing  my  normal  workout  and 
 as  she's  walking  like  somewhat  near  me
[24:37] one  day  to  go  it's  like  a  different 
 machine  I'm  not  so  social  in  the  gym 
 these  days  so  this  isn't  about  me 
 flirting  with  or  anything  but  a  personal
[24:43] trainer  sees  her  maybe  they  somewhat  you 
 know  have  seen  each  other  enough  and  the 
 personal  trainer  kind  of  shouts  out  in
[24:48] in  a  playful  sense  of  like  oh  you're  a 
 beast  you're  in  here  you  know  you're 
 still  here  like  he  said  he  says
[24:54] something  like  that  like  you're  still 
 here  you're  a  beast  insinuating  okay 
 she's  been  here  for  a  while  she's 
 working  really  hard
[25:00] she  has  the  biggest  smile  on  her  face 
 and  I  promise  you  after  that  she  stayed
[25:07] for  extra  long  she  started  to  like 
 experiment  with  new  equipment  that  I 
 could  tell  that  she  wasn't  really  used
[25:12] to  she  starts  like  sprinting  on  this 
 treadmills  later  on  I'm  stretching  near 
 like  the  place  where  we  have  a  a  boxing
[25:18] bag  and  she  literally  just  puts  the 
 gloves  on  and  starts  training  on  that 
 and  like  her  form  was  whack  and  I  didn't
[25:23] want  to  be  like  I  didn't  want  to  go  up 
 there  oh  you  know  it's  like  like  a 
 [ __ ]  sometimes  like  guys  will  do  this
[25:28] like  oh  let  me  give  you  some  tips  you 
 can  do  if  you  want  whatever  but  um  her 
 form  wasn't  very  good  but  you  know  she
[25:33] was  trying  anyway  and  so  she's  literally 
 on  the  boxing  bag  she's  smiling  she's 
 got  like  this  extra  playful  part  inside
[25:40] of  her 
 and  she's  literally  in  the  corner  like 
 like  fully  like  bursting  into  like
[25:45] dancing  and  stuff  after  that  and  like 
 just  smiling  so  much  that's  what  a 
 simple  compliment  did  do  you  see  how  the
[25:52] PT  did  not  compliment  oh  hey  nice  ass 
 babe  oh  hey  you've  got  a  lovely  smile 
 because  those  things  can  be  seen  as
[25:58] cringe  if  you're  not  like  close  enough 
 intimately  with  the  girl  the  PT 
 complimented  something  fantastic  which
[26:04] is  literally  just  oh  hey  you're  still  in 
 here  wow  you're  in  here  a  lot  and  she 
 took  pride  in  that  because  a  gym  girl
[26:10] will  take  pride  in  that  right  so  you 
 could  literally  steal  the  exact  same
[26:15] compliments  that  he  did  next  time  if 
 you're  going  to  the  gym  and  you  see  the 
 exact  same  girl  in  there  all  the  time
[26:21] you  can  like  look  at  her  in  a  sign  of 
 respect  do  something  like  this  be  like 
 you're  in  here  at  like  every  single  day
[26:26] nice  one  that's  it  you  literally  could 
 just  say  that  and  you  know  she  smiles
[26:31] when  I've  been  walking  away  and  I 
 guarantee  she's  gonna  have  not  only  a 
 way  better  day  way  better  training
[26:36] session  and  she's  also  gonna  remember 
 you 
 you  didn't  want  anything  from  her
[26:42] now  you  see  how  that  isn't  simping  at 
 all  you  see  that  you're  that's  like  what
[26:47] a  genuine  compliment  is  when  you 
 genuinely  respect  that  this  person  has
[26:52] been  there  doing  this  thing  when  you 
 genuinely  like  this  thing  about  a  person 
 when  it's  just  based  on  superficial
[26:58] looks  that's  when  you  can  come  across  as 
 a  bit  of  a  simp  and  you  probably  don't 
 want  that
[27:04] now  hearing  all  this  especially  with  you 
 know  the  example  I've  given  you  of 
 complimenting  the  girl  on  inside  of  the
[27:10] gym  you  might  still  have  another 
 limiting  belief  which  is  but  I  still 
 don't  feel  very  confident  and  this  is
[27:16] where  most  guys  get  stuck  you're 
 learning  more  and  more  okay  praise  is 
 important  how  to  praise  without  being  a
[27:22] simp  but  you  still  don't  feel  like 
 confident  enough  to  like  give  more 
 compliments  out  and  this  is  where  I  can
[27:29] give  you  one  fast  tip  which  will 
 literally  not  only  help  you  give  out
[27:35] compliments 
 I'm  not  exaggerating  when  I  say  that 
 this  tip  will  help  you  with  100  of  your
[27:41] life 
 can  you  think  what  it  might  be
[27:46] this  is  an  actionable  step  that  you 
 should  do  before  you're  about  to  go  and
[27:51] approach  a  girl  or  compliments  her 
 whether  it's  online  whether  it's  in 
 person  and  it's  also  an  actionable  step
[27:57] that  you  could  do 
 before  you  literally  go  and  do
[28:02] anything  in  life 
 and  it's  the  breathe  fully  there  is  a
[28:10] chapter  before  you  get  like  weirded  out 
 by  that  and  you  you  just  wanted  me  to 
 give  you  like  okay  just  say  this  bro
[28:15] trust  me  when  I  say  I'm  using  like  think 
 about  it  I'm  I'm  this  YouTuber  I'm  using 
 a  part  of  my  video  valuable  time  in  the
[28:21] video  to  give  you  this  advice  I  would 
 only  like  say  the  things  that  I  thought 
 was  going  to  be  valuable  to  you
[28:27] I  promise  you  that  this  is  one  of  the 
 most  valuable  tips  I  could  genuinely
[28:32] ever  give  you  no  matter  what  I  learn  in 
 the  future  of  my  entire  life  this  is
[28:37] probably  one  of  the  most  valuable  tips  I 
 could  ever  give  you  and  it's  to  breathe 
 fully  to  unlock  your  diaphragm  your
[28:44] stomach  when  you  breathe  you  will  get  so 
 much  more  present  happy  in  a  social  flow
[28:53] strong 
 you'll  overcome  a  lot  of  that  neurotic
[28:59] self-concern  you're  the  thinking  that  we 
 have  when  we're  just  stuck  in  our  brains 
 because  that's  what  happens  to  me  quite
[29:05] often  and  so  when  I  first  joined  this 
 gym  again  like  I  had  been  in  this  gym 
 I've  spoke  about  it  a  lot  in  previous
[29:11] videos  but  then  I  I  left  I  traveled 
 around  I  moved  into  different  countries 
 I  came  back  and  I  joined  and  I  kind  of
[29:17] like  you  know  fell  off  my  breath  work 
 meditation  practice  and  I  went  in  and 
 for  a  bunch  of  my  first  workouts
[29:23] I  was  kind  of  that  guy  with  his  hood  up 
 just  kind  of  you  know  just  focused  on  my 
 own  thing  and  just  being  silent  and  you
[29:28] know  just  doing  my  own  thing  and 
 honestly  I  had  quite  like  negative 
 thoughts  in  my  mind
[29:34] and  then  I  remembered  the  tip  that  I  had 
 learned  from  here  which  we'll  discuss 
 and  I  started  to  breathe  fully  just
[29:40] literally  for  a  few  seconds  before  I'd 
 walk  into  the  gym  you  know  so  I'm 
 walking  like  I'm  walking  towards  the  gym 
 or  I  usually  I  run  to  the  gym  and  I'm
[29:46] starting  to  implement  this  practice 
 which  I'll  literally  walk  you  through 
 the  exact  way  to  breathe  and  by  the  time
[29:51] I'd  walk  into  the  gym  it  was  as  if 
 suddenly  I  was  visible  to  everyone  where
[29:58] before  this  and  I  was  wearing  the  same 
 clothes  by  the  way I  still  had  the  hood 
 up  and  everything  like  so  before  this  I
[30:03] was  kind  of  like  I  felt  kind  of 
 invisible  to  people  I  was  just  like  an 
 NPC  who's  in  the  gym  who's  also  doing 
 his  workout  I  promise  every  single  time
[30:10] I  do  a  few  deep  breaths  suddenly  it 
 feels  like  there's  almost  a  spotlight  on
[30:15] me  in  the  gym  and  I'm  not  saying  this 
 out  of  ego  this  is  just  simply  a  fact 
 suddenly  I'm  so  much  more  visible
[30:21] because  it's  like  the  smallest  part  of 
 your  body  language  maybe  your  shoulders 
 literally  just  do  this
[30:27] and  just  see  my  shoulder  there  just  this 
 little  difference  here  so  you  can  go  in
[30:32] you've  not  been  breathing  right  you've 
 been  breathing  shallowly  you've  been 
 sitting  down  with  chip  posture  you're 
 going  to  the  gym  like  this  you  breathe
[30:38] right  for  a  few  seconds  you  kind  of  open 
 up  your  body  and  you  look  like  this  like 
 that  little  bit  of  a  difference  it's
[30:43] like  that  makes  such  a  difference  in 
 people's  brains  Primal  brains  and 
 nervous  system  that  suddenly  they  see  oh
[30:49] happy  friendly  healthy  strong  guy  over 
 there  and  they  actually  look  towards  you
[30:54] girls  smile  guys  come  over  and  talk  and 
 literally  the  first  and  and  every  time
[30:59] that  I've  just  done  a  couple  of 
 breathing  practices  but  also  like 
 specifically  kind  of  like  open  up  the
[31:04] front  of  my  body  literally  just  by  doing 
 this  so  like  this  is  how  we  normally 
 stand  literally  just  just  do  this  just
[31:09] push  your  your  gyno  commercial  out  so 
 push  your  chest  out  breathe  fully  which
[31:14] I'll  explain  how  to  do  that  every  single 
 time  I  do  it  I  promise  at  least  three  or
[31:20] four  people  come  and  speak  to  me  in  the 
 gym  suddenly  it's  like  okay  is  it  just  a 
 coincidence  it  probably  is  a  coincidence
[31:26] but  that  more  and  more  people  who 
 recognize  me  will  come  in  on  those  days 
 that  someone  for  who  I  used  to  speak  to
[31:32] in  the  gym  a  year  ago  suddenly  just  this 
 is  their  first  workout  back  and  they 
 come  straight  towards  me  we  have  another
[31:37] work  we  have  like  a  conversation  then 
 another  guy  comes  walks  over  Hamza  how 
 many  subscribers  are  you  on  now  then  his
[31:42] friend  comes  over  then  like  the  girl  in 
 the  corners  like  smiling  towards  me  then 
 a  girl  walks  into  like  the  part  where
[31:47] I'm  training  and  she's  actually  like  an 
 old  friend's  sister  so  I'm  speaking  to 
 her  like  suddenly  it's  like  I'm  in  this
[31:52] social  flow  speaking  to  like  multiple 
 people  for  the  workout 
 it  can  be  a  bit  of  a  distraction  I  will
[31:57] admit  but  it's  kind  of  nice  to  feel  like 
 you're  socially  included  in  the  places
[32:02] that  you  go  to  it  really  is  and  it 
 really  does  destroy  the  anxiety  you  know
[32:07] that  anxious  negative  thinking  that  you 
 get  about  yourself  or  about  other  people 
 when  you're  speaking  when  you're  in  the
[32:12] social  flow  you  don't  get  that  and  you 
 just  have  way  more  of  a  pleasant  time 
 and  sometimes  honestly  I  have  a  better
[32:17] workout  when  that  happens  because  you 
 just  kind  of  feel  like  a  stronger  you 
 know  like  if  you  put  yourself  in  that
[32:22] situation  where  literally  three  people 
 come  up  they  recognize  you  they  speak  to 
 you  they  you  know  they  say  oh  you  know
[32:27] they're  asking  you  questions  you  ask 
 them  some  questions  suddenly  you  notice 
 that  like  a  girl  in  the  same  part  of  the 
 room  is  looked  over  towards  you  like
[32:33] three  times  you're  probably  gonna  train 
 maybe  a  little  bit  harder  after  that 
 aren't  you  it's  kind  of  nice  isn't  it
[32:38] this  all  comes  down  to  just  breathing 
 right  and  so  breathing  right  will  not
[32:44] just  help  you  with  compliments  but  with 
 literally  the  rest  of  the  world  and  what 
 you  need  to  do  is  breathe  fully  you  can
[32:50] have  a  look  at  chapter  47  let's  see  if 
 I've  got  it  right  is  it  47  or  is  it  45
[32:57] it  is
[33:02] 44  45  yeah  45  that's  kind  of  close 
 chapter  45  of  our  book
[33:09] the  way  the  superior  man  breathed  down 
 the  front  all  men  tend  to  have  blocks  in
[33:14] the  front  of  their  body  and  my  along  an 
 imaginary  line  that  runs  from  the  top  of 
 the  head  through  the  tongue  throat  heart
[33:21] solar  plexus  Naval  genitals  down  to  the 
 perineum  the  principal  bodily  key  to
[33:26] mastering  the  world  and  women  is 
 maintaining  a  full  and  open  front  of  the 
 body  at  all  times  the  best  method  is
[33:33] through  full  and  relaxed  breathing 
 drawing  energy  down  the  front  and 
 freeing  attention  from  neurotic
[33:39] self-concern  this  is  the  most  important 
 book  that  I  read  every  single  day 
 this  is  the  book  that  has  changed  my
[33:45] life  the  most 
 in  this  book  he's  saying  the  principle
[33:50] bodily  key  to  mastering  the  world  and 
 women  is  to  is  to  maintain  a  full  and
[33:57] open  front  of  the  body  most  men  will 
 close  up  the  front  of  their  body  because 
 of  poor  habits  neurotic  self-conception
[34:03] because  when  you  think  about  it  when 
 you're  thinking  overthinking  about 
 yourself  anxious  you  know  you're 
 thinking  kind  of  negative  thoughts
[34:09] naturally  your  body  language  will  kind 
 of  respond  to  that  and  suddenly  you  will 
 be  that  guy  who's  kind  of  using  this
[34:14] phone  like  this  and  the  front  of  your 
 body  is  kind  of  caved  inwards  if  you 
 think  to  remind  yourself  of  what  we've
[34:20] just  learned  open  up  the  front  of  your 
 body  like  this  and  now  you  walk  around 
 it's  like  I  don't  look  weird  right  maybe
[34:25] with  the  bathroom  but  like  I  don't  look 
 like  I'm  like  forcing  my  like  weird 
 posture  or  anything  I  just  look  like  a
[34:31] guy  with  decent  posture 
 this  is  a  quick  tip  that  just  before 
 you're  about  to  go  and  compliment  a
[34:37] woman  you  should  do  every  single  time  so 
 imagine  in  this  realistic  scenario  even
[34:43] if  it's  online  or  it's  in  person  and 
 there's  a  woman  you  want  to  go  and  speak 
 to  literally  just  think  to  yourself  okay
[34:51] the  deep  breathing  thing  take  a  full 
 deep  breath  to  the  point  that  it's  loud
[34:56] like  this  and  really  what  you  want  to  do 
 is  use  the  air  and  kind  of  force  it  into
[35:02] the  lower  part  of  your  stomach  and  let 
 your  stomach  kind  of  bloat  out  it's  okay
[35:07] remember  like  how  a  king  would  Breathe 
 he  wouldn't  care  that  his  stomach  bulges 
 a  little  bit  you  need  to  have  that  same
[35:12] thing  you  shouldn't  be  walking  around 
 tightening  up  your  abs  thinking  that 
 anyone  can  see  that  and  someone  will
[35:17] respect  you  more  because  you've  got  a 
 six-pack  or  anything  let  your  stomach 
 [ __ ]  bulge  out  when  you  breathe 
 breathe  forcefully
[35:29] just  one  of  those  before  you  go  and  do 
 anything  important  will  significantly
[35:36] help  you  now  this  is  a  book  on 
 spirituality  masculinity  and  everything 
 but  if  you  want  a  bit  less  of  like  a
[35:42] woo-woo  type  of  practice  Dr  Andrew 
 huberman  has  been  talking  about  this 
 practice  with  a  slight  change  that  you
[35:48] can  use  which  is  called  the  cyclic  sigh 
 and  it's  very  similar  to  this  but
[35:53] there's  just  one  difference  which  is 
 that  when  you're  at  the  end  of  the 
 inhale  you  stop  there  for  a  second  and
[35:59] you  inhale  a  bit  more  so  this  is  exactly 
 what  it  looks  like
[36:05] foreign
[36:10] you  do  a  full  deep  breath  and  when  you 
 get  to  the  point  where  you're  pretty 
 much  full  you  kind  of  stop  for  a  split
[36:16] second  and  do  another  that  the  double 
 inhale  after  that  so  it's  double  inhale 
 and  then  exhale  that's  been  seen
[36:23] literally  just  one  of  those  has  been 
 seen  says  significantly  reduce  stress 
 and  help  people  get  into  the  present
[36:29] moment  actually  even  more  than 
 meditation 
 when  there's  something  that  has  been
[36:34] proven  to  be  more  effective  than 
 meditation  you  should  probably  take  it 
 seriously  so  I  know  that  this  is  kind  of
[36:40] a  weird  part  of  this  video  when  you  just 
 wanted  to  learn  how  to  compliment  a 
 woman  this  is  the  weird  stuff  that  will
[36:46] actually  help  you  more  I  could  have 
 spent  20  minutes  in  this  video  giving 
 you  like  you  know  like  a  chat  gbt  20
[36:52] examples  of  compliments  you  could  have 
 given  a  woman  and  go  yeah  go  on  go  go 
 ahead  you  didn't  need  that  the  way  for
[36:59] you  to  like  compliment  a  woman  is  for 
 you  to  genuinely  think  to  yourself  the 
 thing  you  want  to  say  to  her  that  like
[37:04] actually  means  you  appreciate  her  you 
 know  it's  you  like  being  authentic  with 
 what  you  appreciate  with  her  me  being
[37:12] sat  here  and  telling  you  examples  of 
 things  you  can  say  is  gonna  actually 
 harm  you  more  because  you're  not  being
[37:17] authentic  with  the  thing  that  you 
 actually  appreciate  about  her  the  thing 
 that  you  respect  or  like  about  her
[37:23] but  I  can  give  you  more  like  the 
 strategy  that  will  simply  just  make  you
[37:28] better  at  complementing  women  as  a  whole 
 instead  of  giving  you  the  specific  words 
 to  say  and  you  know  I'm  equipping  you
[37:34] more  as  like  a  man  instead  of  like  a 
 [ __ ]  dumbass  right  so  this  is  the
[37:40] principal  key  for  you  to  take  away  from 
 this  video  is  to  breathe  fully  before 
 you're  about  to  compliment  a  woman
[37:46] before  you're  about  to  approach  a  woman 
 breathe  fully  whilst  you're  having  sex 
 breathe  fully  24  7.
[37:54] you  will  be  honestly  twice  as  strong  I
[37:59] guarantee  it  not  even  like  in  a  woo-woo 
 sense  I  guarantee  if  you  start  to 
 breathe  more  fully  through  the  day
[38:04] promise  I  promise  you  this  and  you  can 
 report  back  I  promise  you  if  you  started 
 I  really  really  remind  yourself  write
[38:10] pieces  of  paper  remind  yourself  have 
 like  your  phone  wall  screen  literally 
 just  saying  breath  fully  I  guarantee
[38:15] you'll  hit  more  PR's  in  the  next  week 
 than  you  have  over  the  last  few  months 
 guarantee  it  Garrett  you  think  this  is
[38:20] some  woo-woo  practice  go  and  try  it  you 
 think  you  know  if  you're  a  guy  who's
[38:25] having  sex  right  now  I  guarantee  if  you 
 start  to  breathe  fully  right  here  right 
 now  even  outside  of  sex  guarantee  you
[38:31] will  last  for  as  long  as  you  want  this 
 sounds  like  it's  a  magical  practice  it's
[38:36] just  breathing  properly  bro  it's  like 
 the  standards  aren't  that  high  literally 
 just  breathe  and  you'll  you'll  actually
[38:42] be  better  in  the  world  you're  here 
 shallow  breath  crooked  neck  from  like 
 the  poor  posture  wondering  like  why  you
[38:48] feel  so  weak  and  so  timid  in  the  world 
 and  your  body  language  is  like  this 
 [ __ ]  open  it  up  breathe  fully  I'm
[38:54] making  you  this  promise  that  you  can 
 come  back  in  the  next  week  you  will  hit 
 more  PR's  than  you've  ever  done  before
[38:59] now  obviously  if  you're  on  a  [ __ ] 
 huge  calorie  deficit  okay  fair  enough 
 but  like  I'm  expecting  things  to  stay
[39:04] consistent  if  you're  a  guy  who's 
 actively  [ __ ]  right  now  if  you 
 breathe  deeply  through  the  day  I
[39:09] guarantee  you  will  last  for  as  long  as 
 you  want  it's  nice  stuff  bro  and  so  when
[39:14] there's  a  girl  that  you  want  to  go  and 
 compliment  just  one  deep  breath  before 
 you  let's  say  okay  I'm  in  the  gym
[39:20] there's  a  girl  there  that  I  want  to 
 speak  to 
 [Music] 
 foreign
[39:25] that's  it  and  even  whilst  you  speak  to 
 her  even  whilst  you  do  everything  in 
 life  you  can  still  breathe  deeply
[39:31] obviously  like  when  you're  next  to 
 someone  you  don't  have  to  like  you  know 
 be  loud  or  anything  but  you  can  still  be
[39:36] breathing  Deeply  One  extra  tip  I'll  give 
 you  is  that  when  you  really  are 
 conscious  of  your  stomach  when  you
[39:41] breathe  deeply 
 you'll  just  get  into  the  the  habit  of 
 feeling  that  you're  always  kind  of
[39:47] tightening  your  stomach  manually  you 
 don't  even  realize  when  you  breathe 
 deeply  it's  almost  like  you  have  to  cue
[39:52] yourself  to  let  go  of  your  stomach  and 
 then  you'll  feel  like  oh  wow  now  my 
 stomach  is  actually  kind  of  relaxed  like
[39:58] my  stomach  is  actually  tense  right  now 
 I'm  becoming  more  and  more  aware  of  it 
 you  probably  don't  know  like  you're
[40:04] probably  not  that  aware  of  how  tense 
 your  body  is  these  things  make  a  bigger 
 difference  than  you'll  honestly  then
[40:11] you'll  ever  realize  a  bit  of  tense  like 
 a  muscular  tenseness  in  your  body  a  bit
[40:17] of  a  shallow  breath  will  genuinely  you 
 know  the  trajectory  of  your  life  will 
 genuinely  be  significantly  different
[40:24] than  if  you  literally  just  breathe  fully 
 I  know  that  this  seems  like  a  weird 
 thing  for  me  to  mention  in  this  video  I
[40:30] wouldn't  have  spent  so  long  on  this  if 
 this  wasn't  so  important  if  this  is  one 
 of  the  first  times  you're  hearing  this
[40:35] and  you're  quite  inspired  by  this  it 
 would  serve  you  well  to  absolutely 
 obsess  over  this  to  get  pieces  of  paper
[40:42] and  write  breathe  fully  breathe  into 
 your  stomach  breathe  into  your  balls  and 
 stick  it  up  on  your  wall  to  change  your
[40:47] phone  wallpaper  to  read  chapter  45  of 
 this  book  you  can  probably  go  find  it 
 online  for  free  like  the  PDFs  and  stuff
[40:52] and  to  literally  just  breathe  fully  for 
 as  many  breaths  as  possible  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  I  promise  that  this  is  one
[40:59] of  the  best  tips  I  could  genuinely  ever 
 give  you  and  you  know  that  this  is 
 authentic  because  I'm  not  charging  you
[41:04] for  this  this  I'm  not  selling  you  a 
 program  on  like  how  to  breath  fully  you 
 can  just  do  it  right  now
[41:10] laughs 
 now  let's  talk  about  the  bit  that 
 there's  quite  a  few  people  probably
[41:15] interested  in  let's  talk  about  sexual 
 compliments  I  won't  exactly  give  you
[41:20] like  a  detailed  story  just  because  I 
 don't  want  it  to  be  too  vulgar  or 
 personal  or  anything  but  what  I  will
[41:25] tell  you 
 is  that  when  you're  literally  having  sex 
 with  a  woman  is  the  best  time  to  shower
[41:33] her  in  compliments  I'm  talking  every  few 
 seconds  you're  literally  having  sex  with
[41:38] a  girl  you  can  be  giving  her  another 
 compliment  I'm  gonna  say  a  few  just  so 
 you  can  kind  of  understand  like  you  know
[41:43] some  examples  I'm  not  gonna  say  it  in 
 like  the  sexy  way  that  I  would  when  I'm
[41:48] like  literally  [ __ ]  so  I'm  just  gonna 
 say  it  in  a  mundane  way  otherwise  you'll 
 sound  really  cringe  I'm  not  even  gonna
[41:53] look  at  you  as  well  you're  so  sexy 
 that's  so  hot  you  look  so  good  look  how
[41:58] good  we  look  things  like  that  you  can 
 and  you  can  by  the  way  you  can  just  say 
 the  same  one  like  10  times  20  times  this
[42:05] is  the  time  when  you're  literally  having 
 sex  with  a  girl  to  compliment  her  like 
 crazy  can  you  tell  why  it's  manipulative
[42:10] as  [ __ ]  but  both  people  benefit  from  it 
 but  it's  like  super  manipulative  because 
 you're  gonna  get  laid  a  lot  more  if  you
[42:16] do  this  you  know  why 
 remember  that  we  said  that  a  compliment 
 is  kind  of  like  positive  reinforcements
[42:21] when  you  praise  her  you  positively 
 reinforce  the  behavior  that  she's  doing
[42:27] so  when  you  praise  her  a  lot  during  sex 
 you're  positively  reinforcing  her  to
[42:33] have  more  sex  with  you 
 remember  that  concept  that  if  you
[42:38] comment  underneath  her  Instagram  picture 
 that  you're  beautiful  what  you're  not 
 doing  is  complimenting  or  like  sort  of
[42:44] uh  positively  reinforcing  her  um  you 
 know  putting  on  makeup  or  anything
[42:49] you're  positively  reinforcing  like  the 
 latest  Behavior  which  is  her  posting  to 
 Instagram  you  don't  want  to  do  that  but
[42:55] when  you  say  You're  beautiful  when  you 
 say  you're  sexy  when  you  say  that  feels 
 so  good  when  you  say  all  these  things  to
[43:00] her  when  you're  literally  having  sex 
 you're  positively  reinforcing  the 
 behavior  which  is  her  having  sex  with
[43:05] you 
 which  is  kind  of  nice  and  so  I  promise 
 if  there's  a  girl  that  you're  currently
[43:10] like  sleeping  with  and  you  want  to  sleep 
 with  her  even  more  often  and  you  want 
 her  to  like  literally  feel  better  and
[43:16] even  like  kind  of  melt  more  and  enjoy 
 herself  and  also  make  you  even  feel 
 better 
 shower  her  in  compliments  like  crazy  I'm
[43:25] literally  not  exaggerating  when  I  say 
 every  few  seconds  give  a  compliment  and
[43:30] when  you're  like  having  sex 
 now  you  can  also  have  another  limited 
 belief  but  won't  this  be  cringe  if  I'm
[43:36] just  you  know  saying  all  these  things 
 Midway  through  Facebook  at  this  point  if 
 you're  literally  [ __ ]  her  at  that 
 point  your  past  being  seen  as  cringe  she
[43:42] likes  you  bro  she  likes  you  stop  this 
 [ __ ]  insecure  mindset  take  a  deep 
 breath  literally  the  two  things  you
[43:47] should  be  doing  whilst  having  sex  is 
 just  deep  breathing  and  just  giving 
 compliments
[43:52] you're  so  sexy  no  do  this  cyclic  sigh  my
[43:57] whilst  you're  [ __ ]
[44:04] so  let's  give  you  a  full  plan  of  action 
 that  you  can  go  forward  with  and  start 
 actually  complimenting  women  in  the
[44:09] right  way  First  Step  that  I  would  give 
 you  which  I  really  think  you  should  do  I
[44:14] genuinely  can  vouch  for  this  book  and  I 
 can  tell  you  that  I've  spent  over  a 
 hundred  hours  studying  this  book  and  it
[44:20] it  has  paid  off  completely  I  read  this 
 book  almost  most  days  I've  read  it  okay
[44:26] I've  read  this  book  like  multiple  times 
 but  I  continuously  studied  this  book 
 because  it's  kind  of  like  a  guidebook  to
[44:32] Life  as  a  man  and  it  is  super  valuable 
 chapter  17  is  praise  her  that's  the  one
[44:38] which  talks  about  this  concept  it'd  be 
 worth  you  to  recap  that  chapter  45  talks 
 about  breathing  fully  it'd  be  worth  you
[44:44] to  recap  that  so  this  is  an  actionable 
 step  if  you  want  to  further  your 
 learning  on  this  you  can  go  and  read
[44:49] those  two  chapters  17  and  45  the  book  is 
 the  way  of  the  superior  man  by  David
[44:54] data  I  literally  even  have  a  necklace 
 with  the  same  logo  you  can  just  about 
 see  it  like  this  is  the  the  man  on  it
[45:00] see  the  one  with  this  little  pbl  see 
 that  this  is  like  by  Leonardo  da  she  and
[45:05] it's  called  like  the  vitrullian  man  or 
 some  [ __ ]  and  I've  got  like  the  necklace 
 of  that  as  well
[45:10] that's  number  one  so  recap  those 
 chapters  number  two  a  part  of  our  full
[45:15] plan  of  action  like  a  new  rule  for  you 
 never  ever  compliment  a  girl  on  her
[45:20] looks  unless  you're  actually  like  with 
 her  or  at  least  on  a  first  date  never  do
[45:25] it  like  publicly  through  Instagram 
 remember  like  a  second  part  of  this 
 always  remember  that  when  you  praise  a
[45:31] woman  when  you  compliment  a  woman  you 
 are  positively  reinforcing  I  should  have 
 probably  explained  what  that  means
[45:36] hopefully  you  know  positively 
 reinforcing  kind  of  means  that  you  like 
 you  you  kind  of  encourage  them  to  do
[45:41] that  thing  more  so  when  you  compliment  a 
 woman  you're  positively  reinforcing  the
[45:46] behavior  that  she's  just  done  this  means 
 that  you  should  never  ever  ever 
 compliment  a  woman  for  her  Tick  Tock  her
[45:53] Instagram  you  know  how  good  she  looks  on 
 Instagram  because  you're  literally 
 reinforcing  her  posting  to  Instagram  if
[45:59] you  see  her  in  person  and  for  example 
 she's  dressed  up  for  you  compliments 
 compliments  compliments  amazing  if
[46:04] you're  having  sex  with  a  compliment 
 compliment  compliments  if  she's  done 
 something  nice  for  you  she's  made  you 
 like  a  cute  little  thing  like  my  girl
[46:10] has  made  made  me  compliment  sweet 
 awesome  but  if  she's  like  posted 
 something  on  Instagram  where  she  looks
[46:16] good  you  probably  don't  want  to 
 reinforce  her  to  be  on  Instagram  more 
 not  only  because  you  might  feel  a  bit
[46:22] insecure  that  she's  posting  good  looking 
 pictures  or  anything  but  the  fact  that 
 it's  like  ins  like  posting  on  Instagram 
 is  not  really  a  healthy  thing  right  so
[46:29] just  always  remember  it's  like  rule 
 slash  like  actionable  step  number  three 
 only  ever  positively  reinforce  the
[46:36] behavior  that  would  actually  be  good  for 
 her  to  do  more  never  ever  comment 
 underneath  a  Instagram  picture  again  oh
[46:42] hey  you  look  really  good  or  you  know 
 some  like  fake  comments  underneath  her 
 her  picture  where  it's  like  you're  not
[46:47] gonna  compliment  what  she  looks  like  but 
 you're  gonna  say  oh  hey  you  know  did  you 
 have  a  fun  time  there
[46:52] nice  plant  pots  in  the  background  is 
 that  wallpaper  from  Ikea  it's  just 
 cringe  right  you  don't  want  to  say
[46:58] anything  like  nice  in  her  like  Instagram 
 because  you  don't  want  to  reinforce  it 
 at  all  if  anything  you  should  be 
 insulting  her  on  Instagram  so  she  gets
[47:04] off  the  app 
 now 
 the  main  part  of  the  actionable  step  or
[47:11] the  full  plan  of  action  is  go  and 
 compliment  a  woman  within  24  hours  once 
 you've  done  it  no  matter  how  it  goes
[47:17] report  back  here  on  this  video  and  write 
 a  comment  to  encourage  another  young  man 
 who's  on  the  same  Journey  as  you  because
[47:22] there's  going  to  be  guys  who  are 
 literally  one  step  behind  you  and  your 
 comment  might  have  actually  helped  them
[47:27] better  than  my  entire  video  would  have 
 because  they're  able  to  relate  to  you
[47:32] more  the  way  that  you  type  and 
 everything  so  this  is  an  actionable  step 
 a  challenge  to  like  the  absolute  top 
 guys  who  are  watching  this  who  will
[47:38] literally  you  know  you  don't  have  to  be 
 super  advanced  in  self-improvements  but 
 more  so  the  guys  who  have  actually  got 
 the  right  kind  of  mindset  who  know
[47:43] they're  going  to  become  successful  go 
 and  use  this  within  24  hours  but
[47:48] take  a  deep  breath  before  you  go  and  do 
 it  that  is  the  one  principle  bodily  key 
 of  the  world  take  a  deep  breath  before
[47:54] you're  going  to  go  and  compliment  this 
 woman  as  soon  as  you've  done  it  you  can 
 use  your  phone  find  this  video  again  and
[47:59] write  your  experience  and  just  write 
 like  a  little  bit  of  encouragement 
 because  it'd  be  so  wholesome  to  see  this 
 entire  common  space  just  be  so  wholesome
[48:06] of  other  guys  saying  like  oh  this  is  a 
 really  Wholesome  Way  for  you  to 
 compliment  a  woman  I  did  it  like  this
[48:12] here's  my  Learning  lesson  I  probably 
 could  have  done  it  like  this  or  it 
 worked  really  well  and  I've  got  a  date 
 with  this  girl  imagine  how  inspiring
[48:17] that  would  be  to  another  guy  who's 
 reading  this  if  and  when  you're  actually
[48:22] having  sex  with  this  girl  shower  her  in 
 compliments
[48:28] if  you've  watched  this  far  you're 
 probably  like  a  real  fan  of  mine  you're
[48:33] probably  like  an  absolute  true  fan  you 
 probably  appreciate  this  video  you 
 probably  like  me  you  probably  know  my 
 story  and  everything  if  you'd  like  to
[48:39] help  me  the  one  of  the  best  things  you 
 can  do  right  now  you've  probably 
 subscribed  already  but  you  can  turn  the
[48:44] post  notifications  on  but  one  of  the 
 best  things  you  can  do  literally  just 
 share  this  video  to  as  many  group  chats
[48:51] and  DMS  as  you  can  you  can  click  on  the 
 shell  button  get  the  link  go  blast  it  to 
 your  friends  who  need  to  hear  it  go
[48:57] blast  it's  like  the  group  chats  you're 
 in  which  has  got  some  guys  whatever  it 
 is  if  you  get  like  another  10  people  to
[49:02] watch  if  every  guy  who's  got  to  this 
 point  gets  like  five  people  ten  people 
 50  people  to  watch  I  wish  there  was  like 
 a  leaderboard  so  we  could  see  who's
[49:08] gotten  the  most  people  to  like  watch  the 
 video  because  that'd  be  awesome  but  yeah 
 that  would  really  help  me  and  it  would
[49:13] also  just  help  you  know  like  another 
 young  man  who  you  can  probably  relate  to 
 who's  probably  going  through  something
[49:18] similar  he's  had  the  same  kind  of 
 thoughts  and  fears  and  pains  and  he  gets 
 to  have  this  advice  and  we  can  just  grow
[49:23] alongside  each  other 
 do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah
