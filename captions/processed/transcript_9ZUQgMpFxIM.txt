[00:00] before  we  begin  with  this  video  there 
 are  two  online  courses  that  I  sell  and
[00:05] you  can  have  a  part  of  both  of  them  for 
 free  the  first  is  a  list  of  seven
[00:10] workout  routines  that  will  build  an 
 attractive  body  that's  linked  as  the  top 
 Link  in  the  description  and  that  comes
[00:16] from  my  aesthetic  body  course  and  then 
 the  second  one  is  a  private  course  video 
 that  is  not  on  YouTube  that  explains
[00:22] exactly  the  mistakes  of  what  not  to  do 
 if  you  are  just  about  to  get  intimate
[00:28] with  a  girl  that  you've  brought  back  to 
 your  place  if  you're  interested  in  those 
 the  two  links  are  there  in  the  top  of
[00:33] the  YouTube  description  today  we're 
 going  to  cover  how  purpose  works  as  a
[00:38] masculine  man  and  my  intention  with  this 
 my  hope  is  that  by  the  end  of  this  video
[00:44] you  will  be  convinced  that  this  is  the 
 only  way  to  live
[00:50] you  will  have  some  kind  of  epiphany  some 
 kind  of  mental  realization  through  this
[00:57] video  if  you  sit  through  and  watch  it 
 all 
 which  will  change  the  plan  that  you've
[01:03] had  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 that's  my  hope  with  the  the  scope  of
[01:08] this  like  mini  project  of  this  guide 
 I've  got  my  notes  here  as  well
[01:14] so  you  may  have  heard  of  what  purpose  is 
 or  you  may  have  heard  of  purpose  being 
 talked  about  online  especially  in  this
[01:20] space  of  men's  self-improvements  and 
 masculine  creators  and  you've  probably
[01:25] heard  of  the  phrase  that  guys  use  which 
 is  like  beyond  your  purpose  stay  on  your
[01:30] purpose  focus  on  your  purpose  but 
 oftentimes  a  lot  of  these  online 
 creators  don't  really  seem  to  explain
[01:36] things  past  that  they  just  say  yeah  be 
 on  your  purpose  and  you  kind  of  it 
 imagine  that  to  be  like  yeah  like  be  on
[01:43] your  grind  King  and  being  on  your  grind 
 is  a  really  nice  thing  but  purpose  goes
[01:48] so  far  above  that  and  so  much  more 
 rewarding 
 your  purpose  is  the  thing  that  you  are
[01:55] currently  obsessed  about  if  we  took  away 
 all  distractions  all  simulations
[02:01] everything  anything  stimulating  is  all 
 removed  imagine  you  are  literally  locked
[02:06] into  just  an  empty  box  a  room 
 what  are  you  gonna  think  about
[02:12] what  are  you  gonna  desire
[02:17] it's  almost  always  going  to  be  related 
 to  progress  in  a  certain  endeavor
[02:23] for  a  lot  of  guys  it  may  be 
 progress  in  how  they  look  progress  and
[02:28] how  they  feel  maybe  getting  into  the  gym 
 that's  the  current  Obsession  for  a  lot 
 of  other  guys  it  may  be  about  studying
[02:33] or  their  career  or  making  money 
 something  that  you  are  currently 
 obsessed  about  if  you  did  not  distract
[02:39] or  stimulate  yourself  because  it's  very 
 easy  to  be  obsessed  about  something  that 
 you're  addicted  to  because  of  modern
[02:45] technology  you  know  it's  technically 
 someone  could  be  obsessed  with  some 
 video  game  but  that's  more  so  about
[02:50] modern  addiction  than  it  is  their  core 
 masculine  energy
[02:55] purpose  is 
 the  current  chapter  of  your  life
[03:01] what  chapter  are  you  currently  in  what 
 is  the  thing  that  your  mind  and  your 
 body  and  your  soul  seem  to  obsess  over
[03:08] this  is 
 the  mission
[03:13] and  we'll  clarify  exactly  how  to  find 
 this  Mission  this  purpose  but  first  let 
 me  just  explain  to  you  how  purpose  works
[03:20] inside  of  us  we  have  a  core  purpose  deep 
 deep  inside  of  us
[03:26] and  chances  are  we  don't  actually  know 
 what  this  is  no  none  of  us  actually  know 
 what  this  is  I  certainly  don't  know  what 
 my  core  purpose  is  this  deep  purpose
[03:33] but  surrounding  this  deep  purpose  are 
 layers  of  like  secondary  purposes  layer
[03:40] upon  layer  upon  layer  upon  layer 
 all  the  way  to  where  we  are  now  and  this
[03:47] is  this  one  here  it's  our  current  layer 
 this  is  our  current  purpose  layer
[03:53] what  we  must  do  is  try  to  focus  entirely 
 utterly  and  completely  on  this  purpose
[04:00] layer  to  try  and  peel  it  back  to  try  and 
 fulfill  it  to  try  and  complete  it  so 
 that  we  may  move  on  to  the  next  layer
[04:06] and  then  do  the  exact  same  thing  peel  it 
 back  through  months  maybe  years  of
[04:11] dedication  to  this  one  thing  this 
 mission  that  your  mind  and  your  body 
 obsesses  over  we  align  as  much  as  we  can
[04:16] of  Our  Lives  to  peel  back  this  layer  and 
 then  the  next  one  and  then  the  next  one 
 and  then  the  next  one  and  then
[04:21] eventually  we  should  get  to  this  like 
 core  purpose  this  this
[04:26] original  source  of  energy  of  bliss  of 
 Love  who  like  who  knows  I'm  speculating 
 about  what  it  would  be  at  this  level  I'm
[04:32] not  even  close  to  that  but  what  I  do 
 know  for  certain  is  that  we  have  these 
 layers  and  whatever  one  you  are
[04:38] currently  obsessed  over  is  simply  just  a 
 layer  that  we  need  to  peel  back  to
[04:43] eventually  get  one  step  closer  to  the 
 core  thing  that  we're  trying  to  reach 
 and  this  in  itself  already  symbolizes
[04:50] masculine  energy  if  you  think  about  it 
 you  we  talk  a  lot  about  masculinity  and 
 masculine  energy  and  if  I  ask  you  okay
[04:56] what  does  masculine  energy  or  what 
 masculinity  even  is  you  know  we'd  say 
 like  oh  yeah  discipline  and  you  know
[05:01] being  a  man  and  lifting  some  weights  and 
 stuff  and  those  things  symbolize 
 masculine  energy  but  the  true  masculine
[05:07] energy  is  all  simply  just  about  progress 
 progress  progress
[05:14] it's  always  just  this  this  goal  striving 
 energy  inside  of  us  when  you  think  about
[05:20] the  way  that  a  man  a  masculine  man  has 
 luck  makes  love
[05:25] it's  about  progress  to  that  end  point 
 for  women  it's  different  women  don't 
 obsess  over  some  end  points  when  they're
[05:31] making  love  they  obsess  over  the  current 
 second  but  for  man  the  the  objective  is
[05:37] that  end  point  the  objective  for  all  our 
 life  no  matter  what  we're  doing  is  to
[05:42] the  end  points 
 when  we  eat  a  meal  you  know  it'd  be  an 
 awesome  mindfulness  meditation  practice
[05:47] to  enjoy  every  single  bite  but  we're 
 almost  looking  forward  to  the  completion 
 of  the  meal  so  that  we  can  then  start  to
[05:53] make  progress  onto  the  next  thing  that 
 is  exactly  how  our  purpose  layers  work 
 and  so  you  can  start  to  see  purpose
[05:59] layers  as  chapters  of  your  life  this 
 chapter  must  be  complete  this  thing  that
[06:04] you're  obsessing  over  let's  say  for 
 example  it's  studying  because  you  have 
 these  this  uh  test  coming  up  six  months
[06:11] from  now  12  months  from  now  and  that 
 test  means  a  lot  to  you  the  current 
 layer  of  your  life  the  purpose  layer  is
[06:17] the  study  and  to  perform  well  in  those 
 tests  why  because  then  the  next  one  is
[06:23] to  then  get  the  job  then  the  next  one  is 
 to  get  a  promotion  in  that  job  then  the
[06:28] next  one  is  to  start  your  own  Clinic 
 we're  always  trying  to  make  progress 
 going  forward  and  so  now  that  you
[06:33] understand  purpose  layers 
 you  can  start  to  try  and
[06:38] understand  which  layer  you're  on  right 
 now  and  where  that  would  most  likely
[06:43] lead  to 
 the  thing  that  you're  currently  obsessed 
 over  that  mission  that  you  need  to
[06:48] complete  right  now  just  like  we  have 
 this  need  to  complete  a  meal  or  this 
 need  to  complete  like  a  sexual  session
[06:55] to  get  to  that  point  of  climax 
 whatever  it  is  for  you
[07:00] that  is  your  current  purpose
[07:06] so  how  do  you  find  this  let's  say  right 
 now 
 it  was  easy  for  you  to  find  yep  of
[07:11] course  this  is  my  purpose  like  okay 
 sweet  but  let's  say  that  there's  quite  a 
 lot  of  men  out  there  who  don't  actually 
 know  the  current  purpose  layer  is  now
[07:18] I'll  happily  admit  to  you  I  don't  know 
 what  the  core  you  know  the  core  the  the 
 middle  of  all  this  is
[07:26] but  I  know  the  layer  and  maybe  you  do 
 but  there  are  some  guys  out  there  who 
 don't  actually  know  okay  how  do  I  find
[07:31] which  layer  am  I  on  and  this  is  why  it's 
 so  important  these  two  words  that  I 
 really  really  think  you  need  to  to  keep
[07:37] in  your  mind 
 destruction  stimulation
[07:42] these  two  things  need  to  be  avoided  if 
 you  actually  want  to  find  out  your 
 current  purpose  layer  so  I  must  ask  you
[07:47] if  you're  a  man  watching  this  right  now 
 and  you're  thinking  wait  I  don't  know 
 the  layer  of  my  purpose  that  I'm 
 currently  on  I  feel  a  bit  directionless
[07:53] I  am  guaranteeing  that  it  is  because  you 
 distract  yourself  and  you  stimulate 
 yourself  too  much  the  way  the  shortcuts
[07:59] are  finding  the  current  purpose  layer  is 
 to  get  rid  of  distractions  get  rid  of 
 stimulation  and  to  sit  in  some  kind  of
[08:05] boring  environment  this  unstimulating 
 environment  where  then  your  brain  can
[08:12] finally  start  to  tick  over  and  realize 
 what's  important  in  your  life  and  so 
 there  is  a  piece  of  advice  that  I've
[08:17] gave  before  accidentally  without  even 
 realizing  how  just  how  valuable  this 
 piece  of  advice  is  and  that  is
[08:23] to  sit  and  to  stare  at  your  wall  to  just 
 stare  at  an  empty  wall  not  a  computer
[08:29] screen  not  to  have  your  phone  or  laptop 
 ready  even  to  journal  or  anything 
 nothing  maybe  a  piece  of  paper  and  a  pen
[08:35] but  just  a  sit  down  maybe  for  hours 
 maybe  for  days  and  don't  be  silly  oh  he
[08:41] said  for  days  now  I'm  gonna  die  of  of 
 starvation  don't  be  silly  but  for  a  good
[08:46] amount  of  time  that  feels  totally 
 uncomfortable  it's  stare  at  the  wall
[08:52] spend  time  not  distracting  yourself 
 spend  time  not  deep  in  the  internet
[08:57] these  modern  inventions  that  hook  our 
 attention  including  YouTube  videos  just
[09:03] like  this  one  you  know  this  can  be  an 
 excellent  source  of  inspiration 
 education  maybe  entertainment  but  in  the
[09:10] end  the  most  important  thing  in  your 
 life  should  be  your  development  as  a  man 
 and  so  maybe  you  are  at  the  point  in
[09:15] life  where  you  need  to  get  rid  of  all 
 the  fluff  maybe  including  my  videos  and 
 literally  just  spend  some  time  some
[09:21] hours  some  days  doing  nothing  to  shut 
 away  to  call  in  sick  from  school  or  work
[09:26] and  to  literally  just  think 
 just  think 
 if  you  can  make  that  promise  to  yourself
[09:32] to  not  quickly  check  on  Instagram  or  to 
 you  know  let  me  uh  check  Discord  quickly 
 oh
[09:37] to  just  allow  your  brain  to  just  free 
 form  just  think  the  message  will  be  sent 
 to  you  your  brain  and  your  body  and  your
[09:43] soul  will  align  and  it  will  tell  you 
 okay  this  is  what  we're  missing  now  this 
 is  the  thing  that  we  need  to  strive  for
[09:50] and  for  most  young  men  it  is  to  do  with 
 either  finances  to  make  money  maybe  to
[09:55] study  and  to  get  into  that  career  or  the 
 University  or  something  to  do  with  like
[10:00] your  physical  fitness  because  that's 
 like  incredibly  important  as  young  men 
 so  a  lot  of  young  guys  have  like  the
[10:05] total  Obsession  of  like  Fitness  or 
 wanting  to  lose  weight  wanting  to  build 
 muscle  you  must  find  your  purpose  layer
[10:11] for  us  to  continue  with  this  video
[10:17] once  you  get  this  idea 
 and  it  will  just  be  that  it  will  just  be 
 an  idea
[10:23] uh  a  vision  an  inclination  of  what  your 
 purpose  layer  could  be
[10:28] that's  when  you  should  throw  yourself 
 into  it  fully 
 so  let's  say  right  now  I'm  a  younger  man
[10:33] who  feels  a  little  bit  directionless  I'm 
 in  school  I'm  in  college  or  something 
 but  it  doesn't  really  feel  like  the
[10:39] thing  that  I  want  to  do  and  you  know  I 
 finish  the  classes  then  I  come  home  and 
 I  just  play  some  video  games  and  I  just
[10:44] kind  of  waste  time  and  go  on  Discord  and 
 stuff  and  I  just  feel  like  a  purposeless 
 young  man  well  I'd  follow  the  advice
[10:49] that  I  just  said  before  and  I'd  you  know 
 I'd  stop  everything  I  wouldn't  go  to 
 class  for  like  two  three  days  you  know
[10:54] maybe  for  the  weekend  would  be  smarter 
 and  I'd  literally  just  stare  at  my  wall 
 and  journal  and  journal  and  journal  and
[10:59] journal  to  my  fingers  ache  about  what  I 
 actually  want  from  my  life  of  what 
 actually  has  meaning  what's  the  point  of
[11:05] of  living  of  my  existence  I  would 
 contemplate  on  my  death  on  my  mother's 
 death  I  would  think  about  these  random
[11:11] deep  things  like  I  would  literally 
 visualize  passing  away  I'd  visualize  my 
 parents  passing  away  just  to  kind  of  you
[11:17] know  start  to  like  spark  some  some 
 thought  some  introspectiveness  and  then 
 it  may  hit  me
[11:22] that 
 what  I  should  actually  be  really 
 obsessing  over  and  spending  my  time  on
[11:28] is 
 health  physical  and  mental  health  to
[11:33] make  sure  I  am  quite  healthy  but  then 
 also  to  learn  the  things  that  creates 
 Health  in  a  person  to  then  also  teach
[11:39] that  to  my  parents  to  make  sure  that 
 they  can  live  a  long  healthy  life  so 
 then  my  mind  starts  to  obsess  over  this
[11:45] this  singular  Vision  like  almost  like  an 
 image  of  just  my  mum  looking  kind  of  old
[11:52] but  also  healthy  at  the  same  time  now 
 this  is  a  very  specific  example  that  I'm 
 giving  you  here  just  you  know  we're
[11:57] imagining  some  random  guy  who's  having 
 these  thoughts 
 that  is  all  it  will  be  for  you
[12:03] perhaps  just  an  image  in  your  mind  a 
 vision  a  feeling  it  will  never  be  a
[12:08] clear  direct  plan  okay  let's  do  this 
 right  now  it  will  never  be  like  that  it 
 will  just  be  some  kind  of  inspiration
[12:14] for  me  personally  my  most  recent  like 
 vision  of  my  new  purpose  layer  was  just
[12:21] a  very  short  mental  movie  of  me  doing 
 Jiu  Jitsu  with  another  another  guy  I'm
[12:27] lean  I  have  I'm  wearing  a  shirt  that's 
 like  skin  tight  like  I'm  very  lean  I'm 
 like  10  body  fat  maybe  even  less  a  shirt
[12:33] is  skin  tight  on  my  on  my  arms  or  my 
 stomach  and  everything  I  don't  have  a 
 stomach  at  all  I've  got  like  a  full-on
[12:38] eight-pack  and  everything  never  been 
 this  lean  before  and  I'm  rolling  around 
 in  this  like  in  a  jiu  jitsu
[12:44] um  training  session  we're  rolling  and  I 
 look  incredible  not  not  in  this  vanity
[12:51] attractiveness  Aesthetics  way  but  like 
 the  way  that  I  move  is  so  impressive  I
[12:56] look  light  I  look  like  an  athlete  I'm 
 flowing  so  perfectly  like  I'm  actually
[13:01] good  at  this  sport  that  I've  been 
 training  for  a  while  it  was  just  this 
 that's  all  it  was  for  me  it  was  just
[13:07] this 
 mental  movie 
 this 
 idea
[13:13] of  being  a  fighter  and  actually  a  pretty 
 good  one 
 that's  how  it  starts
[13:18] once  you  have  this  original  vision  and 
 this  idea  of  what  your  purpose  layer
[13:23] could  be  the  real  way  to  really  find  out 
 exactly  what  your  purpose  layer  is  and  a
[13:28] lot  of  guys  struggle  with  this  but  it's 
 the  take  action  immediately  to  somewhat
[13:34] of  an  extreme  level  to  throw  yourself 
 into  it  fully
[13:39] there's  a  phrase  from  the  book  The  Way 
 of  the  superior  man  by  David  Dieter
[13:44] which  I  absolutely  love  which  is  align 
 100  of  your  life  to  your  purpose
[13:49] I'll  say  that  again  align  100  of  your 
 life  to  your  purpose
[13:54] once  you  start  to  figure  out  okay  what 
 is  your  purpose  layer  you  know  the 
 current  thing  that  we  need  to  work  on
[14:00] the  current  mission  that  we  need  to  peel 
 back  till  we  get  to  the  next  one  and  the 
 next  one  and  the  next  one  it  would  be
[14:05] the  best  thing  that  you  could  possibly 
 do 
 aligning  100  of  the  decisions  you  make
[14:11] the  place  you  live  the  foods  you  eat  the 
 people  you  talk  to  to  this  purpose  layer
[14:16] to  peel  it  back 
 so  for  example  for  me  I  had  this  vision 
 of  like  this  fighting  you  know  this  um
[14:22] rolling  around  doing  Jiu  Jitsu  being 
 like  an  athlete 
 and  so  I  could  try  and  fulfill  this
[14:29] layer  of  my  purpose  like  a  no  I'm  not  I 
 was  gonna  say  no  offense  I  don't  don't
[14:34] want  it  to  seem  like  I'm  saying  this  is 
 you  but  like  how  a  mediocre  man-made  a
[14:39] mediocre  man  would  get  the  same 
 visualization  that  I  did  okay  yeah  oh 
 yeah  I'm  an  athlete  sweet  and  what  he
[14:44] would  do  is  he'd  start  to  he'd  sign  up 
 to  a  Jujitsu  class  and  he'd  go  five
[14:50] times  a  week 
 nice 
 that  man  is  better  than  90  of  the
[14:57] population  of  men 
 95  perhaps 
 and  yet  he's  still  a  mediocre  man
[15:04] you  see  once  you  know  your  purpose  layer 
 maybe  yours  is  studying  right  now  and
[15:09] you  study  for  an  hour  a  day 
 and  then  you  know  you  go  play  some  video 
 games  and  everything  yeah  that  means
[15:14] that  you're  you're  barely  a  mediocre  man 
 and  I'm  not  saying  this  again  to  be
[15:19] insulting  or  anything  to  be  a  superior 
 man  to  be  like  actually  a  masculine  man
[15:24] who  is  on  his  purpose  we  need  to  push 
 closer  to  100  of  your  life  aligned  to
[15:31] this  layer  of  your  of  your  purpose  so 
 for  example  the  media  command  will  get 
 the  vision  that  I  did  and  he'd  start
[15:37] training  a  few  hours  a  week  the  superior 
 man 
 would  go  and  live  in  a  fight  Camp  the
[15:43] superior  man  them  the  man  who's  really 
 like  on  this  would  literally  go  and  live
[15:48] amongst  the  fighters  and  the  Warriors 
 and  live  amongst  them  eat  amongst  them 
 and  be  revolving  around  this  lifestyle
[15:55] as  much  as  possible  when  he's  not 
 training  he's  eating  right  when  he's  not 
 training  or  eating  right  he's  speaking
[16:01] with  other  Fighters  and  asking  them 
 questions 
 there's  a  there's  levels  to  how  much  you
[16:06] can  dedicate  to  your  purpose  and  you  can 
 say  well  of  course  you  know  we've  got 
 commitments  and  we  can't  throw  you  know
[16:11] we  can't  all  just  like  quit  University 
 or  anything  like  this
[16:17] but  the  more  masculine  you  want  to 
 become  the  more  that  you  have  to  align 
 to  your  purpose
[16:24] and  so  this  is  where  it  gets  interesting 
 because  this 
 is  where  some  sacrifices  need  to  be  made
[16:31] and  this  is  actually  where 
 the  life  that  we're  gonna  live  as  young
[16:36] masculine  men 
 it's  going  to  be  so  different  that  we 
 almost  need  like  a  paradigm  shift  like
[16:42] me  and  you  need  to  discuss  a  different 
 kind  of  lifestyle  that  we've  never 
 actually  heard  of  before  because  the  the
[16:48] media  machine  you  know  your  current 
 beliefs  and  perceptions  and  plans  of
[16:54] life  you  know  that  they're  very  very 
 influenced  by  the  things  you've  seen  in 
 like  movies  and  by  modern  standards  you
[16:59] understand  this  right  as  much  as  we 
 would  like  to  be  like  based  guys  the 
 truth  is  a  lot  of  what  we  perceive  Our
[17:06] Lives  to  be  in  a  lot  of  the  beliefs  that 
 we  have  are  actually  made  from  things 
 like  Hollywood  movies  that  we  watch  when
[17:12] we  were  children  and  so  it  is  normal 
 think  about  this  in  inside  of  our  minds 
 even  as  young  masculine  men  inside  of
[17:18] our  minds  roughly  you'll  probably  agree 
 is  this  life  plan  that  okay  we're  young
[17:23] we're  going  to  build  up  all  these  things 
 I'm  gonna  get  into  fitness  and  then  I'm 
 gonna  start  attracting  some  girls  and
[17:28] I'm  gonna  get  into  this  career  or  this 
 business  make  up  a  lot  of  money  and  I'll 
 travel  and  everything  and  then  there'll
[17:33] be  a  point  when  I  will  then  do  the  same 
 thing  for  a  very  long  time  I  will  have  a
[17:38] family  and  I  will  raise  that  family  for 
 18  years  or  longer  I  will  find  a  woman
[17:43] and  I  will  be  with  her  for  20  years  or 
 40  years  or  for  the  rest  of  my  life  we 
 have  this  perception  that  good  equals
[17:49] long-term  stability  good  equals  no 
 change  we  have  this  perception  that  a
[17:54] man  is  supposed  to  build  himself  up  to 
 an  okay  level  and  then  essentially  just 
 do  the  same  thing  for  the  rest  of  his
[17:59] life  that  the  man  who  settles  down  and 
 has  a  family  is  winning
[18:05] and  surely  it  is  right  families  probably 
 the  most  important  thing  right
[18:10] now 
 what  if  it's  not
[18:16] what  if  our  perceptions  of  the  wild  man 
 who  lives  a  masculine  life  of  purpose
[18:21] have  been  brainwashed  and  conditioned  to 
 be  negative
[18:26] because  I  want  you  to  imagine  just  right 
 now  imagine  some  random  Hollywood  movie 
 or  TV  show  that  you've  watched  and
[18:32] imagine  the  40  year  old  man  who 
 eventually  starts  to  be  more  masculine
[18:38] and  discovers  his  purpose  how  is  he 
 portrayed  in  these  movies  this  fourth 
 year  old  man  who's  got  family  and
[18:43] everything  he  realizes  his  purpose  here 
 is  kind  of  done  now  he  shouldn't  abandon 
 his  family  but  he's  got  something  new  to
[18:49] work  on  something  new  that  he's  really 
 starting  to  care  about 
 the  media  portrays  him  as  a  man  who's
[18:57] going  through  a  midlife  crisis  as  a  man 
 who  just  doesn't  know  who  he  is  anymore 
 and  he's  been  a  nuisance  and  his  wife
[19:04] eventually  calms  him  down  come  on  Timmy 
 you're  not  supposed  to  ride  mobile  like 
 she's  saying  this  to  her  40  year  old
[19:10] husband  come  on  like  Timmy  you're  going 
 crazy  huh  look  everyone  he's  got  a 
 motorbike  because  he's  40  years  old  and
[19:15] he's  having  a  midlife  crisis  look  he 
 wants  to  try  this  new  thing  and  he's  not 
 so  good  at  it  come  on  come  back  home
[19:20] back  to  normality  back  to  a  life  of  a 
 lack  of  purpose  and  meaning  come  on
[19:28] yeah  you're  at  risk  of  killing  yourself 
 but  come  on 
 you're  a  mule  you're  supposed  to  just  be
[19:34] a  mule  just  work  just  work  just  work 
 provide  and  then  die
[19:41] don't  be  masculine 
 don't  change  anything  about  your  life
[19:48] don't  be  purposeful  don't  try  new  things 
 you're  supposed  to  be  a  mule  got  it
[19:53] Timmy  come  on  back  to  normality
[19:58] this  is  what  we  see  in  the  modern 
 propaganda  machine  don't  we 
 and
[20:04] similarly  on  you  know  these  movies  these 
 TV  shows  the  good  standing  long-term
[20:10] stable  man  who  works  the  exact  same  job 
 for  40  years  straight  and  you  know  he's
[20:15] really  good  with  his  family  that's  seen 
 as  a  really  positive  thing  now  you  know 
 it  might  seem  weird  what  I'm  saying  here 
 because  I'm  you  know  it  might  seem  like
[20:21] he's  I'm  just  saying  to  not  value  family 
 no  no  it's  not  that  I'm  saying  to 
 devalue  family  it's  what  I'm  saying  is
[20:27] to  understand  that  your  purpose  this 
 layer  that  you  have  to  fulfill  will
[20:32] constantly  keep  changing  and  they  will 
 most  likely  be  a  bit  like  a  purpose 
 layer  to  have  children  and  to  raise  them
[20:38] but  then  your  purpose  layer  will  update 
 and  it  will  change  and  there  will  be
[20:43] more  that  you  have  to  do  with  your  life 
 more  than  just  being  a  father  who  pays 
 for  his  children  and  his  wife
[20:49] there  will  be  more 
 now  I  don't  have  children  I  I  don't
[20:55] shouldn't  even  be  able  to  like  you  know 
 talk  about  what  a  father  should  do  you 
 know  we  can  leave  that  to  men  who  are 
 way  more  experienced  in  that  area  but
[21:02] the  more  that  I  understand  and  learn 
 about  purpose  the  more  that  I'm  starting 
 to  Envision  this  life  that  I  want  you  to
[21:08] visualize  we've  thought  that  okay  you 
 know  build  ourselves  up  in  our  20s  have 
 some  kind  of  career  or  business  that  you
[21:14] know  really  really  pops  off  and  we  get 
 really  successful  and  then  we  just  kind 
 of  you  know  it's  almost  like  a  vague 
 gray  thing  of  like  oh  yeah  and  then  the
[21:20] years  will  slip  by  really  fast  and  we'll 
 just  keep  doing  the  same  thing  the  same 
 business  the  same  career  for  the  rest  of
[21:25] our  lives  till  eventually  we  like  we 
 just  want  to  retire  we  probably  won't 
 want  to  retire  because  retirement's 
 boring  so  we'll  just  continue  the  same
[21:31] thing  forever  that's  how  kind  of  our 
 perception  of  things  but  I  want  you  to 
 visualize  right  now  what  if  we  chased
[21:37] the  layer  of  our  purpose  always  what  if 
 we  are  every  single  time  we  had  a  new
[21:42] layer  we  threw  in  100  of  our  life  to  it 
 we  aligned  as  much  of  our  life  to  it
[21:48] I  want  you  to  start  to  visualize 
 potentially 
 this  new  lifestyle
[21:54] where  it's  like  you've  lived  so  many 
 many 
 lives  in  one  wherefore  two  years  of  your
[22:02] life  you  were  so  into  this  one  thing 
 like  for  example  becoming  a  fighter  and 
 you  were  living  in  Brazil  doing  Jiu
[22:08] Jitsu  or  you  were  in  Thailand  learning 
 Muay  Thai  every  single  day  for  four 
 hours  that  was  your  life  that  was  how
[22:13] you  lived  and  then  when  that  layer  of 
 purpose  was  complete  and  it  was  time  to
[22:18] get  into  sailing  you  got  into  sailing 
 and  you  you  did  that  for  six  months  or  a
[22:23] year  to  till  that  layer  of  purpose  was 
 complete  and  then  it  was  time  for  you  to 
 learn  this  random  language  or  for  you  to 
 learn  about  artificial  intelligence
[22:29] because  this  was  the  thing  that  now  okay 
 I  need  to  understand  this  I  need  to 
 understand  this 
 and  it's  like  you've  lived  multiple  many
[22:35] many  lives  and  that  usually  is  seen  as  a 
 bad  thing  because  long-term  stability  of 
 a  career  or  a  business  is  usually  like
[22:41] the  player  right  long-term  thinking  is  a 
 good  thing  right 
 and  it  would  seem  so  weird  if  I  told  you
[22:46] that  perhaps  long-term  thinking  maybe
[22:51] weirdly 
 catastrophic  for  masculine  men
[22:57] because  this  idea  of  okay  just  get  to  a 
 point  and  then  do  the  same  thing  for  40 
 years  it  defies  what  your  purpose  most
[23:04] likely  how  your  purpose  is  going  to  be 
 working
[23:12] now  this  is  the  point  right  now 
 where  you  figured  out  your  purpose  layer
[23:17] and  you're  starting  to  realize  okay  I 
 should  align  100  of  my  life  to  peeling 
 back  these  layers  and  just  seeing  where
[23:23] that  would  take  me 
 to  peel  back  the  current  purpose  layer
[23:29] it's  going  to  require  sacrifice 
 mine  right  now  seems  to  be  based  on  two
[23:36] things  mine  is  on  fighting  you  know 
 becoming  that  athlete  and  also  very 
 interestingly  like  there's  another  like
[23:41] almost  half  purpose  that  I  have  which  is 
 about  investing  to  like  stack  like
[23:46] long-term  serious  Investments  That  Then 
 retire  like  my  family  and  everything
[23:51] right  those  are  like  my  two  focuses 
 to  make  progress  in  this  purpose  layer
[23:57] you  have  to  sacrifice  things 
 and  that  seems  obvious  right  so  if 
 you're  a  young  guy  right  now  and  your
[24:02] purpose  your  obsession  seems  to  be  on 
 your  Fitness  and  you  really  want  to 
 build  like  a  good  body  you  really  want 
 to  lose  some  weight  so  you  can  finally
[24:08] feel  like  you're  like  a  respectable 
 younger  man  that  you're  full  of 
 confidence  and  that  means  so  much  to  you
[24:13] you're  gonna  need  to  sacrifice  the 
 things 
 that  you  know  you've  got  to  get  rid  of
[24:19] the  junk  food 
 the  the  sleep-ins 
 of  course  sleep  is  important  but  you
[24:25] know  like  oh  you've  stayed  up  till  1am 
 playing  games  and  stuff  and  now  you're
[24:30] gonna  wake  up  at  11  P.M  tomorrow  sleep 
 Disturbed  blue  light  at  night  time  and
[24:35] everything  you're  gonna  need  to 
 sacrifice  those  snacks  you're  gonna  need 
 to  sacrifice  going  on  like  meeting  your
[24:40] friends  for  lunch  because  you  always  go 
 to  unhealthy  places
[24:46] to  make  a  lot  of  progress  in  the  layer 
 of  your  purpose  you  need  to  be  okay  with
[24:52] making  sacrifices  this  is  where  most 
 guys  find  it  very  difficult  to  make 
 progress  and  why  most  men  are  stuck  in
[24:59] this  this  man  child  stage  of  not 
 fulfilling  their  purpose  is  because
[25:04] making  a  sacrifice  is  incredibly  hard 
 especially  in  the  modern  day  you  know
[25:09] it's  sacrificing 
 in  the  modern  days  difficult  because 
 food  has  been  made  to  be  addictive
[25:15] technology  has  been  made  to  be  addictive 
 so  we  feel  genuine  spiritual  physical
[25:20] mental  pain  when  we  try  to  sacrifice 
 something  that  we  have  like  a  mild 
 addiction  to
[25:29] I  sacrificed 
 some  level  of  Fame  for  my  purpose  I
[25:35] could  have  kept  on  going  with  this  like 
 YouTube  content  consumption  machine  with 
 a  massive  team  to  keep  thinking  okay
[25:40] let's  get  to  5  million  Subs  this  year 
 then  10  million  next  year  that  was  the 
 track  that  I  was  going  for
[25:46] and  I  kept  on  pushing  it  even  though  my 
 purpose  changed  in  my  mind  and  my  heart 
 I  kept  on  just  going  through  the  same
[25:51] thing  because  I  didn't  want  to  sacrifice 
 like  this  YouTube  career  that  I  had 
 built  up
[25:57] So  eventually  it  hit  me  like  this  is  the 
 thing  I  have  to  sacrifice  now  of  course 
 I  can  every  now  and  then  I  can  sit  down
[26:02] for  an  hour  and  you  know  try  and  teach 
 you  something  that  will  genuinely  try 
 and  help  you  just  because  you  know  it's 
 like
[26:07] I  like  kind  of  talking  and  teaching 
 that's  kind  of  nice 
 but  what  we  had  previously  and  the  huge
[26:13] level  we  were  trying  to  push  for  you 
 know  myself  and  my  team  I  sacrificed 
 that  because  it  was  a  huge  distraction
[26:19] away  from  the  new  thing  that  I  wanted  to 
 do  I  don't  want  to  record  videos  every 
 single  day  I  don't  want  to  try  and  get
[26:24] like  lots  of  lots  of  views  and  and  watch 
 time  and  you  know  more  subscribers  I 
 don't  care  about  any  of  that  I  had  to
[26:30] sacrifice  it  so  that  I  could  focus  more 
 on  fighting  and  investing  and  you  know 
 to  have  like  my  brain  and  my  time  freed
[26:37] up 
 so  what  you've  seen  in  front  of  you  just 
 in  the  last  week  is
[26:43] a  example  of  sacrifice 
 and so  I  want  you  to  think  right  now  of
[26:49] where  you're  up  to 
 what  your  purpose  layer  is  and  this  is 
 so  interesting  right  I  want  you  to  think
[26:56] of  the  things  that  you  could  potentially 
 sacrifice  so  that  you  could  make  more 
 progress  in  this  purpose  layer  you  know
[27:02] to  peel  it  back  to  like  fulfill  it  this 
 mission  of  yours  right 
 and  there's  gonna  be  something  perhaps
[27:07] it's  already  happened  there's  gonna  be 
 something  that  there  is  a  potential 
 sacrifice  a  very  valuable  thing  to
[27:13] sacrifice  like  it'll  make  a  lot  of 
 progress  if  you  did  and  your  brain  will 
 argue  against  it  because  of  the
[27:19] addiction  to  the  thing 
 you  what  I  found  is  that  the  thing  that
[27:24] you  need  to  sacrifice  is  actually  the 
 thing  that  your  own  brain  will  defend 
 the  most  but  it's  almost  like  your  brain
[27:30] is  going  to  start  to  split  in  half  right 
 now  and  this  is  going  to  give  you  like 
 slightly  mental  problems  your  brain  is 
 going  to  start  to  argue  with  itself  of
[27:36] whether  or  not  this  this  thing  that's  in 
 your  mind  that  you  could  sacrifice 
 should  be  sacrificed  and  you're  like
[27:41] okay  I  know  I  know  technically  that 
 that's  a  bad  thing  for  my  purpose  layer 
 but  then  you  know  I  really  like  it  and
[27:47] what  if  I  do  this  and  what  if  I  cope 
 like  this  and  I'll  keep  coping  I'll  keep 
 coping  and  I'll  keep  coping  and  I'll 
 keep  making  excuses  right
[27:53] it's  okay  right 
 sure  you  can  you  know  whatever  the
[27:59] excuse  is  in  your  mind  whatever  this 
 thing  that  you  need  to  sacrifice  maybe 
 it's  junk  food  for  a  fat  guy  maybe  it's
[28:04] a  weed  for  a  stone  or  whatever  it  is 
 right  there's  some  usually  instant 
 gratification  by  the  dopamine  bad  habits
[28:10] that  you  need  to  sacrifice  to  make  the 
 real  progress  to  your  purpose  and  when 
 you  refuse  to  do  it  you  live  like  a
[28:16] shell  of  the  man  that  you're  supposed  to 
 you  lose  respect  for  yourself  it's  like 
 metaphorically  your  dick  gets  smaller
[28:26] when  you  don't  live  to  your  purpose  as 
 close  to  a  hundred  percent  and  there  is 
 something  clear  in  your  mind  that  you
[28:32] should  sacrifice  but  you're  not 
 sacrificing  it 
 it  starts  to  fully  destroy  your
[28:39] perception  of  yourself  it  starts  to  make 
 you  feel  weak  it  starts  to  make  you  feel 
 insecure  your  ability  to  hold  eye
[28:45] contact  with  people  especially  women's 
 thoughts  that  drastically  go  down 
 your  ability  to  still  have  like  an  open
[28:51] confident  body  language  especially  when 
 another  man  who's  somewhat  intimidating 
 who's  bigger  in  size  than  you  walks  in
[28:58] and  he  holds  your  eye  contact  and  you 
 look  away  or  you  you  seem  to  speak  with 
 like  a  higher  pitched  voice  you  become
[29:03] less  of  a  man  when  you  don't  sacrifice 
 the  thing  that  you're  supposed  to  do
[29:08] and  I  know  this  because  two  years  ago 
 for  me  it  was  weed 
 the  purpose  layer  that  I  had  in  2022
[29:15] years  ago  just  before  the  start  of  covet 
 was  to  become  an  entrepreneur  and  to 
 make  money  online  and  to  get  to  achieve
[29:21] Freedom  through  that  I  wanted  to 
 specifically  make  money  online  and  be  in 
 Thailand  which  I've  kind  of  achieved  now 
 but  it's  like  doesn't  really  you  know
[29:27] that  was  the  all-purpose  layer  anyway 
 right  so  early  2020  that's  what  I  wanted 
 to  do  I  wanted  to  be  an  entrepreneur
[29:32] make  money  online  and  everything  and  the 
 thing  that  was  stopping  me  the  thing 
 that  I  needed  to  sacrifice  but  I  kept  on 
 delaying  it  was  smoking  weed  because
[29:38] yeah  you  know  but  it's  really  nice  at 
 the  end  of  a  hard  day  and  I've  been 
 really  working  hard  and  it's  relaxing
[29:43] and  it's  really  fun  and  you  know  I've 
 got  a  girl  there  who  makes  the  sex 
 better  and  everything  and  you  know 
 you've  got  to  have  a  break  sometimes  and
[29:48] everything  it's  kind  of  nice  to  smoke 
 and  you  sometimes  I  smoke  and  I  journal 
 and  I  like  to  smoke  and  it's  chilling
[29:53] here 
 imagine  that  version  of  me  who's  making
[29:58] these  excuses  who  knew  what  he  should  do 
 who  knew  what  he  should  sacrifice  but 
 didn't  make  those  choices
[30:05] imagine  that  version  of  me 
 who  had  this  mental  turbulence  in  his
[30:10] mind 
 do  you  think  I  would  have  been  totally 
 present  and  loving  and  masculine  then  or
[30:17] do  you  think  I  would  have  neurotically 
 had  like 
 self-obsessed  thoughts  anxious  thoughts
[30:22] in  my  mind 
 do  you  think  not  to  be  vulgar  but  when  I
[30:27] did  have  sex  my  erection  would  have  been 
 Rock  Hard  or  do  you  think  every  now  and 
 then  it  would  have  just  went  softer  for
[30:32] seemingly  no  reason  because  all  of  these 
 things  are  correlated
[30:37] all  of  them  are 
 your  level  of  masculinity  of  course  is
[30:42] colorated  to  the  the  firmness  of  your 
 erection  of  course  it  is
[30:48] and  so  rewind  back  two  years  from  now 
 2020  you  know  making  these  excuses  I
[30:53] don't  want  to  stop  smoking  weed  even 
 though  I  have  this  very  clear  purpose 
 layer  which  is  to  become  an  entrepreneur 
 and  achieve  the  freedom
[30:59] and  I'm  not  making  that  choice  I'm  not 
 making  that  sacrifice  and  I  didn't  for 
 months  and  months  and  months  and  I  hate
[31:05] in  my  life 
 and  I  started  to  hate  myself  and  I 
 started  to  look  at  myself  in  the  mirror
[31:10] with  this  like  vacant  dead-eyed 
 expression  high  so  high  so  stoned  at
[31:17] like  1am 
 looking  at  myself  in  the  mirrors  if  I'm 
 like 
 like  this
[31:23] whilst  I'm  having  like  a  piss  or 
 something 
 no  care  in  the  world
[31:34] is  that  the  kind  of  life  that  we  should 
 live 
 now  when  you  think  about  me  like  me  like
[31:40] you  know  what  you  know  of  me  right 
 that's  very  different  to  who  I  am  today 
 but  when  you  think  about  that  version  of
[31:45] me 
 and  think  that  what  it  took  for  me  to 
 make  progress  to  become  the  man  that  I
[31:50] am  today 
 was  sacrificing  something  that  I  didn't 
 want  to  sacrifice
[31:56] isn't  it  very  easy  for  you  to  sit  there 
 right  now  and  think  okay  that's  silly 
 like  he  should  have  just  sacrificed  weed
[32:01] faster  of  course  he  should  right  think 
 about  how  much  I  was  losing  out  on 
 it's  like
[32:06] it's  a  no-brainer 
 when  you  think  about  it  from  someone 
 else's  perspective  you're  thinking  about
[32:12] it  from  me  yeah  it's  a  no-brainer  that 
 you  should  quit  smoking  weed  hams  of 
 course  right  and  I'm  talking  about  like 
 you  know  two  years  ago  right
[32:18] well  then  for  me  to  think  about  that 
 with  you  it's  a  no-brainer  that  this 
 thing  that  you're  not  sacrificing  that
[32:23] you  probably  should  it's  a  no-brainer 
 for  me  to  think  wait  bro  this  thing  that 
 you're  not  sacrificing  whatever  it  is
[32:28] for  you 
 it  is  a  no-brainer 
 that  you  should
[32:34] because  the  gain  of  aligning  100  of  your 
 life  to  your  purpose  that  peel  back  this 
 layer  is  is  huge  so  this  thing  in  your
[32:41] mind  right  now  this  bad  habit  that  you 
 don't  want  to  get  rid  of  that  you  keep 
 coping  and  saying  that  oh  no  but  it 
 could  be  okay  like  if  it's  like  this
[32:46] could  be  okay  it's  only  a  little  bit
[32:54] you  know  exactly  what  you  should  do  and 
 up  until  you  do  that  you  will  you  will 
 not  feel  like  a  full  true  man  and  when
[33:00] you  do  make  that  decision  finally 
 it's  like  you  will  just  be  filled  with
[33:05] this  extra  level  of 
 shiva-like  masculine  energy
[33:11] you  will  literally  walk  up  straighter 
 like  your  chest  will  stick  out  more 
 you'll  gain  muscle  faster  like  all  these
[33:17] masculine  random  things  will  be  better 
 the  more  that  you  align  yourself  to  your 
 purpose  and  it  takes  sacrifice
[33:30] this  is  also  the  points  where  every  step 
 of  the  journey  every  bit  of  progress
[33:37] that  you  make  feels  amazing 
 so  when  you  know  what  your  your  current
[33:43] purpose  layer  your  mission  is  and  you 
 make  progress  towards  it
[33:48] you  feel 
 happy  blissful
[33:53] free 
 it's  amazing  imagine  you  really  really 
 care  about  your  body  transformation  and
[33:59] you  go  and  hit  a  great  workout  and  then 
 you  also  end  the  day  on  the  perfect 
 macronutrients  you  feel  amazing  it's
[34:05] like  that  thing  today  has  just  given  you 
 life  you  go  to  bed  literally  with  a
[34:10] smile  on  your  face  excited  for  tomorrow 
 let's  do  it  again  let's  do  it  again 
 let's  do  it  again  the  masculine  man
[34:16] has  most  of  all  about  making  progress  to 
 something  meaningful  and  this  is  why  men
[34:22] who  are  actually  on  their  purpose  men 
 who  are  doing  the  right  things  men  who 
 have  set  those  goals  and  are  on  on  track
[34:28] to  achieve  those  goals  men  who  said  that 
 they  were  going  to  hit  six  workouts  this 
 week  and  literally  are  on  the  sixth
[34:33] workout  this  week  that's  why  and  how  and 
 when  as  men  we  feel  good
[34:38] You've  Been  Told 
 by  again  like  you  know  these  like 
 Outsiders  these  unmasculine  people  these
[34:44] feminine  men  these  male  feminists  these 
 women  who  are  masculine  but  then  they 
 tell  you  not  to  be  masculine  you've  been
[34:50] told  by  these  people  who  don't  even  like 
 you  that  as  a  man  you  should  just  be 
 happy  whenever  you  indulge  that  it's
[34:56] okay  to  be  weak  it's  okay  to  be  soft 
 it's  okay  to  be  fat  well  it's  not 
 you  want  to  know  how  I  know  it's  not  you
[35:01] know  you  want  to  know  how  I  can  give  a 
 guaranteed  statement 
 of  truth  of  objective  universal  truth
[35:08] because  we  feel  terrible  when  we're  not 
 achieving  something  we  as  men  feel  awful 
 when  we're  not  making  progress  that  is
[35:14] why  you  see  the  hordes  of  millions  of 
 men  who  are  who  sink  deeper  and  deeper 
 into  technology  because  they  need  to
[35:20] stimulate  and  distract  themselves 
 because  these  kinds  of  men  who  aren't 
 making  progress  in  goals  literally  would
[35:25] feel  terrible  if  they  just  sat  there  for 
 one  minute  in  total  Consciousness  if  not
[35:30] distracting  themselves  imagine  you  talk 
 a  guy  who  genuinely  had  not  made  real 
 good  progress  to  some  kind  of  important
[35:35] goal  or  purpose  for  the  last  year  you 
 know  he's  just  been  wasting  away  like  a 
 Jeffrey  he's  just  been  playing  video
[35:40] games  smoking  weed  and  stuff  and  the 
 thing  is  he  can  still  say  that  he's  kind 
 of  enjoying  himself  because  he  plays  the
[35:45] newest  video  game  and  he  smokes  more 
 weed  and  you  know  he  does  all  those 
 things  imagine  taking  that  guy  locking 
 him  into  a  room  where  he  doesn't  have
[35:51] his  phone  or  anything  he  would  hate  it 
 wouldn't  it  so  we  can  say  with  certainty
[35:56] because  we  can  also  compare  that  to  the 
 man  who's  imagine  the  man  who's  been 
 making  so  much  progress  imagine  the  man
[36:01] who  genuinely  set  this  very  like  you 
 know  worthwhile  goal  this  purpose  that 
 he  knows  that  he  should  fulfill  and  he's
[36:07] made  amazing  progress  to  that  imagine 
 the  man  who  literally  has  hit  the 
 perfect  macronutrient  so  that  he's  had
[36:12] the  perfect  workout  today  he's  also  done 
 his  business  work  right  and  then  we  lock 
 that  man  into  into  an  empty  room
[36:17] that  at  that  this  second  man  who's  made 
 a  good  amount  of  progress  in  progress 
 he's  going  to  be  smiling  there  doing
[36:22] push-ups  he's  like  okay  whatever  I  don't 
 care  like  I've  already  hit  my  macros  for 
 today  I've  already  like  checked  off  all
[36:27] the  boxes  today  I  feel  awesome
[36:32] so  you  want  to  know  the  secrets  to 
 feeling  good  to  feeling  happy  to  feeling
[36:37] Pleasant  and  joyful  and  and  humorous  as 
 a  man
[36:43] make  progress  in  your  purpose  Leia 
 it's  that  simple 
 your  happiness  does  not  come  from
[36:48] stimulation  your  happiness  does  not  come 
 from  Indulgence  of  drugs  or  video  games 
 or  any  of  these  things  from  weed  or  any
[36:54] of  these  things 
 it  comes  from  progress  to  your  purpose
[36:59] layer 
 if  as  a  man  you  are  making  good  progress 
 to  your  purpose  you  will  feel  happy
[37:05] around  the  clock  but  if  you  are  not 
 making  good  progress  to  your  purpose 
 based  on  your  own  perception  of  your  you
[37:12] know  your  strength  your  dedication  and 
 everything  based  on  your  own  talents 
 you  will  feel  bad
[37:17] so  I  want  you  to  just  take  a  quick 
 little  second  right  now  and  to  just  kind 
 of  think  okay
[37:22] it's  currently  you  know  as  I'm  recording 
 this  it's  February  2023  maybe  you're 
 watching  it  at  a  different  time  but  it's
[37:27] February  2023  we've  been  in  this  new 
 year  now  for  one  month  and  one  week  or 
 so  how  happy  and  pleasant  and  positive
[37:34] have  I  been  for  this  last  month  ask 
 yourself  that  question  how  happy 
 Pleasant  and  positive  have  you  felt  in
[37:41] the  last  month 
 unless  there's  been  some  kind  of  like 
 very  unpl  like  you  know  some  significant
[37:47] event  like  a  family  member  passes  but 
 let's  say  it's  just  a  normal  you  know 
 last  month  no  one  has  passed  away  or
[37:52] anything  like  that  right  there's  no  like 
 serious  car  accidents  or  anything  right 
 it's  just  Monday  normal  life
[37:58] if  you  answer  this  question  like  yeah 
 actually  I've  been  really  happy  chances 
 are  that  you've  been  making  a  really 
 good  amount  of  progress  to  your  purpose
[38:04] now  if  you  answer  this  question  and  say 
 no  I'm  actually  depressed  and  I  take 
 antidepressants  and  it's  not  because  of
[38:09] purpose  or  anything  no  no  it's  a 
 clinical  problem  it's  a  biological  thing 
 and  I  take  anti-anti  anxiety  medication
[38:16] and  no  it's  not  because  I  I  spend  all 
 day  on  the  Internet  or  anything  it's 
 because  of  something  else
[38:22] there's  men  out  there  who  don't  feel 
 good  who  haven't  felt  good  in  a  long 
 time  who  need  to  like  take  pills  and 
 everything  to  still  not  even  feel  good
[38:31] simply  because  they're  not  making 
 progress 
 when  you  make  progress  understand  this
[38:36] when  you  make  progress  to  your  purpose 
 you  feel  good  every  step  of  the  way  you 
 feel  good
[38:41] so you  can  just  start  to  evaluate  how 
 good  your  days  feel 
 and  that  will  tell  you  how  much  more
[38:48] like  you  can  put  in 
 and  you  would  be  surprised  by  the  way 
 you  know  I'm  telling  you  okay  align  as
[38:53] much  as  of  your  life  as  you  can  to  your 
 purpose  you  would  be  surprised  at  just 
 how  much  you  can  actually  do
[39:00] you  know  with  all 
 all  of  like  the  advice  that  men  get
[39:05] toxic  advice  that  men  get  not  not  from 
 hopefully  not  from  men  like  me  but  from
[39:10] like  the  male  family  you  know  from  like 
 those  people  who  give  us  advice  they 
 tell  us  open  up  and  be  emotional  and  cry
[39:16] and  it's  okay  to  be  weak  it's  okay  to  be 
 feminine  all  those  people  say  this  to  us 
 the  thing  is  with  all  of  the  advice  they
[39:22] give  us 
 it  doesn't  actually  work 
 The  Man  Who  Lies  around  who  says  it's
[39:28] okay  to  be  weak  who  plays  video  games 
 that's  stereotypical  guys  on
[39:33] antidepressants 
 you  see  the  rise  of  like  the 
 antidepressant  influencer  giving
[39:38] happiness  and  mental  health  advice  to 
 other  guys
[39:43] why  we  should  we  listen  to  them 
 to  be  happy  all  you  have  to  do  is  is
[39:49] make  progress  to  your  purpose  if  you're 
 not  happy 
 and  there  hasn't  been  some  kind  of
[39:54] chaotic  events  recently  like  some  car 
 accident  or  family  member  death  it's 
 simply  because  you've  not  made  enough
[39:59] progress  it's  as  simple  as  that 
 all  right
[40:04] so  now  we've  made  a  lot  of  progress  to 
 this  purpose  layer  and  this  is  where  it
[40:09] gets  interesting  now 
 it's  completed 
 so  whatever  you  know  this  big  mission  is
[40:15] on  in  your  mind  right  now  whether  it's 
 studying  or  getting  really  fit  or 
 whatever  right  this  is  the  thing  we're 
 obsessing  over  obsessing  over  obsessing
[40:21] over  it's  going  to  be  so  good  once  we've 
 completed  this  thing  once  I've  done  that 
 exam  and  I've  got  the  grade  that's  going
[40:26] to  get  me  into  University  it's  going  to 
 be  so  good  once  I  build  the  body  it's 
 going  to  be  so  good  I'm  peeling  back 
 this  layer  of  my  line  in  as  much  of  my
[40:31] life  as  I  can  to  it  and  it's  done 
 oh
[40:36] it's  done 
 so 
 this  is  how  it  feels  when  you  complete  a
[40:42] layer  of  your  purpose 
 just  like  that  it's  the  it's  the
[40:47] equivalent  of  like  just  a  board  shrug 
 for  so  long  we  hyped  up  this  thing  I've
[40:53] made  a  long  video  explaining  okay  the 
 benefits  of  purpose  whoa  and  when  you 
 actually  complete  a  layer  of  your
[40:58] purpose  it  literally  just  feels  like 
 whatever  so  actually  it's  kind  of  stupid
[41:03] you'll  specifically  look  at  the  layer  of 
 purpose  that  you've  spent  so  long  on  and 
 you're  almost  like  downplay  it  it  almost
[41:09] will  seem  silly  it'll  almost  seem  a 
 little  bit  stupid  it'll  seem  like  it  was 
 kind  of  like  a  waste  of  time  it'll  be
[41:14] weird  right  you're  right  now  you're 
 thinking  wait  wait  I'm  never  gonna  be 
 like  that  wait  what  no  no  I'm  studying 
 I'm  gonna  get  a  good  grade  and  it's
[41:19] gonna  be  super  important  I  promise  you 
 when  you  complete  the  layer  of  your 
 purpose  you're  gonna  look  back  to  all  of
[41:24] the  work  you've  just  put  in  in  this  one 
 particular  thing  when  you  truly  complete 
 it  right  and  it's  almost  gonna  seem
[41:30] weird  why  you  put  in  that  much  work  into 
 it  and  it's  going  to  be  so 
 anti-climactic  it's  going  to  be  kind  of
[41:35] boring  you're  going  to  be  just  thinking 
 okay  what  was  the  point  in  all  that  it 
 was  just  silly  this  is  how  I  feel  about
[41:40] the  big  YouTube  operation  that  we  had 
 and  one  and  a  half million  subscribers 
 that  meant  so  much  to  me  I  was  literally
[41:45] like  writing  down  these  goals  sticking 
 piece  of  papers  with  like  you  know  1 
 million  subscribers  five  1.5  like  all
[41:51] around  my  wall  as  if  it  was  the  most 
 important  thing  ever  now  I  look  at  it  as 
 if  it  was  just  like  that  she's  silly
[41:56] this  is  how  it  actually  works  once  you 
 complete  a  layer  of  your  purpose 
 something  inside  of  us  has  been
[42:02] meticulously  made  to  make  us 
 move  away  from  it
[42:09] this  is  so  interesting  something  inside 
 of  us  as  men  in  general  has  been  made  so
[42:14] that  we  feel  some  kind  of  boredom  and 
 indifference  and  almost  like  slightly
[42:19] resentful  for  the  time  that  we've  just 
 spent  on  this  goal  you've  probably  heard 
 of  this  too 
 isn't  it  kind  of  normal  commenter  here
[42:26] of  a  man  who  achieves  like  this  big  goal 
 that  he  had  set  out  and  then  he  just 
 kind  of  feels  depressed  afterwards  he
[42:32] just  kind  of  feels  bored  afterwards 
 you've  thought  that  hitting  a  million 
 subscribers  would  make  you  really  happy
[42:37] you  think  this  right  now  right  if  you're 
 like  a  young  YouTuber  you  think  right 
 here  right  now  one  million  subscribers 
 would  make  me  so  happy  I  guarantee  you
[42:43] right  now  you  know  how  it  actually  feels 
 from  a  guy  who's  genuinely  got  that  at 
 999  000  you  feel  like  this
[42:49] at  a  million  you  feel  like  this 
 there's  no  difference  achieving  some  Big
[42:54] Goal  as  a  guy  literally  does  not  make 
 you  feel  any  different  and  so  you're 
 maybe  wondering  okay
[42:59] why  why is  it  like  this 
 well  remember  what  I  just  said  before
[43:05] that  we  as  a  man  feel  good  when  we  make 
 progress
[43:10] to  some  meaningful  goals  a  layer  of  our 
 purpose  the  reason  why  when  you  open  up
[43:15] and  fulfill  a  layer  of  your  purpose  when 
 you  complete  a  big  goal  and  you  have 
 these  accomplishment  that  you've  been 
 working  so  hard  for  the  reason  why  after
[43:21] you've  done  it  doesn't  even  feel  that 
 good  is  because  straight  away
[43:27] you  are  now  ready  to  make  progress  in 
 the  next  thing  and  so  a  lot  of  men  stay
[43:34] here 
 in  this  this  feeling  of  like  sadness  and
[43:39] thinking  wait  why  did  I  work  so  hard  for 
 this  thing  it's  pointless  and  you  know 
 they  waste  time  and  maybe  they  over
[43:44] indulge  in  partying  and  drugs  they're 
 celebrating  stuff 
 and  it  just  this  is  like  something  that
[43:49] that  freaks  men  out  and  you  might  not  be 
 here  just  yet  it  might  seem  really  weird 
 to  you  and  you're  so  convinced  that
[43:54] you're  not  going  to  be  like  this  chances 
 are  you  probably  are 
 it  just  seems  strange  and  the  reason  why
[44:00] it's  so  anti-climatic  when  you  complete 
 a  layer  of  your  purpose
[44:05] is  because 
 you've  got  to  be  ready  for  the  next  one 
 we  as  men  feel  good  when  we  make
[44:11] progress 
 when  we  accomplish  something  you  know 
 the  moment  of  Celebration  that  we've
[44:16] done  the  thing  it  often  feels 
 anticlimactic  it  often  does  if  not  then
[44:21] in  the  moment  of  Celebration  then 
 afterwards  you're  you  often  look  back  to 
 the  thing  that  you've  dedicated  your
[44:26] life  to  for  the  last  few  years  and  you 
 think  it's  just  silly  Mike  Tyson  he  did
[44:31] some  kind  of  interview  with  a  news 
 reporter  brings  him  in  to  see  his  belts 
 and  all  this  and  you  know  the  news
[44:36] reporter  shows  and  pictures  and 
 everything  of  him  with  the  belts  and 
 Mike  Tyson  literally  says  it's  all
[44:41] garbage  it  doesn't  mean  anything  it's 
 all  garbage 
 that's  a  little  bit  like  how  you  will
[44:47] feel  about  when  this  moment  that  you've 
 completed  a  layer  of  your  purpose  that's 
 how  well  literally  I  was  speaking  to  my
[44:52] best  friend  Sam  about  the  YouTube 
 channel  I  Paul  it's  just  stupid  it's 
 just  it's  just  silly  now  of  course  it's
[44:57] not  from  your  perspective  if  you're  like 
 a  pretty  big  fan  of  mine  you'll  probably 
 be  thinking  that  this  is  weird  but
[45:03] literally  just  three  days  ago  I'm 
 literally  looking  at  the  whole  channel 
 the  videos  and  thinking  bro  it's  just 
 stupid  it's  just  stupid  it's  just  silly
[45:08] it's  just  like  oh  Jeffrey  I'm  just 
 making  fun  of  it  myself  and  I'm  almost 
 saying  the  exact  same  things  that  Mike
[45:14] Tyson  said  about  his  heavyweight  belts 
 this  doesn't  mean  that  objectively  it's 
 a  stupid  thing  because  objectively  Mike
[45:20] Tyson  became  a  legend  forever 
 objectively  like  the  videos  that  I've
[45:25] made  have  probably  helped  quite  a  lot  of 
 guys  out  there  so  it's  not  a  stupid 
 thing  and  yet  it  feels  like  it  is  for
[45:30] you  once  you've  completed  it  and  the 
 reason  why  is  most  likely  this  is  like 
 so  divine
[45:36] creation  inside  of  us  it's  so  that  we 
 don't  get 
 hooked  onto  this  one  thing  that  now
[45:42] we've  completed  and  it  allows  us  space 
 to  then  focus  on  the  next  thing  so  once
[45:47] you've  completed  this  this  layer  of  your 
 purpose  that  you've  spent  so  long  on 
 you've  studied  for  this  exam  and  you  got
[45:52] the  grade  that  you  wanted  and  now  you're 
 in  college  well 
 it's  time  to  now  focus  on  the  next  layer
[45:59] as  a  man  it  is  always  constant  striving 
 for  progress  on  the  layer  that  we're  in
[46:05] and  sometimes 
 you  won't  even  enjoy  celebrating  for  an
[46:10] hour  once  you've  completed  a  layer 
 sometimes  you'll  complete  a  layer  and
[46:15] literally  just  want  to  start  moving  on 
 to  the  next  one  immediately  sometimes 
 you'll  want  to  move  on  to  the  next  one 
 before  you've  even  totally  completed
[46:20] this  one 
 this  is  how  it  will  feel
[46:25] anticlimactic  bored  but  not  because  this 
 isn't  a  journey  that's  worth  going  on
[46:31] but  simply  just  because  we're  supposed 
 to  feel  quite  disinterested  in  this  old
[46:37] thing  which  is  no  longer  our  purpose 
 and  so  we  go  back  to  the  previous  stage
[46:42] remember  where  we  don't  really  know  our 
 purpose  so  we  kind  of  are  open  and  we 
 don't  distract  ourselves  we  don't
[46:47] stimulate  ourselves  we  stare  at  our  wall 
 we're  kind  of  open  to  new  ideas  and  then 
 we  get  that  vision
[46:52] and  that's  when  we  discover  the  next 
 layer  of  the  purpose  and  we  do  the  exact 
 same  progress  process  again
[47:00] there's  a  few  things  that  I'll  mention 
 here 
 which  is  very  this  is  very  specific
[47:05] things  right  so  you  won't  hear  this 
 anywhere  else  but  I  am  pretty  sure  that 
 a  lot  of  men  at  this  point  of  the
[47:11] completion  of  a  purpose  actually 
 physically  gets  sick  this  is  something 
 I've  physically  seen  in  in  myself  and  in
[47:18] loads  of  other  men  when  a  man  is 
 constantly  working  on  his  purpose  this 
 big  goal  and  he  eventually  completes  it
[47:24] he  accomplishes  it  it's  like  he  gets 
 this  genuine  feeling  of  sickness  he's
[47:29] genuinely  like  he's  stuffy  his  nose  is 
 running  he's  got  a  dry  throat  he's  got  a 
 headache  everything  this  literally  just
[47:34] happened  to  me  like  four  days  ago  I  just 
 picked  up  a  fever  out  of  nowhere  for 
 like  one  whole  day  I'm  like  curled  up  in
[47:39] bed  and  stuff  and  the  reason  why  I  think 
 this  happens  and  I've  seen  this  in  in 
 with  my  friend  first  man  the  the  guy  who
[47:44] does  the  YouTube  videos  I've  seen  it 
 with  him  where  like  he  works  really 
 really  hard  to  get  this  to  the  certain
[47:49] point  and  as  soon  as  it  was  done  he  was 
 sick  for  like  two  weeks  I've  seen  this 
 so  many  times  with  different  guys
[47:54] they'll  accomplish  the  goal  the  purpose 
 and  then  literally  physically  get  sick
[47:59] and  the  reason  why  this  may  happen  is 
 because  we  as  men  especially  when  we 
 achieve  living  our  purpose
[48:05] it's  like  you're  strong  every  step  that 
 you  take  towards  your  purpose  makes  you 
 physically  strong  physically  mentally
[48:10] everything  you  feel  so  good  aligning 
 yourself  to  your  purpose  and  trying  to 
 peel  back  that  layer  and  then  eventually
[48:16] when  you  have  peel  the  layer  it's  like 
 now  it  all  hits  it  all  resets  it's  like 
 okay  you're  essentially  you  know  on  Step
[48:22] Zero  of  completing  the  next  purpose  so 
 you're  not  like  you  haven't  made  a
[48:27] significant  amount  of  progress  in  this 
 next  layer  so  it's  almost  like  you're  at 
 the  beginning  again  and  you're  hit  now
[48:32] with  all  of  the  the  diseases  and 
 sicknesses  that  you've  picked  up  over 
 the  last  while  but  that  you've  pushed
[48:38] off  because  of  this  mental  like  strength 
 that  you  have  this  is  perhaps  why  we
[48:43] hear  stories  of  masculine  men  who  worked 
 hard  their  entire  lives  who  were
[48:48] literally  65  70  75  years  old  still 
 working  some  kind  of  job  or  project  and
[48:53] the  moment  that  they  truly  retired  they 
 died  like  a  week  after  you've  probably
[48:58] heard  of  this  kind  of  thing  before 
 having  you  that  there'll  be  a  guy  who's 
 lit  like  an  old  man  who's  literally 
 worked  hard  his  entire  life  and  as  soon
[49:04] as  he  retires  like  two  weeks  later  he 
 dies 
 because  we're  not  supposed  to  stop
[49:11] we're  not  supposed  to  stop  we're  not 
 supposed  to  retire  we're  not  supposed  to
[49:16] take  vacations  or  holidays  these  are 
 modern  day 
 feminine  inventions
[49:23] because  life  as  a  man  is  supposed  to  be 
 this  constant  peeling  of  your  layer  the
[49:29] discovery  of  a  new  layer 
 and  then  peeling  again  and  again  and 
 again
[49:34] and  that  can  seem  kind  of 
 upsetting  Kana  it  can  seem  kind  of  like
[49:39] oh  boring  or  maybe  agitating  like  but 
 but  when  does  it  when  does  it  complete
[49:44] when  does  it  stop  like  I  want  it  to  stop 
 like  you  know  when  do  I  get  to  like  live 
 my  life
[49:49] well 
 this  this  is  your  life 
 this  is  perhaps  the  most  beautiful  kind
[49:54] of  life  that  you  could  live  as  a  life  of 
 of  constant  progress  to  things  that 
 actually  mean  a  lot  to  you
[50:01] and  who  knows  what  happens  once  you  peel 
 back  so  many  layers  and  you  get  to  a 
 point  where  there's  no  more  layers  than
[50:06] it  is  just  this  core  thing  inside  of  you 
 at  the  end  of  this  video  I  will
[50:11] speculate  what  it  feels  like  to  like 
 literally  have  all  the  layers  peeled 
 back
[50:16] but  just  for  now  I  am  sure  that  there's 
 going  to  be  some  young  guys  watching
[50:21] this  who  almost  have  a  sense  of  like 
 slightly  like  agitation  and  hatred  for 
 this  potential  life  that  I'm  mentioning
[50:26] which  is  okay  we  constantly  peel  back 
 the  layer  we  don't  even  enjoy  the 
 celebration  we  don't  even  like  the
[50:31] accomplishment  then  we  peel  back  the 
 next  one  then  the  next  one  then  the  next 
 one  we  don't  take  time  off  for  anything 
 we  just  constantly  keep  peeling  them
[50:36] back  it  seems  like  you  know  I  can 
 imagine  there's  going  to  be  quite  a  few 
 guys  who  don't  like  this  the  idea  of
[50:42] this  and  maybe  this  is  because  of 
 difference  maybe  this  is  because  you're 
 more  feminine  than  you're  supposed  to  be
[50:47] because  of  brainwashing  and  conditioning 
 that  goes  on  especially  in  Western 
 countries  maybe  this  is  because  again
[50:53] from  this  you  know  the  modern  media 
 machine  the  Hollywood  movies  and  the  TV 
 shows  you've  been  sold  this  idea  that
[50:59] like  man  love  man  loves  to  look  forward 
 to  vacations  and  he  has  to  work  and  work
[51:05] and  work  and  then  oh  yes  vacation  and 
 holidays  coming  up  soon  I  can't  wait  to 
 have  freedom  yet  that  is  life  guys  like
[51:10] you've  been  sold  this  message  from 
 movies  and  everything  from  people  from 
 school  holidays  and  everything  okay  we
[51:16] love  to  wait  for  the  holidays  the 
 holidays  is  when  life  is  actually  lived 
 and  yet
[51:21] no 
 if  we  really  take  some  time  right  now  to 
 think
[51:28] a  man's  life  is  not  on  holiday 
 a  man's  life
[51:33] is  in  training  it's  in  war 
 that's  what  makes  our  life  worth  living
[51:41] because  if  you  delay  and  if  you  want  to 
 live  this  life  like  most  men  do  right 
 the  modern  media  machine  really  like  you
[51:47] know  the  media  Hollywood  movies  they've 
 written  like  just  governments  and  and 
 everything  right  the  The  Narrative  of
[51:52] the  normal  people  is  that  a  man  should 
 get  a  job  when  he's  18  or  something  and
[51:57] then  just  work  and  work  and  work  and 
 work  and  work  till  he's  like  65  and  then
[52:02] retire  and  now  he  gets  to  enjoy  his  life 
 the  big  payout  things  are  going  to  be
[52:08] different  things  are  going  to  be 
 different  when  you  get  that  promotion 
 things  are  going  to  be  different  how 
 about  that  cost
[52:17] gonna  be  different 
 and  yet  we  can  learn  from  the  men  who
[52:22] have  believed  these  lies  and  things 
 aren't  different 
 they  die  after  retirements  he  gets  the
[52:27] new  car  and  doesn't  even  feel  any 
 difference
[52:32] I  don't  think  that's  the  way  that  we're 
 supposed  to  live  even  though  that  is 
 like  the  like  this  is  kind  of  hard  to 
 talk  about  because  this  is  like
[52:38] literally  the  normal  belief  in  our  brain 
 is  yeah  work  is  bad
[52:43] normal  life  is  bad  weekend's  good 
 holiday  good  retirement  good
[52:49] but  if  you're  watching  my  content  you're 
 probably  a  little  bit  more  based  than 
 the  normal  person  and  you  already
[52:54] understand  retirement's  probably  a  scam 
 We're  Not  Gonna  you  know  the  government 
 or  your  old  company  is  not  just  going  to
[52:59] give  you  free  money  obviously  they're 
 gonna  like  they'll  stop  retiring  you 
 know  what  I mean  like  so  we  don't 
 believe  most  of  these  lies  right  we're
[53:05] not  living  you  and  I  aren't  living  for 
 the  weekend  or  anything  so  when 
 you  think  about  this  life  where  you  live
[53:11] to  your  purpose  and  then  you  peel  back 
 the  purpose  and  it's  finished  and  then 
 it's  just  you  may  as  well  just  make  Pro
[53:16] works  in  the  next  one  you  can  start  to 
 see  that  although  that  may  seem  a  little 
 bit  depressive  to  think  okay  well  my
[53:22] life's  just  going  to  be  constantly 
 working  with  no  retirement  no  break  or 
 anything
[53:27] I  want  you  to  genuinely  think  okay 
 how  much  fun  do  you  really  have  when
[53:32] you're  not  productive  how  much  fun  do 
 you  really  have  when  you're  not  doing 
 anything  because  the  thing  is  right  you
[53:38] have  a  lot  of  fun  on  your  time  off  when 
 you  play  video  games  and  when  you  do 
 something  right  fair  enough  but  when 
 you're  playing  video  games  you're  just
[53:43] stimulate  you're  like  you're  simulating 
 a  masculine  life  that  you're  literally 
 simulating  Brotherhood  competition
[53:48] everything  right 
 how  much  fun  does  the  average  man  have 
 on  holiday
[53:54] where  he  has  to  pretend  that  he's  having 
 a  good  time  when  he  sits  on  the  beach 
 and  like  you  know  going  to  the  beach  is 
 nice  oh  yeah  sweet  oh  nice  take  a
[54:00] picture  yeah  sweet  and  then  once  you've 
 been  on  the  beach  like  an  hour  it's  like 
 okay  well  yeah  it's  a  bit  boring  now
[54:06] foreign 
 you  see  a  man  comes  alive  not  in  times 
 of  rest  in  times  of  like  you  know
[54:13] enjoyment  and  holiday  no 
 we  come  alive  and  we  are  in  a  total  of
[54:18] Flow  State  and  present  like  there's  no 
 thoughts  in  our  brain  when  we're  in 
 training  and  we're  good  when  we're
[54:23] making  progress  to  something  that  means 
 a  lot  to  us 
 so  maybe  it's  worth  it  if  we  consider
[54:29] you  know  what  maybe  my  ideal  life  would 
 probably  be  just  constant  [ __ ]  just
[54:35] constant  progress  constant  progress 
 constant  progress  to  all  these 
 purposeful  layers  and  imagine  how  far  I
[54:41] could  go  imagine  the  life  that  I  could 
 live  which  is  comprised  almost  by  like  a
[54:46] hundred  mini  lives  in  one
[54:52] that  could  be  a  beautiful  existence
[55:02] one  point  that  I've  made  here  when  it 
 comes  to  completing  the  layer  of  your
[55:07] your  purpose  and  I've  learned  this  again 
 from  the  book  The  Way  of  the  superior 
 man  is  that  you  should  complete  the
[55:14] layer 
 in  a  way  that  doesn't  harm  anyone  else 
 so  oftentimes  you  will  have  a  layer  of
[55:20] your  purpose  that's  just  totally 
 independent  and  it's  solo  and  it's  just 
 about  you  okay  you've  completed  it
[55:25] you've  lost  the  weight  now  it's  time  to 
 focus  on  something  else  okay  sweet 
 but  there  will  be  times  maybe  not  just
[55:30] yet  but  it'll  be  important  for  you  to 
 learn  this  lesson  there  will  be  times 
 when  you  fulfill  a  layer  of  your  purpose
[55:35] by  having  the  help  or  you  know  being 
 around  other  people  to  help  you  whether
[55:40] it's  for  example  like  for  me  you  know  to 
 spread  my  message  of  self-improvement 
 that  was  my  layer  of  my  purpose  I
[55:45] employed  a  bunch  of  people  to  help  me  do 
 that  video  editors  and  personal 
 assistant  and  sales  staff  and  all  this
[55:50] right  so  I  I  had  like  15  people  that  I 
 was  paying  for  as  employees  that  I  was 
 paying  for  to  run  this  YouTube  channel
[55:55] not  like  a  video  like  this  but  like  if 
 you've  seen  you  know  my  previous  videos 
 there's  video  editors  and  admin  and  all
[56:01] this  stuff  right 
 so  one  thing  is  that  once  you've 
 completed  a  layer  of  your  purpose  and
[56:06] it's  time  to  align  the  rep  like  all  of 
 your  life  to  the  next  layer  it's  to  just
[56:11] make  sure  you  spend  enough  time  really 
 making  sure  that  you  don't  harm  anyone
[56:17] by  changing  your  your  focus  to  the  new 
 layer  when  you  do  Discover  it  so  in  my
[56:23] case  my  purpose  layer  was  to  spread  the 
 message  of  self-improvement  on  YouTube 
 to  grow  the  YouTube  channel  to  get  a
[56:28] million  subscribers  1.5  million 
 subscribers  we  got  there  I  completed  the 
 layer  of  my  purpose  it  just  seemed
[56:33] pointless  to  continue  I'm  looking  at  it 
 like  okay  this  is  just  silly  I  don't 
 want  to  do  this  anymore  my  focus  is
[56:38] elsewhere  I  just  want  to  sit  down  and 
 record  a  video  every  now  and  then  but 
 with  no  team  or  anything  like  this  I
[56:43] don't  want  the  expenses  I  don't  want  to 
 spend  50  000  pounds  a  month  running  this 
 Channel  or  anything
[56:48] I  read  this  chapter  of  the  way  the 
 superior  man  from  this  book  and  it's
[56:53] said  that  you  should  make  sure  that  you 
 should  cut  off  the  ties  with  everyone 
 properly  otherwise  if  you  leave  this
[57:00] layer  of  your  purpose  in  the  wrong  way 
 it  can  come  back  to  bite  you
[57:06] so  what  I  actually  wanted  to  do 
 genuinely  what  I  wanted  to  do  as  soon  as
[57:11] I  completed  like  you  know  the  previous 
 layer  of  my  purpose  to  grow  the  YouTube 
 channel  literally  just  let  everyone  else 
 everyone  go  okay  goodbye  and  focus  on  my
[57:17] new  thing 
 I  wanted  to  do  that  but  for  quite  a 
 while  I'm  debating  this  decision  because
[57:23] I  realized  like  this  15  guys  who  are  my 
 employees  who  who  rely  on  me  who  need  me
[57:29] who  need  the  money  that  I  paid  them  and 
 so  I  delayed  the  decision  for  a  long 
 time  to  be  100  sure  that  this  is  the
[57:35] direction  that  I  wanted  to  take  and  then 
 eventually  when  I  was  sure  I  started  to 
 like  really  I  spent  an  entire  day
[57:41] thinking  about  okay  what's  the  best  way 
 to  treat  these  guys  okay  this  is  what 
 I'm  gonna  do  to  all  of  my  employees  I'm 
 going  to  pay  them  a  severance  package
[57:47] which  I  don't  have  to  do  because  they 
 were  all  Freelancers  they  were  all  you 
 know  like  they're  not  like  actual  real 
 government  style  employees  that  we've
[57:53] done  through  a  contract  they  were  all 
 Freelancers  you  don't  have  to  pay  a 
 freelancer  like  a  severance  or  anything
[57:58] but  I  thought  wait  some  of  these  guys 
 have  have  worked  for  me 
 for  months  and  months  and  months  so  I'm
[58:04] going  to  literally  just  essentially  give 
 them  free  money  just  so  that  like  when 
 we  split  up  they've  got  like  kind  of
[58:09] like  their  normal  wage  for  another  two 
 weeks  or  four  weeks  so  I  gave  out  more 
 than  ten  thousand  dollars  I  think  about
[58:15] fifteen  thousand  dollars  like  just  like 
 this  essentially  free  money  to  give  to 
 these  guys  just  because  they  had  relied
[58:20] on  me  previously  then  I  spent  over  an 
 hour  which  was  quite  tedious  to  like 
 record  a  testimonial  for  everyone  on  my
[58:26] team  hey  guys  it's  Hamza  and  I'm 
 recording  this  testimonial  for  my  editor 
 Mo  he's  done  a  really  good  job  if  you
[58:31] want  to  hire  him  I  can  support  it 
 whatever 
 so  I  did  that  then  soon  you're  going  to
[58:36] see  a  community  post  on  the  main  Channel 
 where  I'm  also  going  to  post  everyone's 
 like  all  my  ex  employees  links  so  that
[58:42] they  can  find  new  work  as  well  so  it's 
 like  I've  really  tried  to  set  these  guys 
 up  who  have  just  letting  go  with  new
[58:49] work  opportunities  and  to  set  them  up 
 nicely  because  I  realize  that  you  don't 
 want  to  end  a  purpose  layer  by  hurting
[58:57] people  in  any  kind  of  way  because  that 
 might  come  back  to  bite  you  that  might 
 then  eventually  become  like  a  new
[59:03] purpose  layer  that  then  oh  I've  got  to 
 help  that  guy  that  I've  really  abandoned 
 before
[59:08] so  that's  a  very  specific  like  instance 
 that  I  had  you  know  I  had  employees 
 maybe  you  won't  have  this  but  there  is  a
[59:13] chance  that  at  some  point  in  your  life 
 there's  gonna  be  someone  who's  a  part  of
[59:18] your  purpose  layer  and  once  that  layer 
 is  complete  you  won't  actually  probably 
 need  that  person  in  your  life  anymore
[59:23] and  it  should  be  very  good  for  you  to 
 just  remember  this  message  make  sure  you 
 treat  them  really  well  because  it  will
[59:29] haunt  you  in  the  future  like  you  know  at 
 the  moment  of  a  completion  of  a  purpose 
 it's  so  easy  to  think  yeah  whatever  I
[59:35] don't  care  about  this  thing  anymore  I 
 don't  care  about  anyone  related  to  this 
 thing  I'm  focused  on  this  other  thing  of 
 course  remember  because  it's  like  that
[59:40] feeling  of  like  yep  I  don't  care  about 
 this  anymore  it  just  feels  indifferent  I 
 just  feel  bored  and  everything  there's  a
[59:45] little  insect  on  my  little  oh  come  on 
 it's  very  inter  uh  it's  very  easy  to  act
[59:52] like  that  and  so  this  is  just  a  quick 
 warning  don't  complete  the  layer  of 
 purpose  and  just  forget  everyone  who  was
[59:58] involved  there  make  sure  you  treat  them 
 nicely 
 now  this  is  a  very  interesting  one  that
[60:04] I've  not  seen  mentioned  anywhere  else 
 but  let's  say  you've  just  completed  a 
 layer  of  your  purpose  so  the  layer  could
[60:10] be 
 the  YouTube  channel  the  layer  could  be 
 you  know  getting  the  grade  or  the  you 
 know  like  whatever  the  big  Obsession  was
[60:16] the  mission  was  for  you  this  is 
 something  I  realized  as  soon  as  you've 
 completed  a  layer  of  your  purpose
[60:24] try  to  Min  try  to  continue  even  on  the 
 new  purpose  layer  that  you  eventually
[60:29] find  try  to  continue  the  maintenance 
 volume  of  the  previous  thing  so  let  me
[60:34] tell  you  an  example  right  in  terms  of 
 Fitness  right 
 part  of  my  purpose  layer  for  a  long  time
[60:40] was  to  build  an  aesthetic  physique  to 
 build  muscle  into  like  you  know  have  a 
 good  physique  that  was  inspiring  that
[60:46] made  me  look  good  that  got  me  girls  and 
 everything  that  this  was  a  huge 
 Obsession  in  my  mind  right  and  I  kind  of 
 you  know  I  don't  have  the  perfect
[60:51] physique  or  anything  but  I  certainly 
 completed  how  important  this  was  it  was 
 a  layer  of  my  purpose  and  I  completed  it
[60:58] but  you  know  what  I  did  which  was  quite 
 smart  and  this  was  years  ago  with  before 
 I  even  knew  it  I  carried  on  training  now
[61:05] this  seems  like  common  sense  right  so  my 
 big  goal  was  to  build  a  body  that  I'm 
 proud  of  that  I  really  like
[61:11] I  built  it  and  then  I  could  have  just 
 stopped  after  that  I  could  have  just  yep 
 I  built  it  and  now  I'm  not  gonna  train
[61:16] anymore  now  that  sounds  stupid  doesn't 
 it 
 but  when  you 
 understand  that  like  I  completed  the
[61:22] layer  and  now  my  new  layer  is  about 
 fighting  my  new  layers  about  martial 
 arts  which  is  a  completely  different
[61:28] kind  of  sport  to  train  for  it  might 
 actually  make  sense  and  it  might  be 
 understandable  if  I  told  you  oh  yeah  by
[61:33] the  way  I'm  not  really  going  to  the  gym 
 and  doing  resistance  training  and 
 bodybuilding  and  weightlifting  anymore
[61:38] because  I'm  literally  just  focused  on 
 fighting  if  I  said  that  it  like  it 
 wouldn't  be  absolutely  crazy  would  it
[61:44] you'd  be  thinking  oh  it's  a  waste  mine 
 you  built  a  nice  physique  and  if  you 
 want  to  get  into  fighting  fair  enough 
 but  you  could  probably  maintain  it  but
[61:50] like  if  I  was  like  no  no  I  just  care 
 about  fighting  just  care  about  fighting 
 good  but  okay  fair  enough  do  I  mean 
 right
[61:55] but  what  I  realized  was  and  this  has 
 happened  to  me  multiple  times  what  I've 
 realized  is  that  when  you've  completed  a
[62:01] layer  of  your  purpose 
 and  you've  built  the  physique  for 
 example  or  you've  built  the  business  and
[62:06] you've  made  the  money  or  whatever  it  is 
 if  you  don't  maintain  that  thing  that 
 you've  just  completed
[62:12] it  will  deteriorate 
 and  when  it  deteriorates  enough  it  will
[62:17] actually  become  a  purpose  layer  once 
 again 
 so  let's  say  I've  built  a  really  good
[62:23] physique  and  I'm  thinking  okay  you  know 
 I've  built  a  really  good  physique  I've 
 sold  an  online  course  training  program
[62:28] about  it  so  now  I'm  profiting  from  it 
 now  my  focus  is  elsewhere  I  don't  really 
 need  to  train  that  much  or  whatever  I
[62:33] don't  really  care  about  it  anymore  I'm 
 gonna  focus  on  business  my  new  purpose 
 layer  whatever  and  then  eventually  you
[62:38] look  at  yourself  in  the  mirror  and 
 realize  oh  wait  my  physique  doesn't  look 
 anywhere  near  as  good  and  I'm  trying  to
[62:43] focus  on  business  work  but  now  in  my 
 mind  the  new  obsession  the  purpose  layer 
 is  to  build  the  physique  again
[62:49] so  if  you  let  it  slip  the  thing  that 
 you've  just  built  then  the  purpose  layer 
 that  you've  just  completed  if  you
[62:55] actually  let  that  deteriorate  even 
 though  it's  finished  it  will  become  a 
 layer  once  more
[63:00] so  even  though  this  is  common  sense 
 build  the  physique  and  at  least  maintain
[63:06] it  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 does  that  make  sense  it's  common  sense 
 but  it's  like  it's  just  something  that  I
[63:12] think  is  valuable  to  discuss  because 
 I  could  throw  myself  in  fully  right  now 
 into  fighting  and  I'd  be  sick  right  you
[63:18] know  martial  arts  whatever  I  wouldn't 
 even  train  bodybuilding  let's  say  right 
 which  means  that  I've  got  extra  recovery 
 and  it's  better  so  that  this  way  I'm
[63:23] less  stiff  and  everything  but  then  maybe 
 a  month  from  now  maybe  six  months  from 
 now  whilst  I'm  in  the  middle  of  like  my
[63:28] martial  arts  like  uh  purpose  layer 
 there's  going  to  be  a  time  when  I  look 
 at  myself  in  the  mirror  and  see  how  much
[63:33] muscle  mass  I've  lost  and  I  like  as  much 
 as  I  want  to  focus  on  fighting
[63:38] the  the  lack  of  muscle  mass  which  means 
 a  lot  to  me  because  I've  worked  very 
 hard  for  this  it  wasn't  like  a  layer  of 
 my  purpose  to  develop  myself  to  have
[63:44] like  a  physique  that  I'm  proud  of 
 it  will  start  to  weigh  on  my  mind  to  the 
 point  that  now  that  is  the  obsession
[63:49] that  is  the  purpose  that  I  need  to  make 
 progress  on  so  when  you  do  complete  a
[63:54] layer  of  your  purpose  find  what's  called 
 this  is  very  specific  there's  a  term
[64:00] called  the  minimum  effective  volume  Mev 
 in  other  words  the  maintenance  volume
[64:06] for  you  to  like  keep  on  holding  on  to 
 what  you  have  gained  so  can  you  see  now
[64:14] why  I'm  I  see  him  like  I've  kind  of  left 
 YouTube  and  yeah  here  I  am  on  YouTube
[64:21] the  minimum  effective  volume  the 
 maintenance  volume  because  I  grew  this
[64:26] YouTube  channel  when  I  was  a  part  of  my 
 my  purpose  then  the  layer  was  complete 
 now  I  could  throw  myself  one  only  solely
[64:34] into  fighting  and  that's  probably  could 
 be  a  good  idea  but  the  thing  is  there 
 would  be  a  time  six  months  from  now  I'm
[64:39] fully  focused  on  fighting  and  I'm  like 
 oh  man  like  I  kind  of  miss  YouTube  and 
 like  oh  the  channels  went  down  so  much
[64:45] imagine  if  I  didn't  post  at  all  for  six 
 months  right  okay  good  goodbye  guys  I'm 
 done  with  YouTube  I'd  look  at  it  I'd  be
[64:51] proper  sad  and  stuff  and  I'd  probably 
 wanna 
 sauce  it  again  because  the  purpose  is
[64:56] back 
 so  what  I'm  doing  with  my  physique  by 
 training  a  few  times  a  week  is  very
[65:02] similar  to  what  I'm  doing  with  YouTube 
 now  which  is  that  I  built  up  something
[65:07] you  know  I  completed  the  purpose  layer 
 and  now  I'm  just  maintaining  it  with  the
[65:12] smallest  amount  of  time  and  energy 
 investment  needed  whilst  I  still  do  have
[65:17] another  like  layer  of  my  purpose  that 
 I'm  focused  on  that's  why  I'll  upload
[65:22] maybe  a  couple  times  per  month  to  this 
 channel  to  kind  of  maintain  a  good  level
[65:27] so  that  I  don't  get  this  like  feeling  of 
 like  oh  man  I  really  want  to  go  and  do 
 that  thing  again
[65:32] because 
 no  one  wants  to  be  that  60  year  old  guy
[65:38] who  looks  at  you  in  the  gym  or  looks  at 
 you  elsewhere  and  says  like  oh  well  you 
 know  I  used  to  be  fit  and  strong  when  I 
 was  your  age  I  used  to  be  able  to  bench
[65:44] seven  plates  and  squat  seven  thousand 
 pounds  but  I  can't  anymore  because  my 
 knee  hurts
[65:49] and  then  he  just  looks  old  and  saggy  and 
 everything  no  one  wants  to  be  that  guy
[65:54] you  want  to  be  the  guy 
 who's  60  years  old  who  started
[65:59] weightlifting  going  to  the  gym  at  our 
 age  and  he's  still  jacked
[66:04] you  want  to  be  the  guy  who's  maintained 
 a  list  of  accomplishments  like  you  a  guy
[66:09] who's  maintained  facets  of  his  life 
 these  like  skills  through  his  life
[66:14] because  it  seems  silly  right  I  I 
 genuinely  I  ask  myself  and  I  was
[66:19] thinking  okay 
 I  built  this  physique  but  I've  got  a  new 
 purpose  layer  and  I  remember  that  okay 
 I'm  supposed  to  align  100  of  my  life  to
[66:26] this  and  so  if  I  keep  bodybuilding 
 that's  gonna  take  some  away  from  this 
 but  then  I  realized  and  I  was  like  wait
[66:32] I'm  definitely  going  to  regret  it  I'm 
 definitely  going  to  want  to  build  the 
 muscle  back  again  and  then  I  thought
[66:37] about  fighting  let's  say  okay  my  current 
 purpose  layers  on  fighting  martial  arts 
 everything  okay  sweet  I'm  gonna  get 
 really  good  at  fighting  that
[66:43] visualization  I  had  where  I'm  doing  Jiu 
 Jitsu  with  the  guy  and  I  look  really 
 good  that's  going  to  come  alive  within
[66:48] six  months  or  12  months  from  now  it's 
 gonna  be  amazing  right  then  I  thought  to 
 myself  okay  imagine  if  I  throw 
 everything  into  fighting  it's  so  good
[66:54] and  then  I  become  like  a  really  good 
 fighter  then  this  layer  of  my  purpose 
 gets  peeled  what  I  just  never  go  to
[67:00] martial  arts  clubs  again 
 no  it'd  be  an  amazing  thing  to  carry  for
[67:07] the  rest  of  my  life  wouldn't  it  and  now 
 I  want  you  to  start  a  picture  the  man 
 that  you'd  become  20  to  40  years  from
[67:14] now  when  you've  got  this  with  like  10 
 different  things
[67:19] that  for  a  few  years  of  your  life  you 
 really  really  focus  and  obsess  over  your 
 physique  and  then  after  that  you  started
[67:25] to  do  a  maintenance  amount  and  you  still 
 got  a  really  good  amount  of  muscle  mass 
 then  for  a  few  years  you're  totally
[67:30] obsessed  over  fighting  in  martial  arts 
 and  you  got  really  good  you  won  fights 
 and  everything  and  then  after  that  you
[67:35] didn't  train  as  hard  but  you  certainly 
 kept  it  up  with  one  to  two  to  three 
 sessions  per  week  so  that  when  you're  40
[67:41] years  old  and  your  son's  looking  up  at 
 you  he's  looking  up  at  a  man  who's  built 
 like  a  Greek  god  who  can  fight  like  a
[67:48] warrior  like  a  Spartan 
 who's  wealthy  like  a  businessman  like  an
[67:53] entrepreneur 
 who's  cultured  like  a  man  who's  traveled
[67:58] the  world  and  you  have  this  list 
 of  things  that  you  can  look  back  on
[68:03] these  purpose  layers  these  chapters  of 
 your  life 
 and  that's  when  this  accomplishment  is
[68:10] gonna  feel  good 
 so  make  sure  when  you  do  complete  some
[68:15] kind  of  part  of  your  the  layer  of  your 
 purpose 
 you  maintain  it  so  this  is  even  let's
[68:21] say  something  which  I  don't  really  have 
 much  experience  of  anymore  but  let's  say 
 something  you're  in  the  education  system
[68:26] you're  still  in  school  right  and  your 
 current  purpose  layer  is  studying  to  get 
 this  good  grade  so  that  you  can  go  into
[68:31] University  you're  studying  medicine  for 
 example  right  so  you're  studying 
 medicine  then  you're  going  to  get  the
[68:36] the  University  degree  and  then  you  can 
 go  work  after  that  right  well  a  lot  of
[68:41] people  who  aren't  really 
 Superior  Juan  you  know  masculine  they'll
[68:46] study  they'll  get  the  degree  and  then 
 they'll  work 
 and  these  people  never  actually  become
[68:52] that  successful 
 you  want  another  kind  of  person  who 
 becomes  truly  successful  well  he  studies
[68:57] for  the  degree 
 he  gets  the  degree  he  gets  the  job 
 and  he  keeps  studying
[69:03] he  maintains  or  even  grows  his  level  of 
 knowledge  for  the  rest  of  his  life
[69:10] whatever  you're  doing  right  now  to 
 complete  and  peel  back  this  layer  of 
 your  purpose  studying  training  working
[69:17] whatever  once  it  is  completed  and  you 
 have  this  accomplishments  that  you  know
[69:22] that  we've  been  working  hard  for 
 maintain  it  or  even  continue  to  grow  it
[69:27] in  the  most  efficient  effective  way 
 possible  so  a  weird  tip  that  I  can  give
[69:32] you  right  now  which  is  so  specific  is 
 there's  a  book  called
[69:37] the  four  hour  work  week  by  Tim  Ferriss 
 the  four  hour  work  week  by  Tim  Ferriss 
 this  book  explains  how  to  do  things
[69:44] mostly  like  your  own  business  work  very 
 very  time  efficiently  if  you  follow  this
[69:50] book  but  even  for 
 Fitness  even  for  studying  whatever  it  is 
 that  you're  doing  it  will  actually  help
[69:56] you  to  once  you've  peel  back  this  layer 
 to  keep  maintaining  this  thing  in  a  way
[70:02] that  won't  deteriorate  how  much  progress 
 you  make  in  your  new  layer  so  that's
[70:07] something  to  look  into 
 foreign
[70:15] you've  peeled  back  multiple  layers  of 
 your  purpose  at  this  point
[70:20] and  there's  a  phrase  now  again  from  the 
 same  book  I've  learned  everything  about
[70:25] masculinity  from  this  one  book  The  Way 
 of  the  superior  man  by  David  Dieter  if 
 you're  interested  maybe  after  this  video
[70:30] you  can  literally  just  Search  the  book 
 title  on  YouTube  and  then  my  name  next 
 to  it  Hamza  the  way  of  the  superior  man
[70:36] I've  done  like  a  one  hour  guide  on  this 
 book  which  is  like  the  book  is 
 life-changing  right
[70:41] there's  another  phrase  from  this  book 
 which  is  really  relevant  which  is  that
[70:47] be  willing  to  change  everything  in  your 
 life 
 be  willing  to  change  everything  in  your
[70:53] life  for  your  purpose  so  this  is 
 something  I  briefly  mentioned  to  you 
 before  which  is  that  once  we've
[70:58] completed  a  layer  you  know  we'll  spend 
 some  time  in  speculation 
 introspectiveness  whilst  they're  at  a
[71:03] war  then  we'll  discover  the  next  one  as 
 soon  as  you  discover  the  next  part  of 
 your  purpose  the  next  layer  the  vision
[71:10] align  100  of  your  life  to  it  this  means 
 that  you  will  have  to  constantly  as  a
[71:15] Young  Man  uproot  your  life  and  move  to 
 where  it  is  that  you  need  to  go  to  to
[71:21] achieve  this  this  Obsession  this  layer 
 of  your  purpose  to  do  as  much  as  you  can
[71:28] this 
 is  where 
 I'm  uncertain  of  how  things  should  be
[71:36] because 
 conventional  success  advice  you  know  if 
 I  was  going  to  give  you  good
[71:41] self-improvement  advice  what  would  I 
 tell  you  I'll  tell  you  okay  delay 
 gratification
[71:46] always 
 make  decisions  based  on  the  longer  term
[71:52] 10  years  down  the  line  20  years  down  the 
 line  when  you're  going  to  start  a 
 business  think  about  it  for  20  years 
 right
[71:57] but  then  this  is  where  I'm  now  I'm  even 
 uncertain  because  I  want  you  to  just
[72:02] picture  Okay  imagine  the  man  the 
 masculine  man  the  superior  man  the 
 spiritual  man  who  navigates  and
[72:07] penetrates  his  life  in  a  way  that  he's 
 peeling  back  these  layers 
 one  by  one  by  one  by  one
[72:13] should  this  man 
 perceive  that  he's  gonna  be  in  the  same
[72:18] business  for  20  years 
 because  that's  usually  good  advice  right 
 if  you  know  if  we  tell  a  young  man  that
[72:24] okay  get  into  artificial  intelligence 
 and  then  you  kind  of  have  the  perception 
 Yep  this  is  the  thing  I'm  going  to  do 
 for  the  rest  of  my  life  but
[72:30] but  if  you  were  truly  a  purposeful  man 
 who  was  peeling  back  every  layer  of  your
[72:36] purpose 
 would  you 
 would  you  continue  doing  the  same  thing
[72:42] for  20  years  with  you  know  the  major 
 part  of  your  life  or  perhaps  if  this  is 
 the  way  that  we  want  to  live  if  this  is
[72:48] the  kind  of  life  that  we  think  we  should 
 live  not  a  life  of  stability  of 
 long-term  stability  with  the  same  career
[72:54] or  same  business  and  those  things  are 
 extremely  valuable  so  so  valuable  the 
 most  successful  people  the  most  wealthy
[73:00] people  of  the  of  the  planet  have  done 
 the  same  things  for  40  years 
 right
[73:07] but  then  what  is  success  based  on 
 is  the  billionaire  businessman  a
[73:14] successful  man  because  he's  had  a 
 company  that  for  20  years  30  years 
 that's  performed  really  really  well  even
[73:20] though  for  most  of  that  time 
 he's  actually  wanted  to  do  something
[73:25] different  but  he  can't  because  of  the 
 accountability  of  staying  in  the 
 business  and  we  all  look  up  to  this  guy
[73:30] we  all  look  up  to  Bill  Gates  as  you  know 
 the  really  really  successful  Tech  guy 
 who's  become  who's  really  really  wealthy
[73:36] and  everything  right 
 we  look  up  to  the  people  who've  been 
 doing  the  same  thing  for  so  long  that
[73:42] they  become  widely  good  at  that  thing 
 but  what's  happening  inside  of  them
[73:48] are  they  gonna  die  happily  knowing  that 
 that's  the  thing  they  did  for  40  years 
 maybe  maybe
[73:54] men  are  just  so  different  some  men  are 
 supposed  you  know  that  was  his  purpose 
 for  40  years  straight
[74:00] but  chances  are 
 it's  actually  not 
 chances  are  for  for  most  men  out  there
[74:07] we're  supposed  to  do  like  complete  you 
 know  this  layer  of  our  purpose  is 
 supposed  to  last  for  anywhere  from
[74:13] months  to  years  and  once  the  the  purpose 
 layer  has  been  completed  and  peeled  off
[74:19] and  we  start  to  understand  what  the  next 
 layer  is
[74:25] it  should  be  time  to  align  100  of  our 
 life  to  this  next  layer
[74:30] but  then  there's  things  that  stop  us 
 there  could  be  you  know  that  ongoing
[74:36] career  that  you  spend  so  long  on  your 
 life  on  and  this  is  where  I  told  you 
 about  that  like  anti-masculine  male
[74:43] media  propaganda  comes  in  because  think 
 about  it  think  about  this  right  now 
 right  our  perception  of  let's  say  you
[74:50] know  there's  some  career  man  right  some 
 guy  who's  got  a  career  and  it's  a  really 
 really  good  career  like  a  hike  end  up
[74:55] career  he  might  get  the  CEO  role  you 
 know  this  prestigious  role  in  another 
 few  years  he's  been  in  the  same  kind  of
[75:01] company  for  so  long  making  huge  progress 
 huge  status  we're  all  looking  up  to  him 
 as  a  successful  man  right
[75:09] if  he  left  this  career  and  said  to  us  oh
[75:14] well  yeah  I  finished  my  purpose  and  now 
 my  purpose  is  to  go  uh
[75:19] hike  up  every  mountain  of  the  world  and 
 see  the  Great 
 skyline  of  the  world
[75:25] would  look  at  him  like  he  was  absolutely 
 crazy 
 but  why
[75:31] we  look  at  the  guy  who's  done  the  same 
 thing  and  built  up  a  long-term  success
[75:36] in  his  career  or  business  with 
 so  much  inspiration  like  wow  that  is  a
[75:41] successful  guy
[75:47] but  Izzy 
 because  success  based  on  the  metric  of 
 wealth  okay  fine  yes  sweet  he  is  but  the
[75:53] thing  is  you  don't  need  that  much  wealth 
 to  live  a  wealthy  life  honestly  like 
 this  you  know  successful  business  and
[75:59] man  Bill  Gates  they've  got  billions  bro 
 you  only  need  like  two  million  to  live 
 off  like  a  really  good  life  for  the  rest
[76:04] of  your  life  right  let's  say  five 
 million  10  million  right 
 so  how  much
[76:10] are  these  guys  potentially  sacrificing
[76:15] in  terms  of  their  masculine  purpose 
 because  chances  are  if  you've  done  the 
 same  thing  for  a  while  that  that  kind  of
[76:20] man  that  we  look  up  to  the  Jeff  Bezos 
 Bill  Gates 
 their  purpose  will  change  now  the
[76:27] smartest  entrepreneurs  that  we  see  what 
 are  they  doing  Elon  Musk  even  Bill  Gates 
 is  doing  this  they've  got  this  main
[76:34] business  you  know  the  long-term 
 successful  business  right  Microsoft  and 
 Tesla  and  everything  but
[76:40] when  they  get  a  little  bit  bored  from 
 that  main  thing  and  they  have  like  a  new 
 purpose  layer
[76:46] they  pursue  it  as  part  of  the  business 
 Tesla  isn't  just  about  the  cars  anymore
[76:51] it's  like  they're  inventing  a  lot  of 
 stuff  like  rocket  ships  and  everything 
 right  Bill  Gates  as  well  it's  like  it's
[76:56] not  just  about  Microsoft  I'm  pretty  sure 
 Bill  Gates  doesn't  even  work  in 
 Microsoft  anymore  he  moved  on  to  his
[77:01] charity  Foundation  where  he  started  to 
 focus  on  like  the  deaths  caused  by 
 diarrhea  and  unclean  water  because  that
[77:07] would  have  become  his  new  purpose  layer 
 we  don't  think  Bill  Gates  is  crazy  do  we 
 he  built  Microsoft  he's  a  billionaire
[77:13] he's  wildly  successful  he's  like  one  of 
 the  most  impactful  people  of  the  entire
[77:18] planet  you  know  there's  people  who  have 
 like  negative  perceptions  of  it  but  he 
 has  changed  the  world  forever  right
[77:24] there  would  have  been  a  point  in  Bill 
 Gates  life  where  he  was  the  head  of 
 Microsoft  and  it  would  have  seen
[77:30] absolutely  crazy  for  us  common  folk  to 
 to  see  him  say  he's  stepping  down  and
[77:36] employing  a  new  CEO  instead 
 he  built  Microsoft  he  was  the  head  of
[77:41] Microsoft  and  eventually  he  replaced 
 himself  well  maybe  whatever  happened  in 
 the  businesses  you  know  like  there's
[77:46] always  like  these  weird  like  office 
 politics  type  of  stuff  right  but  let's 
 say  if  that's  what  happened  and  there
[77:51] was  a  CEO  who  replaced  him  and  Bill 
 Gates  was  happy  to  step  down  and  to 
 focus  on  something  else  we  would  have
[77:56] thought  that  was  crazy  how  could  you 
 leave  that  much  success  you  built  up  so 
 much  like  you  should  have  just  stayed  in
[78:01] there 
 but  his  purpose  was  complete
[78:07] and  so  maybe  as  a  man  sometimes  we  have 
 to  make  this  sacrifice  to  our  status  to
[78:12] our  image  to  our  wealth 
 to  keep  pursuing
[78:17] these  purpose  layers 
 keep  peeling  them  back
[78:22] and  it  can  seem  so  crazy  from  an  outside 
 perspective  to  think  wait  why  would  you
[78:27] sacrifice  that  thing  that  you  had  going 
 for  you 
 but  that  thing  that  you  had  going  for
[78:32] you  no  longer  does  anything  for  you 
 because  the  new  thing  that  you  need  to
[78:38] make  progress  on  that  you  need  to  align 
 as  much  of  your  life  as  possible 
 it's  different
[78:44] this  is  why  I  think  our  perceptions  of  a 
 successful  male  life
[78:50] perhaps  have  have  been  brainwashed  so 
 that  we  pursue  things  like  long-term
[78:56] stability  which  sounds  awesome 
 but  I'm  not  sure  that  that's  how  a 
 masculine  man  would  live
[79:03] I'm  beginning  to  realize  that  at  least 
 for  me 
 the  way  that  I  may  navigate  the  rest  of
[79:08] my  life  is  in 
 multi-year  compartments  multi-year
[79:15] chapters  where  I'm  currently  in  a 
 chapter  of  my  life  that's  about  being  in
[79:20] different  countries  like  Thailand  and 
 training  martial  arts  and  this  is  what  I 
 I'm  completely  focused  on  and  every
[79:25] decision  I  make  is  based  on  this  and 
 then  when  this  layer  of  purpose  is  open 
 or  completed  or  fulfilled  and  I  start  to
[79:32] discover  the  next  layer  that's  the  next 
 chapter  of  my  life  and  I  focus  entirely 
 on  that  and
[79:37] I  still  go  about  things  in  a  long-term 
 way  you  know  it'd  be  silly  for  me  to 
 like  get  into  martial  arts  in  a
[79:42] short-term  way  of  like  yeah  I  wanna  I 
 wanna  have  a  uh  an  amateur  fight  next 
 week  yeah  uh  Parkinson's  law  you  know
[79:48] like  oh  yeah  like  short-term  stuff  it'd 
 be  silly  to  do  that  you  know  it's  good 
 until  I  still  think  long  term  to  set
[79:53] long-term  goals  and  everything  because 
 you  don't  know  how  long  your  purpose 
 layer  is  going  to  last  for 
 but  it  may  be  valuable  for  us  to  just
[79:59] think  you  know  what 
 trying  to  think  what  I  do  20  years  from
[80:05] now  10  years  from  now  might  not  actually 
 be  that  valuable  because  my  purpose
[80:10] layer  seems  to  change  every  six  to  six 
 months  to  three  years  Max
[80:20] it  seems  crazy  to  what  I'm  kind  of 
 saying  here  which  is  that  we  shouldn't 
 live  the  normal  life  of  stability  of
[80:26] this  long-term  commitment  to  to  people 
 to  maybe  to  family  this  seems  like  I  I
[80:32] don't  even  know  right  but 
 I'm  imagining
[80:37] a  30  year  old  man 
 who  did  everything  he  was  supposed  to  do
[80:42] he  went  through  college  and  everything 
 and  then  he  met  a  nice  girl  then  they 
 got  married  and  they  had  children  and
[80:47] everything  and  I  want  you  to  imagine  if 
 you're  this  guy 
 and  suddenly  it  feels  like
[80:55] your  purpose  layer  has  been  complete 
 and  the  next  thing  you've  got  to  do  is 
 totally  different
[81:03] you  would  be  a  bad  person 
 you've  got  people  who  rely  on  you  you've 
 got  a  family  and  everything  you'd  be
[81:08] about  you'd  be  seen  as  a  bad  person  but 
 I  want  you  to  imagine  if  this  was  you 
 how  you  would  feel  knowing  that  you  had
[81:14] these  commitments  that  you've  got  to 
 hold  to 
 even  though  you  now  know  that  your
[81:19] purpose  layer  is  different  than  you 
 can't  get  away  this  is  your  family 
 you've  got  to  now
[81:27] a  lot  of  men  are  experiencing  that 
 and  the  men  who  do  make  you  know  some
[81:33] kind  of  progress  to  the  new  purpose 
 layer 
 they're  ridiculed
[81:38] they're  shown  as  you  know  on  TV  as  these 
 guys  who  get  motorbikes  and  their  wives 
 nagging  them  and  you  know  he's  having  a
[81:43] midlife  crisis  everyone  oh  Dad  are  you 
 having  a  midlife  crisis  oh  look  dad
[81:48] actually  wants  to  be  masculine  oh  come 
 on  dad
[81:54] by  no  means  as  at  all  am  I  saying 
 abandon  your  children  abandon  your
[81:59] family  but 
 it's  just  this  lifestyle  of  how  purpose
[82:04] works  is  making  me  think  of  wow  like  I 
 thought
[82:09] making  the  commitment  to  a  woman  to 
 marry  to  have  children  I  thought  that 
 was  a  huge  commitment  already  I'm
[82:15] beginning  to  realize  it  is  so  much  more 
 than  I  thought  because  one  extra  thing 
 that  you've  got  to  now  think  about
[82:20] before  you  commit  yourself  to  a  woman 
 before  you  you  have  children  is  to  think
[82:25] okay  what's  gonna  happen  to  these 
 purpose  layers  of  yours  because  if  you 
 just  stop  and  peel  back  one  layer  and
[82:31] then  the  next  one  is  to  go  and  travel 
 the  world  or  something  that  you  can't  do 
 with  children  because  they  need  to  stay 
 in  school  you  will  feel  like  a  shell  of
[82:37] a  man  remember  those  problems  I  talked 
 about 
 where  you  gain  body  fat  it's  you 
 struggle  to  to  build  muscle  your
[82:42] testosterone  goes  down  your  erections 
 get  weaker  is  that  not  the  symptoms  of 
 the  modern  man  who's  stuck  in  a
[82:47] relationship  that  no  longer  kind  of 
 serves  him  but  then  he  has  to  stay  in 
 there  because  it's  evil  if  he  doesn't  I
[82:52] don't  have  all  the  answers 
 but  what  I  do  know 
 is  that  a  man  who  leaves  his  purpose
[82:58] unfulfilled  who  doesn't  make  progress  to 
 it  does  not  feel  good
[83:03] and  so  it's  just  an  extra  like 
 precaution  that  perhaps  we  should  really 
 think  about  before  we  make  a  big
[83:09] commitment  whether  it's  with  family  or 
 it's  with  a  military  career  that  you've 
 got  to  sign  up  for  it's  four  to  eight  to
[83:15] twelve  years  or  or  college  you  know  a 
 four-year  commitment  before  we  sign  up 
 to  these  to  really  ask  ourselves  okay
[83:20] where  is  my  purpose  layer  gonna  go  what 
 if  I  get  a  year  into  this  five  years 
 into  this  and  my  layer  gets  fulfilled
[83:25] but  if  there's  still  time  that  I've  got 
 to  put  into  this  there's  still  people 
 who  rely  on  me
[83:31] it  seems  evil  to  think  these  things 
 but  it's  for  your  own  benefit  and  you
[83:36] don't  really  have  to  tell  anyone  that 
 you're  thinking  wait  what  if  my  purpose 
 layer  gets  complete  with  this  person  you 
 don't  have  to  tell  anyone  but  just  try
[83:42] and  think  to  yourself  okay  what  would 
 happen 
 and  then  now  really  start  to  consider
[83:47] okay  is  this  definitely  the  right  time 
 to  have  children  or  to  marry  this  woman
[83:53] because  a  lot  of  guys  are  getting 
 married  young  which  usually  would  be  a 
 good  thing  but
[83:58] the  same  guys  are  then  getting  divorced 
 a  year  later  or  five  years  later  or 
 something
[84:05] I  can  only  speculate  what  happens  past 
 this  in  terms  of  your  purpose  this  is
[84:10] the  the  kind  of  the  stage  I  am  on  now 
 where  I've  completed  multiple  layers  of 
 my  purpose  and  my  understanding  of
[84:16] purpose  really  seems  to  get  be  getting 
 better  and  better  by  no  means  am  I  some 
 professional  and  I  certainly  have  so
[84:23] much  more  to  learn  and  so  many  more 
 layers  to  peel  back  I  can  only  speculate 
 what  to  do  from  here  which  is  okay  just
[84:29] keep  going  forward  with  the  exact  same 
 pattern  of  aligning  as  much  of  your  life 
 as  possible  to  the  purpose  peel  it  back
[84:35] and  then  again  and  again  and  again  and 
 again 
 it's  left  me  a  little  bit
[84:41] sighted  and  almost  concerned  and  worried 
 for  the  future  because  I'm  so  excited 
 that  I  kind  of  I'm  starting  to  get  like
[84:47] a  Life  Plan  of  like  okay  my  life  will 
 most  likely  be  lived  in  like  chapters  of
[84:52] an  obsession  of  this  one  thing  at  a  time 
 that  I  will  align  everything  else 
 relationships  and  everything  else  into
[84:57] but  then  when  that  part  of  my  life  gets 
 completed  checked  off  peeled  back  and
[85:03] it's  time  for  the  next  layer  of  my 
 purpose  it's 
 I'm  worried  in  the  sense  that  like 
 perhaps
[85:08] I  shouldn't  set  any  long-term  goals  or 
 commitments  because  things  can  change  so
[85:13] much  you  know  people  keep  asking  me  what 
 my  plans  are  for  the  rest  of  the  year 
 people  keep  asking  me  what  my  plans  are 
 for  five  years  ten  years  and  I  had
[85:20] really  good  answers  for  all  this  it 
 seems  really  smart  to  say  yep  my 
 Five-Year  Plan  is  this  and  here's  my 
 business  plan  and  in  my  in  10  years  I'll
[85:26] have  this  I  used  to  be  really  really 
 into  that  stuff  of  like  yeah  really 
 having  a  long-term  plan  now  I  look  at  it
[85:31] and  say  wait 
 but  you  can't 
 because  most  likely  you  are  going  to
[85:36] fulfill  well  if  you  plan  to  you're  going 
 to  fulfill  the  layer  of  your  purpose  and 
 then  everything  should  be  different
[85:41] after  that  now  at  the  same  time  I'm  also 
 realizing  that  you  should  actually  have
[85:46] a  long-term  plan  for  the  current  purpose 
 layer  you're  on  because  you  don't  know 
 how  long  it's  going  to  last  but  you 
 should  be  open  to  when  it  feels  like
[85:52] you've  you've  completed  the  layer  and 
 you  truly  have  completed  the  layer
[85:57] you  should  be  open  to  dropping 
 everything  all  the  plants 
 I  told  you
[86:02] months  ago  that  I  was  going  to  hit  5 
 million  subscribers  at  the  end  of  this 
 year  in  December  2023  I  was  gonna  hit  a
[86:09] I'm  projecting  into  the  future  right 
 every  single  time  that  I  set  a  goal  for 
 the  sub  count  of  YouTube  I  was  right
[86:16] exactly  right  every  single  time  so  I'm 
 sure  that  I  was  going  to  hit  5  million 
 subscribers  I  had  this  long  term  plan
[86:21] and  I  had  to  just  cut  a  shot  there  when 
 I  realized  that  my  purpose  here  was  done 
 that's  the  equivalence  or  an  example  of
[86:29] what  we  may  need  to  do  once  we  realize 
 we're  in  the  middle  of  something  that  we 
 thought  was  going  to  last  a  lot  longer
[86:34] but  we're  actually  just  done  with  it  now 
 in  the  book  The  Way  the  superior  man  he
[86:40] does  mention 
 maybe  you're  bsing  yourself  maybe  you're 
 just  like  being  a  bit  lazy  or  you're
[86:45] just  feeling  a  bit  like 
 week  or  whatever  there's  always  a 
 possibility  that  you  haven't  actually
[86:50] completed  the  layer  of  your  purpose  and 
 you're  just  being  lazy  there's  always  a 
 possibility  and  so  you  should  have  close
[86:55] friends  ask  like  you  know  kind  of 
 critique  you  and  hold  you  accountable 
 you  should  journal  and  ask  yourself  okay
[87:00] am  I  actually  being  lazy  or  have  I 
 genuinely  fulfilled  this  layer  of  my
[87:05] purpose  and  I  did  this  multiple  times 
 and  you  know  I  kept  on  daily  uploads  for 
 the  YouTube  channel  for  over  a  year  so
[87:10] it's  like  I  knew  it  wasn't  about 
 laziness  or  anything  I  was  disciplined 
 enough  to  do  that  it  was  generally  just
[87:15] time  for  me  to  move  on  past  this  this 
 layer  of  my  purpose
[87:20] that  is  all  that  I  have  for  you  today 
 that  is  my  current  understanding  of  how
[87:26] purpose  works  as  a  young  masculine  man 
 and  I  truly  hope  that  this  video  May
[87:31] serve  you  some  kind  of  educational  value 
 that  you  might  even  want  to  save  to  your 
 watch  later  playlist  and  come  back  to  it
[87:38] over  and  over  because  one  thing  I  will 
 tell  you  from  my  own  research  and 
 learning  on  purpose  is  that  there  were
[87:44] so  many  things  that  I  I  learned  and  read 
 that  I  didn't  actually  understand  but  I
[87:49] kind  of  remembered  six  months  later  when 
 it  now  became  relevant  purpose  is  this
[87:54] one  topic  that  I  keep  seeming  to  like 
 keep  coming  back  to  places  that  I've 
 learned  about  it  especially  in  the  book
[87:59] The  Way  of  the  superior  man  and  I  keep 
 just  coming  back  when  I've  learned  or 
 you  know  I've  experienced  something  new
[88:04] with  my  life  and  I  hope  that  this  video 
 could  be  a  source  of  Education  that  you
[88:09] do  this  with  that  you  think  you  know 
 right  now  yeah  this  video  is  kind  of 
 nice  sweet  and  literally  three  months 
 from  now  or  six  months  from  now  or  a
[88:15] year  from  now  you  remember  this  video 
 when  something  in  your  life  actually 
 happened  you're  like  oh  that's  what
[88:20] Hamza  meant  he  said  this  and  then  you 
 come  back  to  this  video  and  you're  like 
 oh  yeah  okay  so  this  other  thing  he  said
[88:25] that's  interesting  because  I've  not 
 experienced  that  just  yet
[88:34] that's  all  I've  got 
 take  care  of  yourself  bro
