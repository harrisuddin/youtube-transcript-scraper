[00:00] if  you  want  to  buy  my  course  on  how  I 
 grew  this  YouTube  following  that's  the 
 top  Link  in  the  description  in  this
[00:06] video  I'm  going  to  teach  you  from  my 
 current  understanding  how  to  love  a 
 woman  and  this  gets  so  much  deeper  than
[00:13] just  getting  into  a  relationship  and 
 saying  I  love  you  to  her  it  gets 
 infinitely  more  deeper  than  the  average
[00:20] relationship  and  if  I  can  tell  you  a 
 story  of  the  last  time  that  I  took 
 psychedelic  mushrooms  I  felt
[00:29] 100  masculine 
 I  achieved  100
[00:35] polarity  at  least  that's  what  I  believe 
 with  my  woman  and  it  was  a  beautiful
[00:40] magical  experience  we  went  up  a  mountain 
 to  a  private  part  of  like  this  place  in
[00:46] Thailand 
 and  there  we  sat  down  we  talked  these 
 like  this  mushroom  like  this  dried  thing
[00:51] which  is  like  a  psychedelic  it's  it's 
 meant  to  enhance  your  consciousness
[00:56] and  after  around  10  15  minutes  it  starts 
 the  hit  and  if  you've  never  experienced 
 this  before  it's  like  the  saturation  of
[01:02] the  world  around  you  like  the  colors 
 start  to  pop  and  it  and  brightness  and
[01:08] feelings  just  went  all  through  me 
 and  I  started  to  feel  anxious
[01:14] I  started  to  feel  a  little  bit  scared  a 
 little  bit  sick  the  plan  was  that  we  you
[01:19] know  we  set  out  this  picnic  on  this 
 mountain  that  you  know  we'd  probably 
 just  stay  there  but  it  just  didn't  feel
[01:24] right  for  some  reason  and  so  I  picked 
 everything  up  and  she's  looking  at  me  a 
 little  bit  weird  Okay  this  was  the  plan 
 to  stay  here  but  I'm  like  no  no  we  need
[01:31] to  go  this  way 
 we  pack  everything 
 and  we  start  to  Walk  and  Walk  and  Walk
[01:39] till  I  remember  to  breathe 
 I  remember  to  consciously  breathe  and  I
[01:45] took  one  big  deep  breath
[01:50] and  I  couldn't  help  but  smile  because  I 
 felt  the  strength  that  I  had
[01:55] imagine  this  my  woman  is  stood  next  to 
 me  and  I  felt  strong  and  this  is  when
[02:00] the  visual  started  hitting  in  and  if 
 you've  ever  taken  psychedelics  you  know 
 what  it's  like  and  if  you've  not  it's
[02:05] like  you  start  to  see  like  visuals  it's 
 almost  like  things  kind  of  have  like  a
[02:10] smoky  glisten  to  them  like  the  thing 
 that  you're  looking  at  almost  looks  like 
 it  melts  into  the  next  thing  it's  a
[02:16] beautiful  experience  and  this  starts  to 
 happen  and  it's  almost  like  I  can  hear 
 like  tribal  music  and  I  feel  strong  I
[02:22] look  to  my  arms  to  my  body  like  I 
 physically  felt  really  strong
[02:28] and  she 
 starts  to  melt
[02:33] and  I  don't  say  that 
 metaphorically 
 this  level  of  strength  that  I  just  felt
[02:40] out  of  nowhere  she  started  to  physically 
 melt  not  in  some  weird  way  but  like  I
[02:46] saw  her  physically  go  like  this  like 
 like  this  closer  and  closer  into  my  arm
[02:53] like  she  looks  so  happy  so  submissive  so 
 feminine  so  beautiful 
 like  this
[03:00] and  what  happened  next  is  one  of  the 
 best  experiences  of  my  entire  life  we're 
 on  the  top  of  this  mountain
[03:05] slowly  just  one  step  at  a  time  going 
 down
[03:10] it  was  like  I  had  perfect  posture  it  was 
 like  I  was  divinely  masculine  like  Shiva
[03:16] like  masculinity  I'm  walking  down  with 
 like  a  straight  back  chest  out  feeling 
 strong  and  she's  like  you  know  clutching
[03:22] onto  my  arm  like  look  literally  looking 
 at  me  like  this  like 
 like  this  obviously  she  took  them  as 
 well  so  you  know  she's  like  probably
[03:27] next  to  me  and  everything  and  it  I'm 
 walking  her  through
[03:32] a  trip  of  our  ancestors 
 and  I'm  looking  at  her  and  saying  like
[03:38] this  like  these  strong  things 
 our  ancestors  used  to  Traverse  these
[03:43] mountains 
 take  your  slippers  off  baby
[03:49] let's  feel  the  floor  between  our  feet 
 and  you  know  I'm  saying  these  things
[03:54] which  obviously  the  impact  of  which  it 
 doesn't  feel  the  same  right  now  but 
 imagine  I'm  just  saying  like  the  like
[04:00] strong  romantic  things  to  her 
 and  I  swear  this  is  the  truth  out  of
[04:05] nowhere  we  look  down  like  in  our  side  of 
 this  mountain  and  there's  a  solid  seven
[04:13] a  nine  quite  big  healthy  looking  stray 
 dogs  and  they  look  kind  of  angry  they
[04:19] look  kind  of  like  hungry  stray  dogs  in 
 Thailand  are  usually  no  problem
[04:24] usually  you  know  worst  case  scenario 
 they've  got  like  maybe  some  some  kind  of 
 disease  but  usually  nothing  but  like
[04:29] sometimes  they  can  be  a  little  bit  like 
 Snappy  like  you  know  sometimes  they  can 
 challenge  you  a  little  bit  and  in  fact
[04:34] one  of  my  friends  just  a  few  days  before 
 this  moment  that  like  literally  had  a 
 scar  on  his  leg  that  he  had  been  bitten
[04:39] by  a  stray  dog  I'm  looking  at  this  group 
 and  she  starts  you  know  we  hear  them 
 barking  down  they're  100  meters  away
[04:45] from  us  like  you  know  with  kind  of  like 
 a  lower  altitude  and  she  starts 
 panicking  there's  a  lot  of  them  there's
[04:50] genuinely  like  I'm  telling  you  the  truth 
 genuinely  there's  like  seven  eight  stray 
 dogs  there
[04:55] inside  of  me  is  a  little  bit  of  a  fear 
 because  I'm  thinking  okay 
 we're  actually  far  away  from  like
[05:00] Civilization  you  know  take  us  five 
 minutes  or  so  to  run  to  the  nearest 
 person  or  something
[05:06] this  actually  could  get  kind  of  nasty 
 and  instantly  the  fear  goes  away  because
[05:11] I  knew  what  I  would  do  if  they  did  come 
 up  to  us 
 and  I  did  say  it  to  her  I  said
[05:17] if 
 the  worst  has  happened  just  stay  still 
 stay  behind  me
[05:23] and  don't  be  scared  of  what  I'm  about  to 
 do 
 because  I  was  expecting  if  these  stray 
 dogs  like  a  pack  of  stray  dogs  run
[05:29] towards  maybe  I'm  over  exaggerating  but 
 if  they  did  I  was  gonna  go  absolutely 
 animalistic  mode  I  was  genuinely
[05:35] thinking  that  I  know  this  is  like  weird 
 to  say  but  I  was  genuinely  imagining 
 okay  if  they  come  towards  me  I'm  gonna
[05:40] go  like  fully  Primal  and  start  like  like 
 you  know  if  I  [ __ ]  making  noises 
 throwing  rocks  at  them  because  I'm  not
[05:45] gonna  risk  them  coming  towards  me  and 
 just  you  know  wanting  to  like  slightly 
 pick  up  my  legs  or  something  just  to  see
[05:50] if  we're  like  weak  or  anything 
 I'm  genuinely  think  okay  I'm  gonna  like
[05:55] bark  like  I've  never  parked  before 
 towards  these  dogs  if  they  do  come
[06:00] towards  me 
 and  she's  feeling  terrified  and  so  we're 
 on  kind  of  alert  for  these  dogs  that  are
[06:06] playing  you  know  it's  playing  or 
 whatever  they're  doing  down  there 
 and  it's  like  you  know  we're  taking  one
[06:12] step  the  next  step  one  step  then  the 
 next  step  going  down  the  mountain  and
[06:17] within  a  few  seconds  she's  pretty  much 
 forgotten  about  them  they've  like  ran 
 off  somewhere  else 
 but  it's  in  my  mind  it  is  in  my  mind
[06:23] okay  this  is  it  potentially  is  a 
 dangerous  genuinely  dangerous 
 environment  it  could  go  wrong  anyone  who
[06:29] kind  of  knows  about  like  stray  dogs  in 
 Thailand  probably  knows  yeah  it  would 
 have  been  fine  anyway  but  it  could 
 potentially  go  wrong  it  added  to  the
[06:35] feeling  of  like  you  know  this  masculine 
 femininity 
 polarity  and  taking  mushrooms  and  nature
[06:41] and  wildness 
 and  we  start  walking  down  and  there's 
 something  that  I  told  my  girl  which  she
[06:48] found  very  interesting  I  told  her  that 
 my  visuals  every  single  time  I've  taken 
 psychedelics  is  always  the  same  it  you
[06:54] know  you  see  sometimes  you  see  like 
 patterns  in  everything  that  you  look  at
[06:59] every  single  thing  that  I  look  at  the 
 pattern  that  I  see  is  always  the  same  it
[07:04] is  always  women  submitting  to  me  it  is 
 always  women  literally  provocatively 
 like  dancing  towards  me  getting  closer
[07:10] and  closer  and  closer  towards  me  they 
 want  me  to  take  them  and  I  said  this  to 
 her  and  like  you  know  this  proper  Shiva
[07:16] like  straight  back  way  and  I  was 
 describing  I've  told  her  this  before  so
[07:21] I  described  it  up  everywhere  I  see  is  a 
 woman  submitting  to  me  and  she  gets  like 
 back  into  that  melty  mood  looking  at  me
[07:27] again  like  in  awe  looking  at  me  I'm 
 telling  her  like  here  amongst  these 
 rocks  that  rock  right  there  that
[07:34] formation  as  a  girl  she's  just  pushing 
 herself  into  me 
 they  want  me  they  want  my  seed  I'm
[07:40] saying  these  things  and  I  I  know  it  can 
 seem  kind  of  uncomfortable  you  know  in 
 like  a  dry  situation  I'm  saying  it  to
[07:45] the  camera  with  my  book  still  but 
 but  just  looking  at  her
[07:51] the  way  that  she's  melting  on  my  arms 
 like 
 she's  looking  at  like  imagine  she's  on
[07:57] my  head  like  my  chest  there  like  she's 
 literally  like  like  the  biggest  smile  on 
 her  face  she  looks  so  happy  so  safe  and
[08:04] every  few  steps  that  we  take  I'm  like 
 saying  something  else  about  our 
 ancestors  about  masculinity  about  our
[08:10] love  together  I'm  looking  at  it  deep 
 into  her  eyes  like  grabbing  her  cheeks 
 like  this  and  not  just  saying  like  oh
[08:17] yeah  I  love  you  I  love  you  baby 
 so  much  deeper  than  that
[08:23] the  kind  of  things  if  I  said  them  now  it 
 wouldn't  even  do  it  justice  but  just  to 
 give  you  an  example  like
[08:29] I  reminded  her  that  the  last  time  I  was 
 here  before  her
[08:34] that  I  had  a  gift  for  her 
 and  I  pulled  out  a  seashell  from  my
[08:39] pocket 
 and  I  looked  into  her  eyes  and  said  the 
 ocean  gave  me  this
[08:46] I  held  my  hand  inside  of  the  ocean  and 
 the  ocean  gifted  me  this  and  now  I  give
[08:51] this  to  you  as  a  token  of  our  love  keep 
 it  safe  forever
[08:57] of  course  it  it  doesn't  sound  as  good 
 maybe  it  sounds  a  little  bit  cringe  you 
 know  right  now  but  imagine
[09:04] for  a  woman  the  man  that  she's  in  love 
 with  is  talking  like  this  and  how  much
[09:10] love  that  she  was  feeling  at  this  moment 
 and  how  like  just  melting  she  was
[09:16] this  was  like  this  is  genuinely  like  a 
 real  experience  that  just  happened  a 
 couple  of  weeks  ago  an  absolutely
[09:21] amazing  connecting  experience 
 but  just  three  years  ago
[09:28] ah 
 3  A.M  4  A.M
[09:33] I  was  on  the  fourth  fap  of  the  day 
 watching  hyper  stimulating  porn  the  kind
[09:39] of  porn  that  isn't  even  like  a  normal 
 video  it's  like  they've  merged  multiple 
 videos  into  one  so  it's  like  like  you
[09:44] know  the  like  hyper  stimulant  there's 
 like  extra  music  and  everything  I'm 
 smoking  weed  at  the  same  time  it's  4am
[09:50] and  I'm  eating  junk  food  I've  just 
 ordered  more  like  cheesecake  and 
 everything  and  I'm  literally  like
[09:55] fapping  multiple  times  in  a  row 
 whilst  at  that  time  my  girlfriend  was
[10:00] sleeping  in  the  Next  Room 
 and  when  she  was  gonna  wake  up  this  is
[10:05] different  girls  you  know  this  what  I'm 
 talking  about  now  happened  four  years 
 ago  when  she  was  gonna  wake  up  the  way
[10:10] that  she'd  look  at  me  with  a  sense  of 
 like  distaste  even  though  we  were  living 
 together  and  we  were  in  love  we  didn't
[10:15] love  each  other  we  could  hated  each 
 other  we  presented  each  other 
 to  the  points  like  you  know  all  this
[10:21] this  tension  between  us  this  lack  of 
 attraction  between  us  me  and  this  girl 
 that  I  was  dating  a  few  years  ago
[10:26] eventually  I  remember  that  you  know  I 
 went  away  I  went  back  to  my  my  family's
[10:31] home  for  a  few  days  and  just  looking  at 
 my  phone 
 neurotically  on  her  Snapchat  and  just
[10:37] seeing  something  very  interesting  one 
 night  one  Saturday  night  I  still 
 remember  this  one  Saturday  night  I  was
[10:42] supposed  to  go  back  there  to  see  her  on 
 Sunday  and  on  Saturday  night  I  noticed 
 that  she  turned  her  Snapchat  location
[10:47] off 
 if  you  didn't  know  that  Snapchat  has 
 this  feature  where  it's  kind  of  a  weird
[10:53] feature  where  you  can  like 
 actively  show  everyone  your  live 
 location  it's  like  a  it's  you  know  the
[11:00] kids  really  like  not  kids  but  you  know 
 some  people  are  kind  of  messed  up in  the 
 head  and  they  think  that's  like 
 something  they  should  turn  on  they
[11:05] should  actively  show  everyone  their 
 exact  location  but  a  lot  of  people  have 
 that  on  and  my  girl  did  at  the  time  like
[11:10] you  know  this  was  four  years  ago  this 
 different  girl  that  we're  talking  about 
 like  my  ex-girlfriend  she  always  had  it
[11:15] on  and  then  I  just  had  this  gut  feeling 
 this  neurotic  overthinking  this 
 anxiousness  that  something  bad  was
[11:20] happening  and  on  this  one  fateful  day  I 
 noticed  that  she  had  it  off  on  like  this 
 night  time  and  imagine  how  that  made  me
[11:25] feel 
 compare  these  two  two  different 
 scenarios  where  four  years  ago  or  three 
 years  ago  I  was  this  anxious  overthinker
[11:31] seeing  these  like  you  know  last  online 
 12  58  P.M
[11:36] a.m  whatever  to  this  experience  that  I 
 just  had  a  few  weeks  ago  and  I'm
[11:41] certainly  no  master  of  masculinity  or  no 
 no  master  of  like  sexual  energy  or
[11:48] anything  but  I  think  I've  made  a  really 
 good  amount  of  progress  and  I  want  to 
 try  and  help  you  make  this  this
[11:53] transformation  way  faster  than  it  took 
 me
[12:00] this  video  is  going  to  be  about  how  to 
 grow  the  love  that  you  have  with  your 
 woman  this  video  is  not  going  to  be
[12:06] about  how  to  attract  a  woman  in  the 
 first  place  I've  made  many  videos  on 
 that  if  right  now  you're  single  and  you
[12:12] don't  have  a  girl  interested  in  you  then 
 there's  so  many  videos  I've  made  on  like 
 you  know  how  to  text  a  girl  how  to 
 attract  how  to  be  the  kind  of  man  that's
[12:18] actually  attractive  to  girls  that  gets 
 like  you  know  more  messages  on  Instagram 
 and  all  the  attraction  phase  things  and
[12:24] so  you  can  skip  this  video  up  until  you 
 actually  have  the  girl  but  what  I  would 
 recommend  is  that  there  is  going  to  be  a
[12:29] point  for  you  that  you're  gonna  have  the 
 girl  eventually  right  there's  if  you 
 stay  on  self-improvement  if  you  keep
[12:34] improving  yourself  there's  got  to  be  a 
 point  when  you  get  the  girl 
 at  that  point  is  actually  when  most  guys
[12:40] fail  most  guys  only  focus  on  the 
 attraction  process  thinking  that  once 
 they  get  into  the  relationship  they'll
[12:45] figure  things  out  but  what  they  don't 
 realize  is  that  getting  into  the 
 relationship  is  actually  the  easier  part
[12:52] being  in  the  relationship  being  in  love 
 is  incredibly  harder  than  just
[12:58] attracting  her  in  the  first  place  and  so 
 this  video  is  either  for  the  guys  who 
 already  have  a  girlfriend  or  a  wife  or
[13:04] if  you  already  preemptively  want  to  like 
 just  kind  of  understand  some  things  from
[13:09] from  something  that  will  happen  to  you 
 just  so  you  have  this  knowledge  in  your 
 mind  which  I  think  would  be  a  pretty
[13:15] smart  way  to  go  about  things 
 let's  talk  about  what  a  feminine  woman
[13:20] is  like  when  she's  in  love  and  I'll  give 
 you  a  caveat  like  a  disclaimer  here 
 everything  that  I  talk  about  on  this
[13:27] video  in  every  video  in  everything  that 
 I  talk  about  I'm  always  talking  from  the 
 perspective  of  a  masculine  man  who  is
[13:33] interested  in  feminine  women  there's  a 
 difference  like  it's  a  lot  of  things  I
[13:38] talk  about  are  going  to  seem  quite  weird 
 to  a  lot  of  people  maybe  to  yourself 
 because  this  is  based  on
[13:44] loving  a  feminine  woman  and  this  such  a 
 big  difference  between  loving  a  feminine
[13:50] woman  and  loving  a  modern  day  masculine 
 independent  woman  if  that's  what  you're 
 interested  in  then  I  I  don't  want  to  be
[13:56] associated  with  that  at  all  it's 
 feminine  women  who  are  beautiful  to  me
[14:01] and  I  am  a  masculine  man  I  am  a  goal 
 striving  ambitious  purposeful  man  and  so 
 if  you  can  relate  to  that  or  if  you  find
[14:07] that  something  that  you  want  to  emulate 
 and  you  want  to  be  more  masculine  you 
 want  to  be  more  of  a  man  you  want  to
[14:12] start  get  becoming  more  disciplined  and 
 everything  then  hopefully  you  can  learn 
 quite  a  lot  from  me
[14:17] feminine  woman  in  love  I  have  my  notes 
 by  the  way  a  feminine  woman  in  love  is 
 highly  sensitive  to  your  love  and  the
[14:26] focus  that  you  have  on  her  she  is 
 incredibly  sensitive  to  the  smallest
[14:31] micro  things  that  happen  to  her  to  you
[14:36] that  you  express  to  her  you  don't  even 
 realize  okay  this  isn't  even  just  if  you 
 say  something  big  like  I  love  you  or  if
[14:42] you  say  something  aggressive  to  her  or 
 anything  like  that  this  is  down  to  the 
 smallest  micro  expression  on  your  face
[14:47] the  smallest  thought  that  you  get  in 
 here  that  are  she's  taking  too  long  to 
 get  ready  she  feels  a  sense  of
[14:53] Abandonment  she  is  highly  sensitive 
 extremely  receptive  to  the  smallest
[14:58] signs  that  you  might  not  even  know  that 
 you're  emitting  yourself  because  her
[15:03] life  depends  on  it  because  for  a 
 feminine  woman  through  Evolution  her 
 life  is  totally  dependent  on  the
[15:09] masculine  man  that's  taking  care  of  her 
 and  so  she  is  incredibly  sensitive  most 
 guys  don't  understand  this  she  is  so
[15:15] much  more  sensitive  to  the  micro  signs 
 that  you're  giving  out  than  you  realize
[15:20] and  this  is  why  her  mood  can  swing  this 
 is  why  sometimes  she  can  feel  kind  of 
 happy  and  then  within  a  few  minutes  just
[15:26] feel  kind  of  like  down  and  depressed  and 
 quite  distant  from  you  and  you're 
 wondering  what  what  happened
[15:31] what  actually  happened  was  that 
 literally  three  micro  muscles  in  your 
 face  moved  in  a  certain  way  that  her
[15:37] Primal  brain  registered  it  as  a  slight 
 level  of  detachment
[15:42] and  again  her  Primal  brain  hurts  like 
 you  know  the  amygdala  the  anxiety  part 
 of  her  brain  flared  up  and  started  to
[15:48] like  change  her  heart  rate  and  cortisol 
 and  and  put  her  into  fight  or  flight 
 instead  of  rest  and  digest  because  that
[15:54] would  usually  symbolize  an  extremely 
 like  dangerous  environment  if  we  were  50
[16:00] 000  years  ago  and  the  human  brain  hasn't 
 actually  evolved  that  much  in  the  last 
 tens  of  thousands  of  years  and  so  she  is
[16:06] still  the  same 
 when  she's  in  love  a  feminine  woman  is
[16:11] in  Love  She  is  totally  reliant  on  you 
 but
[16:16] she  could  be  independent  if  she  needs  to 
 if  she  senses  weakness  in  you  and  this
[16:22] is  maybe  something  that  you've 
 experienced  before 
 she's  usually  really  really  into  who
[16:27] she's  usually  looking  for  you  for  your 
 guidance  but  you've  seen  times  when  she 
 seems  to  make  her  own  decisions  and
[16:32] she's  way  more  independent  and  usually 
 those  are  around  the  times  that  you've 
 been  maybe  a  little  bit  lazier
[16:38] she  picks  up  on  it  now  again  50  000 
 years  ago  she  wouldn't  have  had  the 
 luxury  of  being  independent  she  would
[16:44] have  needed  you  to  like  be  that  guy  in 
 the  modern  day  we've  safeguarded  a  lot
[16:49] of  things  and  so  what  this  means  is  that 
 it's  a  lot  harder  to  be  a  masculine  man 
 dating  a  feminine  woman  because  she  has
[16:54] like  a  safety  level  that  she  could  be  at 
 if  you  guys  did  split  up  if  she  did
[17:00] think  that  you  were  just  getting  weaker 
 and  weaker  and  weaker  the  safety  level 
 that  the  government  gives  her  that  she's
[17:05] got  with  her  family  and  that  you  know 
 she  she's  got  a  safe  place  to  live  and  a 
 way  to  get  food  and  everything  and
[17:10] shelter  well  then  she  can  go  to  that 
 level  once  she  feels  like  your  weakness 
 is  too  unbearable
[17:16] this  is  what  happens  to  a  lot  of  guys 
 who  eventually  find  themselves  just 
 watching  porn  and  playing  video  games 
 and  taking  drugs  when  they're  in  a
[17:22] relationship  she  sees  this  and  she  can't 
 help  but  just  think 
 actually
[17:28] I don't  even  need  him 
 her  happiness  anxiety  and  stress  are
[17:36] very  much  so  correlated  with  yours  now 
 what  this  means  is  that  for  this 
 feminine  woman  who's  in  love  with  you
[17:42] pretty  much  all  of  her  emotions  are 
 based  on  what's  happening  with  you  if
[17:47] things  are  good  if  you're  especially  if 
 you're  happy  she's  happy  my  girl  makes 
 this  joke  all  the  time  when  I  you  know
[17:53] it's  time  to  order  food  or  to  eat  I'll 
 sometimes  kind  of  say  to  myself  am  I 
 hungry  are  you  hungry  and  she'll  say  in
[17:59] like  with  like  a  laugh  like  if  you're 
 hungry  I'm  hungry 
 and  she's  I  know  this  can  seem  weird  to
[18:05] other  people  but  she's  genuinely  not 
 joking  if  I  suddenly  say  I'm  hungry  she 
 would  be  hungry  if  I'm  like  oh  I'm  so
[18:11] tired  she'd  be  like  yeah  I'm  tired  too 
 let's  just  lie  down  if  I'm  like  oh  yeah 
 you  know  I  can't  wait  to  move  my  body  I
[18:16] can't  wait  to  exercise  she's  like  yeah 
 me  too  me  too 
 this  isn't  fakeness  by  the  way  a  lot  of
[18:22] people  will  look  down  to  this  and  say 
 like  oh  no  this  is  a  bad  thing  this  is 
 cringe  but  I  don't  you  know  I  want  a
[18:27] girl  who's  her  own  person  but  this  is 
 her  being  her  own  person  because  a
[18:32] feminine  woman  who's  in  love  is  100 
 devoted  to  you  so  much  that  her  emotions
[18:37] and  feelings  are  dictated  or  at  least 
 heavily  correlated  by  how  you  feel  and
[18:43] so  if  you  feel  happy  she  will  feel  happy 
 if  you  feel  certain  she  will  largely
[18:48] feel  certain  to 
 if  you  feel  lazy  then  so  will  she  if  you
[18:54] feel  stressed  then  so  will  she  if  you 
 feel  nervous  anxious  anything 
 so  will  she  because  again
[19:01] remember  those  black  Primal  caveman 
 micro  Expressions  when  you  show  the 
 smallest  level  of  stress  of  anxiety  you
[19:08] know  somehow  it'll  come  across  your  face 
 right 
 she  will  see  that  and  pick  up  on  it
[19:13] if  he's  anxious  anxious  anxious 
 then  I  probably  should  be  too  right
[19:20] I  think  I  said  this  to  my  girl  once  like 
 she  said  oh  yeah  you're  not  scared  of 
 anything  and  you  know  I  was  laughing
[19:25] around  and  I  said  we're  like  if  you  see 
 me  scared  you  should  be  very  scared
[19:31] does  that  make  sense  like  if  something 
 scares  me  as  the  guy  and  she's  saying
[19:36] like  oh  yeah  I've  never  even  seen  you 
 scared  before  I've  never  seen  you 
 anxious  before 
 if  you  see  me  scared  then  that  means
[19:42] okay  shit's  actually  about  to  go  down
[19:48] and  when  she  is  totally  in  love  with  you 
 she  is  perfectly  polarized
[19:54] always  consensing  to  your  love  and  to 
 your  physical  acts  of  Love  to  You
[20:01] caressing  her  undressing  her  and  even 
 going  further  she's  pretty  much  she  is 
 always  consenting  to  you  guys  have
[20:08] experienced  this  before  maybe  you  have 
 you  can  have  a  woman  who's  totally  in 
 love  with  you  and  it  feels  like  you  can
[20:14] have  sex  with  a  100  of  the  time 
 and  unfortunately  a  lot  of  guys  have
[20:19] experienced  that  with  a  woman  and  then 
 seen  it  change  where  suddenly  she's  too
[20:25] tired  to  have  sex  with  them  now 
 suddenly  she's  too  busy  to  meet  them  on
[20:30] the  day  or  the  dates  that  they  usually 
 do 
 when  she's  in  love  with  you  totally  in
[20:36] love  with  you 
 she's  always  consenting  to  you
[20:42] and  finally  when  she  is  totally  in  love 
 with  you  she's  always  submissive  and 
 following  your  direction  now  those  are
[20:47] kind  of  Common  Sense  things  but  you  know 
 just  something  that  a  lot  of  people 
 don't  know  about  a  feminine  woman  there
[20:53] may  be  some  people  watching  this 
 thinking  no  no no  women  aren't  like  that 
 I  don't  know  like  or  maybe  there's  a 
 woman  watching  the  cylinder  I'm  in  love
[20:58] but  I'm  not  like  that  we're  talking 
 about  feminine  women  women  who  are 
 filled  with  femininity  they  are  very
[21:03] quite  rare  these  days  and  if  you  are 
 wondering  very  quickly  I  said  I'm  not 
 going  to  teach  you  the  attraction  stage
[21:08] things  in  this  video  but  the  way  to  find 
 those  feminine  women  is  to  be  that
[21:13] masculine  man  yourself  and  the  way  to  be 
 the  masculine  man  yourself  very 
 interestingly  is  for  you  to  abandon  your
[21:20] feminine  side  people  these  days  try  to 
 trick  young  men  to  tell  them  to  embrace 
 their  feminine  side  to  be  weak  to  cry  to
[21:25] show  their  emotions  to  show 
 vulnerability  all  of  that  is  very 
 manipulative  and  it's  like  a  trap  as  a
[21:31] Young  Man  one  of  the  best  things  you  can 
 do  is  to  destroy  the  feminine  side 
 inside  of  you  to  still  have  you  know 
 some  relics  of  it  to  still  have  the
[21:37] ability  to  enjoy  yourself  and  laugh  and 
 dance  and  stuff  okay  nice  but  to  not  be
[21:42] have  the  counter-intuitive  side  to  not 
 be  their  emotional  focused  on  play
[21:48] instead  of  work  to  be  to  be  ambitious  to 
 be  masculine  and  disciplined  when  you
[21:53] change  your  personality  like  this  you'll 
 find  that  you'll  automatically  start  to 
 attract  women  who've  got  a  feminine
[21:58] personality  who've  got  feminine  energy 
 because  you  know  the  two  just  attract 
 like  opposite  sides  of  a  magnet  that's
[22:04] how  you  attract  a  feminine  woman  they 
 are  somewhat  rare  these  days  in  the  west 
 once  you  leave  the  West  if  you  are
[22:10] interested  again  if  you're  young  and  you 
 haven't  really  seen  this  before  if  you 
 get  out  of  the  US  and  the  UK  and  some  of
[22:16] those  like  basic  countries  and  you  go 
 out  to  places  like  Thailand  or  maybe  to
[22:22] um  to  be  fair  Thailand's  one  of  the  most 
 places  that  I've  traveled  then  I've  been 
 to  some  parts  of  um  like  Pakistan  and
[22:28] everything  once  you  go  outside  more  of 
 these  like 
 somewhat  traditional  places  somewhat
[22:33] like  like 
 wild  places 
 you'll  see  that  the  women  here  are
[22:38] feminine  and  you  automatically  start  to 
 attract  them  when  you  have  this
[22:43] masculine  directional  energy  now 
 how  is  a  woman  like  when  she  doesn't
[22:49] feel  loved  what  is  a  feminine  woman  like 
 when  she  doesn't  feel  loved  and  this  is
[22:55] I  don't  know  if  I  should  say  this  but 
 this  is  kind  of  close  to  my  my  heart 
 because  as  I  was  writing  this  down  I  was
[23:01] journaling  all  of  this  to  try  and 
 present  this  to  you  in  a  video 
 I  couldn't  help  but  just  constantly
[23:06] visualize  my  my  mother  in  this 
 to  just  see  her  alone  in  the  kitchen
[23:12] with  like  this  this  neurotic  and  anxious 
 body  language  trying  to  kind  of  like
[23:18] overhear  what  my  dad's  saying  on  the 
 phone  in  the  other  room  and  you  know 
 just  kind  of  overthinking  closed  body
[23:23] language  like  this  a  feminine  woman  who 
 doesn't  feel  loved  if  there's  one  word
[23:28] that  I  would  use  to  describe  her  it 
 would  be  barren
[23:33] Baron 
 like  an  like  an  empty  Wasteland  like 
 what  do  you  visualize  when  you  when  you
[23:38] hear  the  word  Baron  what  and  imagine 
 that  inside  of  a  woman  I  see  it  as  like
[23:43] a  dead  Forest  inside  of  her  stomach 
 a  gray  heart
[23:50] a  feminine  woman  who  doesn't  feel  loved 
 by  the  man  that  she  is  in  love  with 
 she's  Barren  she's  neurotically
[23:57] overthinking  she  feels  unsafe  and 
 anxious 
 she  feels  ugly
[24:04] and  these  thoughts 
 you  know  we  know  the  power  of  thinking 
 don't  we  these  thoughts  manifest  into
[24:09] reality  when  she  feels  neglected 
 neglected  and  Abandoned  and  ugly  and  you
[24:16] know  she's  having  these  thoughts 
 emotions  and  thoughts 
 they  start  to  manifest  into  reality
[24:22] suddenly  she's  pinching  her  spots  a 
 little  bit  harder
[24:27] she's  constantly  looking  in  the  mirror 
 looking  for  Flaws  and  of  course  finding 
 some  because  everyone's  got  some
[24:34] and  then  she  starts  to  focus  on  them 
 every  single  time  she  steps  in  front  of 
 the  mirror  she  sees  the  same  five  flaws
[24:40] that  she  always  focuses  on  and  they  seem 
 to  get  worse  and  worse  and  worse  because 
 she's  paying  them  more  attention  you 
 know  that  Dynamic  of  like  if  you  think
[24:46] of  the  the  yellow  car  if  you  think  of 
 the  car  make  like  the  Mercedes  or 
 whatever  or  the  motorbike  and  then  you
[24:52] constantly  start  seeing  it  more  the  more 
 you  think  about  it  well  it's  the  same 
 with  her  insecurities
[24:57] usually  a  loving  man  would  just  like  rip 
 away  those  insecurities  and  fill  her  up
[25:02] with  love 
 but  when  she  doesn't  have  that  she 
 doesn't  feel  love  she  starts  to  question 
 why  and  and  oftentimes  women  will  start
[25:09] to  you  know  pinpoint  on  on  their 
 physical  attractiveness  their  physical 
 Beauty
[25:15] her  personality 
 it's  very  interesting  a  feminine  woman
[25:20] who  doesn't  feel  love  her  personality 
 turns  quite  rude  and  disrespecting  you
[25:26] thought  maybe  it'd  be  quite  like  you 
 know  silence  you  know  the  physical 
 manifestation  of  of  you  know  like  closed
[25:33] off  and  feeling  baroness  the  opposite 
 that  it's  the  violent  hostility  it's  a
[25:38] rude  disrespectful  it's  challenging  it's 
 testing 
 the  reason  why  she's  like  this  her
[25:43] personality  is  quite  hostile  to  the  man 
 that  she's  in  love  with  is  because  she's 
 testing  him  to  try  and  see  if  he'll
[25:49] still  love  her  often  times  when  a  woman 
 who  doesn't  feel  loved  acts  in  this  like
[25:54] disrespectful  way  she's  doing  it  because 
 this  in  response  to  this  her  man  will
[25:59] now  show  her  attention 
 sometimes  for  a  lot  of  women  this  is  the 
 only  time
[26:05] they're  men  that  they're  in  love  with 
 will  show  them  attention 
 when  she's  being  disrespectful  when
[26:11] she's  testing  him  when  she's  being  rude 
 that's  when  the  guy  will  blow  up  and  you 
 know  argue  with  her  and  swear  at  her  and
[26:17] as  much  as  she  hates  the  abuse  like 
 at  least  he's  focusing  on  me  at  least
[26:22] he's  like  giving  me  eye  contact
[26:29] there's  the  book  that  I  really  like  that 
 I  mentioned  a  lot  the  way  of  the 
 superior  man
[26:34] it's  written  by  an  author  called  David 
 Dieter  and  in  this  book  there's  a  bit 
 where  he  talks  about  a  feminine  woman
[26:41] who  doesn't  feel  loved  and  there's 
 something  he  wrote  which  is  very 
 interesting  that  when  she  doesn't  feel
[26:46] feel  filled  up  with  love  she  fills 
 herself  up  with  things  like  chocolate
[26:54] drugs  gossip  TV  casual  sex  from  men  that
[26:59] she's  not  in  love  with  tattoos  all  of 
 these  like  short-term  distractions  out
[27:04] think  about  the  things  I've  just  said  to 
 you  chocolate  and  we  can  say  you're  not 
 junk  food  in  general  drugs  gossip  TV
[27:09] Netflix  video  games  uh  YouTube  porn 
 casual  sex  tattoos  essentially
[27:15] degeneracy  a  woman  who  doesn't  feel 
 loved  will  do  this  now  I  want  you  to 
 imagine  right  now
[27:21] a  teenage  girl  aged  16. 
 you  know  from  your  hometown  or  from  your
[27:27] country  right  so  for  me  it's  like 
 Britain  right  I  imagine  a  16  year  old 
 British  girl
[27:32] who  doesn't  feel  loved  by  her  father  who 
 feels  ignored  by  the  guy  that  she's  got
[27:37] a  crush  on  how  is  she  gonna  behave 
 who  doesn't  feel  love  right  because  if
[27:42] you  know  she's  got  Father's  Love  if 
 she's  got  her  father's  love  if  she's  got 
 maybe  a  crush  that's  actually  receptive 
 then  she's  going  to  be  healthy  and  stuff
[27:47] but  when  a  girl  doesn't  have  a  Father's 
 Love  when  she's  young  and  then 
 eventually  the  romantic  love
[27:53] what  happens  to  those  girls  were  like  16 
 years  old  who  don't  have  daddy's  love
[27:59] exactly  this  early  age  they're  taking 
 drugs  early  age  they're  going  out 
 drinking  and  going  to  parties  with
[28:05] boyfriends  that  they  don't  even  care 
 about  and  they're  cheating  on  those 
 boyfriends  and  you  know  this  this  toxic 
 and  horrible  degenerate  environment
[28:11] where  she's  degrading  herself  even 
 though  other  women  are  telling  her  that
[28:16] feminism  is  empowering 
 oh  she's  destroying  herself  she's 
 filling  herself  up  with  a  substitute  for
[28:23] real  love  and  it  never  works  the  issue 
 with  these  substitutes  is  that  they're
[28:28] all  instant  gratification  they're  all 
 destruction  they're  all  like  bad 
 dopamines  bad  habits  and  so  whilst  they
[28:33] do  give  you  like  a  feel  or  they  give 
 women  a  feeling  of  of  being  filled  up  in 
 some  sense
[28:39] there's  always  negative  consequences  the 
 woman  who  fills  herself  up  with  junk 
 food  and  chocolate  tomorrow  steps  on  the
[28:44] scale  and  then  gets  depressed  at  the 
 two  kilogram  weight  gain  that  she's  had
[28:49] consistently  every  week  or  so  the  woman 
 who  then  does  this  with  casual  sex  like
[28:54] you  know  the  guy  that  she  really  wants 
 isn't  really  replying  or  being 
 interested  in  her  maybe  that's  her 
 father  maybe  that's  um you  know  the
[29:00] crush  that  she's  got  the  man  that  she's 
 in  love  with  well  then  she  does  it  with 
 casual  sex  and  she  gets  filled  up
[29:05] by  some  random  guy  and  then  think  about 
 the  consequences  of  that
[29:10] the  consequences  of  a  woman  a  feminine 
 woman  who  doesn't  feel  loved  is 
 absolutely
[29:18] life-changing  and  the  reason  why  this  is 
 a  very  controversial  issue  and  this  is
[29:23] something  that  a  lot  of  people  feel  too 
 uncomfortable  to  talk  about  the  reason 
 why  is  because  a  woman  who  does  these
[29:28] things 
 is  damaged  permanently  a  woman  who 
 doesn't  feel  her  father's  love  when
[29:34] she's  growing  up  it  gets  damaged 
 permanently  when  a  woman  tries  to  fill
[29:39] herself  up  from  like  these  habits 
 especially  the  sex  related  ones  you  know 
 from  casual  sex  she  she  could  go  through
[29:45] a  period  of  transformation  for  10  years 
 she's  going  to  be  damaged  permanently 
 because  of  these  experiences  and
[29:52] I'd  have  to  go  into  too  much  detail  with 
 this  and  it'll  be  too  like  vulgar  and 
 everything 
 but  it's  such  a  sad  sad
[29:59] reality  for  so  many  women  especially 
 what  seems  to  be  in  the  west  where 
 fathers  are  being  taken  out  of  the  home
[30:04] fathers  are  being  demonized  you  know  the 
 father  is  like  this  disrespectful
[30:09] disrespected 
 figure  these  days  you  know  the  father  in 
 every  TV  show  is  a  bumbling  idiot  these
[30:14] days  isn't  it  every  TV  show  you  can 
 think  of  it's  like  the  father  is  like 
 the  idiot  the  mother  is  the  super  mom
[30:19] who  who  looks  after  the  kids  and  also 
 looks  after  the  husband  because  the 
 husband  doesn't  know  anything
[30:24] the  father's  useless  in  the  modern  day 
 in  the  west  of  course  not  all  countries
[30:29] are  like  this 
 that  was  a  side  tangent  but  pretty  much
[30:36] when  she  doesn't  feel  loved  it's 
 horrible  for  her  and  also  for  your 
 relationship  or  because  imagine  think
[30:42] about  these  things  that  she  could  be 
 doing  when  you  don't  make  her  feel  loved 
 of  course  this  is  a  very  extreme  example
[30:47] when  she  really  feels  neglected 
 this  is  what  she's  kind  of  pushed 
 towards  and  this  is  why  the  extreme
[30:53] example  like  you  don't  want  your  woman 
 to  feel  like  she's  unloved  by  you 
 because  this  is  where  it  leads  to  it
[30:59] leads  to  her  hurting  herself  it  leads  to 
 her  filling  herself  up  with  things  that 
 will  damage  her  and  and  your
[31:05] relationship  together  you  want  her  to 
 feel  loved  and  so  how  do  we  do  that  well 
 there  is  a  challenge  to  this
[31:12] the  challenge  that  we've  as  young  men 
 have  never  really  been  taught  about  in 
 terms  of  relationships  you  know  we've
[31:17] always  you  know  you  hear  some  wisdom 
 maybe  from  some  male  family  members  or 
 from  like  men  online  and  you  hear  about
[31:23] how  to  attract  girls  okay  you  know  just 
 take  her  on  a  date  what's  a  dress  like
[31:28] what  to  do  how  to  talk  those  things  are 
 really  nice  but  no  one  really  I  have 
 ever  seen  online  really  explains  the
[31:34] challenge  in  loving  a  woman  and  the 
 challenge  is  that  it  goes  way  further 
 than  the  automatic  mundane  I  love  yous
[31:41] of  the  day  once  you  fall  in  love  with  a 
 woman  guys  think  that  that's  all  there 
 is  yep  okay  accomplishment  no  no no  this
[31:47] is  the  start  the  mundane  automatic  I 
 love  yous  that  we  throw  out  there  do
[31:52] nothing 
 the  challenge  with  loving  a  woman  is 
 that  she  needs  every  micro  interaction
[32:01] of  yours  to  be  filled  with  love  I  will 
 say  this  again  she  needs  every  micro
[32:06] interaction  of  yours  to  be  filled  with 
 love 
 every  micro  interaction  notice  that  I
[32:12] didn't  say  every  minute  every  hour  every 
 day  a  lot  of  guys  think  this  right  a  lot 
 of  guys  think  that  they  get  into  the
[32:18] relationship  and  it's  yeah  okay  sweet 
 we're  in  love  and  then  they  forget 
 everything  else  no  no  then  there's  more
[32:23] clued  up  guys  there's  more  aware  guys 
 who  say  no  no  you've  got  to  make  your 
 woman  feel  loved  every  day
[32:28] okay  that's  that's  okay 
 but  it's  not  good  enough
[32:35] if  you  want  to  make  your  woman  feel 
 loved  every  day 
 you'll  be  slightly  better  than  the
[32:40] average  guy 
 because  a  day  is  huge
[32:46] you  need  to  make  her  feel  loved  in  this 
 exact  micro  second
[32:53] this  is  where  the  challenge  comes  in 
 because  sometimes  it  feels  impossible  to
[32:58] that  to  do  that  sometimes  she's  next  to 
 you  whilst  you're  on  Google  Maps  looking 
 for  like  the  restaurant  that  you  guys
[33:03] are  trying  to  go  to  was  it  a  left  from 
 here  or  was  it  forward 
 every  interact  every  micro  second  you
[33:11] know  two  if  if  we  were  trying  to  get  to 
 the  ultimate  performance  if  we  were 
 trying  to  get  to  your  best  performance 
 with  her  every  microsecond  would  be
[33:17] filled  with  love 
 everyone  not  just  the  dates  a  lot  of 
 guys  think  okay  you  know  you're  in  the
[33:23] middle  of  a  relationship  don't  stop 
 dating  keep  going  on  dates  that  sounds 
 awesome  but  it's  not  good  enough  you
[33:28] can't  just  go  on  a  date  with  her  and 
 think  yep  okay  job  done  no  no  you  go  on 
 the  date  you  sit  down  with  love  looking
[33:35] into  her  eyes 
 and  then  you  bring  like  you  literally 
 grab  her  chair  and  pull  it  closer  to  you
[33:40] with  love  looking  into  her  eyes  every 
 micro  moment  even  when  you're  looking
[33:45] through  the  memory  you  put  your  hand  on 
 her  leg  or  on  her  back 
 every  micro  moment  like  it  needs  to  be
[33:52] as  short  term  as  you  can  possibly  get  it 
 and  even  dinner  for  the  male  brain  bro
[33:57] even  then  it's  like  it's  still  like  too 
 big  for  us  she  needs  to  feel  it  the 
 specific  term  right  now  for  a  woman
[34:05] those  are  the  two  most  important  words 
 that  could  ever  exist  right  now
[34:10] when  she  says  I  love  you  she  means  I 
 love  you  right  now  when  she  says  I'm 
 happy  she  means  I  love  I'm  happy  right
[34:17] now 
 you  need  to  make  her  feel  loved  happy 
 secure  safe  excited  right  now  and  this
[34:25] right  now 
 has  already  passed  I  said  that  I  said 
 right  now  like  a  second  ago  it's  already
[34:31] passed  now  are  you  making  her  feel  loved 
 right  now  okay  maybe  you  are 
 but  then  you  check  your  phone  and  you've
[34:37] oh  there's  that  message  you've  got  to 
 reply  to  and  oh  okay  oh  the  menu  yes 
 okay  yes  what  are  we  gonna  eat  here
[34:43] how  about  right  now  oh  just  one  second 
 you  know  just  quickly  quickly  gotta  look 
 through  the  menu  just  one  second  just
[34:48] want  to  look  through  the  bed  oh  Carnival
[34:53] it  needs  to  be  this  is  what's  so 
 difficult  about  truly  making  her  feel
[34:58] loved  it  needs  to  be  right  now  in  this 
 small  micro  moments
[35:04] now  I  want  you  to  think  right  now 
 imagine  you  gave  her  your  full  attention
[35:10] imagine  you  made  it  your  full  Focus  just 
 like  you  do  with  your  work  just  like  you
[35:15] do  with  your  workouts  and  everything  you 
 know  you've  got  that  ability  right  you 
 know  that  you've  got  that  drive  to  check
[35:20] off  the  boxes  for  your  task  Place 
 imagine  if  you  put  that  much  intention 
 into  making  her  feel  loved  right  now  for
[35:27] the  duration  of  your  dates  together 
 you  could  do  that  right  awesome
[35:32] but  then  imagine 
 after  the  date  imagine  the  next  day  and
[35:37] the  next  day  and  the  next  day  and  the 
 next  day  imagine  you  live  together 
 imagine  you're  on  a  holiday  together 
 there's  going  to  be  moments  when  you
[35:42] slip  up 
 and  it's  so  easy  right  now  there's  a  lot 
 of  guys  watching  this  it's  so  easy  right
[35:47] now  to  try  and  blame  her  or  to  say  no  no 
 this  is  too  much  this  is  oh  this  is  too 
 much  expectations  I'd  rather  just  you
[35:52] know  just  watch  porn  anyway  like  oh  no  I 
 don't  date  women  who  who  are  this  needy
[35:58] anyway  I  I  prefer  more  independent 
 masculine  women
[36:04] as  soon  as  we  say  like  that  all  the  guys 
 take  a  step  back  like  no  no  I  don't  like 
 muscular  women  I  just  like  women  who  who
[36:09] aren't  as  feminine 
 if  you  are  attracted  to  feminine  women
[36:14] submissive  women  and  you  want  to  be  a 
 masculine  man  this  is  what  this  is  the 
 reality  of  it  and  we  can  look  at  this
[36:20] really  negatively  can't  we  oh  it's  so 
 mentally  demanding  let  me  just  look
[36:25] through  the  menu  [ __ ]  we  can  look 
 through  it  we  can  look  at  it  like  really 
 negatively
[36:30] but  this  may  be  the  greatest  gift  that 
 she  can  give  us  her  constant  need  for
[36:35] love  right  now 
 because  this  means  that  we  have  this 
 constant  meditation  reminder  next  to  us
[36:43] we  have  this  real  person 
 who  is  our  reminder  to  be  here  in  this
[36:50] moment  and  that  is  so  valuable 
 another  part  of  the  challenge  that  comes
[36:56] with  loving  a  feminine  woman  is  that  you 
 need  to  balance  this  you  know  her  her 
 need  for  love  with  your  need  for
[37:04] progress  on  your  purpose  and  your 
 mission  so  as  a  masculine  man  the  most
[37:09] important  things  for  you  will  be  like 
 the  major  goals  that  you  have  the  major
[37:15] thing  in  your  life  the  drive  that  you 
 have  whether  it's  you  know  to  get  the 
 degree  or  to  get  the  job  or  to  level  up
[37:20] your  business  or  to  get  success  in  this 
 area  or  to  go  to  the  gym  and  build  the 
 physique  that  you're  proud  of  whatever
[37:25] it  is  that  is  like  the  number  one 
 priority  in  your  life  that  these  big 
 goals  and  a  woman  comes  second  or  maybe
[37:31] third  fourth  like  the  woman  actually  is 
 down  here  on  the  list  for  you  know 
 you're  truly  masculine  when  the  number
[37:36] one  most  important  thing  for  you  is  like 
 your  goals  your  mission  your  purpose 
 how  do  we  balance  her  need  for  love  and
[37:44] what  we've  got  to  give  her  with  our  need 
 for  purpose  this  is  when  it  gets  tricky 
 because  she  needs  this  reassurance  all
[37:50] the  time  and  sometimes  sometimes  you  do 
 need  to  look  through  your  phone 
 sometimes  you  do  need  to  look  at  the
[37:55] menu  to  make  sure  you're  ordering 
 something  that's  healthy  for  both  of  you 
 and  so  this  is  where  it  gets  tricky  and
[38:01] I  don't  have  like  the  perfect  answer 
 here  I'm  just  kind  of  bringing  awareness 
 for  you  that  this  is  the  challenge  that
[38:06] we  need  to  navigate  and  we  need  to  learn 
 about 
 I'm  not  perfect  at  this  at  all  or  bro
[38:11] I'm  barely  even  good  at  this  honestly  I 
 find  it  incredibly  that  once  you  really 
 open  up  your  mind  I'm  not  sure  if  it's
[38:16] clicked  for  you  yet  but  if  you  really 
 open  up  your  mind  to  this  challenge  of 
 thinking  okay  she  needs  to  feel  loved
[38:22] right  now  like  constantly  and  this  isn't 
 because  she's  got  you  know  some  guys 
 might  tell  well  yeah  but  this  is  because
[38:27] you  know  she's  she's  like  too  anxious  or 
 something  right  I  want  like  a  girl  who 
 does  who  is  an  anxious  but  this  is  just
[38:32] how  feminine  women  are  this  is  just 
 through  Evolution  what  a  woman  is 
 supposed  to  be  because  she's  supposed  to
[38:38] feel 
 like  she  needs  reassurance  constantly 
 because  her  brain  is  the  same  she  has
[38:44] the  same  brain  like  you  maybe  there's 
 someone  who  can  correct  me  on  this  in 
 the  comments  I'm  pretty  sure  we  have  the
[38:49] same  brain 
 from  our  caveman  ancestors
[38:54] she  has  the  same  brain  as  the  cave  women 
 in  her  DNA
[39:01] those  cave  women  needed  to  feel  anxious 
 they  needed  to  feel  constant  reassurance
[39:07] and  if  they  saw  the  smallest  micro 
 expression  in  their  cavemen  they  would 
 have  felt  weird  they  would  have  felt
[39:13] agitated  they  would  have  felt  unloved 
 because  this  was  literally  based  on  my 
 Primal  survival
[39:19] and  so  when  we  do  in  this  modern  day 
 have  women  who  say  like  oh  this  is  you 
 know  these  anxious  women  I'm  not  like
[39:24] this  I'm  a  boss  baby  and  everything  well 
 that's  because  you're  not  masculine
[39:29] I'll  be  I've  got  guys  who  said  I  don't 
 know  but  I  don't  want  to  deal  with  this 
 I  just  want  a  more  independent  woman 
 that's  because
[39:34] this  guy  who's  saying  this  he's  quite 
 feminine  he's  in  touch  with  his  emotions 
 he  he  likes  to  like  cry  in  front  of  his
[39:40] girl  he  doesn't  even  go  to  the  gym  and 
 he  prefers  masculine  women 
 but  again  if  you  are  a  masculine  man
[39:47] and  you  are  and  you  want  a  feminine 
 woman  in  your  life  and  you  want  a  love
[39:52] with  this  feminine  woman  this  is  just 
 part  of  it 
 and  it's  okay  like  I  don't  think  we
[39:57] should  view  this  negatively  because  this 
 is  just  who  she  is  she  prioritizes  love
[40:02] above  everything  else  and  interestingly 
 we  prioritize  purpose  and  Mission  above 
 everything  else  and  so  this  is  where
[40:07] there's  a  bit  of  like  deviation  where 
 our  priorities  are  not  the  same
[40:12] and  so  it  is  with 
 responsibility  and  discipline  that  we've
[40:17] got  to  try  and  make  her  feel  loved  as 
 much  as  possible  and  I'll  just  very  like
[40:22] go  into  a  very  quickly  rant  here  this  is 
 not  simping  there's  a  lot  of  guys  out 
 there  in  this  modern  world  maybe  you
[40:28] thought  I'd  be  one  of  them  who  think 
 that  like  being  like  this  is  like  being 
 a  simp
[40:33] the  word  simp  is  thrown  around  like 
 quite  derogracy  these  days  and  maybe  for
[40:38] good  reason  maybe  to  the  guy  who's 
 donating  to  like  only  fans  girls  or  to 
 like  you  know  like  those  women  on  Twitch
[40:44] who  are  like  in  hot  tubs  and  stuff  and 
 there's  a  guy  who  who's  like  oh  my  God 
 you  know  she  said  my  name  wow  okay 
 that's  something  fine  being  a  gentleman
[40:51] and  being  a  lover  and  being  masculine  to 
 your  woman  is  not  simping  do  not  get 
 this  confused
[40:57] for  any  guy  out  there  who  who's 
 listening  to  this  thinking  wait  you  want 
 to  make  your  woman  feel  loved  and
[41:02] appreciated  that  simping 
 I  would  invite  that  man
[41:08] to  go  say  this  to  like  a  1900s  gentleman 
 the  kind  of  guy  who  wore  like  a  a  tuxedo
[41:14] like  a  suit  for  his  first  date  with  your 
 great-grandmother
[41:19] the  kind  of  guy  who  when  you  had 
 handshaking  would  accidentally  crush 
 your  hand  because  this  is  how  hard  men
[41:24] used  to  handshake  those  they're  the  kind 
 of  guy  with  a  four  digit  testosterone 
 for  1076  nanograms  per  deciliter
[41:30] testosterone  and  these  modern  day  it  was 
 skinny  neck  skinny  risk  guys  call  this
[41:35] simping  this  isn't  simping 
 this  is  what  this  is  how  our  great
[41:40] grandfather's  navigated  relationships 
 and  I  don't  think  a  single  one  of  us
[41:46] Modern  Men  could  call  one  of  those  those 
 men 
 Sim  could  we
[41:51] we're  just  emulating  what  our  great 
 grandfathers  did  perhaps  in  hopefully  a 
 slightly  better  more  educated  way
[41:57] because  now  we  understand  a  lot  more 
 about  psychology  and  relationships 
 this  is  not  simping  this  is  love
[42:04] and  there's  a  big  difference  in  it  and 
 it's  okay  like  you  know  the  friend  of 
 mine  sneako  he's  another  Creator  he  I
[42:09] think  he  went  on  this  rant  once  as  well 
 where  people  were  calling  him  as  like  it 
 was  on  like  a  live  chat  on  live  stream
[42:15] and  stuff  so  people  do  turn  a  bit  stupid 
 when  it  comes  to  like  live  streaming  and 
 everything  but  people  were  commenting
[42:20] like  spamming  like  when  he  kissed  this 
 girl  or  he  said  he  loved  this  girl  or
[42:25] something  and  then  he  went  on  around 
 saying  like  how  is  this  isn't  simply 
 like  we're  in  a  relationship  we're  in 
 love  that's  not  simply  it's  not  it's  all
[42:31] like  being  in  love  with  this  woman  and 
 treating  her  with  love  and  respect  and
[42:36] appreciation  is  not  simping  it's  only 
 simping  if  she  doesn't  even  like  you  if 
 she  doesn't  even  like  you  if  she
[42:41] disrespects  you  if  she  doesn't  even  know 
 you  and  then  you're  like  acting  in  this 
 proper  love  Ewa  and  you're  paying  for
[42:46] her  or  something  okay  that's  sipping  but 
 like  with  a  girl  who's  literally  yours 
 who  you  literally  have  like  you  have
[42:52] you've  got  her  soul 
 treating  her  nicely  and  paying  for  the 
 dates  and  and  being  really  conscious  of
[42:58] how  much  you've  got  to  show  love  to  her 
 is  not  simply  at  all  this  is  the  right 
 thing  to  do  this  is  for  her  benefit  and
[43:03] also  for  yours  so  don't  let  any  of  these 
 like  modern  day  Sigma  males  with  like
[43:08] smelly  breath  and  like  weird  facial  hair 
 tell  you  that  this  is  simple  because  I 
 don't  believe  it  is
[43:17] so  then  we  get  to  the  point  how  do  we 
 actually  make  her  feel  loved  we
[43:22] understand  that  we've  got  to  try  and 
 make  her  feel  loved  as  much  as  possible 
 but  how  do  we  actually  go  about  and  do
[43:28] that  because  a  lot  of  guys  don't 
 actually  know  this  and  I  didn't  for  a 
 long  time 
 a  lot  of  guys  say  this  and  quite  like
[43:34] usually  older  guys  and  a  little  bit  more 
 old  school  guys  say  this  oh  she  knows
[43:39] that  I  love  her  so  I  don't  have  to  say 
 it 
 no
[43:45] she  might  rationally  know  that  you  love 
 her
[43:51] but  she's  an  emotional  being  and  it  it's 
 not  her  rational  logical  side  that  even
[43:57] matters  if  she's  a  feminine  woman  it's 
 about  how  she  feels  right  now  she  needs
[44:02] to  be  made  to  feel  like  you  will  love 
 her  right  now 
 foreign
[44:11] you  could  do  this  how  the  Hollywood 
 movies  and  the  modern  day  materialistic
[44:16] propaganda  capitalistic  machine  want  you 
 to  with  these  big  romantic  gestures  and
[44:21] and  the  box  of  expensive  overpriced 
 chocolates  on  Valentine's  Day  and  look 
 honey  I  got  you  flowers  and  look  like
[44:26] you  know  the  the  sad  chump  who  like 
 brings  like 
 um  all  the  at  least  these  these  moments
[44:32] could  be  nice  right  this  isn't  me 
 criticizing  a  Gentleman  Just  just 
 understand  this
[44:37] there  is  a  brainwashing  and  conditioning 
 that's  been  going  on  for  a  long  time  in
[44:42] the  minds  of  men  from  movies  that  we've 
 seen  from  the  ways  that  you  know  what 
 we've  seen  in  school  that  the  way  to
[44:47] show  your  woman  love  is  a  big  romantic 
 gesture  especially  when  you  spend  money
[44:53] make  sure  you  spend  money  make  sure  you 
 spend  money  make  sure  you  spend  money 
 that's  what  they  want  you  to  do
[44:59] but  remember  what  we  said  before 
 we  need  to  make  her  feel  loved  right  now
[45:05] in  every  micro  moments 
 and  so  you  could  do  the  big  romantic
[45:10] gesture  and  the  sweet  dinner  date  that's 
 really  expensive  and  she'll  feel  loved
[45:17] for  30  seconds 
 you  bring  her  into  the  bedroom  and
[45:22] there's  rose  petals  all  over  the  floor 
 she'll  feel  loved  for  five  seconds 
 done
[45:30] now 
 right  now  that  moment's  already  gone 
 okay  she's  seen  the  pencils  okay  she's
[45:35] seen  the  dinner  day  okay  she's  eating 
 the  food  right  now  that  that  moment's 
 gone  what  about  right  now
[45:40] this  is  what  you're  not  really  told 
 it's  not  about  these  big  moments  that
[45:45] are  so  expensive  for  you  to  conduct  and 
 to  that  show  your  love  or  anything  it's 
 about  the  smallest  micro  moments  every
[45:53] as  many  moments  as  possible  that's  how 
 you  make  her  feel  loved  you  don't  need
[45:58] to  spend  money  on  this 
 you  don't  need  to  make  some  big  gesture 
 for  this
[46:03] in  fact 
 the  smaller  and  more  consistent  and  more
[46:08] quantity  of  these  moments  where  you  make 
 her  feel  loved  is  actually  better
[46:16] so  the  way  that  I  think  is  best  to  do 
 this 
 is  to  change  the  way  that  you  talk  to
[46:22] your  woman  and  there's  something  that  I 
 wrote  down  in  fact  I'll  read  it  to  you 
 right  now  so
[46:28] yeah  it's  on  my  phone 
 foreign
[46:33] act  like  you're  on  mushrooms  with  her 
 all  of  the  time 
 just  act  like  him
[46:39] for  if  you  are  wondering  I've  not  really 
 spoken  about  like  psychedelics  much  but 
 I've  taken  mushrooms  like  psychedelics
[46:44] like  maybe  10  times  or  so  and  I'm  not 
 like  a  professional  like  uh  shroom  knot
[46:49] or  whatever  it's  called  but  like  I'm 
 kind  of  like  a  fan  of  them  I'm  really 
 getting  like  a  lot  of  positive  benefit 
 from  this
[46:55] and  what  I  found  is  that  if  if  you 
 haven't  ever  taken  psychedelics  before 
 at  least  for  me  personally  I  turn  into
[47:02] like  such  a  a  romantic  almost  like  it's 
 out  of  a  movie  the  way  that  I  speak  to
[47:07] my  woman  the  way  that  I  speak  to  her  and 
 I  just  wrote  this  down 
 imagine  like  you're  on  shrooms  with  her
[47:14] all  the  time 
 I  remember  remember  this  is  I've  wrote 
 the  song  Right  remember  how  you  used  to
[47:19] talk  to  her  like  it  meant  something 
 and  this  is  I  literally  wrote  down  what
[47:25] I  was  gonna  say  to  her  when  I  was  gonna 
 give  her  this  the  seashell 
 this  is  a  gift  for  you  my  love  the  ocean
[47:32] gave  it  to  me  and  now  I  give  it  to  you 
 keep  it  safe  forever  as  a  token  of  my
[47:37] love 
 so  you  can  change  the  way  that  you  talk 
 and  you  can  talk  with  this  extra  level
[47:44] of  of 
 energy  of  emotion  and  or  more
[47:50] seriousness 
 like  you're  in  a  movie  and  this  doesn't 
 need  to  be  all  the  time  and  of  course  it
[47:55] sounds  a  little  bit  cringe  when  I'm 
 saying  what  I  was  gonna  say  to  my  girl 
 to  you  it  sounds  a  little  bit  cringe  but
[48:01] that's  because  you  know  the  context  has 
 changed  the  context  has  changed  now  I'm 
 speaking  to  you  through  the  internet  and
[48:06] you  know  people  are  listening  and 
 everything  like  that  compared  to  like  me 
 passionately  with  my  girl  there's  a
[48:11] difference 
 change  the  way  that  you  talk  to  her  and 
 talk  to  her  and  more  of  like  this  this
[48:16] beautiful  serious  way  better  than  the 
 mundane  I  love  yous  that  we  throw  out
[48:21] there  like  grab  her  cheeks  I  put  both 
 hands  on  her  cheeks  look  and  deeply  into
[48:26] her  eyes  and  just  feel  the  love  that  you 
 have  and  say  say  what's  on  your  mind  I
[48:32] won't  give  you  like  some  pre-built 
 statements  that  you  can  say  to  her 
 but  there  is  like  some  some  almost  movie
[48:39] star  level 
 sentence  and  and  stuff  that  you  can  say
[48:45] to  her  that  will  arise  if  you  let  it  if 
 you  don't  stop 
 you're  on  the  process  because  it  feels  a
[48:51] bit  cringe  because  you  don't  usually 
 talk  like  this  trust  me  if  she  is  the 
 right  girl  and  she's  totally  in  love
[48:56] with  you  and  you  act  like  this  and  you 
 talk  to  her  with  seriousness  like  with 
 this  level  of  like  you  know  of  this  like
[49:01] psychedelic  love 
 she  will  you  will  physically  see  this  I
[49:07] promise  you  you  will  see  you're  holding 
 the  cheeks  like  this  or  you  know  you're 
 holding  your  hands  you  will  see  her  as
[49:12] you  say  these  like  sweet  words 
 melts  she  will  literally  melt  in  your
[49:17] arms 
 at  least  that's  the  energy  that  I  get 
 from  my  girl  maybe  your  girl's  energy  is
[49:22] different  and  you  know  she  picks  up  and 
 she's  so  happy  to  hear  it  or  something 
 you  will  physically  see  her  energy  just
[49:28] change 
 which  is  beautiful
[49:34] and  so  the  fastest  way  that  I've 
 personally  if  I  was  going  to  recommend 
 anything  of  course  there's  a  not  like  a
[49:40] recommendation  you  can  do  whatever  you 
 want  but  like  the  fastest  way  that  I've 
 personally  been  able  to  like  level  up
[49:46] how  much  she  feels  loved  but  also  how 
 much  I  love  her  is  taking  psychedelics
[49:51] together  they've  been  a  beautiful  part 
 of  my  journey  over  the  last  few  years 
 extremely  impactful  maybe  I'll  make  like
[49:56] a  whole  separate  video  of  of  the 
 experiences  that  I've  had  on 
 psychedelics  they're  kind  of  like  a
[50:02] controversial  thing  and  I'm  not  some 
 like  guy  who's  constantly  doing  them  or 
 anything  in  around  three  years  or  two
[50:08] years  I've  done  them  maybe  I  think  seven 
 eight  times  or  something  like  that  but 
 if  you  are  interested  if  there's  a  bunch
[50:13] of  comments  saying  like  oh  yeah  I  should 
 do  that  maybe  I  will  it's  just  something 
 I've  assumed  people  will  find  too
[50:18] controversial  or  people  might  not  find 
 interest  I  don't  know
[50:24] how  to  make  love 
 so  we've  talked  about how  to  make  her 
 feel  loved  and  and  how  to  love  her  and
[50:30] everything  but  perhaps  the  most 
 important  and  the  fastest  way  to  do  this 
 is  actually  making  love  like  that  like
[50:37] actually  having  sex  in  the  book  The  Way 
 of  the  superior  man  he  defines  sex  as
[50:42] the  bodily  transmission  of  Love  think 
 about  that  that  phrase  that  is  perfect 
 for  like  the  definition  of  sex  the
[50:50] bodily  transmission  of  Love  That  is  a 
 perfect  phrase  and  yeah  it  doesn't  work 
 for  most  people
[50:56] because  most  people  don't  transmit  love 
 to  each  other  when  they're  making  love
[51:02] unfortunately  most  people 
 I  would  assume
[51:07] they're  unconscious  they're  overthinking 
 they're  neurotic  they're  self-centered
[51:12] when  they're  actually  like  getting 
 passionate  with  you  know  the  woman
[51:17] making  love  is  is 
 the  way  that  you're  you  know  magnify
[51:23] everything  that  we're  talking  about 
 today 
 if  you  are  presence  conscious  and
[51:29] actually  doing  it  in  some  kind  of  loving 
 way  and  I  don't  mean  to  you  know  oh 
 you're  gonna  do  it  slowly  or  something
[51:34] you  can  still  [ __ ]  it  but  but  doing  it 
 with  the  elements  of  Love  behind  you
[51:39] there's  something  there's  like  a  system 
 that  I  made  for  myself  and  it's  called
[51:46] dap  plus  cap  dap  plus  cap  and  it  stands
[51:51] for  dominance  aggression  pain 
 connection
[51:56] authenticity  presence 
 I  found  that  when  I  keep  these  six
[52:01] things  in  mind  as  I  make  in  love  my 
 performance  and  the  enjoyment  and  the
[52:06] connection  of  everything  goes  up 
 so  much  more  dominant  aggression  pain
[52:12] connection  authenticity  and  presence 
 Pain  by  the  way  is  an  interesting  one  I
[52:17] found  that  you  need  to  like  most  guys 
 this  is  a  controversial  subject  and 
 stuff  and  maybe  we  shouldn't  talk  about
[52:23] it  like  widely  on  YouTube  because  people 
 will  take  out  of  context  but  I  found 
 that  you  as  a  guy  who's  you  know
[52:28] masculine  man  who  wants  to dominate  your 
 woman  you  need  to  be  okay  with  the
[52:33] feeling  of  inflicting  pain  on  her  that 
 like  a  woman  who's  in  love  who's  having 
 sex  can  experience  like  a  lot  more  pain
[52:39] than  you  think  she  can  and  it's  a  part 
 of  actually  making  the  love  like  there 
 is  a  level  of  like  soreness  and
[52:45] painfulness  in  the  the  DAP  plus  cap 
 system  just  trying  to  remember  that  the 
 next  time  that  you  know  if  it  becomes
[52:51] relevant  for  you  and  if  you're 
 interested  in  one  of  the  links  in  the 
 description  I've  got  a  course  where  I
[52:56] teach  this  in  full 
 there  are  exercises  now  we  can  get  quite 
 practical  here  there  are  exercises  that
[53:03] you  can  do  that  will  make  your  your  love 
 making  sessions 
 significantly  better  like  quite
[53:09] literally  like  five  times  as  good  and 
 there  was  a  point  just  a  few  months  ago 
 when  I  was  in  London  about
[53:15] um  three  months  ago  four  months  ago  that 
 I  had  stopped  all  these  exercises  and  I 
 had  even  stopped  a  lot  of  the  normal
[53:21] exercise  like  weightlifting  and  cardio 
 that  I  was  doing  and  so  I  became  like 
 quite  relatively  unfit  for  my  own  like
[53:27] you  know 
 um  skills  you  know  my  own  sort  of  memory 
 I  became  quite  unfit  right  and  it  made  a
[53:34] huge  difference  it  made  it  that  I  wasn't 
 even  present  when  I  was  making  love  it 
 made  it  that  my  performance  was  way
[53:40] worse  that  I  was  slower  that  I  was 
 lethargic  that  I  would  get  tired  that 
 you  know  like  that  you  just  can't  go
[53:45] with  the  same  like  aggressive  Primal 
 penetration  that  you  used  to  and  so  I
[53:50] know  that  this  is  getting  like  practical 
 here  but  I  really  hope  you  can 
 appreciate  this  there  are  exercises  that
[53:55] you  should  consider  100  and  those  are  in 
 order  stuff  first  of  all  hit  high
[54:01] intensity  interval  training  so  this  is 
 you've  heard  about  this  kind  of  cardio 
 this  isn't  just  you  know  going  on  on  a
[54:06] run  for  like  five  minutes  or  10  minutes 
 that  could  probably  help  but  hit 
 training  high  intensity  interval
[54:12] training  where  you  go  for  a  Sprint  and 
 then  you  slow  down  for  a  few  minutes  and
[54:17] then  you  sprint  again  for  20  seconds 
 then  you  slow  down  for  a  few  minutes 
 then  you  sprint  again  that  kind  of 
 training  where  you  go  hard  then  you  slow
[54:23] down  then  you  go  really  fast  then  you 
 slow  down  like  this  and  this  happens  in 
 Crossfit  workouts  in  martial  art  and
[54:29] boxing  for  example  you  go  for  Rounds 
 this  hap  this  makes  you  so  much  better 
 at  like  the  breathing  elements  of  your
[54:37] performance  when  it  comes  to  love  making 
 it  makes  a  huge  difference  it  genuinely 
 does  and  I  know  it  can  seem  kind  of
[54:42] weird  why  I'm  teaching  this  as  part  of 
 this  video  but  again  making  love  is
[54:47] incredibly  important  in  what  we're 
 talking  about  and  then  being  able  to 
 actually  for  example  have  the  fitness  to
[54:53] be  able  to  make  love  is  also  incredibly 
 important  then  the  next  thing  I  realize 
 is  training  your  core  so  a  lot  of  guys
[54:59] especially  bodybuilders  and 
 weightlifters  think  that  they  can  just 
 kind  of  forget  training  their  core  and
[55:05] that  they  can  just  do  squats  and 
 deadlifts  and  I  found  that  that  doesn't 
 actually  cut  it  doing  your  own  like
[55:10] specific  core  workouts  ab  workouts 
 crunches  planks  they  make  a  huge
[55:15] difference  you  can  find  like  you  can 
 feel  if  your  core  is  letting  you  down 
 when  it  comes  to  having  sex  if  it  just
[55:21] gets  really  tight  and  it  burns  as  you 
 know  like  like  you've  been  working  it 
 out  that  means  that  it's  the  weak  spot
[55:26] and  if  you  improve  it  suddenly  like  you 
 ease  open  the  bottleneck  and  you  can
[55:31] literally  go  like  better 
 and  the  final  thing  that  we  will  talk 
 about  is  kegels  kegels  however  you  say
[55:37] it  there's  a  muscle  a  direct  muscle  that 
 you  can  use  that  directly  influences
[55:44] literally  your  erection  and  also  like 
 how  far  you  can  ejaculate  like  there's
[55:50] of  direct  muscle  that  you  can  train  that 
 will  make  you  harder  last  longer  that
[55:56] will  make  it  so  that  she  feels  better 
 and  it's  called  the  Kegel  muscle  like
[56:01] the  PC  muscle  and  there's  two  easy  ways 
 that  I'd  explain  this  there's  like  two 
 kind  of  muscles  that  we  want  to  train 
 and  there's  easy  ways  to  explain  this
[56:07] the  first  one  I  want  you  to  right  now 
 Act  to  activate  the  muscle  that  you
[56:13] would  if  you  wanted  to  stop  pissing 
 imagine  right  now  you  were  having  a  piss
[56:18] right  you're  having  a  piss  the  the 
 urine's  coming  out  and  then  you  want  to 
 stop  the  piss  what  would  you  do  do  that
[56:24] do  that  movement  right  now  it's  almost 
 like  you're  like  sucking  in  that  kind  of
[56:29] area  that's  you  we  can  say  it's  like  one 
 key  go  like  one  rep  that's  one  but  then
[56:34] another  element  is  imagine  if  you  were 
 having  a  piss  and  you  wanted  to  push  it
[56:39] out  faster  like  imagine  you're  in  a  rush 
 or  something  so  you  can  you  can  like  pee 
 at  the  normal  rate  but  you  can  push  out
[56:45] faster  P  can't  you 
 that  is  another  part  of  the  training  if 
 you  can  do  that  right  now  and  you  won't
[56:50] like  pee  yourself  in  anything  the  same 
 thing  I  imagine  you're  pushing  it  out
[56:55] those  are  two  different  like  ways  that 
 you  can  train  these  like  sexual  muscles 
 and  I  found  that  when  you  put  intention
[57:02] into  this  for  literally  just  a  few  days 
 you  will  see  an  improvement  to  your
[57:07] lovemaking  like  a  significant 
 Improvement  it  the  reason  why  I'm 
 talking  like  this  you  know  it's  such  a
[57:12] practical  tip  to  give  you  in  this  kind 
 of  video  it's  because  it  genuinely  will 
 be  the  fastest  Improvement  to  your
[57:19] lovemaking  which  will  then  genuinely  be 
 the  fastest  Improvement  to  making  her
[57:24] feel  loved 
 we  can  talk  now  about  setting  rules  and
[57:30] expectations  as  a  father  would  this  is  a 
 controversial  part  of  loving  a  feminine
[57:36] woman  that  the  modern  day  the  modern 
 world  do  not  understand  this  one  single 
 bit  a  good  father  would  set  a  very  clear
[57:44] house  rules  for  his  daughter  very  clear 
 this  is  what  you  do  this  is  what  you  eat
[57:49] this  is  how  you  behave  this  is  the  words 
 that  we  can  use  this  is  the  words  that 
 we  don't  use  this  is  what  time  you've
[57:55] got  to  come  home  from  school  everything 
 like  this  and  this  is  absolutely 
 perfectly  normal  and  healthy  for  a 
 father  to  do  this  for  his  daughter  but
[58:01] then  it  gets  kind  of  weird  to  set  these 
 kinds  of  rules  and  boundaries  for  an
[58:08] adult  for  a  grown  woman  and  the  modern 
 world  around  this  question  this  heavily
[58:13] and  says  that  this  is  toxic  controlling 
 everything  but  again  if  you  are  a
[58:18] masculine  man  dating  a  feminine  woman 
 this  is  what  she  needs  why  because  if 
 she's  a  feminine  woman  it  means  that
[58:23] she's  had  a  masculine  father 
 and  she  will  be  attracted  to  the  man  who
[58:28] acts  in  a  somewhat  similar  way  to  her 
 father  her  father  used  to  say  okay  come 
 do  this  no  not  in  a  horrible  way  you
[58:34] know  but  I  can't  come  do  this  it'll  be 
 good  for  you  no  no  don't  do  that  it'll 
 be  bad  for  you  is  used  to  her  father
[58:41] being  like  this  and  now  when  she  grows 
 up  it's  almost  like  she  wants  to  be 
 passed  on  to  the  next  man  who  can  direct
[58:47] her  life  in  the  way  of  the  superior  man 
 that  book  that  I  mentioned  before 
 there's  a  quote  which  says  she  wants  to
[58:52] relax  in  the  guidance  and  the  direction 
 of  your  your  masculinity  she  wants  you
[58:58] to  be  certain  not  just  for  yourself  and 
 your  own  Direction  but  what  she  should
[59:03] do  and  often  most  guys  are  not 
 comfortable  with  this  most  guys
[59:08] literally  are  so  like  like  anxious  with 
 this  and  the  reason  why  is  because  you
[59:14] will  get  punished  in  the  modern  day  if 
 we  talk  about  this  out  loud  like  I'm 
 doing  right  now  you  will  get  people  who
[59:20] respond  to  you  and  say  that  you're 
 manipulative  you're  misogynist 
 everything  but  the  truth  is  a  feminine
[59:25] woman  actually  needs  this  and  will  be 
 more  in  love  with  you  if  you  act  in  a
[59:30] kind  of  a  similar  way  as  her  father  did 
 when  you  set  rules  and  expectations  and 
 boundaries
[59:37] I  journaled  a  lot  for  this  video  there's 
 like  four  pages 
 in  the  modern  day  everyone  is
[59:43] depolarized  honestly  most  like  couples 
 are  depolarized  the  man's  not  that
[59:48] masculine  the  woman's  not  that  feminine 
 this  means  everyone's  quite  unhappy  and 
 because  most  relationships  are  like  this
[59:54] now  we  see  man  and  woman  as  equal  we 
 have  equal  rights  and  so  we  are  equals
[60:00] the  problem  with  this  this  equality 
 thinking  is  that  then  we  don't  need  each
[60:05] other  the  necessity  of  of  being  in  a 
 relationship  disappears  when  you're
[60:11] equals  when  you're  equals  you  don't  need 
 each  other  anymore 
 it  sounds  weird  but  one  of  the  best
[60:18] pieces  of  advice  that  I  could  give  you 
 is  to  not  treat  her  like  like  she's 
 really  cool
[60:24] it  sounds  weird  and  people  will  quote 
 this  and  and  try  and  terrorize  me  and 
 everything  and  they'll  say  that  this  is
[60:29] horrible  one  of  the  best  pieces  of 
 advice  that  I  could  give  you  is  to  treat 
 her  like  she's  weaker  than  you
[60:35] you  know  why 
 this  is  gonna  make  you  be  so  much  more
[60:40] loving  to  her  because  if  you  genuinely 
 keep  in  your  mind  that  she's  weaker  than 
 you  which  is  actually  on  objective  fact
[60:47] she  is  weaker  than  you 
 then  you  will  act  like  the  good  happy
[60:52] agile  active  father  she  needs  something 
 so  you're  gonna  stand  up  and  go  get  it
[60:57] for  her  and  she's  gonna  love  that  this 
 is  not  something  she's  broken  something 
 and  you're  gonna  sit  down  and  help  her
[61:03] clean  it 
 the  weak  lazy  father  who  thinks  that  his 
 daughter's  grown  up  enough  oh  we  need
[61:08] milk  and  he  throws  her  a  pound  like  you 
 know  a  dollar  or  something  oh  yeah  go  go
[61:13] get  it  he  says  to  her  in  the  modern  day 
 this  is  what  a  lot  of  relationships  are 
 like  the  man  is  acting  like  an  equal  or
[61:19] even  below  the  man  is  acting  like  the 
 boy  the  son  to  his  woman  the  mother  and
[61:24] this  is  why  relationships  have  gotten  so 
 ucky  for  a  lot  of  people  especially  if 
 you're  able  to  resonate  with  me  and  you
[61:30] know  like  feel  the  similarities  between 
 maybe  if  you  you  feel  kind  of  similar  to 
 me  in  some  areas
[61:35] if  you're  a  masculine  man  you'll  find 
 that  in  deeply  unattractive  to  think 
 that  your  woman  is  gonna  guide  you  your
[61:40] woman's  gonna  like  look  after  you  she's 
 gonna  provide  for  you  that  she's  gonna 
 make  half  the  decisions
[61:46] treat  her  like  you  would  your  daughter
[61:51] you  would  do  a  lot  for  your  daughter  you 
 would  be  the  one  to  protect  her  you'd  be
[61:56] the  one  to  jump  up  out  your  seat  when 
 your  daughter  needs  something  if  you 
 were  like  the  good  happy  father
[62:03] she  expects 
 to  follow  you 
 remember  this  is  not  all  women  honestly
[62:09] this  is  we're  talking  about  the  small 
 amount  of  women  right  we 
 we  never  wanted  to  date  90  of  of  women
[62:15] right 
 um I  was  gonna  say  no  offense  to  the 
 barnacy  offense  to  them  we  like  90  of
[62:21] men  and  women  are  just  like  Low  T  or 
 aren't  they  you  look  around  everyone's
[62:26] on  Tick  Tock  everyone's  watching  porn 
 and  playing  video  games  and  eating  junk 
 food  and  taking  drugs  and  stuff  okay  90 
 of  people  are  just  like  we  don't
[62:32] okay  if  you're  on  self-improvement  if 
 you're  meditating  if  you're  going  to  the 
 gym  you  can't  even  relate  to  most  people
[62:37] we  don't  want  to  date  some  normal 
 masculine  independent  woman  if  you 
 wanted  to  date  a  feminine  woman  this  is
[62:43] what  she  expects  because  her  father 
 acted  like  this 
 and  there  is  something  iconic  with  how
[62:48] man  and  woman  used  to  get  married  her 
 father  used  to  walk  her  down  the  aisle 
 and  pass  her  to  the  husband
[62:54] in  the  modern  day  feminists  say  that 
 this  yeah  this  was  like  some  some 
 ceremony  that  was  so  Barbara  no  it
[63:00] wasn't 
 he  was  her  protector  the  father  was  her 
 provider
[63:06] and  then  he  passes  the  responsibility 
 onto  the  husband  that  is  one  of  the  like 
 that  is  the  most  sacred  moment  that  a
[63:13] father  could  have  is  like  thinking  to 
 himself  I'm  passing  like  you  know  my
[63:20] how  much  I  have  looked  after  my  little 
 girl  to  this  man
[63:25] and  I  am  trusting  this  man  to  look  after 
 this  the  same  way  that  I  did  that  is  the
[63:31] most  beautiful  moment  the  husband  and 
 father  could  see
[63:36] and  in  the  modern  day  like  feminists  and 
 men  with  like  skinny  necks  and  long  hair 
 is  saying  like  oh  yeah  that's  barbaric
[63:41] it's  sexist 
 let  the  that  let  the  feminine  woman 
 decide  if  there's  a  masculine  woman  out
[63:46] there  who  thinks  it  is  more  better  okay 
 fine  the  thing  is  what  we're  just  doing 
 is  just  invoking  our  own  consent  and  our
[63:52] own  preferences  and  we're  attracting 
 like  we  want  to  attract  the  feminine 
 woman  who  actually  expects  this  because
[63:58] her  father  who's  still  around  who's  not 
 divorced  from  her  mother  her  father 
 raised  her  quite  tightly  securely  her
[64:06] father  set  rules  and  said  no  no  we  don't 
 do  that  because  of  this  no  yes  we  do  no
[64:11] come  on  we  do  this  thing  no  we  don't 
 stay  out  that  late  no  you  know  what  you
[64:16] can't  be  friends  with  that  girl  because 
 she's  not  good  for  you  her  father  was 
 like  this  for  a  good  feminine  woman  that
[64:21] like  you  think  is  actually  good  quality 
 her  father  would  have  it  like  that  this 
 is  the  only  way  a  woman  can  be  of  good
[64:26] quality  her  father  was  like  this 
 and  so  you  must  be  like  this  too  you
[64:31] must  be  okay  with  being  seen  as  a 
 misogynist  patriarchal  figure  you  must
[64:36] be  okay  with  setting  rules  and 
 expectations  and  telling  her  what  you 
 can  and  can't  do
[64:41] foreign 
 if  you  know  that  you're  supposed  to  be  a
[64:46] man  like  this  if  this  sounds  like 
 absolutely  right  and  you  couldn't  even 
 imagine  a  relationship  where  for  example
[64:53] you  didn't  get  to  say  or  you  know  make 
 your  girl  do  something
[64:58] that  would  be  weird  for  you 
 you've  got  to  be  authentic  with  this 
 because  a  lot  of  guys  don't  have  the
[65:03] confidence  to  admit  this  but  if  this  is 
 your  desire  to  have  this  kind  of 
 relationship  where  genuinely  you  are  in
[65:09] control  of  your  woman  then  be  authentic 
 to  it  of  course  this  is  going  to  be  with 
 consent  with  age-appropriate  adults  and
[65:15] everything  so  no  one  can  ever  like 
 criticize  us  for  this  be  authentic  with 
 your  desire  with  this
[65:22] the  extreme  level  of  this  now  she's 
 going  to  be  embarrassed  when  I  tell  this 
 like  mini  story  The  Extreme  level  with
[65:28] you  know  you  telling  your  girl  what  to 
 do  and  her  looking  to  your  guidance  is 
 that  when  you  get  to  the  extreme  levels
[65:35] of  feminine  energy  inside  of  a  woman 
 where  she  has  like  literally  zero 
 Independence  when  she's  with  you
[65:41] and  she's  totally  100  submissive  when 
 she's  with  you 
 is  something  that  I've  just  experienced
[65:47] a  few  days  ago  where  I  was  having  a 
 shower  and  my  girl  lives  with  me  right 
 she's  like  we've  been  all  like  we've
[65:52] traveled  a  lot  the  last  six  months  in 
 different  countries  we  lived  in 
 different  countries  right  I  was  having  a
[65:57] shower  and  it  just  hit  me  I  was  like 
 wait  she's  going  to  be  embarrassed  when 
 I  tell  this  story
[66:02] it  hit  me  I  was  like  she's  not  I  had  a 
 shower  in  like  two  days  or  for  a  little
[66:07] while  and  I  know  this  isn't  like 
 weirdest  it's  embarrassing  to  say  and 
 people  are  gonna  find  this  weird  but  the
[66:12] reason  why  this  hit  me  and  I  thought  oh 
 yeah 
 because  like  I've  gotta  tell  her  to
[66:18] I've  got  to  tell  her  like  oh  yeah  not 
 like  I'll  go  have  a  shower  stinky  but 
 like  you  know  come  come  shower  with  me
[66:24] and  it  this  is  when  it  hit  me  of  how 
 sweet  this  is  even  though  that's  kind  of 
 like  a  gross  example  it  hit  me  because
[66:29] it  made  me  realize  just  how  much 
 responsibility  I  have  to  take  as  a  man
[66:35] that  I  have  to  think  of  her  basic  needs 
 just  as  I  would  a  father  to  a  daughter
[66:41] now  you  might  hear  that  well  probably 
 not  you  but  like  you  know  there's  going 
 to  be  some  people  who  would  hear  this 
 and  say  oh  well  that's  that's  gross  and
[66:47] I  want  a  woman  who's  more  independent 
 and  that's  real  that's  weird
[66:53] whatever  your  preference  is  fine  but 
 then  I  can  have  mine  you  can  have  yours 
 right 
 the  thing  is  there's  a  lot  of  people
[66:59] listening  to  this  there's  a  lot  of  men 
 out  there  perhaps  you're  one  of  them  who 
 actually  in  a  weird  way  think  that
[67:06] that's  kind  of  attractive  she  didn't 
 take  a  shower 
 unless  you  would  kind  of  tell  her  oh
[67:12] yeah  like  come  with  and  of  course  if  she 
 lives  by  herself  if  she  lives  with  her 
 family  or  roommates  or  something  of 
 course  that's  going  to  be  different  and
[67:17] you  know  you're  not  coming  you  don't 
 want  it  to  be  like  oh  yeah  she's 
 literally  just  sat  there  and  felt  till 
 you  come  visit  again  of  course  this  is
[67:23] on  the  dynamic  of  like  oh  yeah  we  live 
 together  we  do  a  lot  of  things  together 
 so  if  I've  not  like  brought  her  into  the
[67:28] shower  for  like  two  days  or  something  it 
 kind  of  like  oh  yeah  it  just  you  know 
 brushed  past  her  mind  or  something  and 
 girls  do  I  sometimes  do  this  weird  thing
[67:33] where  they  don't  shower  for  like  a  day 
 or  something  because  they  don't  want  to 
 get  their  hair  wet  I  don't  know  but  you
[67:38] get  what  I  mean  right  she's  gonna  be 
 embarrassed  that  I  told  this  story  but 
 hopefully  there's  gonna  be  some  guys 
 maybe  you're  one  of  them  who  kind  of
[67:43] understand  what  I'm  getting  at  here  that 
 there's  a  lot  of  responsibility  to  take 
 here  there's  a  lot  you  have  to  think
[67:49] about  her  fundamental  needs  and  so  now 
 I'm  getting  I'm  personally  getting 
 better  at  this  I  wake  up  come  on  baby
[67:55] let's  brush  our  teeth 
 because  if  I  don't  say  that 
 she  might  not
[68:01] and  again  a  lot  of  people  with  no  no 
 that's  weird  that's  weird  fine  fine
[68:06] but  a  lot  of  masculine  men  see  this 
 level  of  feminine  submissive  dependent
[68:11] energy  in  a  woman  and  think  that  is 
 exactly  what  I'm  attracted  to  I  want  her
[68:16] exactly  to  be  like  an  extension  of  my 
 arm  I  want  her  to  be  mine
[68:22] I  don't  want  her  to  be  this  independent 
 girl  who  can  go  live  her  life  I  want  her
[68:27] to  be  mine 
 and  so  this  is  where  it  gets  really 
 controversial  and  many  people  can
[68:33] disagree  and  many  people  can  say  that 
 this  is  too  far  or  anything  for  me 
 personally  this  is  the  right  level  she's
[68:38] happy  I'm  happy  maybe  you  want  something 
 similar  maybe  you  don't  but  I'm  just 
 telling  you  as  an  example  this  is  like
[68:44] the  extreme  example  of  like  okay  when 
 she's  totally  submissive  just  like  a
[68:49] daughter  would  be  like  a  young  girl 
 would  be  this  is  what  it's  like  and 
 actually  we  have  two  comments  here  that
[68:54] I  want  to  read  that  guys  have  left 
 comments  on  my  YouTube 
 there's  a  comment  from  Zaid  chakras
[69:02] realize  you  can't  find  a  good  girl  you 
 must  guide  her  in  the  right  direction
[69:07] yourself  and  then  there's  a  comment  from 
 a  guy  on  YouTube  his  name  was  Chad  on 
 YouTube  love  your  woman  like  a
[69:14] one-year-old  daughter 
 on  dating  a  feminine  woman  this  is  the
[69:19] key  love  your  woman  like  your  one  year 
 old  daughter  like  your  poo  poo  poo  PP
[69:26] one-year-old  daughter  you  cannot  go 
 wrong  if  she's  a  feminine  woman  you 
 cannot  go  wrong  with  this  in  your  mind
[69:32] love  her  like  she's  my  one-year-old 
 daughter 
 oh  she  says  something  like  a  little  bit
[69:38] too  rude  or  something  oh  yeah  no  you're 
 a  poo  poo  head  oh  she's  like  she's  she's
[69:43] misbehaving  a  little  bit  no  come  on  come 
 on  always  loving  her  you  went  with  your
[69:48] daughter  wouldn't  you  imagine  your 
 one-year-old  daughter  acts  in  some  kind 
 of  way  with  slightly  disrespectful
[69:55] you'd  still  love  her  you'd  still  grasp 
 her  in  and  then  she  knows  oh  there  is
[70:00] secure  love  here  this  is  not  like 
 rewarding  bad  behavior  this  is  not  going 
 against  the  red  pill  or  anything  this  is
[70:05] just  to  understand  it  in  a  slightly  like 
 condescending  way 
 that  actually  she  isn't  that  far  off
[70:13] from  the  one-year-old  daughter  in  terms 
 of  how  we  would  behave  to  her  of  course 
 she's  matured  of  course  she's  developed
[70:19] you  know  this  sentence  that  I'm  saying 
 right  now  will  not  be  quoted  when  some 
 male  feminist  puts  us  on  his  YouTube
[70:24] channel  or  his  videos  or  his  articles  or 
 something  but  of  course  like  of  course 
 she's  developed  since  she's  one  years
[70:29] old  but  for  your  own  benefit  and  for  her 
 benefit  if  you  just  imagine  and  treat
[70:34] her  like  she  is  your  one-year-old 
 daughter  your  relationship  will 
 drastically  improve  as  long  as  she  is  a
[70:39] feminine  woman  and  of  course  the 
 disclaimer  there's  going  to  be  masculine 
 women  watching  this  there's  going  to  be
[70:44] male  feminists  watching  this  who  get 
 angry  at  this  this  is  the  most 
 controversial  part  of  this  video  and  I 
 know  that  a  lot  of  people  will  take  it
[70:49] out  of  context  but  those  people 
 generally  aren't  even  in  happy 
 relationships  anyway  those  are  the  kinds
[70:54] of  people  who  are  on  antidepressants  and 
 then  say  that  like  what  we  say  about 
 self-improvement  and  everything  is  is
[71:00] toxic  and  how  are  they  who  who  are  they 
 to  give  us  advice  anyway
[71:05] living  together  so  this  is  a  very 
 specific  few  tips  I  can  just  give  you
[71:10] because  I've  kind  of  like  lived  with  my 
 girl  for  the  last  six  months  or  so  so  in
[71:15] brief  like  the  story  of  us  is  that  we 
 met  in  Thailand  in  uh  July  last  year  in
[71:21] 2022  I  was  traveling  with  my  best  friend 
 Sam  she  was  traveling  with  her  brother 
 and  one  of  her  female  friends  and  then
[71:27] we  met  literally  on  my  last  day  in 
 Thailand  so  I  was  about  to  fly  out  the 
 next  day  we  met  and  in  the  first  day
[71:33] that  we  met  both  of  us  actually  fell  in 
 love  which  was  a  very  magical  experience 
 and
[71:38] there's  a  lot  to  say  about  that  there 
 but  yeah  I  um  I  flew  out  back  home  and
[71:43] we  stayed  connected  which  is  quite  rare 
 for  me  like  I  don't  do  like  internet 
 relationships  or  anything  but  this  was
[71:48] very  rare  for  me  that  I  I  still  had  this 
 extremely  like  strong  pull  towards  her
[71:53] as  she  did  with  me  halfway  across  the 
 world  and  then  shortly  after  she  she  was
[71:58] meant  to  keep  traveling  but  shortly 
 after  she  just  booked  a  flight  and  then 
 a  12  hour  flight  from  Thailand  to  London
[72:04] and  then  a  four  hour  train  to  come  see 
 me  for  a  date  she  traveled
[72:10] genuinely  this  is  an  exaggeration  she 
 genuinely  traveled  the  globe  to  come  see
[72:16] me  for  updates 
 we  had  the  best  dates  of  our  life  which 
 was  a  one  week  road  trip  we  didn't  even
[72:22] use  technology  we  literally  drove  around 
 the  UK  drove  around  Scotland  didn't  use
[72:27] technology  slept  in  the  car  best  week  of 
 my  entire  life  best  week  of  her  life  and 
 then  she  went  back  home  for  a  few  days
[72:32] and  I  told  her  okay  I'm  gonna  book  like 
 a  place  in  Scotland  close  to  where  we 
 were  then  we  stayed  together  there  for  a
[72:37] month  and  then  we  drove  down  to  London 
 and  we  essentially  moved  to  London 
 because  that  was  my  plan  for  last  year  I
[72:42] was  going  to  move  to  London  moved  to 
 London  but  only  for  two  and  a  half 
 months  I  was  meant  to  stay  there  for  a
[72:48] year  but  then  I  just  hated  it  I  hated 
 out  unsafe  and  how  like  degenerate 
 London  and  just  wet  the  West  is  in
[72:54] general  the  UK  cities  are  just  horrible 
 this  is  a  side  runs  so  we  were  there 
 then  we  flew  out  to  Dubai  and  really
[72:59] liked  it  there  for  two  months  and  then 
 we  went  to  Thailand  went  to  Shanghai  and
[73:04] right  we've  been  to  so  many  different 
 locations  and  so  I'm  just  gonna  give  you 
 some  advice  from  the  experiences  that
[73:09] we've  had  because  we've  technically 
 lived  together  but  of  course  in  many 
 different  areas  and  living  together
[73:14] living  with  your  partner  is  a 
 tricky  situation  to  begin  so  maybe  you
[73:20] can  skip  this  if  you  don't  expect  to 
 live  with  your  girl  for  a  while  or 
 whatever  but  it  you  know  if  you  do  if
[73:25] you  are  ever  expecting  to  move  in 
 together  which  maybe  would  be  you  know 
 the  the  right  thing  to  do  especially  if
[73:31] you're  gonna  have  children  or  something 
 we're  not  planting  such  kids  right  now 
 but  I've  just  got  like  one  or  two  tips  I
[73:36] wanted  to  give  you  here  living  together 
 is  the  fast  track  to  depolarization
[73:41] because  of  familiarity  so  that's  a  bad 
 thing  living  together  is  the  fast  track
[73:46] to  depolarization  so  depolarization  is 
 when  the  man  becomes  feminine  and  or
[73:51] like  at  least  your  energy  just  kind  of 
 gets  like  in  this  weird  Gray  Zone  where 
 you're  not  Ultra  masculine  she's  not
[73:56] she's  not  Ultra  feminine  because  you 
 just  spend  so  much  time  with  each  other 
 when  you  were  apart  she  thinks  of  you  as
[74:03] Superman  what's  he  doing  who's  he  with 
 what  girls  is  he  speaking  to  what  you 
 know  she's  got  all  these  big  things  of
[74:08] you  and  then  when  you  spend  all  day 
 together  it's  like  she  smelt  your  poo  by 
 [ __ ]  seven  I  was  gonna  say  seven
[74:13] times  a  day  but  maybe  it's  not  that  much 
 for  you  but  I  eat  a  lot  of  protein  but 
 you  know  what  I  mean  the  mystery's  all
[74:19] gone  and  it  can  be  very  easy  to  lose  a 
 lot  of  the  excitement  and  love  at  this
[74:25] point 
 and  I've  also  found  that  when  you  are
[74:30] living  together  you  are  bound  to  rub  off 
 each  each  other  in  the  worst  where  your
[74:36] bounds  are  just  agitate  each  other 
 slightly  at  some  moment  which  can 
 actually  be  kind  of  significant  at  least
[74:41] for  me  I  I  really  get  agitated  at  how 
 slow  she  is  I'm  just  complaining  but
[74:47] you'll  get  why  in  a  second  because  this 
 is  important  for  you  in  cases  you've  not 
 experienced  this  it's  just  in  cases  you
[74:53] know  because  I 
 I  lived  with  a  girl  three  four  years  ago
[74:58] remember  that  I  told  you  the  comparison 
 story  where  I  had  like  the  trip  with  my 
 girl  but  then  four  years  ago  I  was
[75:04] fapping  at  night  time  and  I  was  living 
 with  like  my  ex-girlfriend  right 
 I  lived  with  her  I  moved  in  with  her  and
[75:09] I  had  never  looked  into  like  living  with 
 a  girl  before  I  wish  that  I  had  this
[75:14] part  of  this  video  like  four  years  ago 
 and  so  this  is  why  I'm  giving  this  very 
 specific  example
[75:20] you  rub  off  on  each  other  in  the  worst 
 way  when  you  live  together  because  you
[75:25] see  these  micro  moments  of  each  other 
 which  are  kind  of  annoying  so  for 
 example  as  a  man  oftentimes  you  want  to
[75:31] go  quite  fast  in  some  areas  so  for 
 example  when  it's  time  to  go  to  the  gym 
 for  me  personally  maybe  for  you  you  want
[75:36] to  put  your  music  in  put  your  shoes  on 
 okay  go  you  know  I  mean  you're  like  in 
 this  flow  of  like  going  forward  come  on
[75:41] let's  go  let's  go  to  the  gym  and  smash 
 it  and  everything  and  then  you  walk  out 
 and  your  girls  like  oh  I  forgot  my  towel
[75:47] like  you  know  she's  having  a  good  time 
 she's  holding  a  little  hip  thrust  pad 
 while  she's  smiling  at  you  and  stuff  and
[75:52] you're  listening  to  like  like  aggressive 
 music  on  the  way  there  like  drill  music 
 or  something  or  metal  music  and  she's
[75:58] there  forever  smiling  at  you  like  oh 
 what  do  you  want  to  eat  for  lunch  after 
 like 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  like  sometimes  she's
[76:05] slow  you  know  I  ride  motorbikes  and  so 
 sometimes  it's  like  my  girl  just  spends 
 too  long  with  the  helmet  and  you  know
[76:11] she's  got  the  airpod  in  and  then  she 
 drops  the  airpod  the  reason  why  I'm 
 saying  this  you  know  it  sounds  like  I'm 
 just  complaining  is  because  this  is  very
[76:17] micro  but  these  small  things  bother  you 
 when  they  can  happen  every  single  day  or
[76:23] multiple  times  a  day  which  is  what 
 happens  when  you  live  together  living 
 together  is  a  fast  track  to  annoying
[76:29] each  other  but  there  is  so  many  benefits 
 you  get  to  see  like  like  you're  on  the
[76:35] micro  moments  through  the  day 
 you  get  to  see  some  beautiful  moments
[76:41] there's  a  moment  when  I  heard  my  girls 
 laugh 
 like  at  night  time  you  know  we  were  just
[76:47] like  goofing  around  giggling  about 
 something  and  she  just  laughed  in  a 
 particular  way
[76:53] and  honestly  it  made  me  like  it  really 
 hit  me  with  some  significance  because  I
[76:58] couldn't  help  but  just  hear  and  feel  and 
 visualize  that  like  that's  how  she  would
[77:03] laugh  with  gray  hair  40  years  from  now 
 like  we're  still  laughing  in  the  same
[77:08] way 
 there's  a  lot  of  good  benefits  and  you 
 know  having  like  a  good  woman  around  a
[77:14] feminine  submissive  woman  around 
 there's  a  lot  of  benefits  to  that  it 
 depends  what  you're  after  if  you  do  want
[77:20] to  live  together  or  not  I'm  not  going  to 
 tell  you  to  but 
 there  is  one  good  tip  I  can  give  you
[77:25] which  is  that 
 try  to  have  a  some  kind  of  daily 
 separation  and  reunion  so  what  I  mean  by
[77:32] this  is  that  even  if  you  live  together 
 don't  spend  all  day  next  to  each  other
[77:37] you  know  okay  so  we're  gonna  wake  up  and 
 we're  gonna  brush  our  teeth  and  we're 
 both  gonna  go  to  the  gym  together  then 
 we're  both  gonna  go  to  like  this
[77:43] restaurant  together  then  I'm  gonna  work 
 here  and  you're  gonna  go  sit  there  and 
 read  or  something  you're  gonna  work 
 there  don't  be  together  all  day  even
[77:50] though  you  live  together  I  found  if  you 
 have  even  a  small  amount  of  Separation 
 through  the  day  like  for  example  right
[77:56] now  I'm  working  in  this  office  space  and 
 she's  downstairs  in  the  apartment  this 
 is  amazing  because  I'm  gonna  walk  in  and
[78:01] we  haven't  seen  each  other  for  like 
 three  hours  or  four  hours  so  there's 
 like  a  reunion  we're  gonna  you  know  it's
[78:06] like  it's  gonna  be  nice  to  see  her  she's 
 missing  me  right  now 
 so  we're  gonna  go  in  for  a  big  hug  and
[78:11] it's  gonna  be  a  lot  more  passionate 
 imagine  the  exact  moment  I  walk  in  that 
 exact  moment  when  we  hug  each  other
[78:16] that's  going  to  be  more  passionate  than 
 if  I  hadn't  been  anywhere  today  wouldn't 
 it  imagine  okay  I  get  home
[78:23] 605  p.m  at  six  or  five  PM  we're  gonna 
 have  a  big  hug  or  you  know  she's  missing 
 me  I've  been  gone  for  a  few  hours  let's
[78:28] go  get  some  food  if  I  didn't  go  out 
 today  at  six  or  five  PM  it's  not  like  we 
 would  have  just  suddenly  like  stood  up
[78:33] and  just  oh  yeah  yeah  oh  like  you  know  I 
 missed  you  so  obviously  not  right  that's
[78:38] separation  and  reunion  if  it  can  be 
 daily  can  be  beautiful  maybe  go  to  the
[78:43] gym  by  yourself  maybe  sign  up  for  some 
 kind  of  Class  by  yourself  maybe  sign  her 
 up  for  a  class  that  would  benefit  her
[78:49] and  it  would  help  her  to  go  to  grow  and 
 then  I  have  this  is  a  specific  thing
[78:55] which  not  a  lot  of  people  could  maybe  do 
 but  try  to  avoid  long-term  stability 
 this  is  I  think  an  absolute  killer  for
[79:03] like  middle  aged  relationships  you  know 
 of  like  married  couples  they  move  in 
 together  and  it's  just  that's  their  life
[79:09] now  and  yep  they  go  to  work  the  same  job 
 for  10  years  and  you  know  the  same 
 routine  and  everything  and  it  gets  just
[79:14] routine  and  and  just  mundane  extremely 
 quickly  and  then  for  10  years  and  20
[79:19] years  you  know  they  try  and  spice  things 
 up  by  taking  an  extra  honeymoon  or 
 something  but  it  doesn't  work  because
[79:24] they  have  this  long-term  stability  one 
 of  the  really  good  things  that  me  and  my 
 girl  have  had  is  that  we've  been  all
[79:30] over  not  not  you  know  purposely  that 
 yeah  let's  just  go  traveling  but  just 
 because  I'm  a  young  man  and  I'm
[79:36] following  my  purpose  us  and  I  want  to 
 keep  moving  around  to  try  and  see  where 
 is  a  good  place  for  me  to  like  you  know
[79:41] call  home  it  was  a  good  place  for  me  to 
 set  up  I  have  a  residency  now  in  Dubai 
 which  means  that  my  company  makes  zero
[79:47] percent  tax  so  that  was  exciting  to  move 
 there  for  that  we  moved  to  London  to  see 
 if  that  was  the  place  where  I  didn't 
 like  it  you  know  imagine  every  time  you
[79:53] move  of  course  moving  is  kind  of 
 stressful  but  it's  like  it  adds  this 
 extra  freshness  and  this  extra
[79:59] dependency  that  she  has  on  you  married 
 couples  don't  do  this  like  maybe  a 
 married  couple  moves  like  once  in  their
[80:05] life  or  twice  in  their  life 
 and  then  it  gets  very  mundane  it  gets 
 very  boring  if  you're  a  young  man
[80:11] watching  this  and  you  are  like  living 
 with  your  girl  you  can  go  on  like  you're 
 a  lot  Freer  than  most  people  are
[80:16] especially  if  you  make  money  online  if  I 
 was  a  young  couple  right  now  I  wouldn't
[80:21] book  some  like  place  to  live  like  some 
 home  for  a  year  you  know  to  rent  this 
 apartment  for  a  year  and  I  would
[80:27] certainly  not  buy  some  house  in  like  my 
 hometown  that  I  see  a  lot  of  young 
 couples  so  I  certainly  wouldn't  do  that
[80:32] because  then  you're  tied  down  there  and 
 then  you've  got  to  kind  of  just  stay  in 
 that  one  area  and  things  get  mundane
[80:38] very  quickly  it'd  be  best  if  you  stayed 
 quite  short  term  here  one  month  here  two 
 months  here  three  months  and  even  though
[80:44] yeah  the  headache  of  moving  is  annoying 
 what  actually  would  happen  is  that  you 
 have  such  significant  chapters  of  your
[80:51] life  with  this  woman  because  you've 
 experienced  so  much  so  they're  the  two 
 like  learning  lessons  I've  had  in  terms
[80:56] of  living  together 
 now  let's  say  you've  you've  done  a  bunch
[81:01] of  this  stuff  where  are  we 
 continue  being  the  best  man  that  she 
 could  get  I  would  absolutely  have  to
[81:08] include  this  part  in  this  video  because 
 even  though  we're  just  talking  about
[81:13] loving  her 
 she  only  wants  your  love  for  as  long  as 
 you  are  competent  and  attractive  for  as
[81:20] long  as  she  is  actually  still  in  love 
 with  you  this  is  a  major  issue  what  a
[81:25] lot  of  guys  go  through  they  think  that 
 the  end  goal  is  to  get  into  the 
 relationship  and  they  forget  that
[81:30] actually  that  is  the  start  it's  not  the 
 end  goal  to  get  into  the  relationship 
 that's  the  end  like  that's  like  the
[81:37] start  of  the  new  big  thing  to  think 
 about  most  guys  get  into  the 
 relationship  and  kind  of  relax  put  their
[81:43] feet  up  go  to  the  gym  a  little  bit  less 
 spend  less  time  with  their  friends  be 
 less  mysterious  relax  and  spend  more
[81:49] evenings  just  watching  Netflix  and 
 wasting  away  with  instant  gratification 
 the  thing  is  you  are  a  man  on 
 self-improvement  and  you  were  able  to
[81:55] attract  her  because  of  the  man  that  you 
 became  because  of  your  discipline
[82:00] because  of  delaying  gratification 
 because  of  your  self-improvements 
 letting  those  things  slack  what  because
[82:06] you've  just  got  her 
 this  is  controversial  as  hell
[82:11] she  will  leave  and  she  has  the  right  to 
 do  so  because  there  is  something  called 
 Branch  swinging  and  this  is  really
[82:18] interesting  Branch  swinging 
 is  when  a  woman  is  with  you  but  she  will
[82:26] like  as  a  monkey  would  she's  got  one 
 branch  right  now  but  she's  kind  of  you 
 know  looking  for  the  next  Branch  to
[82:32] swing  to  and  she  will  grab  the  branch 
 before  she  lets  go  of  the  current  one
[82:38] and  and  of  course  people  will  take  this 
 out  of  context  I'm  not  describing  women 
 as  monkeys  or  cheaters  or  anything
[82:43] but  Branch  swinging  is  essentially  where 
 most  women  especially  this  is  the
[82:48] interesting  thing  especially  feminine 
 women  are  so  much  more  likely  to  like
[82:53] essentially  like  leave  you  abandon  you 
 and  to  choose  another  guy  and  even  to 
 cheat  because  of  evolution  because  she
[83:00] needs  to  constantly  be  with  the  best  guy 
 that  would  give  her  the  best  genes  for 
 her  children  and  also  that  would  keep
[83:06] her  children  safe  if  you  display 
 weakness  if  you  get  complacent  if  you 
 start  lacking  in  the  things  that  she  was
[83:11] attracted  to  it's  natural  for  her  to 
 start  looking  elsewhere  most  guys  don't 
 want  to  like  think  about  this  most  guys
[83:17] reject  this  and  then  get  angry  towards 
 women  and  say  wait  the  the  cheaters 
 that's  horrible  yeah  I  don't  care  about
[83:22] women  anyway  most  women  hear  this  and 
 get  offended  no  we're  not  cheetahs  and 
 everything  but  this  is  absolutely  normal
[83:29] healthy  and  necessary  how  do  you  say 
 that  word  necessary  for  the  the
[83:35] evolution  of  humans  for  the  survival  of 
 our  species  women  must  find  strength  she
[83:41] must  find  and  be  impregnated  it  by  a  man 
 of  strength  always  and  so  if  you  start
[83:47] to  show  weakness  she  can't  help  but  to 
 lose  that  attraction  in  you 
 this  is  the  point  where  you  must
[83:53] continue  being  the  best  man  that  she 
 could  get 
 and  there  is
[83:58] something  we've  got  to  say  here 
 the  sexual  Marketplace  essentially  how
[84:04] we  date  gets  more  and  more  competitive 
 competitive  every  year  you  probably  hear 
 that  like  a  hundred  years  ago  to  attract
[84:10] a  woman  all  you  needed  was  like  an  okay 
 job  a  car  and  if  you  were  like  a  decent
[84:15] man  you'd  be  married  with  Children  these 
 days  it  feels  like  you  need  to  be  six 
 foot  one  with  really  attractive  face  and
[84:20] you  need  to  have  a  good  body  and  you'll 
 also  need  to  make  a  lot  of  money  and  you 
 need  to  have  good  personality  and  you
[84:25] need  to  know  the  tick  tock  dances  and 
 you  need  to  have  the  tick  tock  following 
 and  everything  like  that  you  need  to 
 have  bring  a  lot  to  the  table  and  every
[84:31] year  what's  required  for  you  to  achieve 
 love  from  this  woman  goes  up  and  up  and
[84:36] up 
 the  sexual  Marketplace  is  getting  more 
 and  more  competitive  now  is  not  the  time
[84:42] to  get  complacent  you  must  understand 
 that  if  you  get  into  a  relationship  with 
 this  woman  you  need  to  not  just  stay  the
[84:48] same 
 certainly  not  get  worse  you  need  to  get 
 better  significantly  better  whilst  with
[84:54] her  because  all  the  men 
 are  getting  better
[84:59] you  need  to  see  this  in  your  mind  right 
 now  other  men  are  getting  better  or  the 
 men
[85:05] want  your  woman 
 the  next  time  you  go  to  the  gym  you  can 
 do  this  visualization  a  lot  of  guys
[85:10] won't  because  it's  gross  but  the  next 
 time  you  go  to  the  gym  especially  if  you 
 go  at  peak  times  just  look  around  at
[85:17] some  of  the  masculine  like  attractive 
 hard  looking  guys  there  look  around  at 
 that  massive  bodybuilder  over  there  look
[85:23] at  that  guy  covered  in  tattoos  over 
 there  look  at  that  white  skinhead  over 
 there  look  at  that  black  guy  who  looks 
 quite  fashionable  look  at  that  guy  over
[85:29] there  look  at  that  guy  look  at  that  guy 
 they  would  all  love  to  slam  into  your 
 girl's  [ __ ]
[85:35] and  I  know  this  is  gross  but  I  just 
 sometimes  you  need  like  you  need  to  like 
 hear  this  sometimes  because  you  like  it
[85:41] we  live  in  this  like  safe  modern  world 
 where  we  don't  discuss  this  bro
[85:46] other  men  want  your  woman  other  men  want 
 your  future  wife  of  course  they  do  right 
 if  she's  desirable  of  course  they  do
[85:51] right  and  it's  up  to  her  to  like  you 
 know  like  not  be  receptive  to  them  and 
 stuff  right  but  the  thing  is  other  men
[85:57] are  getting  more  attractive  there  are 
 guys  out  there  who  are  who  are  building 
 more  muscle  who  are  building  more 
 success  who  are  getting  fitter  who  are
[86:04] getting  more  attractive  who  are 
 confident  who  will  look  your  woman  in 
 the  eyes  until  she  looks  away  and
[86:09] slightly  smiles  to  herself  because  he 
 was  kind  of  hot 
 I  know  she  can't  help  but  feel  quite 
 attracted  to  him  because  you've  gained
[86:15] five  percent  body  fat  since  you've  been 
 with  her  these  are  like  these  dark  parts 
 of  like  female  psychology  of  loving  a
[86:21] woman  that  most  people  don't  want  to 
 talk  about  because  it's  gross  to  think 
 this  and  yet  if  you  do  think  that  it's
[86:26] just  every  now  and  then  that  there  are 
 other  guys  out  there  who  would  happily 
 happily  pound  your  woman  and  honestly
[86:35] she'd  be  happy  with  it  too  if  eventually 
 you  guys  broke  up  you  know  she's  gonna 
 get  with  another  guy  eventually
[86:40] it's  worth  just  thinking  okay 
 I'm  not  gonna  let  that  happen
[86:45] [ __ ]  that  guy  over  there  I'm  gonna  keep 
 going  to  the  gym  I'm  Gonna  Keep  lifting 
 really  hard  I'm  gonna  make  sure  my
[86:50] diet's  on  point  I'm  gonna  make  sure  I'm 
 not  just  wasting  away  playing  video 
 games  or  just  relaxing  for  no  reason
[86:56] it's  worth  thinking  this  because  a  lot 
 of  guys  get  complacent  with  their  girl 
 with  this  sense  of  like
[87:02] eternity  yep  she  loves  me  and  things  are 
 going  to  be  the  same  forever 
 no  she  loves  you  right  now  remember
[87:08] those  two  special  words  right  now  the 
 moment  that  she  really  senses  weakness 
 inside  of  you  that  love  starts  to
[87:14] diminish  and  she  it  is  natural  and 
 healthy  for  her  to  start  weighing  up 
 other  options  to  start  grabbing  that
[87:20] other  branch  and  you  don't  want  that  to 
 happen  it's  important  to  keep  this  in 
 mind  that  this  is  part  of  her  female
[87:25] brain 
 and  finally  once  you've  done  all  this
[87:30] once  you've  done  all  of  everything  that 
 we've  talked  about  to  make  her  feel 
 loved
[87:36] it  meant  nothing 
 it  meant  nothing 
 you've  done  all  of  this
[87:42] and  yet  all  of  this 
 was  in  the  past
[87:47] all  of  this  was  in  the  past  all  of  those 
 cute  romantic  gestures  and  how  how
[87:52] masculine  you've  been  is  in  the  past 
 what  happens  and  what  matters  right  now
[87:58] is  right  now  this  moment  this  present 
 moment  this  is  what  men  really  struggle
[88:03] with  and  this  is  why  I  feel  so  hard  to 
 attract  women  what  matters  is  what's
[88:08] happening  right  now  how  she  feels  right 
 now  if  you've  done  all  this  and  you've
[88:13] done  those  cute  romantic  gestures  and 
 you've  been  like  you  know  that  guy  with 
 the  six-pack  to  a  tractor  that  was  in
[88:18] the  past  and  it's  gone  now  what  matters 
 is  how  you  make  her  feel  right  now  this
[88:23] is  a  constant  tussle  a  challenge  of 
 loving  a  feminine  woman  and  it  sounds
[88:28] crazy  it  sounds  horrible  we  don't  want 
 this  like  we  want  something  more  stable 
 we  want  something  with  you  know  more 
 long  term  but  the  thing  is  this  is
[88:35] actually  just  one  it's  the  hand  like  the 
 card  that  we've  been  dealt  but  two  this 
 is  what  we're  attracted  to  we're  not
[88:42] attracted  to  masculine  women  we're  not 
 attracted  to  like  the  independent  woman 
 who's  certain  of  her  career  and
[88:48] everything  we're  attracted  to  this  cute 
 emotional  being  who  needs  this  constant 
 reassurance  right  now  who  values  love
[88:54] and  how  she  feels  right  now  now  above 
 everything  else  and  so  your  track  record 
 does  not  matter  that  is  the  quote  from
[89:00] the  way  of  the  superior  man  your  track 
 record  does  not  matter 
 what  matters  is  how  she  feels  right  now
[89:08] you  don't  need  those  grand  romantic 
 gestures  you  don't  need  that  like  you're 
 the  the  hot  um  air  balloon  where  you
[89:16] propose  or  any  cute  stuff  like  that  you 
 need  those  micro  moments  where  she  feels 
 in  love  with  you  right  now  especially
[89:21] well  with  the  requirements  that  you  are 
 that  top  tier  guy  that  she's  attracted
[89:26] to  if  you  can  maintain  that  and  even 
 grow  it  and  constantly  remind  yourself
[89:31] that  I  need  to  make  her  feel  loved  right 
 now  right  now  right  now  right  now  in
[89:36] every  moment  then  you  will  do  well  with 
 her  this  is  the  great  Challenge  and  it 
 is  extremely  challenging  once  like
[89:42] there'll  be  a  point  I  don't  know  if  I've 
 done  it  for  you  in  this  video  but  there 
 will  be  a  point  where  it'll  really  hit 
 you  and  you'll  think  wow  like  this  is
[89:49] actually  like  tricky  this  is  actually 
 kind  of  difficult  this  is  actually  a 
 constant  hurdle  that  I  need  to  achieve
[89:58] but  it's  worth  it 
 there's  a  woman  outside  little  Asian 
 woman  right  now  like  a  really
[90:03] grandmother  or  something  like  just 
 talking  loudly  on  the  phone  right  behind 
 me
[90:09] this  is  not  the  end 
 this  is  the  beginning
