[00:00] Jeffrey's  brought  her  back  to  his  place 
 but  he  doesn't  know  what  to  do  next 
 instead  of  escalating  and  becoming
[00:05] physical  Jeffrey  just  awkwardly  sits 
 down  next  to  her  so  uh  so  what  kind  of 
 music  do  you  like  how  should  I  go  in  for
[00:11] the  kiss  she  looks  bored  why  does  she 
 keep  checking  her  phone  can  you  relate 
 to  this  situation
[00:17] Adonis  like  a  true  gentleman  Adonis 
 opens  the  door  gets  her  a  drink  and  make
[00:22] sure  she's  comfortable  not  so 
 comfortable  inside  of  Anastasia's  mind 
 and  brain  there's  still  a  little  bit  of
[00:27] nervousness  which  is  always  a  good  sign 
 she's  flooded  with  emotions  which  is
[00:32] exactly  the  way  to  attract  girls 
 when  I  started  growing  up  going  through
[00:37] puberty  and  getting  horny  as  [ __ ]  I 
 started  looking  online  for  advice  on  how 
 to  attract  girls  how  to  flirt  with  girls
[00:43] how  to  text  girls  and  all  of  the  advice 
 that  was  available  was  trash  literally 
 all  of  it  was  trash  you  probably  heard
[00:48] the  exact  same  advice  and  that's  why  you 
 struggled  with  girls  they  told  us  that 
 the  keys  are  flirting  with  girls  was  to
[00:53] take  an  interest  in  them  to  ask  nice 
 questions  about  their  Hobbies  do  you 
 think  that's  what  those  top  tier  guys
[00:58] are  doing  you  see  we  stumbled  down  the 
 wrong  path  when  I  saw  this  advice  I 
 started  texting  girl  so  there's  one
[01:03] particular  girl  I'm  sexing  her  like  so 
 uh  well  what  are  you  doing  today  and  she 
 would  literally  reply  with  one  word  TV
[01:09] you  oh  that's  a  really  good  sign  isn't 
 it  all  these  [ __ ]  telling  me 
 that  that's  a  good  sign  because  you  know 
 if  she's  asked  you a  question  too  so  I
[01:15] was  like  yes  she's  asked  me  a  question 
 okay  I  took  a  lot  of  interest  in  her  do 
 you  think  I  got  her  obviously  not  you
[01:20] see  there's  a  lot  of  undesirable  guys 
 low  tier  guys  who  take  in  interesting 
 girls  who  ask  them  nice  questions  and
[01:26] they  don't  get  the  girl  do  they  that's  a 
 normal  experience  you've  seen  everywhere 
 you've  probably  been  through  this 
 yourself  you've  taken  an  interest  in  a
[01:32] girl  you've  asked  her  about  her  hobbies 
 and  you  still  didn't  get  her  so  clearly 
 that  advice  did  not  work  for  us  it's  not 
 going  to  work  for  us  because  it's  silly
[01:37] advice  and  it's  not  even  attractive 
 there  is  one  key  that  I've  found  that  no 
 one  has  really  explained  in  a  nice  way
[01:42] and  honestly  like  I'm  a  little  bit 
 hesitant  telling  you  because  this  is 
 literally  a  superpower  once  I've 
 explained  this  it's  like  you'll  be  as
[01:47] good  as  getting  girls  as  I  am  and  I'm 
 not  sure  if  we  should  share  the 
 superpowers  let's  keep  it  between 
 yourself  don't  share  this  video  but  make
[01:53] sure  you  watch  all  of  it  so  I  still  get 
 the  YouTube  retention 
 listen  closely  and  make  sure  you  stay 
 around  to  let  me  fully  explain  this  the
[01:59] key  to  flirting  with  girls  it's  not  to 
 ask  them  questions  not  to  ask  them  about 
 their  Hobbies  or  anything  like  this  it
[02:05] is  to  spike  all  of  their  emotions 
 imagine  as  a  man  we  have  like  seven
[02:11] emotions  there's  a  limited  spectrum  of 
 emotions  I  can't  it's  taken  me  a  while 
 to  even  listen  right  but  there's 
 probably  like  seven  and  footmen  right
[02:16] for  women  guess  how  many  there  are  guess 
 how  many  emotions  that  women  can  be  in 
 not  seven  not  ten  not  7c  not  25  but  bro
[02:23] hundreds  you  ever  see  like  those  color 
 palettes  where  there's  like  the  basic 
 colors  it's  probably  like  seven  ten
[02:28] basic  colors  but  then  there's  like  the 
 other  different  shades  it's  like 
 hundreds  of  shades  of  colors  and  that  is
[02:33] like  women's  emotions  and  guess  what  the 
 more  of  those  that  you  spike  the  more 
 that  she  will  be  attracted  to  you  it's
[02:38] as  simple  as  this  most  guys  don't 
 realize  this  like  this  is  so  [ __ ] 
 good  advice  just  trust  me  again  most 
 guys  make  this  mistake  that  you've  done
[02:44] so  many  times  you  think  that  the  way  to 
 attract  a  girl  is  that  just  Spike  one  or 
 two  emotions  of  her  which  is  like  love
[02:50] and  interest  and  it  doesn't  work  does  it 
 it  never  works  and  what's  so  interesting 
 you've  always  heard  of  the  stories  where
[02:55] the  girl  is  getting  around  by  the  guy 
 who's  an  [ __ ]  who  sometimes  stands 
 her  up  who  sometimes  like  whoa  this  like
[03:00] scares  her  and  [ __ ]  you've  always  heard 
 those  stories  why  because  that  guy  is 
 hitting  as  many  emotions  as  possible  you
[03:06] really  want  to  attract  this  girl  that 
 you're  currently  speaking  to  Bro 
 disappear  disappear  for  24  hours  and 
 that'll  be  a  different  emotion  that
[03:11] you've  not  spiked  yet  give  it  like  a 
 slight  roast  don't  don't  be  mean  but 
 roasts  are  about  something  that's  a
[03:16] different  emotion  you've  never  spiked 
 yet  all  of  the  soft  guys  who  don't  even 
 get  girls  will  disagree  with  us  but  they 
 don't  get  girls  who  can't  trust  them
[03:21] anyway  the  guys  who  get  girls  do  you 
 really  think  that  all  they're  doing  is 
 just  being  nice  to  the  girl  just  being
[03:26] nice  to  the  girl  doing  everything  that 
 she  wants  obviously  not  what  these  top 
 tier  guys  are  doing  who  find  it  easy  to 
 get  girls  they're  literally  just  living
[03:31] their  normal  life  you  know  they've  got 
 goals  and  missions  that  they're  working 
 on  and  by  nature  of  actually  being  busy
[03:36] as  a  man  as  a  disciplined  man  sometimes 
 they're  ignoring  her  they  don't  really 
 mean  to  but  sometimes  you  just  don't
[03:41] reply  to  your  phone  like  for  a  couple  of 
 hours  if  you're  busy  if  you're  like  a 
 little  spurg  and  you're  on  your  phone 
 every  hour  of  the  day  then  obviously
[03:46] you're  not  going  to  be  spiking  maneuver 
 emotions  and  that's  why  you're 
 struggling  I  will  say  this  again  so  that 
 you  truly  understand  the  most  common
[03:52] mistake  that  most  guys  make  is  that  they 
 only  think  about  spiking  the  pause 
 positive  happy  loving  emotion  in  a  woman
[03:58] whereas  the  guys  who  actually  get  the 
 girl  spike  a  variety  of  them  Yo  with 
 your  girl  when  was  the  last  time  that
[04:03] you  ever  like  like  you  ever  did  some 
 weird  [ __ ]  like  this  one  the  last  time 
 that  you  wrestled  her  and  actually
[04:08] physically  hurt  her  like  a  little  bit 
 and  I'm  not  talking  about  abuse  or 
 something  but  you  know  you  play  fire 
 then  she  ends  up  crying  because  you  just
[04:13] hit  her  too  hard  or  something  or  she's 
 oh  when  was  the  last  time  they  scared 
 when  was  the  last  time  that  you  made  her
[04:18] laugh  so  much  that  she's  literally  like 
 she  can't  like  you  know  she's  laughing 
 like  a  little  girl  when  was  the  last 
 time  that  you  did  something  so  silly  so
[04:23] weird  like  you  put  a  pistachio  in  her 
 belly  button  when  you  don't  do  these 
 things  you  are  this  one-dimensional  beta
[04:29] male  that  cannot  be  attractive  because 
 for  women  there's  no  such  thing  as  you 
 know  a  happy  loving  connection  women  are
[04:35] in  love  and  so  devoted  with  the  guy  that 
 is  in  her  mind  and  her  heart  that's  true
[04:40] you  know  that  right  not  so  much  that  the 
 guy  who's  the  most  positive  person  in 
 the  world  and  he's  just  compliments  her
[04:45] all  the  time  but  the  guy  who's  always  in 
 her  mind  so  think  about  this  right  now 
 what  could  you  do  to  be  in  her  mind  and
[04:50] heart  more  do  you  think  being  a 
 one-dimensional  Jeffrey's  gonna  help  you 
 with  this  just  message  her  the  same
[04:55] thing's  always  on  always  oh  you  know  oh 
 you're  really  interesting  what  are  you 
 doing  today  oh  I'm  taking  an  interest  on 
 your  hobbies  you're  really  cool  pretty
[05:00] like  just  positive  positive  positive 
 positive  compliments  boom  you  think 
 that's  exciting  you  think  she's  in  her
[05:05] mind  right  now  thinking  oh  my  God  yes 
 yes  he  just  gave  me  another  compliment 
 no  if  that's  all  you  are  which  most  guys
[05:11] are  most  guys  are  just  this  awkward  shy 
 timid  guy  who's  gonna  try  and  be  nice  to 
 try  and  give  her  a  compliment  I'm  not
[05:16] saying  to  be  an  [ __ ]  to  girls  but  I'm 
 giving  you  permission  to  not  always  be 
 like  that  positive  guy  who's  just  given
[05:22] a  compliment  it's  okay  sometimes  to  not 
 reply  to  a  message  fast  because  you're 
 busy  don't  be  a  little  spoke  don't  be
[05:27] sat  there  like  a  Jeffrey  on  your  phone 
 seeing  the  text  message  and  not  replying 
 because  yeah  yeah  because  the  red  pill 
 the  red  pill  YouTubers  told  me  not  to
[05:33] reply  so  I  won't  that's  cringe  anyone 
 who  desires  [ __ ]  cringe  when  you're 
 on  your  phone  you  can  reply  to  people  so 
 every  time  I'm  on  my  phone  there's  a
[05:39] list  of  people  to  reply  I'm  not  trying 
 to  sound  like  a  popular  [ __ ]  or 
 anything  maybe  I'll  choose  like  five  of 
 them  when  I'm  having  a  [ __ ]  and  I'll
[05:44] reply  every  time  right  but  that  being 
 said  I'm  not  on  my  phone  that  much  maybe 
 10  times  for  the  entire  day  maybe  20
[05:49] times  and  that's  still  quite  like  a  low 
 amount  for  most  guys  because  you  need 
 something  else  to  do  the  reason  why  you
[05:54] are  stuck  in  this  one-dimensional 
 Jeffrey  you  know  struggling  to  attract 
 this  girl  and  you're  trying  to  just 
 Spike  her  positive  emotion  because
[05:59] you've  got  nothing  else  to  do  how  can 
 you  disappear  and  leave  her  wondering 
 what  you're  doing  when  you're  always
[06:04] there  how  can  you  make  her  jealous  even 
 though  those  aren't  positive  emotions 
 and  every  Jeffrey  and  Jessica  will
[06:09] disagree  but  they're  not  trying  to  help 
 you  anyway  how  can  you  make  her  slightly 
 anxious  when  you  don't  even  get  other 
 girls  she  knows  for  a  fact  that  she's
[06:15] probably  the  only  girl  that's  interested 
 in  you  and  even  that  she's  almost  given 
 you  like  a  Pity  interest  of  like  some 
 cost  fallacy  like  oh  yeah  we've  already
[06:21] spoiled  for  a  bit  so  maybe  I'll  keep  the 
 beginning  how  can  she  feel  literal 
 sexual  desire  to  want  to  [ __ ]  you  when
[06:26] you  don't  have  a  six-pack  honestly  this 
 is  when  your  cope  will  start  if  you  have 
 a  predominant  Jeffrey  Brave  you  will
[06:32] start  coping  now  and  think  oh  yeah  this 
 video  is  [ __ ]  anyway  he's  wrong  why 
 would  you  want  to  make  a  woman  anxious
[06:37] compliments  yeah  the  six-pack  doesn't 
 matter  because  women  like  that  if  you're 
 coping  right  now  in  your  own  mind  bro
[06:42] you  know  you're  not  gonna  make  it  I'm 
 not  trying  to  be  horrible  or  anything 
 but  like  we  know  you're  not  gonna  make 
 it  but  you  may  have  the  Adonis  part  of
[06:48] your  brain  that's  lighting  up  that's 
 taking  some  accounts  of  your  failures 
 and  thinking  you  know  what  yeah  this 
 this  makes  sense  because  the  guy  who
[06:54] gets  the  girl  is  always  among 
 multi-dimensional  being  she  really 
 really  likes  him  she  lusts  after  him  she
[07:00] also  really  upset  by  this  other  thing 
 that  he  does  she  also  feels  a  bit 
 jealous  that's  the  guy  in  her  mind  and
[07:05] you  see  that  and  you  think  okay  well  you 
 know  what  that's  not  me  right  now  really 
 ask  yourself  don't  pick  yourself  up 
 falsely  why  would  you  be  in  a  girl's
[07:11] Mind  through  the  day  you  want  to  know 
 truthfully  the  best  way  to  be  in  her 
 mind  even  though  this  is  seen  as  toxic 
 but  this  is  the  real  natural  way  of
[07:17] things  because  she  knows  that  if  you  are 
 the  level  of  man  that  as  soon  as  you 
 walk  through  the  door  you  could  end  up 
 [ __ ]  a  girl  most  guys  can't  even
[07:22] believe  that  this  is  a  concept  of  like 
 no  no  one's  like  that  you  couldn't  do  no 
 no  the  guys  who  are  either  at  the  top  or
[07:28] going  there  know  that  this  is  just  a 
 normal  part  of  life  like  once  you  get  to 
 a  certain  level  of  man  you  literally 
 make  your  woman  anxious  by  just  leaving
[07:34] the  house  not  even  being  a  dog  not  even 
 cheating  like  she  finds  it  hard  to 
 believe  that  over  a  couple  of  weeks  you
[07:39] wouldn't  accidentally  [ __ ]  a  girl  as  you 
 just  go  to  the  gym  because  you  know 
 you'll  see  a  girl  on  the  way  there  or
[07:44] something  if  you're  that  level  of  guy 
 girls  find  that  difficult  I'm  a  woman 
 and  I'm  not  emotional  you're  a  woman  and
[07:49] you're  not  emotional  but  there's 
 feminine  masculine  energy  we  know  which 
 one  that  you  have  because  feminine  women 
 are  naturally  and  almost  holy  emotional
[07:55] of  course  they  are  that's  not  a  bad 
 thing  the  whole  point  of  a  feminine 
 woman's  emotions  is  for  us  as  a 
 masculine  man  to  tame  that  to  create
[08:01] order  inside  of  the  chaos  and  you  might 
 right  now  be  thinking  well  you  know  this 
 this  sounds  silly  anyway  because  they're 
 spiking  her  all  her  emotions  like  I
[08:06] don't  want  to  be  with  an  emotional  girl 
 I  want  to  be  with  a  girl  who's  really 
 sensible  and  works  hard  and  she's 
 disciplined  and  she's  got  goals  and
[08:12] she's  masculine  which  then  means  that 
 I'm  feminine  because  if  she's  masculine 
 you've  got  to  be  feminine  and  that  that
[08:17] can  be  okay 
 sometimes  maybe  the  truth  is  from  my 
 understanding  if  you  don't  want  a
[08:23] feminine  woman  who  has  these  normal  like 
 female  emotions  which  are  very  chaotic 
 compared  to  a  man's  you  might  be  a  lot
[08:29] more  feminine  than  you  think  because 
 I've  realized  that  the  more  masculine 
 you  become  the  more  ordered  and
[08:34] disciplined  you  become  you  just  you 
 shrug  your  shoulders  and  like  if  someone 
 asks  me  like  why  do  you  date  a  woman 
 who's  emotional  I  would  answer  like  why
[08:40] wouldn't  you  I  want  her  because  that's 
 the  whole  point  like  I'm  not  that 
 emotional  anymore  as  I've  become  more 
 masculine  what  else  I  like  that  she's
[08:46] got  a  whole  Spectrum  whole  color  palette 
 of  emotions  because  it's  fun  for  me  it's 
 like  yeah  sweet  that's  my  mission  like
[08:51] with  my  time  with  her  that's  my  mission 
 that's  like  let's  engage  some  of  these 
 emotions  today  let's  think  which  one  she 
 needs  today  okay  she  needs  a  bit  of
[08:57] excitement  maybe  she  needs  like  a  little 
 bit  of  a  scare  because  she's  been 
 getting  comfortable  so  I'll  just  stand 
 in  the  wardrobe
[09:02] does  that  does  that  make  sense  because 
 or  am  I  weird  for  that  no  that's  no  I'm 
 not  weird  you  the  other  people  are  bro  I
[09:08] fear  that  even  whilst  you've  watched 
 like  12  minutes  of  this  video  you  have 
 this  deep  rooted  conditioning  propaganda
[09:14] brainwashing  from  the  normal  society 
 around  us  has  conditioned  you  to  fear  a
[09:19] woman's  emotions  they've  conditioned 
 women  to  think  that  their  emotions  are  a 
 bad  thing  a  lot  of  women  these  days  are
[09:24] literally  giving  up  their  emotions  and 
 thinking  like  nah  like  I  don't  want  to 
 be  emotional  I  don't  cry  or  anything  but 
 that  scene  is  a  bad  thing  a  woman  being
[09:29] feminine  like  being  feminine  naturally 
 means  you  have  to  be  emotional  that's 
 two  and  two  together  women  are  literally
[09:35] abandoning  their  femininity  because  of 
 feminism  and  because  of  that  women  are 
 less  feminine  they've  had  to  get  into
[09:40] the  workplace  so  now  they've  got  to 
 develop  some  of  their  masculine  energy 
 and  so  when  women  become  more  masculine 
 men  become  more  feminine  and  I  think
[09:46] this  mess  up  of  our  sexual  energies  is 
 what's  causing  the  need  for  you  to  even
[09:51] watch  this  video  50  years  ago  you 
 wouldn't  have  needed  advice  like  this  we 
 wouldn't  have  even  been  speaking  about
[09:56] this  kind  of  topic  or  how  to  get  girls 
 because  it  would  have  been  simple  work 
 hard  get  a  good  job  be  a  masculine
[10:01] gentleman  it  was  literally  a  as  simple 
 as  that  and  the  complication  has  come 
 from  like  these  modern  movements  that
[10:07] have  destroyed  our  ability  to  even  make 
 relationships  through  this  video  there's 
 been  so  many  like  trigger  points  for
[10:12] like  the  modern  person  the  Modern  Woman 
 the  modern  man  to  think  like  nah  this 
 guy  in  the  bathrobe  is  wrong  now  I'm  a
[10:18] woman  I'm  not  emotional  not  I'm  a  man 
 and  I  don't  want  an  emotional  woman  if 
 you  really  want  to  find  out  what  kind  of 
 man  you  are  whether  you're  feminine  or
[10:24] masculine  just  analyze  your  thoughts 
 over  this  video  because  if  you  are  more 
 on  the  feminine  side  and  you've  been 
 watching  all  this  just  wanting  to  give
[10:30] up  and  thinking  like  no  this  is  all 
 pointless  I  don't  want  to  do  this  anyway 
 it's  not  going  to  be  going  to  work  and 
 like  now  a  woman  like  that  I  don't  even
[10:35] want  to  work  in  a  like  that  I  just  want 
 a  girl  who  likes  me  for  me  you're  not 
 supposed  to  be  feminine  I  don't  know  if 
 this  is  like  a  big  [ __ ]  controversial
[10:40] statement  but  as  a  man  you're  not 
 supposed  to  be  feminine  there's 
 countries  in  the  world  where  men  aren't 
 feminine  and  those  countries  are
[10:45] developing  at  a  very  fast  rate  you  are 
 not  supposed  to  be  feminine  and  now  if 
 you're  interested  in  this  topic  and  you
[10:50] really  want  to  go  face  your  real  energy 
 and  you  want  to  develop  that  core 
 masculine  energy  inside  of  you  you  want
[10:55] to  be  the  man  you  want  to  learn  how  to 
 dominate  women  click  and  watch  this  full 
 masculinity  guide  right  now  do  the  hard
[11:01] work  especially  when  you  don't  feel  like
