[00:00] jeffrey  wants  love  sex  and  intimacy  he 
 wants  status  and  achievement  and 
 brotherhood  do  you  think  jeffrey  goes
[00:06] out  there  and  builds  himself  up  as  a  man 
 to  acquire  these  things  or  do  you  think 
 jeffrey's  like  most  modern  young  men
[00:12] who'll  take  the  easy  path  porn  and  video 
 games  it's  no  wonder  why  jeffrey  feels 
 so  empty  so  unfulfilled  and  uncertain
[00:19] with  himself  why  he  has  no  confidence 
 just  look  at  his  habits  worst  of  all  he 
 isn't  even  aware  of  his  weaknesses
[00:26] adonis 
 adonis  wants  love  sex  and  intimacy  he
[00:31] wants  status  and  achievement  and 
 brotherhood  but  adonis  is  different  to 
 jeffrey  because  he  is  the  kind  of  man
[00:36] who  goes  out  there  and  acquires  these 
 things  in  the  real  world  we  see  adonis 
 hunt  we  see  him  train  we  see  him  feast
[00:43] he  works  hard  especially  when  he  doesn't 
 feel  like  it  and  that  is  exactly  why 
 adonis  has  built  up  such  a  good  life
[00:50] aren't  you  tired  of  living  life  like 
 jeffrey  you  see  you  have  this  huge 
 weakness  inside  of  you  you  have  the
[00:55] desire  of  these  healthy  needs  like  to  be 
 socially  included  amongst  your  peers  to 
 level  up  in  your  tribe  to  get  a
[01:01] girlfriend  experience  love  but  the 
 modern  world  is  riddled  with  traps  and
[01:06] the  biggest  issue  is  that  the  modern 
 world  will  serve  you  a  fake  version  of 
 the  thing  that  you  actually  wanted  you
[01:11] wanted  love  they'll  give  you  porn  you 
 wanted  brotherhood  they'll  give  you  call
[01:16] of  duty  or  whatever  [ __ ]  video  games 
 people  play  these  days  and  most  young 
 men  are  totally  content  living  like  this
[01:21] they  have  their  needs  fulfilled  in  the 
 modern  day  they  jack  off  multiple  times 
 they  wake  up  jack  off  before  they  go  to
[01:26] school  or  to  work  sometimes  some  of 
 these  creepy  [ __ ]  start  jacking 
 off  inside  of  school  and  work  in  class
[01:32] how  [ __ ]  is  that  like  i've  just 
 thought  about  my  time  in  high  school  it 
 was  totally  normal  for  all  of  the  boys
[01:38] to  watch  porn  and  jackoff  and  worst  of 
 all  we  were  told  by  like  the  elders  like
[01:43] the  teachers  and  this  common  narrative 
 like  this  weak  little  jeffrey  modern 
 media  narrative  that  porn  and
[01:48] masturbation  is  good  for  you  why  were  we 
 told  that  masturbating  would  be  good  for 
 us  you've  been  raised  all  of  your  life
[01:54] to  be  weak  chances  are  you  haven't  had  a 
 strong  father  figure  who's  made  you  more 
 masculine  who  put  you  through  trials  and
[01:59] tribulations  you  haven't  had  a  right  of 
 passage  that's  actually  made  you  into  a 
 man  you're  a  soft  little  boy  in  between
[02:05] the  stage  of  actual  boyhood  and  manhood 
 so  what  are  you
[02:10] we're  weak  but  we  don't  want  to  be 
 anymore  you  watch  videos  like  this  you 
 know  you  are  tears  above  like  we're  not
[02:16] supposed  to  say  this  thing  we're 
 supposed  to  compare  against  others  but 
 you  kind  of  know  your  tears  ahead  of
[02:21] everyone  else  who's  content  living  their 
 life  like  a  jeffree  but  if  you  don't 
 stay  consistent  on  self-improvement
[02:27] self-improvement  is  when  you  start  to  do 
 those  good  habits  that  you  always  hear 
 about  like  going  to  the  gym  consistently
[02:32] or  reading  good  books  or  meditating  and 
 journaling  or  being  productive  and  doing 
 your  schoolwork  or  your  business  work  or
[02:37] leveling  up  in  a  career  holistic 
 self-improvement  is  when  you  do  all  of 
 those  things  to  try  and  become  more  like
[02:42] adonis  the  ultimate  man  if  you  take  this 
 pathway  and  you  overcome  this  weakness 
 that  inflicts  most  young  men  the  future
[02:48] for  you  is  very  very  bright  you'll  stand 
 out  you'll  become  strong  you'll  become 
 successful  you'll  be  strong  and
[02:53] confident  attracting  more  women  than 
 ever  you'll  go  through  your  20s  with  a 
 sense  of  pride  that  you're  actually
[02:58] doing  the  right  things  whilst  you  see 
 everyone  else  playing  video  games 
 jacking  off  scrolling  on  social  media
[03:03] endlessly  just  looking  at  girls  it'll  be 
 slow  at  first  but  soon  you  will  realize
[03:08] that  there's  quite  a  big  gap  between  you 
 and  the  jefferies  of  the  world  you're 
 feeling  good  productive  successful  life
[03:13] is  going  so  well  and  the  ultimate  vision 
 of  this  why  are  we  doing  all  of  this 
 hard  work  because  there's  gonna  be  a
[03:18] time  when  you  have  children  and  to  be 
 the  kind  of  father  that  you  want  to  be 
 to  be  the  kind  of  father  that  your  child
[03:24] your  son  your  daughter  needs  you're 
 gonna  need  to  do  these  things  you  will 
 not  allow  yourself  to  be  another  sad
[03:29] pathetic  low  value  father  an  absent 
 father  an  abusive  father  this  is  why  now
[03:35] whilst  we're  young  we  focus  on  things 
 like  mental  health  so  that  when  we 
 eventually  have  children  we  won't  pass 
 on  like  family  traumas  to  them  we  won't
[03:41] abuse  them  we  won't  shower  them  we  won't 
 scream  at  them  this  is  why  we  start 
 being  productive  now  so  that  our 
 finances  can  be  set  up  your  future  son
[03:48] is  hoping  that  you  give  up  this  weakness 
 the  weakness  is  over  indulging  in  the 
 modern  technological  version  of  the
[03:53] thing  that  fulfills  our  need  porn  over 
 love  video  games  over  brotherhood  it's  a
[03:58] very  good  life  when  you  go  down  this 
 path  but  what  if  you  don't 
 what  if  you're  watching  this  video  right
[04:03] now  and  you're  uncertain  about  getting 
 into  self-improvement  and  you're  fine 
 skipping  a  few  days  from  the  gym  because
[04:08] it  doesn't  really  matter  and 
 meditation's  kind  of  too  weird  it 
 doesn't  work  for  me  and  journaling  is 
 kind  of  gay  i  don't  want  to  write  in  a
[04:14] diary 
 what  if  you  refuse  to  do  the  good  habits
[04:20] i  could  make  this  like  a  nice  soft  video 
 that  you're  used  to  where  it's  like  oh 
 you  know  everyone's  perfect  bro  [ __ ] 
 that  if  you  refuse  to  do  the  good  habits
[04:26] if  you  over  indulge  in  the  bad  if  you 
 continue  playing  video  games  taking 
 drugs  eating  junk  food  scrolling  on 
 social  media  just  looking  at  underage
[04:32] girls  shaking  ass  on  tick  tock  instagram 
 you  will  end  up  just  like  these  jeffries
[04:38] you'll  become  one  of  those  like  weak 
 empty  shallow  flabby  like  hairy  stomach 
 kind  of  men  and  you'll  pass  that  on  to
[04:44] your  children 
 maybe  your  son  will  be  the  one  who 
 changes  it  then  maybe  your  son  will  grow
[04:49] up  and  say  you  know  what  i  don't  want  to 
 end  up  like  my  father  hopefully  he  won't 
 say  that  hopefully  you  are  the  one  who
[04:55] changes  things  for  your  bloodline  what 
 you  see  before  you  is  not  a  usual 
 youtube  channel  everyone  else  is  way  too
[05:01] [ __ ]  soft  on  men  telling  them  that 
 it's  okay  to  be  weak  it's  okay  to  be 
 feminine  it's  okay  to  like  display 
 emotions  and  be  a little  [ __ ]  is  it
[05:07] [ __ ]  what  you  see  in  front  of  you  is  a 
 cult  you  know  like  those  cults  that 
 you've  heard  about  which  they're  all 
 they're  weird  and  they're  they're
[05:12] strange  they're  doing  things  which  is 
 uncommon  and  controversial
[05:17] that's  what  you  see  in  front  of  you  you 
 see  a  cult  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
 young  men  who  refuse  to  live  like  the  99
[05:23] percenters  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
 young  men  who  refuse  to  jack  off  six 
 times  a  day  castrating  ourselves
[05:31] what  you  see  is  a  cult  of  men  who  hope 
 for  better
