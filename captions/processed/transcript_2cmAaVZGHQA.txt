[00:00] jeffrey  is  a  normal  guy  he  spends  most 
 of  his  time  on  the  internet  playing 
 video  games
[00:05] jacking  off  and  watching 
 self-improvement  videos  he  doesn't 
 understand  why  he  can't  take  action
[00:10] why  he  can  only  seem  to  do  things  that 
 give  instant  pleasure  adonis 
 adonis  delays  gratification  he  doesn't
[00:16] indulge  in  the  bad  habits  of  normal 
 people 
 and  because  of  that  he's  able  to  achieve 
 his  wildest  goals
[00:22] like  growing  a  business  or  building  his 
 dream  body
[00:30] [Music]
[00:42] so 
 those  [ __ ]  light  gains  boys  holy  [ __ ]
[00:50] oh  my  god 
 legs  really  really  grew  on  this  bulk  god
[00:56] damn
[01:01] last  year  everyone  on  youtube  was  making 
 videos  on  how  to  reset  your  mind  in  24
[01:06] hours 
 i  took  it  one  step  further  than  that 
 when  i  tell  you  the  benefits  that  i've 
 experienced  on  this  one  year  dopamine
[01:12] detox 
 i  think  you'll  want  to  join  me  first  of 
 all  my  name  is  hamza  and  i  help  young 
 men  go  through  the  jeffrey  to  adonis
[01:17] transformation  through  self-improvement 
 you're  clearly  interested  in  that  so  if 
 you  scroll  down  right  now  click  on  the
[01:22] subscribe  button  then  it's  a  win-win  for 
 both  of  us  i'm  going  to  tell  you  about 
 my  story 
 in  may  2020  i  first  learned  about
[01:28] dopamine  detoxing  from  all  the  viral 
 videos  that  were  going  on 
 and  i  had  the  brilliant  idea  to  do  two
[01:34] weeks  of  going 
 all  out  on  the  bad  habits  before  i  first 
 would  try  the  dopamine  detox
[01:40] so  two  weeks  100  bad  habits 
 i  had  a  binge  eating  disorder  so  you  can
[01:45] see  that  that  that  mentality  came  into 
 all  other  parts  of  my  life  and  by  the 
 way  this  video  is  going  to  be  pretty
[01:50] unfiltered  so  you 
 might  not  want  to  watch  it  next  to  your 
 parents  for  two  weeks  i  would  wake  up 
 and  immediately  start  smoking  the  crack
[01:56] pipe 
 i'd  eat  some  dirty  ass  food 
 jack  off  probably  like  three  to
[02:03] four  to  five  times  and  spend  the  entire 
 day  on  the  internet 
 so  i'd  wake  up  first  go  on  to  reddit
[02:09] whilst  i  was  having  my  morning  poop  stop 
 smoking  weed 
 go  on  to  my  computer  play  some  video
[02:14] games  watch 
 boring  ass  netflix  shows  and  movies  just 
 bingey  and  constantly  literally  just
[02:20] eating  snacks  through  everything 
 i  was  doing  no  structure  to  my  diet 
 maybe  i  exercised
[02:25] three  times  in  the  two  weeks  eventually 
 i  started  drinking  alcohol  in  the 
 apartment  and
[02:30] i'll  be  honest  to  you  i  got  really  dirty 
 i  started  a  couple  of  days  taking 
 mdmhs  sat  there  literally  just
[02:38] sat  there  in  the  apartment  i  turned  into 
 a  crackhead  so  you  can  probably  see  that 
 i  was  the  perfect  candidate  for  a
[02:43] dopamine  detox 
 and  finally  by  evening  slash  night  time 
 i  would  wind  down  by  just  going  on  my
[02:48] computer  going  onto  4chan  looking  at 
 some  messed  up  posts 
 jacking  off  more  sometimes  i  stay  up  to
[02:53] like  3  4  a.m  just  smoking  weed  up  until 
 i  pass  out 
 and  probably  the  worst  time  of  my  life 
 to  be  honest  and  it  was  it  was  odd
[02:59] to  do  all  this  whilst 
 i  try  not  to  think  about  that  part  of  my
[03:06] life 
 these  days  because  it  just  makes  me  like 
 i'm  grateful  for  it  you  know  i'm 
 grateful  for  the  progress  that  i've  made 
 but  when  i  do  think  about  it
[03:12] it  makes  me  a  bit  fearful  to  think  that 
 i  could  sink  back  into  that  type  of 
 lifestyle  so  i  hated  my  life
[03:18] i  used  to  cry  a  lot  maybe  after  every 
 day  or  every  two  days 
 i'd  be  crying  i'd  burst  into  tears  i  was
[03:24] living  with  my  girlfriend  at  the  time 
 and  so  she'd  be  like  comforting  me  but 
 you  boys  know  how  that  goes  when
[03:29] if  you  break  down  emotionally  like  that 
 like  it's  done  for  you 
 and  although  i  somewhat  broke  up  with
[03:35] her  eventually  when  i  went  on  to  the 
 dopamine  detox  like  there  was  no 
 attraction  left  from  her  anyway  i  used
[03:40] to  journal  a  lot 
 at  this  point  i  had  relatively  found 
 self-improvement  and  i  was  trying  to  do
[03:45] the  stuff 
 i  just  wasn't  able  to  do  it  consistently 
 so  i  had  already  been  working  out  for
[03:50] years  before  this  in  terms  of  going  to 
 the  gym  building  the  body 
 god  damn  but  in  terms  like  meditation
[03:56] journaling  that's 
 all  the  good  habits  the  reading  and 
 stopping  internet  stuff  in  fact
[04:01] it  was  it  was  a  bit  of  a  struggle  for  me 
 especially  quitting  smoking  as  well  i 
 wanted  to  quit  smoking
[04:06] a  year  before  this  and  every  single  day 
 i'd  go  back  to  go  back  to  the  old  weed
[04:11] and 
 it  was  a  true  addiction  now  when  it's 
 kind  of  a  side  note  but  when  people  say 
 that  oh  you  know  weeds  not  a  problem
[04:16] weed's  actually  good  for  you  you  can't 
 get  addicted  to  weed 
 bro  i  want  us  i  want  to  what's  up
[04:22] downwards 
 elbow  that  i've  been  learning  in 
 kickboxing  i  want  to hit  him  with  one  of 
 these  but 
 it's  not  not  bad  for  you  shut  up  bro
[04:28] you're  clearly  not  smoking  like  i  was 
 so  all  around  before  i  got  into  the 
 dopamine  detox  i  had  this
[04:34] horrible  stuck  feeling  in  life  that 
 i  wanted  to  change  i  knew  what  actions
[04:39] would  help  me 
 i  just  wasn't  doing  them  because  they 
 were  just  too  hard  because  they  weren't
[04:44] giving  me 
 instant  gratification  and  instant 
 gratification
[04:49] delayed  gratification  those  are  two  very 
 very  important  phrases  that  are  going  to 
 change  your  life
[04:54] and  i'll  teach  you  all  about  them  in  the 
 later  parts  of  this  video  so  what  did  i 
 do 
 i  learned  about  dopamine  detoxing  i  knew
[04:59] that  this  was  the  thing  that  was  going 
 to  change  it  all  for  me  and  i  made  a 
 very  drastic  decision  to
[05:04] move  out  of  the  city  apartment  that  i 
 was  living  in  to  move  back  home 
 to  my  my  family's  house  i  live  with  my
[05:09] family  so  i  can't  smoke  weed  i  can't  do 
 any  like  drugs  or  anything  here  i'm  just 
 gonna  do  you  know  i  could  still
[05:14] be  spending  time  like  my  computer's 
 right  here  i've  got  my  own  room 
 obviously  and  so  i  could  still  be 
 spending  time  doing  the  bad  habits
[05:20] but  this  was  like  the  new  chapter  of  my 
 life 
 in  the  book  deep  work  by  cal  newport  he
[05:27] gives  this  phrase  of 
 the  grand  gesture  when  you  really  want 
 to  take  something  serious  you  do  a  grand 
 gesture
[05:32] and  this  was  mine  this  was  my  grand 
 gesture  i  said  i'm  tired  of  this  life 
 i'm  tired  of  smoking  weed  i'm  literally
[05:37] gonna  move  back  to  my  mummy 
 because  i  know  that  she's  not  gonna  let 
 me  smoke  weed  anymore  so  i'll  get  back
[05:42] here  and  i  instantly  get  onto  the 
 dopamine  detox  now  before  i  tell  you 
 about  the  rules  that  i  have  personally
[05:47] set  myself  which  have  helped  me  get  to 
 this  point  where  i'm  a  year  in  i'm  not 
 doing
[05:52] some  24  hour  challenge  or  a  week 
 challenge  to  you  know  do  the  youtube 
 video 
 this  was  for  a  life  change  like  i  am
[05:57] never  going  back  to  normal  life 
 if  you  adopt  the  same  rules  that  i'm 
 about  to  tell  you
[06:02] you  will  become  different  for  life  you 
 will  never  want  to  go  back  to  being  like
[06:07] a  normal  person  it 
 it  sickens  me  to  think  of  life  like  that 
 again  but  before  i  tell  you  the  rules
[06:13] the  why  is  more  important  the  why 
 is  always  far  far  more  important  than
[06:19] the  what  or  the  how  and  you  must 
 understand  the  why 
 why  did  i  want  to  do  this  why  should  you 
 consider  a  dopamine  detox
[06:25] my  why  was  because  i  wanted  to  like 
 myself  again 
 in  this  modern  world  literally  no  one
[06:31] has  self  love  anymore  and  i  certainly 
 didn't  have  it  i  didn't  like  myself  i 
 thought  i  was  a  piece  of 
 and  i  actually  i  spent  some  time  to  to
[06:38] think  okay 
 what  exactly  is  self-love  now  of  course 
 i  did  the  youtube  search  and  it  was  a 
 lot  of  these  like
[06:43] maybe  sexist  but  you  know  like  feminine 
 videos  of  just  the  girls  saying  like  i 
 do  some  online  shopping  go  have  a  bath
[06:48] with  a  bath  bomb  like 
 is  that  gonna  help  me  [ __ ]  so  i  spend  a
[06:53] large  amount  of  time  journaling  and 
 really  thinking  okay  what  is  self-love 
 how  what  is  a  practical
[06:58] somewhat  masculine  way  that  i  can 
 generate  self-love 
 no  no  [ __ ]  no  wishy-washy  stuff  what
[07:04] is  practical  what  are  the  steps 
 to  form  self-love  like  i  could  be 
 selling  this  right  now  i  could  get  this
[07:09] viral  and  this  this  would  make  me  famous 
 there  is  practical  steps  to  self-love 
 and  it  is  to  do  things
[07:15] for  your  future  self  that's  the  only 
 thing  you  have  control  over 
 do  good  things  for  your  future  self  the
[07:20] reason  why  no  one  likes  themselves 
 anymore  the  reason  why  you  don't  have 
 pure  self  love  for  yourself  is  because
[07:25] the  younger  version  of  yourself 
 set  you  up  to  fail  the  younger  version
[07:30] of  yourself  ate  that  junk  food  and  now 
 you  have  too  high  of  a  body  fat 
 percentage  than  you're  comfortable  with 
 the  younger  version  of yourself  didn't
[07:35] study  hard  enough  and  now  you've  got  a 
 degree  or  a  degree  or  career  so  you
[07:40] don't  have  much  self-love 
 now  flip  it  around  i  have  my  dream  body 
 right  now  right 
 six  almost  seven  years  of  training
[07:47] obviously  my  training  and  diet  went  to 
 during  these  bad  parts  but  especially 
 the  last  year  of  this  detox
[07:52] best  training  i've  ever  had  i  have  huge 
 self-love  for  myself 
 because  the  younger  version  of  myself
[07:58] delayed  gratification 
 and  put  me  as  the  priority  and  so  i  am 
 sat  here  today  chilling  with  my  dream
[08:04] body 
 that's  self-love  self-love  is  doing 
 things  for  your  future  self 
 and  that's  what  the  dopamine  detox  aims
[08:10] to  accomplish  that  was  my  why 
 and  i  suggest  if  you  are  considering 
 your  own  dopamine  detox  you  you
[08:16] set  a  declaration  of  why  you're  doing 
 this  not  just  what  you  aim  to 
 achieve  not  just  the  goals  that  you  want
[08:21] to  do  but  the  why 
 what  is  the  purpose  and  i  think 
 self-love  is  a  fantastic  purpose  to  do
[08:26] this  for 
 so  here  is  the  strategy  of  my  dopamine 
 detox 
 now  like  i  said  i  wanted  this  to  be  a
[08:32] long-term  improvement  hopefully  a 
 lifelong  improvement  i  did  not  want  to 
 do  any  kind  of  clickbait  challenge  i
[08:37] didn't  want  to  do  it  24 
 hours  to  reset  your  mind  her  one  week 
 dopamine  it's  not  for  a  challenge  this
[08:42] isn't  for  you 
 like  what  i'm  saying  this  for  me  this 
 isn't  for  you  i'm  doing  this  for  myself 
 i'm  not  doing  this  for  the  viewers  on
[08:48] youtube  i'm  not  doing  this  for 
 24  hours  to  click  you  know  like 
 clickbait  videos  which  get  a  million 
 views  and  it's 
 the  before  and  after  picture  in  the
[08:54] thumbnail  where's  the  guy  on  his  phone 
 and  it's  like  a  guy  reading  like 
 i'm  not  doing  that  it's  not  for  your
[08:59] entertainment  it's  for  my  benefit 
 and  so  that  means  that  the  way  that  i  do 
 my  dopamine  detox  the  way  that  it's  been
[09:05] successful  in  completely 
 changing  my  life  it  isn't  as  sexy  as 
 doing  a  24-hour  challenge  which  you
[09:10] can't  do  anything  and  you  can  only  sit 
 there  and  be  bored 
 i  knew  that  if  i  was  gonna  do  this  for
[09:15] life  the  rules  had  to  be  pretty  lenient 
 and  so  in  general  the  rules  come  from
[09:20] drastically  reducing 
 instant  gratification  and  drastically 
 increasing
[09:25] delayed  gratification  instant 
 gratification  the  bad  thing 
 are  the  activities  that  give  us  instant
[09:32] pleasure  but  they're  usually  not  good 
 for  us 
 that's  video  games  because  video  games 
 are  kind  of  fun  when  we  play  them  right
[09:37] now 
 but  they  just  make  you  into  like  a 
 [ __ ]  over  time 
 porn  junk  food  drugs  all  of  these  give
[09:45] you 
 instant  pleasures  quite  a  high  level  of 
 instant  pleasures 
 but  pretty  much  every  single  time  you  do
[09:50] any  of  these  every  single  time  you 
 indulge  in  one  of  these 
 your  life  gets  slightly  worse  not  a  huge 
 amount  you  can  take  some  drugs  every  now
[09:56] and  then  you  can 
 watch  porn  probably  not  but  like  the 
 issue  is  that  we've  built  up  a  habit  of
[10:01] doing  these  every  single  day 
 and  so  your  life  trajectories  like  this 
 that's  what  instant  gratification  does
[10:06] to  you  that's  why  you  don't  love  your 
 your  younger  self  that's  why  you  look 
 back  and  you  think
[10:11] about  a  [ __ ]  life  this  is  why  we  don't 
 have  self  love  is  because  we  keep  doing 
 this  to  our  lives
[10:16] how  could  you  love  yourself  when  you're 
 here  looking  back  at  yourself  and  you 
 were  up  here 
 delayed  gratification  is  the  other  way
[10:22] around  delayed  gratification 
 are  the  activities  that  are  hard  and 
 uncomfortable  and  challenging  right  now
[10:28] but  they  give  us  a  long  term  benefits 
 that's  exercise  because exercise 
 unless  you  know  you're  very  experienced
[10:33] and  you've  gotten  into  it  generally  for 
 most  people  exercise  is  actually 
 uncomfortable  it's  actually  pretty 
 difficult  they  don't  want  to  go  and  work
[10:39] out  but  in  the  long  term 
 it  gives  you  better  fitness  better 
 health  better  confidence  better
[10:44] self-esteem  better  body 
 more  attraction  from  girls  more  respect 
 from  men  it's  awesome  building  a 
 business  learning  some  skills
[10:50] meditating  journaling  reading  all  of 
 these  are  somewhat  uncomfortable 
 somewhat  boring  right  now  i  don't  know
[10:56] what  you're  probably  thinking  but 
 readings  are  boring  how  to  show  but  for 
 most  people  it  is
[11:01] and  it's  certainly  not  as  fun  as  over 
 stimulating  your  brain 
 on  any  kind  of  video  game  when  you  delay
[11:07] gratification  you 
 secure  your  future  self  to  have  a  better 
 life  that's  the  point  of  the  dopamine
[11:12] detox 
 at  least  my my  point  my  long-term  detox 
 so  now  let's  go  through  the  tactics  what 
 exactly  i  did  that  you  can  do  too
[11:19] i  made  a  timetable  now  usually  when  i 
 say  this  people  get  a  little  bit  bored
[11:24] because  they  wanted 
 you  know  they  wanted  me  to  say  something 
 exciting  do  you  remember  the  timetables 
 that  we  used  to  have  in  school
[11:29] 9  a.m  was  science  10  a.m  was  maths  11 
 a.m  was  english
[11:34] you  could  probably  still  remember  what 
 time  x  lesson  was  right 
 because  it  gets  ingrained  in  our  brain
[11:40] there's  a  reason  why  every  job 
 every  school  uses  timetables  because  it 
 works
[11:45] we  leave  the  education  system  and  then 
 we  just  think  oh 
 i  don't  need  to  do  anything  with  time
[11:50] management  and  then  you're  like  gee 
 i  wonder  why  i'm  not  being  productive  i 
 wonder  why  i'm  not  doing  anything  with
[11:55] my  time 
 it's  because  you  haven't  managed  your 
 time 
 so  the  time  table  out  of  every
[12:02] productivity  tactic  i've  ever  learned 
 about  and  i've  learned  about  fair 
 amounts  out  of  every  time  management  the 
 timetable's  better  than  all  of  them  put
[12:08] together 
 every  single  thing  i've  ever  learned 
 about  productivity  is  undermined  by  the 
 timetable  because  the  timetable  this  is
[12:14] the  the  op  the  overpowered  part  of  the 
 timetable 
 it  makes  your  entire  day  into  a  habit  if
[12:19] your  jaw  hasn't  dropped  you  don't  even 
 understand  what  i  just  said 
 the  timetable  makes  your  entire  day  into
[12:24] a  habit 
 remember  we're  trying  to  build  a  habit 
 or  two  we're  trying  to  build  a  habit  of 
 meditation  imagine  having
[12:29] your  high  productivity  your  high 
 performance  day 
 as  a  habit  the  whole  day  becomes  a  habit
[12:35] it's  like  i  can  do  my  high  performance 
 day  like  afk  now  like  i  can  just  do  it 
 chilling  because  it's  a  habit  i  know
[12:41] what  time  to  wake  up  i  know  what  task  is 
 next  already 
 i  can't  explain  how  overpowered  this  is
[12:46] i've  had  pictures  of  my  times  it  will 
 come  up  on  screen 
 the  guys  who  follow  it  change  their 
 lives  the  guys  who  think  oh  this  doesn't
[12:51] look  so 
 hamza  what  about  the  pomodoro  technical 
 remake  it  exactly  how  i  have
[12:56] don't  have  the  limiting  belief  but  but 
 hamza  sometimes  my  date  oh  yeah  of 
 course  it  does  sometimes  your  day  does 
 change  sometimes  life  gets  in  the  way  as
[13:02] we  know 
 but  this  is  your  ideal  day  we're  not 
 saying  okay  this 
 this  has  to  be  every  single  day  the
[13:07] whole  point  is  this  is  like  the  100  best 
 day  that  you  could  have  you  write  it 
 down 
 literally  i  haven't  even  purposely  done
[13:13] this  but  i'm  gonna  look  like  a  [ __ ] 
 if  this  isn't  but  i'm  pretty  sure  if  i 
 open  this  right  now  my  timetable  is 
 going  to  open
[13:19] and  it  did  i  didn't  even  plan  for  this 
 to  happen  but 
 you  can't  see  that  yeah  there  i  keep  it
[13:26] open  on  my  phone 
 all  the  time  like  if  there's  one  app 
 that's  open  on  my  phone  it's  this 
 i've  read  this  timetable  probably  about
[13:32] two  three  thousand 
 times  but  i  still  read  it  a  couple  times 
 every  single  day  just  because
[13:37] if  there's  a  moment  that  i  have  some 
 time  to  like  look  at  my  phone 
 i  would  rather  look  at  this  which  has
[13:42] truly  changed  my  life  than  going  to 
 any  of  the  bad  stuff  the  reason  why  i'm 
 going  on  about  this  instead  of  the
[13:47] specific  actions  like  quitting  social 
 media  quizzing  video  games 
 that  stuff's  sexy  that  stuff  is  so  cool
[13:52] and  you  want  to  hear  me  and  you  want  to 
 you  know  you  want  to  see  the  b-roll  of 
 me  like  deleting  the  apps  on  my  phone
[13:57] it's  bs  anyone  who  showed  you  a  video  of 
 that  saying  oh  i  deleted  i  delete  social 
 media  i  believe
[14:02] it's  bs  that's  not  how  it  works  you're 
 alcoholic 
 parents  you're  you've  got  an  alcoholic
[14:07] mother  or  uncle  he's  done  that  before 
 hasn't  he  he's  thrown  away  the  alcohol 
 what  happened  did  he  just
[14:12] suddenly  quit  because  he  threw  away  that 
 one  bottle  no  he  bought  more  you've  got 
 a  fat  family  member  or  a  fat  cow  worker 
 and  they've  said  the  same  thing  haven't
[14:17] they  oh  i  threw  away  the  junk  food  what 
 happened 
 they're  still  fat  why  because  they  went
[14:22] and  bought  more  junk  food 
 how  many  times  have  you  uninstalled 
 league  of  legends  too  many  and  yet
[14:27] it's  still  you're  literally  loading  up  a 
 gaming  league  as  i'm  speaking  right  now 
 because  deleting  and  hiding  the  the
[14:33] stuff  that  you're  addicted  to 
 doesn't  work  when  you  structure  your  day 
 with  things  that  you  would  rather  do
[14:38] you  make  progress  when  you  try  to  to  get 
 validation  from  people  by  saying  i i
[14:43] deleted  social  media  i 
 i  uninstalled  league  of  legends  you  make 
 no  progress  still  to  this  day  i  say
[14:49] i've  said  this  sentence  a  hundred  times 
 and  still  to  this  day  people  talk  to  me 
 they're  like  i  deleted  social  media 
 a  week  later  that  not  even  a  week  two
[14:55] days  later  they're  back  on  twitter 
 league  of  legends  i'm  gonna  uninstall 
 league  of  legends  right  now  but  i  see 
 you  playing  it  every  single  day
[15:00] deleting  this  stuff  in  like  a  big 
 righteous  moment  does  not  work  and  i 
 know  that  that's  what  you  want  and  i
[15:05] know  that  that's  the  videos  that  you've 
 watched  before  it  does  not  work  like 
 that 
 you  don't  cure  your  addiction  by  just
[15:10] throwing  it  away  because  you  are 
 addicted  and  you  still  get  it  you  need 
 to  become  addicted  to  something  else
[15:15] i'm  addicted  to  the  timetable  for  more 
 than  the  year  just  recently  i  have  i'll 
 explain  why  but  from
[15:20] almost  the  entire  year  i  left  my 
 addictions  on  my  computer  i  left  the 
 video  games  right  there  i  left  social
[15:25] media  on  my  phone  this  is 
 a  side  note  but  dopamine  detoxing  and 
 doing  the  right  things  delaying
[15:30] gratification  not  indulging  no  instant 
 gratification 
 it  comes  from  willpower  willpower  is  the
[15:35] skill  of  disobeying  your  lizard  brain 
 and  your  lizard  brain  is  the  dumbass 
 part  of  your  brain  that  convinces  you  to
[15:40] play  video  games  that  convinces  you  to 
 skip  the  workout 
 so  the  lizard  brain  you  could  probably 
 say  is  your  biggest  enemy  ever
[15:45] because  it's  around  24  7.  it's  that 
 internal  bully  in  your  mind  that  tells 
 you  to  do  the  bad  things  and  then
[15:50] straight  afterwards  it  leaves  you  and 
 you're  like 
 why  did  i  just  cheat  on  my  diet  again 
 what  i'm  on  a  nofap  streak  why  did  i
[15:56] just  jack  off 
 it  seemed  like  such  a  good  idea  a  second 
 ago  what  no  one  online  is  telling  you 
 because  i  don't  believe  that  they've
[16:01] actually  experienced  a  huge 
 self-improvement  journey  from  going  to 
 the  depths  of  [ __ ]
[16:06] instant  gratification  addiction  to  like 
 becoming  a  normal  person  or  better  than 
 normal 
 if  i'm  better  i  am  better  than  normal  to
[16:12] be  honest  but  no  one's  actually  telling 
 you  how  to  level  up  your  willpower 
 and  that's  what  automatically  gets
[16:17] leveled  up  through  dopamine  detoxing  but 
 only  if  you  do  it  the  right  way 
 and  most  people  are  doing  it  the  wrong 
 way  they  want  to  increase  their
[16:22] willpower  through  dopamine  detox 
 but  they  do  it  through  a  stupid  way  of 
 essentially  covering  up  their  eyes  and
[16:27] saying  but  i  can't  see  the  junk  food 
 anymore 
 i  i've  deleted  social  media  i  don't  have
[16:32] the  apps  on  my  phone  so  i'm  cured 
 i've  installed  a  youtube  website  blocker
[16:37] so  i  can't  see  youtube  anymore  i'm  cured 
 you  never  give  your  willpower  a  chance 
 to  level  up  the  reason  why  you  struggle
[16:43] with  these  the  reason  why  you  can't  do 
 the  hard  actions 
 is  because  you  have  low  levels  of
[16:48] willpower 
 and  the  few  attempts  that  you've  made  to 
 try  and  level  up  your  willpower  has  been
[16:53] undermined  by  the 
 youtube  channels  that  show  you  oh  i 
 deleted  the  apps 
 don't  delete  the  apps  keep  them  on  your
[17:00] phone  don't 
 install  the  website  blocker  don't  throw 
 away  the  junk  food  don't  do  anything 
 with  the  addictions
[17:05] keep  them  in  front  of  you  for  over  a 
 year  i  kept  chocolate  bars  on  my  desk 
 and  i  used  to  just  stare  at  them  just
[17:11] looking  at  them  and 
 feeling  how  i  would  feel  the  cravings
[17:16] how  many  people  do  you  know  have  done 
 that  now  chocolate  doesn't  have  an 
 effect  on  me  we  have  it  in  the  house 
 all  the  time  but  it  doesn't  have  an
[17:21] effect  on  me  if  your  way 
 of  trying  to  improve  yourself  is  to 
 simply  set  up  the  environment  and  close
[17:27] your  eyes 
 eventually  your  eyes  are  going  to  be 
 open  when  someone  offers  you  the 
 chocolate 
 eventually  you're  gonna  feel  like
[17:32] playing  league  and  you're  gonna  be  like 
 let  me 
 let  me  just  download  it  again  because 
 you've  never  actually  built
[17:38] the  willpower  to  have  league  of  legends 
 installed  just  have  icon  right  in  front 
 of  you 
 and  literally  just  choose  not  to  click
[17:44] on  it  that's  like  my  secret 
 to  staying  like  this  for  an  entire  year 
 and  it  annoys  me
[17:49] because  no  one  else  is  actually  telling 
 you  the  truth  everyone's  giving  you  the 
 click  bait  like  oh  i  deleted  social 
 media  here's  his  b-roll  of  me
[17:55] and  installing  the  app  on  social  media 
 like  and  then  they  downloaded  it  again 
 you  can  literally  search  their  profile
[18:01] whatever  youtuber  you  want  to  see 
 you  can  literally  search  them  on 
 instagram  after  they've  said  that  they 
 deleted  the  apps
[18:06] and  they're  back  on  posting  they're  back 
 on  commenting  to  everyone
[18:11] so  the  tactics  with  my  dopamine  detox 
 was  firstly  to  set  this 
 ideal  timetable  the  ideal  day  just  wrote
[18:16] out  just  like  that  and  that  was  my  guide 
 for  the  day  that  was  me  trying  to  just 
 follow  it  as  best  as  i  come
[18:21] in  this  timetable  at  first  i  allowed 
 myself  some  bad  time  some  instant 
 gratification  time
[18:27] and  so  i  did  the  80  20  rule  and  i  said 
 okay  what  are 
 the  20  of  bad  habits  the  instant
[18:32] gratification  habits  that  give  me  the 
 most 
 joy  because  you  need  to  keep  something
[18:37] in  remember  we're  not  doing  a  24  hour 
 challenge  that  you  can  you  know  you  can 
 for  24  hours  just  sit  in  a  room  and  do 
 nothing  but  you  know  we're  doing  this
[18:43] for  life 
 and  so  for  life  we've  got  to  think  about 
 adherence  long  term 
 the  ability  to  stick  to  the  plan  rather
[18:49] than  just  making  it  extreme 
 because  we've  got  our  entire  lives  to 
 make  it  more  extreme
[18:54] so  for  the  first  while  i  gave  myself 
 like  a  solid  couple  of  hours 
 to  like  two  hours  per  day  to  just  spend
[19:01] on  instant  gratification  so  i  did  the  80 
 20  pareto's  principle 
 and  i'll  just  i'm  not  gonna  lie  so  i'll
[19:07] tell  you  the  two  favorite  things 
 i  wanted  to  do  was  meet  girls  from 
 tinder  and  watching  some  youtube  videos
[19:12] so  i  completely  stopped 
 social  media  i  completely  stopped  drugs 
 i  completely  stopped  binge  eating
[19:18] especially  junk  food  i 
 literally  don't  even  eat  junk  food  at 
 all  i 
 stopped  watching  movies  and  netflix  and
[19:24] and  any  type  of  games  or  any  anything 
 else  i  literally  just  watched  about  an 
 hour  of  youtube
[19:29] a  day  and  probably  like  once  or  twice  a 
 week  i'd  meet 
 any  like  girls  that  i  was  matching  with
[19:34] on  tinder  that  wasn't  my  fun 
 and  that  was  more  than  enough  honestly 
 and  so  for  the  rest  of  my  time  i  was 
 following  the  time  table  as  best  as  i
[19:40] could 
 of  course  life  would  get  in  the  way  of 
 course  sometimes  i'd  have  extra 
 responsibilities  or  you  know  i'd  sleep  a
[19:45] bit  longer  someday  or  something 
 but  generally  i'd  be  looking  at  the 
 timetable  and  just  trying  to  follow  that
[19:50] as  best  as  possible 
 that  was  my  plan  now  i  know  this  video 
 is  about  dopamine  detoxing  and  you  want 
 to  need  to  talk  about  like
[19:55] overthrowing  the  internet  and  stuff  but 
 all  of  this 
 came  from  the  timetable  because  you  will
[20:01] fail  your  dopamine  detox  you  will  not 
 transform  your  life 
 until  you  have  a  new  structure  to  your
[20:06] day  because  what  is  the  dopamine  detox 
 other  than  just 
 doing  different  things  in  your  day  it's
[20:11] the  timetable  that  you  need  to  get  onto 
 so  that's  the  tactic 
 and  finally  what  are  the  benefits  then
[20:16] after  one  year  of  this  lifestyle  what 
 are  the  benefits  well  i'll  tell  you  what 
 the 
 the  difference  of  my  life  is  right  now
[20:22] compared  to  one  year  ago  and  you  can 
 tell  yourself  i'm  in  the  best  shape  i've 
 ever  been  in
[20:27] here  is  a  one-year  transformation 
 picture  i've  had  visible  abs  for  the 
 last  entire  year
[20:33] i've  never  done  that  before  i  would  only 
 for  for  the  years  that  i've  trained 
 before  this
[20:38] i  would  only  have  visible  abs  for 
 honestly 
 a  month  max  because  i  was  always  a  binge
[20:44] eater  i've  always  liked  i've  had  anxiety 
 and  so 
 with  if  you've  got  anxiety  you  just 
 binge  eat  usually  and  so  anytime  i  would
[20:50] get  lean  from  doing  lots  of  exercise  and 
 dieting 
 i'd  see  my  abs  add  veins  and  everything
[20:55] literally  within  a  month 
 i  just  each  i  used  to  go  to  the  shops 
 and  literally  do  an 
 entire  food  shop  of  just  snacks  and  just
[21:02] eat  all  this  like  whilst  i  was  just  sat 
 at  home  watching  netflix  and  so 
 for  the  last  year  i've  had  visible  abs
[21:07] i've  been  the  best  shape  of  my  life 
 i've  been  training  with  the  gymnastic 
 rings  which  is  like  a  completely  new
[21:13] skill  for  me  because  i  usually  just  lift 
 weights  but  i've  been  training  with  them 
 and  i've  been  making  some  pretty  damn
[21:18] good  progress  sometimes  it  hits  me  like 
 for  an  entire  year 
 two  three  four  times  a  week  i've  been
[21:23] going  out  and  training  with  these 
 gymnastic  rings  and  the  training  is 
 actually  difficult
[21:28] and  i've  just  been  going  out 
 consistently  doing  it  and  i  can  do  some 
 pretty  cool  movements  i  can  do  a
[21:33] handstand  press  on  the  rings  like  five 
 reps 
 on  the  rings  i  can  do  not  exactly  a 
 front  lever  but  i'm
[21:38] seeing  some  pretty  good  progress  can  hit 
 the  back  lever  and  in  including  with 
 fitness  my  cardios  went  straight  up
[21:44] so  before  the  dopamine  detox  i  used  to 
 do  pretty  much  no  cardio 
 a  little  bit  of  boxing  here  and  there 
 but  nothing  much  since  then
[21:50] i  can  now  run  what  feels  like  an 
 unlimited  amount  like  i  don't  really
[21:55] have  to  stop  running  unless 
 i  want  to  and  so  5k  is  like  normal  i  ran
[22:00] a  10k  one  time 
 i've  now  started  kickboxing  in  terms  of 
 fitness  honestly 
 i've  never  been  better  before  i've  never
[22:06] been  in  better  shape  i've  never  felt 
 physically  as  strong  or  as  agile  or  as
[22:11] as  much  stamina  as  i  have  now  in  terms 
 of  money  and  finances 
 i'm  making  the  most  money  i've  ever  made
[22:16] before  with  youtube  so  in 
 with  youtube  videos  i've  been  uploading 
 at  least  twice  a  week
[22:21] every  single  week  for  the  for  the  last 
 year  and 
 i've  made  this  my  business  i've  made  my
[22:27] purpose  in  life  helping  young  guys 
 to  get  out  of  that  dopamine  rut  and  to 
 achieve  the  same  transformation  that  i
[22:33] have 
 i've  helped  a  fair  amount  of  guys  i've 
 created  a  community  of  young  men  who  are 
 all  climbing  who  are  all  on
[22:39] improvements  we  do  use  discord  as  well 
 if  you  do  want  to  join  us  there's  a 
 discord  link  in  the  description  with
[22:44] like  500  guys  who  talk  about  fitness  and 
 nofap  and  red  pill  and  all  that  so  if 
 you're  interested  in  this
[22:49] just  scroll  down  right  now  click  on  the 
 discord  link  and  you'll  be  able  to  join 
 my  business  is  it's  not  making  it  like
[22:55] an 
 amazing  amount  but  like  i'll  tell  you 
 the  actual  figures  i'm  not  afraid  of 
 telling  you  so
[23:00] january  i  made  1  550  pounds 
 february  made  1  742  pounds  march  i  made
[23:08] 1463. 
 april  went  down  to  like  800  and 
 something  because  i  stopped  doing  a  part
[23:13] of  the 
 not  april  may  may  went  down  to  like  800 
 pounds  so  it  fluctuates  but 
 in  general  it  is  the  most  i've  made
[23:19] before  even  though  i've  worked  like  a 
 full-time  job  like  a  low-end  full-time 
 job  before  and
[23:24] it's  literally  my  dream  to  be  a  youtuber 
 so 
 in  one  year  i've  achieved  my  childhood
[23:30] my  teenage 
 dream  of  being  a  youtuber  of  making 
 online  income 
 and  i  expect  within  one  year  another  one
[23:37] year 
 that  i'll  be  able  to  achieve  my  recent 
 big  dream  which  is  to  be  a  digital  nomad 
 to  take  all  of  this  and  go  abroad  and
[23:42] just  live  in  different  countries  and  get 
 experience  like  whatever  the  world  has 
 to  offer 
 just  with  my  camera  and  my  laptop  and
[23:48] the  reason  why  i'm  able  to  achieve  this 
 is  because  my  productivity  just  went  up 
 i'm  finally  doing
[23:53] the  work  for  youtube  because  i  wanted  to 
 be  a  youtuber  for  a  long  time 
 i  just  never  got  around  to  it  because  of
[23:59] laziness  because  of  just  putting  it  off 
 because  it  was  too  hard  it  was  too  much 
 of 
 delaying  gratification  my  mental  health
[24:05] has  never  been  this  good  before 
 so  i've  mentioned  that  i  do  have  anxiety 
 and  i  still  do
[24:10] but  obviously  with  one  year  ago  with  the 
 experience  i  was  telling  you  when  i  was 
 smoking  from  the  crack  pipe  and
[24:15] everything  my  mental  health  was  in 
 all  time  bad  high  levels  of  stress
[24:20] interrupted  sleep  from  anxiety  and 
 stress  i'd  literally  just  wake  up  slowly 
 sweating  and  worrying  and
[24:26] thinking  that  someone  was  gonna  attack 
 me  like  a  hundred  times  a  day 
 like  that's  not  even  an  exaggeration
[24:31] every  single  time  i'd  step  out  of  my 
 apartment 
 i  used  to  think  that  someone  would  try 
 and  stab  me  like  more  than  once  like
[24:37] every  few  seconds  i  would  think  that 
 even  being  sat  inside  playing  like 
 playing  video  games  over  indulging  in  in 
 the  bad  habits  was  the  only  times  that
[24:43] my  anxiety  would  essentially  just 
 disappear  because  i  was  just 
 too  much  in  a  haze  and  in  a  rut  to  feel
[24:48] it  but  i  felt  like  i  was  very  depressed 
 i  felt  like  i  had  not  much  to  live  for
[24:53] at  that  point 
 and  that  was  the  complete  opposite  i 
 feel  like  i  have  everything  to  live  for
[24:58] there's  a  psychologist  maslow  who  who 
 made  this  pyramid  the  hierarchy  of  needs
[25:03] i'm  at  the  top  i've  reached 
 self-actualization  like 
 i  don't  maybe  that  sounds  like  a  big
[25:08] eagle  boost  or  something  but  i  think  it 
 is  true 
 i've  checked  off  every  single  one  of 
 these  little  characteristics  that  he
[25:14] said  you  need  to 
 you  check  off  to  reach 
 self-actualization  like  i'm  at 
 the  point  of  of  human  experience  that's
[25:21] why 
 like  i  have  motivation  just  on  tap  it's 
 like  24  7.  it  doesn't  turn  off  or 
 anything  my  discipline  is sky  high  i'm
[25:27] doing  all  this  stuff  i  feel 
 so  fulfilled
[25:32] with  the  the  stuff  i'm  doing  because  not 
 only  have  i  improved  myself  to  the  point 
 that  i  feel  awesome
[25:37] but  my  cup  is  full  and  now  i'm  just 
 using  my  cup  to 
 to  fill  up  the  cups  of  the  boys  who  i
[25:42] can  help  i've  never 
 felt  purposeful  or  fulfilled  in  my 
 entire  life  and
[25:48] now  people  are  seeing  me  as  like  the 
 leader  like 
 guys  are  sending  me  messages  that  have 
 literally  saved  their  lives  in  terms  of
[25:55] bad  habits  there  really  isn't  that  many 
 like  i  still  do  some  bad  stuff  in  terms
[26:01] of  you  remember  we're  doing  this  the 
 long  term  so  i'm  not 
 going  to  completely  cut  stuff  out  and
[26:06] say  no  no  it's  against  the  rules 
 for  example  i  went  to  a  party  um  four  or
[26:11] five  days  ago 
 took  some  mdma  there  and  then  i  drank 
 there  and  stuff  that  was  like 
 the  first  time  i've  done  something
[26:16] social  for  like  a  year  or  some  you  know 
 social  party  vibe  for  like  an  entire
[26:21] year 
 in  the  last  year  i've  smoked  weed  a 
 bunch  of  times  because  i  was 
 with  a  girl  like  you  know  if  you  meet  a
[26:26] girl  from  tinder  and  she  smokes  then 
 obviously  i'm  gonna  smoke  with  her  and 
 so 
 smoked  probably  like  20  times  over  the
[26:32] last  year  which  is 
 a  fair  amount  maybe  i'll  leave  it  a 
 little  bit  more  than  i  spare  them  out 
 but 
 it's  not  something  i  feel  negative  about
[26:39] because  it's 
 it's  not  in  a  disgusting  way  where  i'm 
 smoking  by  myself  whilst  doing
[26:44] it  by  myself  it  was  more  like  11  p.m 
 meeting  a  girl 
 to  bang  obviously  and  you  smoke  like
[26:49] what  like 
 half  the  joints  a  quarter  of  the  joint 
 each  and  then  like 
 you  know  that's  it  that  that  to  me  is
[26:55] like  a  very  good  way  to  enjoy  drugs 
 and  you  know  no  one's  supposed  to  i'm 
 not  supposed  to  ever  tell  you  like  oh
[27:00] make  sure  you  do  drugs  honestly 
 if  you  do  them  like  that  like  you  have 
 my  blessing  in  terms  of  video  games
[27:05] movies  netflix  zero 
 zero  seconds  i  can  promise  you  there's
[27:11] zero  seconds  on  video  games  movies 
 netflix 
 a  fair  amount  on  youtube  obviously 
 because  that's  what  i've  allowed  myself
[27:16] but  recently  i've 
 just  drooled  over  myself  recently  i've 
 got  even  more
[27:21] pretty  like  not  exactly  strict  but  i've 
 just  lost  even  more  interest  in  youtube 
 and  so  i  maybe  watch  about  let's  say
[27:27] less  than  two  hours  per 
 week  honestly  probably  closer  to  about 
 one  hour 
 which  is  the  lowest  i've  ever  had  in  my
[27:33] in  my  life  since  i  started  watching 
 youtube 
 social  media  for  the  entire  year  has
[27:38] been  like  very  very  low 
 and  i  use  it  in  like  a  tactical  way
[27:43] where  i 
 i  see  it  as  like  an  online  portfolio 
 where  you  can  gain  something  from  it  you 
 can
[27:48] get  goals  you  can  get  like  business 
 partners  i  i  use  it  to  invite  people  to 
 join  my  podcast
[27:53] so  i  go  on  to  it  to  upload  a  picture  i 
 have  my  notifications  disabled  and  then 
 i  go  off 
 i  don't  use  it  like  i  don't  scroll  or
[27:59] anything  i  don't  look  at  people's  posts 
 i  upload  my  picture  and  i  go  snapchat  i 
 don't  even  have  it  anymore  i  literally
[28:04] deleted  my  fully  deleted  my  snapchat 
 account 
 facebook  obviously  no  one  uses  that 
 nofap
[28:09] nutted  twice  by  myself  in  the  last  12 
 months 
 both  times  was  like  a  conscious  decision
[28:15] i  won't 
 get  into  like  too  much  of  the  gory 
 details  but  both  times  it  was  like  i 
 wanted  to  not  in  the  sense  of  lust  but
[28:20] in  the  sense  of  like 
 practicality  and  like  learning  and  stuff 
 but  maybe  one  day  i'll  explain  why  i  did
[28:25] that  [ __ ] 
 in  terms  of  the  good  habits  exercise 
 like  here's  a  screenshot  i've  hit
[28:30] 300  and  something  workouts  in  the  last 
 year  like  300  and  something  workouts  in 
 the  last  year  if  i'm
[28:35] meditated  let's  say  i've 
 almost  every  single  day  let's  say  i  miss
[28:40] like  50  days  of  meditation  an  entire 
 year 
 which  is  sick  some  days  i  went  up  to  one
[28:45] hour  per  day 
 gratitude  journaling  almost  every  single 
 day  cold  showers  recently  i've  been
[28:50] doing  them  twice  per  day  bro 
 my  entire  life  has  gotten  better  it's 
 only  going  up  like  this  has  now
[28:55] created  the  foundation  of  me  being  a 
 high  performance  high  productivity
[29:00] person  which  i've  never  been  before  this 
 is  the  story  that  every  guy  says  like 
 you  know  i've  always  been  a  bad  student
[29:05] and  i've  never  been  productive  and  girls 
 wouldn't  hold  eye  contact  with  me  well 
 yeah 
 that's  that's  exactly  what  it  was  and
[29:10] honestly  i  am  a  student  now 
 what  i  realized  is  that  my  education 
 began  a  year  ago
[29:16] like  i  have  i've  never  truly  learned 
 anything  my  entire  life 
 apart  from  about  a  year  ago  when  i  have
[29:21] started  this  openly  detox 
 and  i  actually  have  the  attention  span 
 to  learn  now  like  through  school  it  was
[29:26] such 
 so  unfortunate  that  through  school  i 
 always  had  a  huge  level  of  mindlessness
[29:31] like  i  couldn't 
 concentrate  my  mind  was  just  talking 
 over  the  teacher  why  would  i  care  what 
 the  teacher's  saying  bro  the  teachers
[29:37] don't  even  like  me  they  keep  shouting  at 
 me  i'm  not  gonna  listen  to  them  i've  got 
 anxiety  bro  like  i  read  like  i'm
[29:42] actually  a  reader  i'm  actually  a  learner 
 i  take  courses  and  everything 
 and  every  single  time  i  read  my  name  i
[29:49] feel  like  part  of  a  secret  club 
 because  i've  never  been  like  this  i 
 always  thought  genuinely  thought  like 
 reading  was
[29:54] just  weird  nerds  and  everything  i  feel 
 like  i'm  part  of  a  secret  club  and  i 
 read  and  i  think  like
[29:59] i  can't  believe  people  don't  actually 
 want  this  knowledge  i  can't  believe 
 people  don't 
 don't  just  read  because  every  time  i
[30:05] read  i  get  better 
 i  read  something  about  marketing  and  my 
 business  just  gets  better  i  read 
 something  about  mental  health  or
[30:11] positive  thinking  and  now  i  just  feel 
 better  here 
 it  makes  me  feel  crazy  that  people  don't 
 read  but  to  be  honest  it  makes  me  feel
[30:16] crazy  that  people  don't  do  exactly  what 
 i  do  it  makes  me  feel 
 like  i  get  a  weird  feeling  when  i
[30:21] realized  like  oh  yeah  people  don't 
 meditate  like 
 how  like  how  is  that  even  back  that
[30:27] it  can't  even  be  possible  that  you  don't 
 meditate  that's  that's 
 just  weird  that's  so  strange  to  me  that
[30:33] people  don't  meditate  because 
 if  you  meditate  you'll  know  what  i'm 
 saying  but  if  you  don't  meditate  you're 
 a  spur  and  you  won't  even  understand
[30:38] what  i'm  saying  because  you'll  be  like 
 oh  but 
 i  i  tried  to  meditate  but  it  didn't  even 
 shut  up  just  keep  meditating  [ __ ]
[30:44] the  first  time  it  works  it's  not 
 supposed  to  work  straight  away  by  the 
 way  but  the  first  time  it  works
[30:50] you're  going  to  be  like  me  you're  going 
 to  be  making  these  videos  telling  people 
 like  you  have  to  meditate  please 
 like  try  to  meditate  this  is  how  you
[30:55] meditate  it's  just  that  people  try  it 
 twice  and  they're  like  oh 
 gee  where's  like  i  couldn't  clear  my
[31:00] mind  of  thoughts 
 i  couldn't  negate  the  damage  of  30  years
[31:05] of 
 of  technology  use  and  bad  stuff  gee 
 i  guess  it  doesn't  work  that's  like  a
[31:10] fact  i  eat  a  salad  and  be  like  oh 
 i  didn't  lose  50  pounds  oh  i  guess 
 healthy  eating  doesn't  work
[31:16] if  you're  interested  in  doing  a  dopamine 
 detox  maybe  you've  attempted  one  before 
 but  you  want  to  do  it 
 with  my  advice  or  like  the  way  that  i
[31:22] would  do  it  i  made  like  a  little 
 three-page 
 checklist  that  you  can  just  go  through

[31:27] just  make  sure  that  you're  doing  it 
 you're  doing  it  all  right

 the  issues  you  get  you're  getting 
 i  will  also  leave  below  my  dopamine
[31:53] detox  coaching

 because  it  is  like  high  ticket
[31:58] but  if  you  are  struggling  with  those  bad 
 habits  that  i've  mentioned  before  and 
 you  want  to  just  shortcut  how

 gonna  like  the  rest  of  the  videos  i'll
[32:34] make 
 it's  all  about  just  not  being  a  normal 
 person  not  being  a  jeffrey  anymore

 adults  do  the  hard  work 
 even  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
