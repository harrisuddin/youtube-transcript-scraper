 and  starts  fights  especially  when  he 
 goes  out  drinking  it  makes  him  feel  so
[00:13] powerful  to  get  loud  and  aggressive 
 adonis  adonis  doesn't  fight  unless  he 
 has  to  he  understands  street  fights  are
[00:19] unpredictable  and  he  knows  that  fighting 
 is  high  risk  with  minimal  reward  and  yet
[00:24] adonis  trains  he  prepares  himself  for 
 the  day  that  he  doesn't  have  a  choice 
 other  than  to  protect  himself  and  his
[00:30] tribe  all  of  the  advice  online  on  reddit 
 on  youtube  is  absolutely  trash  men  come 
 fearing  for  their  safety  and  the  advice
[00:36] you're  given  is  run  away  run  run  away 
 make  sure  you  run  away  check  the  check

[00:47] have  to  my  name  is  hamza  i  help  young 
 men  go  through  the  jeffrey  to  adonis 
 transformation  through  self-improvements
[00:52] scroll  down  right  now  click  on  the 
 subscribe  and  the  post  notification 
 button  it's  a  win-win  for  both  of  us  hey
[00:57] amazing  bro 
 you  dropped  a  guy  this  guy  came  up  to  us
[01:03] bro  free  ribs 
 rips  us  on  the  menu  for  me  personally 
 most  of  the  potential  fights  and
[01:08] arguments  and  aggressive  situations  have 
 been  in  the  nightclub  environments  like
[01:13] the  night  time  alcohol  involved 
 environments  because  this  is  literally 
 the  prime  environment  it's  fueled  by
[01:18] alcohol  there's  usually  hot  girls  there 
 so  all  the  guys  are  like  weirdly  horny 
 and  like  your  testosterone's  probably
[01:23] going  up  we're  all  competing  like 
 obviously  no  one's  thinking  this  but  we 
 all  somewhat  are  competing  to  be  the 
 alpha  male  who  gets  the  [ __ ]  of  the
[01:29] night  it's  a  very  raw  place  to  be  and  so 
 we're  dancing  in  a  circle  me  two  of  my 
 male  friends  and  three  of  my  female
[01:35] friends  we're  all  dancing  in  a  circle 
 and  i  don't  know  where  this  drunk  guy 
 stumbles  in  like  brushes  into  some
[01:40] people  don't  really  think  much  of  it  you 
 know  he's  a  bit  of  a  [ __ ]  so  i  think 
 we  we  say  something  like  this  i  say 
 something  out  like  what  a  what  a  dick
[01:46] and  he  kind  of  like  you  know  stumbles 
 off  like  it's  it's  like  10  p.m  and  he's 
 at  this  point  obviously  he's  a  dumbass
[01:51] right  out  of  nowhere  this  other  guy 
 comes  up  and  he's  like  that's  what  mate 
 that's  my  mate  you're  talking  about 
 within  literally  like  a  second  this  is
[01:57] kicked  off  and  it's  gonna  get  like 
 aggressive  now  my  friend  did  something 
 like  a  10  out  of  10  move  right  here  i'm
[02:02] not  even  gonna  lie  my  friend  just 
 literally  walked  behind  this  guy  and 
 just  held  his  arms  like  almost  like  he 
 was  almost  pretending  like  you  know  he
[02:07] was  like  holding  the  guy  and  he  just 
 kind  of  like  slid  his  arm  down  and  he 
 just  held  both  of  his  arms  like  this  and
[02:12] i  saw  the  guy  like 
 when  my  friend  had  him  held  like  good 
 good  man  thank  you  kai
[02:18] this  guy's  getting  loud  he's  got  his 
 arms  behind  him  he's  like  thrashing 
 everywhere  bouncer  comes  in  takes  him 
 out  now  this  was  like  an  easy  situation
[02:24] this  was  like  a  low  level  situation 
 let's  go  one  step  higher  this  is  in  a 
 different  club  i'm  in  the  smoking  area
[02:29] and  i'm  speaking  to  this  cute  girl  and 
 you  know  it's  going  well  and  flirting 
 with  her  everything  some  asian  guy  comes 
 to  stands  like  to  the  side  of  us  this  is
[02:35] the  first  time  a  brown  skin  okay  i've 
 always  i've  only  ever  had  problems  with 
 white  guys  it's  just  how  it  is  like
[02:40] white  guys  seem  to  like  be  more 
 aggressive  in  these  like  you  know  the 
 drunk  lad  who  who  drinks  pines  and  [ __ ]
[02:45] never  once  as  like  a  black  or  a  brown 
 guy  ever  even  had  an  argument  with  me 
 this  was  the  only  time  i  can  remember
[02:50] this  brown  guy  just  stands  to  the  side 
 of  us  looking  at  me  aggressively  he  goes 
 shut  up  what  sure  bro  what  you're  on
[02:56] about  bro  he  wants  to  speak  to  this  girl 
 or  he  knows  her  maybe  he's  dating  her  or 
 something  i've  just  approached  his 
 girlfriend  or  something  rob  you  know
[03:01] what  i  do  i'm  like  all  right  i  walk  away 
 now  you  might  think  that  oh  that's 
 that's  not  the  alpha  male  thing  to  do
[03:07] hamza  but  i  actually  would  think  that  it 
 is  because  in  your  comfortable  spot
[03:12] right  now  you're  sat  on  your  your  crusty 
 computer  chair  you're  nice  and  safe  it's 
 nice  to  think  like  oh  hamza  you  should
[03:17] have  hit  him 
 it's  nice  to  be  a  little  spur  like  that 
 but  when  you're  in  that  moment  and 
 people  die  in  these  moments  i'd  say  i
[03:24] did  the  alpha  male  thing  of  just  saying 
 like  yeah  whatever  bro  the  girl's  cute 
 but  she's  not  even  worth  the  anxiety  and
[03:29] the  discomfort  of  having  even  an 
 argument  with  a  guy  never  mind  actually 
 hitting  each  other  never  mind  actually
[03:34] getting  dropped  by  his  friends  so  i  turn 
 around  and  i  walk  away  later  on  in  the 
 night  i  walk  back  into  the  smoking  area
[03:39] i'm  speaking  some  more  [ __ ]  and 
 everything  but  then  i  see  him  and  his 
 group  like  his
[03:44] group  of  like  a  lot  of  guys  like  seven 
 eight  guys  all  in  the  corner  and  this 
 guy's  just  staring  at  me  he's  pissed  for
[03:49] some  reason  boys  like  it  wasn't  even  his 
 girlfriend  like  she  wasn't  around  at 
 this  point  she's  she's  just  disappeared
[03:54] or  something  he's  just  staring  at  me  and 
 his  friends  like  talking  to  him  and 
 they're  like  pointing  at  me  and 
 everything  i'm  getting  worried  so  i'm
[04:00] like  pat  and  my  friends  like  you  know  my 
 friend's  speaking  to  a  [ __ ]  or 
 something  so  i  like  him  i'm  like  bro 
 like  it's  me  two  or  three  no  actually  i
[04:06] had  a  fair  amount  of  friends  on  this 
 night  as  well  actually  so  it's  a couple 
 of  my  friends  couple  of  his  friends  and 
 now  it  starts  getting  heated  his  friends
[04:12] are  coming  up  and  they're  like  you  know 
 putting  their  arm  around  me  like  bro 
 what  what  did  you  do  why  is  he  so  pissed 
 off  at  you  like  you  do  realize  we're
[04:17] gonna  have  to  like  do  and  like  they're 
 all  asian  guys  as  well  we're  all  like 
 almost  like  a  couple  of  his  friends  were
[04:23] being  real  nice  and  we're  like  we  don't 
 want  to  start  or  anything  what's  going 
 on  and  i  said  bro  like  i'm  never  gonna 
 start  a  fight  against  an  asian  guy  they
[04:28] seem  to  respect  this  because  i'm  being 
 polite  to  them  i'm  literally  like 
 putting  my  arm  around  them  and  saying 
 like  bro  like  i  might  have  spoke  to  his
[04:33] girlfriend  or  something  and  they're 
 saying  oh  i  think  they  might  have  said 
 like  oh  no  it's  not  his  girlfriend  it 
 might  have  been  but  she  wasn't  around  or
[04:39] anything  it's  getting  heated  my  friends 
 are  speaking  to  him  you  know  everyone's 
 kind  of  doing  this  buddying  up  thing 
 we're  like  no  one  really  wants  to  fight
[04:44] but  everyone  is  on  edge  and  you  can  see 
 like  guys  literally  like  cracking  their 
 knuckles  and  we're  getting  ready  and  to
[04:49] be  honest  it  just  kind  of  diffuses  it's 
 kind  of  anti-climatic  but  it  just  kind 
 of  diffuses  his  friends  kind  of  say  like
[04:54] just  kind  of  like  don't  look  at  it 
 towards  him  my  friend  say  to  him  now  bro 
 come  on  let's  go  get  you  a  drink  or
[04:59] something  this  and  his  friends  kind  of 
 go  with  him  my  friends  go  with  me  no 
 problem  that  was  like  a  medium  situation
[05:04] that  could  have  turned  into  like  a  full 
 blown  brawl  potentially  it  didn't
[05:09] because  of  social  skills  which  we  will 
 get  into  soon  but  that  was  like  a  medium 
 level  thing  let's  go  one  step  higher  so
[05:15] it's  the  end  of  the  night  again  club 
 alcohol  related  it's  probably  3am  me  and 
 my  friend  my  one  friend  are  leaving  the
[05:21] club  we've  just  finished  the  night  and 
 we're  gonna  go  get  some  chicken  wings  so 
 we  crossed  this  big  intersection  so  it's
[05:26] like  a  big  ass  road  right  we're  on  one 
 side  of  it  we're  going  across  and  on  the 
 way  other  side  like  solid  20  30  meters
[05:32] away  like  some  good  distance  away 
 there's  like  a  group  of  people  and 
 obviously  like  you  know  it's  3am  you 
 expect  people  to  be  like  loud  and  drunk
[05:37] and  everything  but  there  was  like  you 
 can  tell  the  difference  between  like  a 
 drunk  loud  [ __ ]  compared  to  like  a
[05:43] drunk  aggressive  guy  and  we  could  hear 
 that  type  of  guy  like  this  guy's  like 
 okay  we  look  to  the  side  this  guy's
[05:48] shirtless  so  he's  white  guy  somewhat 
 short  he's  shirtless  and  he's  just 
 yelling  and  he's  shouting  he's  shouting 
 to  people  and  so  me  and  my  friend  are
[05:53] lit  we  probably  shouldn't  have  done  this 
 but  we  kind  of  like  shout  over  we  didn't 
 say  anything  offensive  but  we  just  kind
[05:58] of  like  encouraged  them  like  yeah  hit 
 them  bro  like  we  were  just  shouting  on 
 [ __ ]  i  don't  even  remember  what  we 
 said  but  i  don't  remember  particularly
[06:04] saying  something  offensive  to  him  but  of 
 course  this  guy's  drunk  he's  shirtless 
 and  he  looks  over  to  the  side  and  he
[06:10] starts  swearing  at  us  and  he  starts 
 walking  towards  us  like  aggressively 
 like  he's  like  he's  pumping  his  conor 
 mcgregor  type  of  [ __ ]  he's  walking
[06:15] towards  us  like  what's  gonna  happen  bro 
 so  he  crosses  from  the  way  other  side 
 like  this  road  is  massive  by  the way  he
[06:21] from  the  way  other  side  of  this  road  he 
 crosses  all  the  way  towards  us  like  it 
 almost  felt  like  kind  of  slow  motion  at
[06:26] this  point  where  it  felt  like  i  was 
 getting  a  hundred  thoughts  in  my  mind 
 what  was  gonna  happen  that  was  gonna  say 
 we're  almost  like  i  almost  felt  like  me
[06:32] and  my  friend  were  kind  of  like  pushing 
 out  a  little  bit  where  we  as  he  was 
 coming  closer  we  kind  of  like  shouted 
 nicer  things  like  oh  yeah  like  nice  nice
[06:38] biceps  bro  or  some  some  [ __ ]  so  he's 
 walking  towards  us  aggressively  his 
 friends  are  on  the  other  side  they
[06:43] haven't  like  really  crossed  over  they're 
 just  kind  of  like  looking  at  to  see 
 what's  happening  and  i  didn't  even  know 
 what  to  think  about  it  when  he  gets
[06:48] close  to  be  honest  you  know  what  when  he 
 gets  close  i  didn't  think  i  had  no 
 thoughts  but  i  remember  one  specific
[06:53] thing  that  i  did  which  i  said  before  but 
 one  specific  thing  i  did  was  this  i 
 clicked  my  knuckles  he  gets  close
[06:59] without  saying  a  single  word  with 
 aggression  he  comes  and  pushes  my  friend 
 pushing  my  friend  with  like  with  force  i
[07:04] didn't  think  about  it  he's  on  the  floor 
 not  my  friend  but  this  drunk  ass  white 
 guy  he's  on  the  floor  within  a  split
[07:09] second  i  had  hooked  this  guy  with  force 
 broke  i  still  remember  the  way  that  he
[07:14] spun  like  he  spun  kind  of  like  inside  of 
 himself  like  a  beyblade  you  know  what  a
[07:19] beyblade  is  bro  like  let  it  rip
[07:24] he  spun  like  that  like  this  fool  crossed 
 over  this  road  if  i  made  him  spin  like  a
[07:29] beyblade  he  falls  down  like  crashes  down 
 he's  like  spurging  out  on  the  floor  his 
 friends  are  running  up  getting  like 
 proper  aggressive  and  everything  and  i
[07:35] specifically  remember  that  one  of  his 
 friends  was  massive  but  he  was  like 
 running  towards  me  a  bit  but  he  was  like
[07:40] you  know  what  what's  going  on  why  did 
 you  hit  him  and  at least  he  just  said  yo 
 like  he  crossed  the  entire  road  he  came 
 up  and  pushed  my  friend  like  you  know
[07:45] i'm  saying  this  again  social  skills  this 
 big  ass  guy  bro  and  he's  just  kind  of 
 like  he  kind  of  agrees  with  me  he  just
[07:50] stops  running  towards  me  goes  towards 
 his  friends  like  picks  him  up  and  me  and 
 my  friend  go  and  get  chicken  wings  yo
[07:55] what'd  he  do  when  he  came  up 
 [Music]
[08:08] because  this  [ __ ]  really  does  happen  and 
 sometimes  you  cannot  as  always  the 
 standard  advice  that  you  see  online  on
[08:14] red  pill  on  reddit  on  youtube  all  this 
 bullsh  is  usually  just  trash  sometimes 
 you  can't  run  away  like  we  could  have
[08:19] run  okay  we  could  have  run  would  you 
 have  run  would  anyone  like  the  drunk 
 guys  like  crossing  the  road  would  you
[08:24] have  like 
 no  you  wouldn't  have  a  [ __ ]  okay  best 
 case  scenario  any  time  a  man  makes  eye
[08:30] contact  with  you  and  he  doesn't  look 
 friendly  ten  toes  away  but  it's  not 
 realistic  because  one  it's  sometimes 
 that  feels  like  social  suicide  because
[08:36] that  feels  awkward  to  like  do  it  and 
 you're  gonna  look  like  a  fool  sometimes 
 look  but  okay  looking  like  a  foolish  is
[08:41] safer  than  getting  your  ass  beat  or 
 beating  someone  getting  put  in  prison 
 fair  enough  but  sometimes  you  won't  even 
 get  like  the  brain  like  signal  to  run
[08:48] because  i  didn't  in  this  point  i  didn't 
 want  to  fight  but  i  froze  because 
 there's  three  responses  you  can  have  in 
 this  type  of  situation  and  that  is  fight
[08:54] flight  or  freeze  and  i  don't  know  about 
 you  but  i  am  a  freezer  up  until  i  fight 
 i  have  never  been  a  flight  type  of
[09:00] person  you  might  be  you  might  be  the 
 type  of  guy  who  runs  away  but  if  you've 
 been  beat  by  your  parents  bro  you're
[09:05] probably  a  freezer  you'll  probably  like 
 stand  there  just  waiting  to  get  hit  by 
 your  dad  bro  and  you  can  usually  tell
[09:10] like  one  thing  that  that  pops  into  mind 
 is  imagine  when  there's  like  a  drunk 
 white 
 white  guy  obviously  drunk  ass  white  guy
[09:15] on  a  train  being  racist  this  has 
 happened  to  me  many  times  right  he's 
 being  racist  the  moment  he  gets  loud  you
[09:20] will  see  the  people  who  are  in  flight 
 mode 
 literally  he  gets  loud  his  first  word  of 
 being  loud  three  four  people  will  stand
[09:27] up  and  start  running  away  everyone  else 
 is  in  either  freeze  or  ready  to  fight 
 mode  i  don't  think  most  people  are  off
[09:33] lights  i  don't  think  most  people  would 
 run  away  and  i'm  not  going  to  tell  you 
 that  stupid  advice  run  away  any  time  you
[09:38] get  in  trouble  bro  sometimes  you  need  to 
 know  how  to  defend  yourself  now  it's 
 unlikely  that  this  drunk  ass  mother  it's
[09:43] unlikely  that  he  would  have  seriously 
 harmed  us  but  he  could  have  because  me 
 and  my  friend  froze  and  he  he  chose  to
[09:49] push  my  friend  what  if  he  came  and  what 
 if  he  knew  how  to  fight  what  if  he 
 actually  punched  my  friend  with  force 
 what  if  he  had  a  knife  what  do  you  have
[09:54] a  gun  so  it's  time  you  need  to  learn 
 these  steps  now  step  zero  the 
 prerequisite  is  to  learn  how  to  fight
[09:59] this  is  a  prerequisite  to  becoming  a  man 
 because  if  you  cannot  protect  yourself 
 or  your  loved  ones  you  are  not  a  man
[10:05] you're  a  liability  now  the  best  case 
 scenario  is  to  train  specifically  to 
 defend  yourself  and  this  you'll  be  able
[10:11] to  find  it  in  different  countries  but 
 this  generally  is  this  martial  arts 
 sports  club  called  krav  maga  you  can
[10:16] search  this  online  on  your  like  google 
 maps  or  something  you'll  probably  be 
 able  to  find  a  club  nearby  this  is
[10:21] probably  one  of  the  best  ones  to  join  if 
 you  specifically  want  to  learn  about 
 self-defense  but  at  the  very  least  just
[10:26] do  three  months  of  any  kind  of  striking 
 martial  arts  striking  means  like  you 
 know  hitting  okay  and  martial  arts  would
[10:32] be  like  boxing  kickboxing  muay  thai  do 
 three  months  of  any  kind  of  striking  and 
 if  you  want  to  be  very  very  well-rounded
[10:38] couple  that  striking  with  any  kind  of 
 grappling  and  ground  work  wrestling  and
[10:43] bazillion  jiu-jitsu  you'll  be  protected 
 all  around  if  you  do  this  most  people 
 say  just  learn  bjj  like  bjj  brazilian
[10:49] jiu  jitsu  has  got  like  this  this  cocky 
 kind  of  what  would  you  say  a  circle  jerk 
 because  of  like  joe  rogan  and  everything
[10:55] and  all  the  guys  like  bjj  like  it's 
 overrated  in  this  sense  in  my  opinion 
 people  say  okay  just  train  bjj  a  lot  of
[11:00] the  stuff  that  you  learn  in  there  you 
 will  not  be  able  to  use  in  a  street 
 fight  bro  get  him  into  the  perfect
[11:05] armbar  you're  about  to  snap  his  arm  off 
 congratulations  bro  you  know  what's 
 gonna  happen  his  friend's  gonna  stomp  on
[11:10] your  face  he's  gonna  bite  your  dick  off 
 or  something  something  like  bjj  is  only 
 good  in  a  street  fight  to  literally  just
[11:15] make  sure  you  don't  get  put  onto  the 
 ground  but  the  moment  you're  on  the 
 ground  you're  trying  to  do  some  [ __ ] 
 [ __ ]  like  playing  chess  with  this  guy's
[11:20] body  bro  his  friend's  gonna  come  and 
 stab  you  in  the  back  so  this  is  the 
 prerequisite  step  zero  learn  some
[11:25] martial  arts  learn  at  least  some  kind  of 
 striking  some  kind  of  grappling  and  so 
 here  is  the  autistic  way  to  implement
[11:30] this  advice  because  i  used  to  see  this 
 advice  and  i  you  know  people  on  red  pill 
 would  say  okay  learn  martial  arts  and
[11:35] i'd  be  like  yeah  that  sounds  awesome  and 
 then  i  just  would  just  not  do  it  and  so 
 you  need  like  this  very  specific  like
[11:40] almost  childish  advice  of  exactly  how  do 
 you  start  one  go  on  to  google  maps
[11:45] search  for  the  type  of  martial  arts  that 
 seems  interesting  to  you  brazilian  jiu 
 jitsu  kickboxing  boxing  muay  thai
[11:50] whatever  just  search  for  that  and  on 
 google  maps  you'll  be  able  to  see  the 
 clubs  that  are  nearby  click  on  their
[11:55] website  and  almost  all  of  them  will  have 
 a  free  first  day  and  even  if  they  don't 
 it'll  be  what  10  15  whatever  just  take
[12:01] some  cash  with  you  you  can  see  their 
 timetable  on  their  website  maybe  their 
 facebook  page  and  just  go  to  the  first
[12:06] nearest  class  that  you  can  attend  don't 
 overthink  it  don't  think  okay  you've  got 
 to  message  them  don't  think  okay
[12:11] how  do  i  know  if 
 it's  going  to  be  good  specifically  you 
 need  to  go  to  their  first  free  day  and
[12:16] then  you'll  be  able  to  tell  from  that 
 point  because  you  could  find  the  best 
 club  in  the  world  and  it's  really  really 
 affordable  but  if  you  don't  go  to  the
[12:21] first  day  you're  never  going  to  join  or 
 you  could  go  to  the  first  day  and 
 everyone  is  a  tall  [ __ ]  to  you  and
[12:26] then  you  don't  want  to  go  but  there's 
 another  club  down  the  road  that  you  then 
 you  go  to  their  first  day  everyone's 
 really  nice  and  you  feel  like  you're
[12:31] leveling  up  anyway  you  need  to  go  to 
 that  first  free  day  usually  free 
 sometimes  take  10  15  with  you  as  soon  as
[12:37] possible  now  step  one  is  anxiety  and 
 mindfulness  because  you've  been  reminded
[12:42] about  this  concept  of  danger  that  other 
 people  could  harm  you  in  this  video  so
[12:47] i'm  willing  to  bet  that  in  the  past  five 
 minutes  you've  probably  sweat  more  than 
 normal  that  since  watching  this  video
[12:52] your  heartbeat's  probably  going  a  little 
 bit  faster  you've  got  this  like  weird 
 sense  of  like  how  do  you say  that  word 
 adrenaline  excitements  and  you  think
[12:59] that  that's  going  to  help  you  in  these 
 fights  and  you're  probably  like  you've 
 probably  got  this  mindset  right  now  like 
 oh  i  could  smash  a  workout  that  feeling
[13:04] that  you've  got  is  anxiety  and  you  think 
 it's  productive  it's  actually  going to 
 be  the  reason  why  you  get  dropped 
 because  think  about  the  master  fighter
[13:10] does  he  have  anxiety  does  he  have 
 excitement  no  he's  calm  he's  stoic  he 
 regulates  his  mind  and  his  body  you
[13:15] think  that  you'd  hit  a  fantastic  workout 
 with  this  rage  you  know  the  people  who 
 hurt  you  and  you  think  about  them  you
[13:20] get  angry  and  you  think  you're  gonna  hit 
 a  fantastic  workout  because  of  that  no 
 it's  mindfulness  flow  concentration
[13:26] being  focused  that's  gonna  help  you  to 
 give  you  the  best  workout  or  even  save 
 your  life  in  the  fights  and  you  wanna
[13:31] know  how  i  know  this  because  i  used  to 
 fuel  my  workouts  with  the  thought  of 
 crushing  the  skull  of  the  racists  who
[13:36] tried  to  stab  me  like  that  was  my  go-to 
 thoughts  and  i  didn't  have  good  workouts 
 i  was  very  distracted  for  them  i  never
[13:41] hit  pr's  in  those  sessions  you  will  get 
 fatigued  from  thoughts  and  these  type  of 
 thoughts  don't  energize  you  they  don't
[13:47] make  you  feel  good  they  don't  give  you 
 confidence  or  strength  or  anything  these 
 type  of  thoughts  mentally  and  physically
[13:52] literally  physically  like  the  real 
 science  is  that  these  type  of  thoughts 
 will  physically  fatigue  you  then  compare
[13:57] that  to  the  times  where  you're  so 
 focused  on  your  workouts  so  mindful  so 
 so  concentrated  that  you  don't  even
[14:03] change  the  song  once  on  spotify  you 
 don't  even  touch  your  phone  you're 
 hitting  pr  after  pr  so  in  terms  of
[14:08] preparing  for  fights  or  danger  or  being 
 threatened  step  one  is  longer  term
[14:13] consistent  meditation  this  will  help  you 
 always  and  no  matter  what  you  want  to  do
[14:18] literally  pick  anything  that  you  want  to 
 do  which  is  completely  random  and  i'll 
 find  a  way  to  explain  how  meditation 
 will  help  you  with  it  and  it's  insane
[14:24] that  people  don't  meditate  but  here's 
 your  chance  meditate  every  single  day 
 for  the  rest  of  your  life  there  and  then 
 in  that  moment  in  that  situation  where
[14:30] it's  about  to  go  down  and  some  guy's 
 swearing  at  you  some  guys  being  racist 
 regulate  your  mind  and  your  body  i'm  not
[14:35] gonna  make  this  a  weird  [ __ ]  guide 
 where  i'm  gonna  tell  you  like  the  10 
 steps  to  do  and  you  know  watch  out  for
[14:40] his  shoulder  and  shoot  your  [ __ ] 
 mouth  one  hopefully  simple  thing  that
[14:45] you  can  remember 
 breathe  that's  it  just  at  that  point 
 when  [ __ ]  is  kicking  off  if  you  just
[14:50] remind  yourself  to  just  breathe  nice  big 
 deep  breath  into  the  stomach  like  into 
 your  balls  as  elliot  hulse  used  to  say
[14:55] breathe  into  your  balls  at  that  point 
 because  when  it's  really  kicking  off 
 you're  taking  shallow  breaths  that's
[15:00] gonna  not  only  make  you  like  weaker  and 
 and  more  fatigued  but  you're  gonna  look 
 weaker  you're  gonna  get  that  closed  body
[15:05] language  start  cowering  over  that's 
 gonna  make  you  look  like  less  of  a 
 threat  less  able  to  defend  yourself  when
[15:11] she's  kicking  off  big  breath  from  your 
 nose  into  your  stomach  open  up  your  body 
 i  know  that  that  seems  way  like  weirdly
[15:17] simple  advice  but  it  could  potentially 
 save  your  life  because  it's  gonna  bring 
 you  back  into  regulating  your  mind  and
[15:22] your  body  then  step  two  is  body  language 
 and  situational  awareness  if  you  aren't
[15:27] even  observing  his  body  language  and  the 
 situation  around  you  what's  gonna  happen 
 you're  gonna  wake  up  being  like  oh  well
[15:32] what  happened  you  didn't  even  realize 
 that  his  friend  just  hit  you  from  the 
 side  you  have  to  keep  your  eyes  open  and
[15:37] you  have  to  stay  aware  of  the  entire 
 situation  not  just  a  tunnel  vision  on 
 the  guy  in  front  of  you  you  can
[15:43] generally  if  you  ever  have  the  the 
 curiosity  to  watch  street  fights  you  can 
 see  that  like  guys  who  watch  football  do
[15:48] this  but  they're  like  they'll  stare  at 
 each  other  or  they'll  like  get  so  close 
 that  they  could  almost  kiss  each  other 
 like  this  is  the  other  guy's  forehead 
 and  they're  like  dude  there's  like  the
[15:53] [ __ ]  rams  this  tunnel  vision  is  gonna 
 get  you  hit  from  the  side  by  his  friend 
 so  again  i'm  not  gonna  overload  you  with
[15:58] information  that  i  did  some  research 
 before  this  and  everyone  said  okay  well 
 if  his  shoulder  drops  by  this  and  if  he
[16:03] does  this  with  his  hand  no  it's  stupid 
 it's  too  much  you're  not  like  anyone 
 who's  been  in  a  real  fight  like  you're
[16:08] not  going  to  remember  this  weird  that  i 
 tell  you  right  now  okay  his  shoulder  is 
 going  to  drop  and  if  if  he  looks  in  a  13
[16:13] degree  angle  you're  not  gonna  remember 
 so  i'm  just  going  to  tell  you  one  main 
 rule  and  i  think  this  is  the  one  that 
 you  can  remember  which  is  never  let
[16:19] anyone  get  to  the  side  or  behind  you  you 
 quickly  observe  the  entire  situation  see 
 like  who's  who  seems  to  be  on  his  side
[16:25] just  make  sure  no  one  is  behind  you  or 
 to  the  side  of  you  now  step  three  is  to 
 avoid  and  this  is  the  step  this  is  the
[16:30] reason  why  the  first  two  stories  that  i 
 told  you  didn't  exactly  get  violence  you
[16:35] can  avoid  a  lot  of  these  aggressive 
 violence  fight  situations  through  social
[16:40] skills  because  let's  put  you  into  this 
 scenario  right  now  you're  in  the  middle 
 of  a  club  alcohol  involved  alcohol's
[16:45] always  [ __ ]  involved  in  fights  right 
 and  someone  starts  chatting  yo 
 and  so  you're  in  the  middle  of  the  club
[16:50] you're  enjoying  yourself  someone  gets 
 aggressive  onto  you  all  the  redditors 
 will  tell  you  to  run  away  this  guy  says 
 [ __ ]  you  to  you  and  you
[16:56] you  run  out  of  club  okay  you're  not 
 gonna  do  that  especially  because  in  in 
 the  situations  where  fights  are
[17:01] happening 
 it's  usually  like  a  packed  place  where 
 you  can't  literally  run  they're  gonna 
 have  to  like  fully  like  excuse  me  excuse
[17:06] me  excuse  me  you're  not  gonna  do  that 
 you  wouldn't  need  to  because  let's  say 
 this  big-ass  meathead  says  yo  you  just
[17:11] bumped  into  me  what  do  you  do  this  is 
 exactly  what  you  do  you  hold  your  hands 
 up  say  yo  i'm  sorry  he'll  swear  even
[17:16] more  he'll  even  say  something  that  like 
 triggers  your  insecurity  you've  got  gyno 
 i  watch  your  youtube  channel  hamster
[17:21] you've  got  guy  i know  i  see  you  talking 
 about  it  whatever  he  says  you  almost 
 take  it  as  like  nonchalance  like  his
[17:26] words  don't  mean  anything  keep  your 
 hands  up  i'm  sorry  and  you  start  walking 
 away  you  do  not  turn  to  the  side  or  to
[17:31] the  back  this  is  the  time  when  if  you 
 like  say  oh  you  know  you  get  scared  and 
 you  start  walking  away  you're  gonna  get
[17:36] [ __ ]  sucked  in  the  back  of your  head 
 that's  happened  to  me  twice  in  the  same 
 night  as  well  by  the  same  [ __ ]  people 
 there's  no  rules  in  a  street  fight
[17:41] there's  no  like  oh  you  know  you  can't 
 hit  him  from  the  back  lad  like  they'll 
 take  the  advantage  that  they  can  get  and
[17:46] if  you're  looking  at  them  like  i  know  it 
 seems  a  bit  socially  weird  to  kind  of 
 stick  your  hands  up  like  this  and  maybe
[17:51] step  away  from  them  whilst  looking  at 
 them 
 completely  fine  because  if  that  saves 
 you  from  turning  around  and  one  of  them
[17:56] just  coming  up  and  hooking  you  in  the 
 jaw  it's  worth  it  and  the  reason 
 specifically  whilst  we're  holding  our 
 hands  up  like  this  is  because  the
[18:02] observation  of  other  people  now  imagine 
 this  cctv  cameras  in  the  club  right
[18:07] think  about  what  they're  gonna  see 
 usually  these  cameras  are  in  like  140p 
 black  and  white  right  all  they're  gonna
[18:12] see  is  like  you  do  this  and  this  guy's 
 coming  at  you  like  this  who's  going  to 
 look  like  the  perpetrator  the  aggressor 
 the  people  around  you  who  potentially
[18:18] could  jump  in  and  help  either  one  of  you 
 who  are  they  more  likely  to  help  the  guy 
 who  looks  angry  with  the  guy  who's  like 
 doing  this  and  also  this  is  a  very  sick
[18:24] if  your  hands  are  lit  up  like  this 
 you're  like  this  right  this  is  a  very 
 safe  position  for  you  to  be  in  you  can 
 catch  attacks  like  this  you  can  block
[18:30] your  face  you  can  even  throw  much  much 
 faster  faster  than  if  you've  got  your 
 hands  like  i  see  some  stupid  ass  video
[18:35] clips  i  used  to  have  an  obsession  with 
 watching  street  fight  videos  and  some  of 
 them  it's  like  the  guy  would  like  want
[18:40] to  show  that  you  know  he  was  confident 
 and  stuff  and  so  he'd  be  he'd  walk  to 
 this  guy  like  with  his  hands  like  up 
 here  with  his  chin  stuck  out  and  so  of
[18:45] course  the  other  guy  would  lightly  hook 
 him  the  guy  falls  oh  i  see  you  see  some 
 fights  with  like  the  guys  originally
[18:50] he's  got  his  hands  in  his  pocket  like  a 
 dumbass  no  we  want  to  shortcut  every 
 little  every  detail  so  that  we  can
[18:56] protect  ourselves  and  the  best  way  to 
 protect  yourself  is  literally  you  know 
 you  keep  your  hands  up  up  here  boxing 
 stance  if  you've  already  got  your  hands
[19:02] here  you're  almost  already  there 
 straight  away  and  so  in  this  situation 
 this  guy's  yelling  at  you  you're  gonna 
 apologize  you're  gonna  walk  away  you're
[19:07] gonna  keep  your  eye  on  him  just  walk 
 away  i'm  sorry  bro  i  didn't  mean  to  bump 
 into  you  my  bad  boo  he's  gonna  start 
 swearing  say  something  racist  my  bad  bro
[19:13] i'm  sorry  just  start  walking  away  whilst 
 i  like  looking  at  the  guy  that  was  you 
 or  void  and  that  was  you  like  trying  to 
 leave  the  situation  what  if  he  follows
[19:19] you  what  if  he  gets  closer  to  you  that 
 is  when  you  get  loud  and  i  found  that 
 this  is  actually  like  a  little  bit  of  a
[19:24] barrier  that  you  have  to  break  to 
 skyrocket  how  effective  you  are  in  in 
 this  type  of  situation  this  guy's
[19:29] getting  loud  he's  getting  like  you  know 
 like  angry  and  his  blood's  rushing  he's 
 getting  ready  for  the  fight  you're  like
[19:34] really  quiet  and  reserved  now  it's  more 
 than  just  him  shouting  at  us  more  just 
 than  him  swearing  now  he's  walking
[19:40] towards  you  now  he's  becoming  like  a 
 full-on  danger  this  is  when  you  start  to 
 get  loud  and  you  start  you  start  to 
 shout  but  you  shout  almost  like
[19:46] defensive  victim  stuff  which  is  like  yo 
 don't  step  towards  me  stay  away  from  me 
 do  not  step  closer  to  me  i  don't  want
[19:51] any  problems  stay  away  again  cctv 
 potentially  like  club  bouncers 
 potentially  any  kind  of  like  observers
[19:56] anyone  who  jump  in  here  this  and  at  this 
 point  if  he's  still  walking  towards  you
[20:01] he's  going  to  hurt  you  unless  if  you 
 hurt  him  first  if  you  can  run  at  this 
 point  try  and  run  but  honestly  the
[20:06] advice  i  give  you  at  this  point  like 
 you're  not  gonna  be  able  to  remember 
 this  at  this  point  honestly  if  you've 
 been  in  these  situations  before  there's
[20:11] there's  no  more  thoughts  if  there's  ever 
 a  time  that  you  get  into  a  flow  state 
 it's  at  a  point  like  this  that  all
[20:16] thoughts  switch  off  your  legs  are 
 shaking  like  this  and  you're  getting  so
[20:21] ready  you  don't  get  to  think  at  this 
 point  if  you're  a  runner  if  you're 
 someone  who  who  seems  to  tap  into  the
[20:26] flight  mode  okay  fantastic  best  case 
 scenario 
 you  might  not  be  i'm  not  at  this  point
[20:32] personally  for  me  if  you're  anything 
 like  me  i  freeze  like  this  is  like  i 
 start  standing  still  i  can't  even  speak
[20:37] or  anything  i  just  kind  of  like  stare  at 
 the  person  this  is  from  like 
 disassociation  from  my  childhood  trauma 
 like  long  story  short  like  you  probably
[20:43] can  experience  that  so  i  freeze  at  this 
 point  i  freeze  up  until  it  is  time  to 
 fight  and  so  step  four  is  strike  first
[20:49] and  this  now  i'm  going  to  teach  you 
 exactly  how  to  hit  which  i've  never  seen 
 any  other  guide  all  these  guys  like  if
[20:54] you're  if  you're  watching  this  video  you 
 you  want  to  know  this  specific  like  gory 
 detail  of  what  hits  her  throw  right  and
[21:00] all  these  guys  every  time  i  see  them  and 
 they'd  always  just  say  oh  don't  get  into 
 fights  guys  don't  get  into  fights  sir
[21:06] before  you  fight  go  on  google  and  search 
 up  the  laws  and  the  registrations  like 
 what  the  [ __ ]  these  reddit  is  actually
[21:11] saying  this  like  before  you  defend 
 yourself  go  search  up  the  self-defense 
 laws  in  your  area  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro
[21:17] if  i'm  like  this  if  i've  walked  away 
 from  this  guy  and  he's  still  coming 
 towards  me  and  he's  got  into  like 
 literally  this  far  away  bro  this  guy  is
[21:22] going  to  hurt  me  like  this  guy  will  [ __ ] 
 you  up  and  i'm  not  even  talking  about 
 his  friends  who've  already  like  walked
[21:27] to  the  outside  of  you  now  again  if  you 
 can  run  fantastic  but  a  lot  of  times  you 
 can't  and  don't  stand  there  going  on
[21:33] wait  wait  one  second  bro  one  second  let 
 me  just  um  what's  the  government  website 
 let  me  just  double  check  can  i  defend
[21:38] myself  or  what's  the  the  section  3.8  law 
 some  [ __ ]  no  at  this  point  you  are
[21:43] in  danger  and  so  the  exact  hits  that 
 you're  gonna  go  with  most  people  will  do 
 a  very  random  like  stupid  boxing  hit
[21:48] right  most  people  have  never  done  boxing 
 and  so  they'll  do  usually  some  kind  of 
 like  long  range  hook  which  is  one  of  the
[21:54] worst  hits  you  could  throw  in  this  area 
 what  you'd  instead  go  for  is  the  side  of 
 your  elbow  right  about  here  this  bit
[22:00] here  this  is  one  of  the  hardest  parts  of 
 your  body  here  specifically  to  the  side
[22:05] of  the  chin  now  again  most  people  would 
 almost  automatically  go  for  the  nose 
 because  it  just  seems  like  where  you'd
[22:10] go  for  the  side  of  the  chin  will  make 
 that  guy  spin  like  a  beyblade  like  i 
 said  before  the  side  of  the  chit  is  how
[22:16] you  get  knocked  out  in  boxing  one  of  the 
 like  the  most  fundamental  things  is  to 
 keep  your  chin  down  if  you  fight  like
[22:21] this  you're  gonna  get  twatted  you  keep 
 your  chin  down  like  this  most  guys  won't 
 do  this  in  a  street  fight  you  keep  your 
 chin  like  down  like  this  it  protects  it
[22:27] if  someone  gets  into  the  distance  that 
 you  could  elbow  them  which  you've  got  to 
 think  is  like  it's  not  there's  no
[22:32] distance  right  it's  like  i  couldn't  even 
 elbow  the  camera  right  now  you  get  what 
 i  mean  so  if  i  could  elbow  someone  who's
[22:37] coming  towards  me  aggressively  like  they 
 deserve  to  be  elbowed  now  of  course  the 
 disclaimer  of  like  oh  but  check  with  the
[22:43] police  first  like  no  i  don't  care  bro  if 
 someone  is  this  close  where  they  they're 
 this  far  away  from  you  after  you  walking
[22:49] away  from  them  they're  legally  following 
 you  at  this  point  i  don't  care  about  the 
 laws  at  this  point  it's  my  survival
[22:54] instinct  to  neutralize  this  threat 
 exactly  what  you're  going  to  do  once  it 
 comes  to  this  point  i  hope  it  doesn't
[22:59] come  but  if  it  fully  does  that  you 
 someone  is  this  close  to  you  they're 
 about  to  hit  you  bro  usually  when 
 someone's  walking  up  to  you  aggressively
[23:05] there's  usually  a  bit  of  a  gap  like  they 
 won't  walk  up  and  as  soon  as  they've  got 
 range  like  this  much  range  they  won't
[23:10] throw  it  like  this  usually  with  every 
 like  if  you  go  and  search  for  like  some 
 street  fight  video  they'll  come  up  for  a
[23:15] split  second  you  know  do  something  like 
 some  [ __ ]  like  this  stick  their 
 hands  down  and  go  oh  bro  and  then
[23:20] they'll  hit  you  you  have  like  that  split 
 second  to  act  first  if  you  absolutely 
 have  to  so  you're  gonna  slightly  step  in
[23:26] with  your  with  your  front  foot  at  this 
 point  you  should  be  in  like  you  know  the 
 full-on  boxer  stance  which  is  literally 
 just  stick  your  right  if  you're
[23:32] right-handed  your  right  foot  slightly 
 back  your  left  foot  slightly  forward  we 
 won't  go  into  like  too  much  detail  with 
 that  [ __ ]  but  pretty  much  as  soon  as  it
[23:38] comes  to  this  point  take  a  little  step 
 in  right  elbow  down  a  little  bit  and 
 just  swing  hard  as  against  the  chin
[23:44] we're  not  even  trying  to  hit  the  chin 
 okay  we're  not  trying  to  hit  the  chin 
 we're  trying  to  go  through  it  imagine 
 you  are  like  bursting  through  not  even
[23:50] connecting  but  bursting  through  a  door 
 we  don't  want  to  hit  the  chin  we're 
 gonna  like  literally  connect  with  it  if
[23:55] you  can  do  like  a little  visualization 
 like  success  visualization  beforehand 
 through  the  chin  fully  imagine  that  his
[24:01] head  is  gonna  like  twist  like  this  and  i 
 know  this  is  like  gory  detail  that  might 
 be  like  unacceptable  for  youtube  but
[24:09] better  him  than  you  that  is  all  you  do 
 the  one  hit  to  his  chin  that  that  will 
 fully  drop  the  guy  even  if  you're  not
[24:15] very  weak  even  if  the  guy's  way  bigger 
 than  you  so  the  side  of  the  chin  will 
 fully  fully  drop  the  person  to  the  floor
[24:20] it  always  will  after  this  step  five  one 
 of the  most  important  steps  escape  now 
 you've  got  to  play  the  game  of  escaping
[24:25] his  friends  him  when  he  probably  will 
 stand  back  up  depending  on  how  good  your 
 strike  was  the  police  the  bouncers
[24:31] anyone  who's  trying  to  fight  you  because 
 at  this  point  his  friends  will  chase  you 
 he  will  call  someone  who  will  come  with
[24:36] a  knife  or  a  gun  to  come  and  get  you  so 
 hit  first  hit  hard  then  escape  this  is 
 when  you  like  i  found  that  you  can
[24:41] almost  tap  into  that  that  running  mode 
 again  you  can  tap  into  the  flight  mode 
 usually  at  least  for  me  the  few  times
[24:46] i've  been  into  this  situation  i  fully 
 freeze  then  i  go  into  fight  mode  and 
 after  the  fight  mode  after  i've  hit  the 
 guy  hard  once  i  only  ever  hit  people
[24:52] once  after  that  point  bro  and  sprint  all 
 the  way  that's  your  cardio  that's  your
[24:57] height  interval  high  intensity  interval 
 training  back  home  go  get  some  chicken 
 wings  ribs  on  the  menu  do  not  stay
[25:03] around  to  be  the  victor  do  not  shout  and 
 start  celebrating  because  i  see  this  so 
 many  times  in  in  i  went  to  the  club  many
[25:09] many  times  in  my  student  days  there 
 would  be  a  fight  like  like 
 every  week  right  there'd  be  a  fight  like
[25:14] every  week  you  know  everyone's  shouting 
 everyone  like  the  crowds  watching 
 everything  one  guy  wins  and  i'm  like  yo 
 like  yo  he's  one  right  fantastic  right
[25:20] this  dumbass  would  win  the  fight  and  it 
 just  kind  of  starts  shouting  and  you 
 just  stay  there  and  like  you  know  like
[25:25] look  at  the  guys  who  he's  dropped 
 dropping  you  know  do  some  [ __ ]  so 
 what  do you  think  happened  the  bouncers 
 come  up  they've  grabbed  this  guy  they
[25:31] like  put  their  knee  on  this  guy's  neck 
 they  man  handle  him  you  see  this  guy 
 like  you  know  two  big  ass  bouncers  like
[25:36] carrying  his  arms  and  dragging  him  by 
 his  hair  and  stuff  he's  like  going 
 through  all  the  piss  on  the  floor  and 
 looks  like  a  fool  just  take  him  straight
[25:42] outside  and  then  straight  into  the 
 police  car  another  time  they're  fighting 
 not  in  the  club  right  now  but  just 
 outside  the  club  on  the  road  they're
[25:47] fighting  and  everything  one  guy 
 literally  gets  a  solid  hit  on  some  other 
 guy  police  car  whizzes  up  this  guy's
[25:52] like  just  shouting  and  everything  gets 
 arrested  right  away  as  soon  as  you  hit 
 like  as  soon  as  it's  possible  bro  sprint
[25:58] sprint  the  [ __ ]  away  do  not  stay  around 
 to  be  the  victor  do  not  stay  around  to 
 finish  off  the  night  if  it's  a  club
[26:03] whatever  it  is  like  get  the  [ __ ]  out 
 party  whatever  it  is  get  out  because  you 
 could  annihilate  this  guy  let's  say  he's
[26:09] passed  out  for  the  entire  night  it's  not 
 gonna  happen  but  let's  say  he's  passed 
 up  for  the  entire  night  his  friends  will 
 stab  you  like  somewhat  something  worse
[26:15] will  happen  the  police  will  be  called 
 the  bouncers  some  something  will  happen 
 get  out  you've  won  you've  profited  at 
 that  point  that  was  the  exact  thought  i
[26:20] had  when  i  hit  this  guy  who  came  up  and 
 pushed  my  friend  it  was  straight  away  i 
 got  the  thought  okay  we've  profited  like
[26:25] we've  already  won  let's  get  the  like  i 
 don't  need  to  stay  and  fight  his  friends 
 now  like  i've  already  won  if  i  leave 
 right  now  it's  like  i've  left  with  like
[26:31] profit  like  there  was  a  good  return  on 
 investment  for  this  but  if  i  stay  like 
 what  what  like  what  is  this  to  stay  for
[26:36] potentially  me  get  hit  too  i  don't  want 
 that  as  soon  as  you  get  you  connect  with 
 that  hits  you  have  to  follow  the 
 situation  now  of  course  i'm  going  to
[26:41] give  the  disclaimer  i  wanted  to  do  this 
 at  last  because  i  don't  want  to  waste 
 your  time  with  this
[26:46] i'm  not  encouraging  people  to  fight 
 don't  fight  bro  it's  stupid  but  this 
 isn't  about  fighting  even  though  i've
[26:51] titled  it  like  that  this  is  about 
 protecting  yourself  like  you  will  never 
 be  the  person  who  who  is  the  antagonizer
[26:57] you  will  never  be  the  person  who's  the 
 guy  who's  shouting  who's  loud  and  who 
 picks  on  someone  but  it  will  happen  to 
 you  like  multiple  times  through  your
[27:03] life  it  will  happen  that  you'll  have  a 
 time  when  there  is  a  guy  who's  picking 
 on  you  who  is  aggressive  on  you  and  if
[27:08] you  don't  know  some  of  this  knowledge 
 like  that's  the  [ __ ]  that  you  overthink 
 about  for  10  20  for  the  rest  of  your
[27:13] life  that's  the  [ __ ]  that  gives  you 
 anxiety  for  the  rest  of  your  life  i 
 highly  highly  recommend  if  you  want  to 
 take  the  actionable  step  right  now  you
[27:18] do  that  thing  which  i  said  in  in  step 
 zero  you  go  right  now  search  up  the 
 martial  arts  club  and  book  in  the  first
[27:24] session  like  you  don't  even  need  to  book 
 in  generally  you  can  just  go  show  up  to 
 the  first  session  i  can't  even  explain
[27:29] to  you  how  much  that  has  changed  my 
 mindset  like  my  anxiety  has  dropped  by  a 
 significant  honestly  about  80  percent  in
[27:35] just  the  last  couple  of  months  like  it 
 was  already  making  good  progress  and 
 it's  like  training  kickboxing  i'm  not
[27:40] even  good  at  kickboxing  right  i'm 
 literally  i'm  not  even  good  like  i've 
 done  like  two  months  of  training  maybe
[27:45] two  and  a half  months  but  it  gives  you 
 this  almost  nonchalant  feeling  we  you 
 now  know  you  don't  need  to  overthink
[27:50] about  it  you  know  that  you  don't  need  to 
 stress  or  be  anxious  about  it  because  i 
 know  like  what  my  sort  of  capabilities
[27:56] are  i  don't  need  to  plan  the  fight 
 anymore  anxiety  is  kind  of  like  planning 
 something  bad  that  could  happen  so  you
[28:01] know  you  can  be  really  aware  of  it  you 
 can  try  and  save  yourself  from  the  pain 
 it's  been  almost  ticked  off  it's  like 
 yeah  you  don't  need  to  plan  because  you
[28:06] you  could  probably  you  know  not  not 
 great  but  someone  could  stop  the  show 
 you  obviously  but  you'd  be  relative  if
[28:11] you  had  like  an  okay  chance  you'd  be 
 relatively  fine  we  don't  need  to 
 preemptively  think  of  like  some 
 dangerous  situation  anymore  that's  very
[28:17] life-changing  for  me  and  i  wish  that  for 
 you  do  that  would  work  especially  when 
 you  don't  feel  like  it
[28:30] foreign
