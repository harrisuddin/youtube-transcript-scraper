[00:00] there  isn't  a  single  YouTuber  out  there 
 who  has  spoke  about  this  monk  mode 
 protocol
[00:05] this  is  the  most  extreme  protocol  that  I 
 found  three  years  ago  on  this
[00:12] this 
 underground  group  that's  what  we'll  call 
 them  that  no  longer  really  exist
[00:19] this  is  the  hardest  mug  mode  protocol 
 out  there 
 and  it's  not  one  of  those  average  ones
[00:24] where  you're  supposed  to  meditate  for  10 
 minutes  a  day  and  not  not  drink  coffee 
 or  something
[00:29] this  is  specifically  for  the  men  who 
 genuinely  need  to  fix  their  lives
[00:35] if  you  look  around  right  now 
 and  your  room
[00:40] is  filthy 
 and  your  mind  is  filthy
[00:46] and  your  body  is  flabby 
 and  you  need  something  extreme  to  change
[00:53] your  life 
 then  this  is  probably  going  to  be  the 
 monk  mode  protocol  for  you
[01:02] I  was  in  this  position  about  three  years 
 ago  exactly  three  years  ago  today 
 exactly  three  years  ago  March  2020
[01:10] that  was  the  month  of  the  months 
 where  I  used  to  stay  up  late  till  2  3  4
[01:17] A.M 
 and  I  used  to  go  on  the  website  for  Chan 
 I  used  to  be  like  you  don't  understand
[01:22] this  bro 
 I  used  to  be  a  four  Channel  if  you  don't 
 know  what  4chan  is  it's  like  one  of  the
[01:28] most  like  [ __ ]  disgusting  dirty 
 websites  out  there
[01:33] it's  like  it's  where  the  full-on 
 degenerates  go  and  I  used  to  be  the  guy 
 who'd  go  on  there  till  4am  watching  like
[01:40] disgusting  porn 
 just  wasting  time  I'd  be  high  as  [ __ ] 
 whilst  doing  it
[01:46] I  used  to  literally  fap  at  least  five 
 times  a  day
[01:53] I'd  literally 
 I  would  wake  up  right 
 I'd  wake  up  I'd  go  to  the  toilet  I
[01:59] always  needed  like  I  I've  always  needed 
 this  [ __ ]  in  the  morning  it's  just 
 something  I  don't  know  so  I  wake  up  have
[02:04] a  [ __ ]  first  thing  right 
 and  these  were  the  months  where  I  used 
 to  have  a  [ __ ]  and  whilst  I  was  having  a
[02:09] [ __ ]  I  would  fap 
 every  morning
[02:14] and  I  actually  wanted  to  be  an 
 entrepreneur  I  wanted  to  be  like 
 successful  at  this  time  so  straight 
 afterwards  you  know  the  idea  would  be
[02:20] okay  come  on  let's  get  on  my  laptop 
 let's  learn  like  these  online  money 
 making  methods  like  Drop  Shipping  and
[02:25] writing  ebooks  and  like  coding  was 
 becoming  really  popular  at  the  start  of 
 of  covid
[02:30] so  I'm  trying  to  learn  how  to  like  make 
 a  website  or  some  [ __ ]  you  know  I'm  just 
 trying  loads  of  different  things  and  my 
 habits  are  so  terrible  I  needed  like  a
[02:37] complete  complete  Extreme  Makeover
[02:45] and  I  found  this  idea 
 and  genuinely  I  knew  what  I  was  about  to
[02:50] teach  you  in  in  this  video  was  gonna 
 work  for  me 
 I  went  from  being  a  full-on  degenerate
[02:56] who  was  broke 
 it's  a  long  story  but  I  literally  had 
 less  money  than  a  homeless  man  that  I
[03:01] was  hell  that  I  was  helping  there  was  a 
 homeless  guy  I  was  helping  he  literally 
 had  more  money  than  I  did
[03:08] bro 
 imagine  being  Broker  Than  a  homeless  guy 
 that  you're  helping
[03:21] for  some  dark  days  what  I'm  telling  you 
 right  now  doesn't  really  justify  uh  that 
 period  of  my  life
[03:27] I  am  um 
 I  will  have  a  book  published  about  my 
 life  later  on  this  year  it'll  be  like  my
[03:34] first  like  book  and  I  think  it'll  be 
 quite  inspiring  to  read  like  the  details 
 of  my  life  that  I  haven't  Dove  that
[03:40] deeply  into  on  YouTube  and  you'll  read 
 about  this  period  of  my  life  or  the  the
[03:45] details 
 me  helping  this  homeless  guy  whilst  I 
 was  broke  and 
 I  used  to  I  used  to  get  night  sweat  I
[03:52] couldn't  sleep  at  night  for  months 
 so  much  [ __ ]  I  was  going  through  around
[03:58] this  time 
 and  I  got  myself  out
[04:05] I  made  a  huge  change  to  my  life  I  got 
 onto  this  monk  mode  protocol  that  we're
[04:10] gonna  like  fully  I'm  gonna  give  you  this 
 full  guide  to  literally  all  you  just 
 have  to  do  is  just  not  be  a  Jeffrey  stop
[04:17] scrolling  down  to  the  comments  for  extra 
 dopamine  stop  looking  at  the  suggested 
 video  stop  checking  your  phone
[04:23] and  for  the  first  time  in  a  little  while 
 just  hold  direct  eye  contact  with  me
[04:28] right  now  and  throughout  this  video 
 this  video  is  fairly  long  so  100  if  you
[04:34] need  to  split  it  up  and  watch  a  little 
 bit  tomorrow  that's  absolutely  fine  but 
 for  what  any  minute  any  second  that
[04:40] you're  gonna  spend  on  this  video  give  it 
 like  full  attention  no  scrolling  down 
 make  it  full  screen  and  just  [ __ ]
[04:46] stare  at  me  practice  like  some  presents 
 like  you  know  really  really  invest  into
[04:52] this  mentally  and  think  okay  you  know 
 he's  describing  things  that  are  quite 
 similar  to  my  life  so  maybe  you  know  he
[04:58] got  himself  out  and  like  oh  [ __ ]  he's 
 got  two  million  subscribers  or  1.9 
 million  subscribers  so  you  know  he's 
 he's  probably  kind  of  successful  now  so
[05:03] it's  kind  of  insane  that  in  only  three 
 years  he's  been  able  to  transform  his 
 life
[05:11] because  if  you  can  relate  to  the  kind  of 
 life  that  I  had  just  three  years  ago 
 and  you  maybe  want  to  get  to  the  point
[05:17] where  I  am  now 
 with  quite  a  successful  business  and
[05:25] I  don't  know  man  it's  it's  always  looked 
 down  upon  to  talk  about  your  successes
[05:30] online  like  if  I  if  I  was  about  to  list 
 some  some  accomplishments  to  you  but 
 then  people  often  just  kind  of  think
[05:35] you're  a  bad  person  if  you  talk  about 
 your  success  online  I  think  that  comes 
 from  you  know  people's  own  um
[05:41] low  self-esteem  or  something
[05:47] but  maybe  you  can  just  speculate  what 
 kind  of  life  that  I  have  and  how  much 
 money  that  I  make  with  a  channel  this
[05:52] big 
 bearing  in  mind  that  being  a  YouTuber 
 was  genuinely  my  childhood  or  my  Teenage
[05:58] Dream
[06:04] so  what  I  did
[06:09] I  got  onto  this  monk  mode  protocol  that 
 we  can  describe  as  military  discipline
[06:16] I  copied  what  the  military  use  it's  a  TR 
 not  to  train
[06:22] but  to  destroy  their  new  recruits  I
[06:27] copied  what  the  military  do  to  destroy 
 their  newest  recruits  and  I  did  that 
 myself  without  being  in  the  military
[06:35] you  know  how  like  the  guys  who  want  to 
 join  the  Army  you  go  through  like  you 
 know  some  assessment  periods  whatever
[06:40] health  checks  but  then  if  you  do  get 
 accepted  and  enlisted  and  then  you  go 
 and  you  go  to  the  boot  camp  the  basic
[06:46] training  for  like  eight  weeks  and  it's 
 just  a  grueling  period  of  of  okay  5am 
 wake  up  5  30
[06:52] bed  and  uniform  inspection  6  a.m  drill  7 
 A.M  workout  9  A.M  eat  9  30  this  like
[07:01] don't  regimented  like  an  extreme  version 
 of  the  timetable  that  we  had  in  school 
 where  every  part  of  your  day  was  planned
[07:07] out  beforehand  and  you  had  to  be  the 
 this  extreme  discipline  that  you  would
[07:12] trim  your  hair  off  for 
 that  that  not  only  trains  the  young  men
[07:17] who  are  the  recruits  but  it  destroys 
 them  it  pushes  them  past  the  point  that 
 they  thought  they  could  ever  get  to
[07:23] and  then  pushes  them  past  that  point 
 it  destroys  them  and  rebuilds  them
[07:31] I  realize  that  this  is  actually  what  I 
 needed
[07:37] and  on  a  little  bit  of  a  side  track  I 
 did  actually  enlist  into  the  Royal  Air 
 Force  because  I  wanted  this  experience
[07:46] I  decided  to  be  a  YouTuber  instead  so  it 
 kind  of  worked  out  for  me  but  still
[07:52] the  idea  behind  all  this 
 was  just  copying  this  military
[07:57] discipline  and  and  to  be  productive  all 
 day  you  see  at  the  time  I  was  looking  at
[08:02] some  self-improvement  videos  like  you 
 might  do 
 and  I  was  honestly
[08:07] I  was  only  seeing  soft  [ __ ]  I 
 was  only  seeing  soft  guys  recommend  to
[08:12] you  like  cute  little  phrases  like  don't 
 push  yourself  too  hard  and  it's  about 
 the  journey  not  the  destination  and  and
[08:19] you  know  it's  okay  like  you  know  life's 
 about  balance  and  it's  okay  to  play  one 
 hour  video  games  it's  okay  to  you  know 
 just  eat  a  little  bit  of  junk  food  it's
[08:25] okay  to  smoke  a  little  bit  of  weed  maybe 
 for  healthy  people  maybe  for  normal 
 people  that's  fine
[08:31] but  I've  known  I'm  not  in  like  a  normal 
 average  person  I'm  not  a  mediocre  person
[08:36] so  that  hasn't  been  fine  for  me  because 
 I  am  a  shell  of  the  man  that  I'm 
 supposed  to  be  if  I  don't  live  to  my
[08:41] potential 
 and  I  think  you  should  say  that  I  think 
 you  should  like  whisper  those  words 
 outside  of  your  mouth  right  now  and  if
[08:47] you've  got  more  confidence  say  it  loudly 
 I  am  a  shell  of  the  man  that  I  am 
 supposed  to  be  if  I  do  not  live  to  my
[08:54] potential 
 and  one  hour  of  video  games  a  day  and  a 
 little  bit  of  weed  put  into  a  [ __ ]
[08:59] crack  pipe  like  that's  how  I  used  to 
 smoke  weed  is  not  like  it  rolled  up  into 
 a  smoking  joint  but  I  would  put  it  in  a
[09:05] pipe  and  like  all  that  or  like  in  a 
 [ __ ]  plastic  bong  that  crackheads  use 
 a  little  bit  of  that  like  would  any  of
[09:11] us  say  like  oh  guys  come  on  like  just 
 just  a  little  bit  of  Pawn  is  okay
[09:17] no 
 I  couldn't  have  lived  like  that 
 I'm  a  very  extreme  guy  and  and  when  you
[09:24] are  like  me 
 your  life  is  going  to  be  one  of  the  two 
 extremes  either  you're  going  to  be
[09:29] extremely  [ __ ]  up  and  you  need  to  fix 
 your  life  or  you're  going  to  be 
 extremely  successful
[09:35] and  I  think  the  beautiful  thing  about 
 the  internet  about  what  you're  literally 
 watching  right  now
[09:40] not  to  sound  like  egotistical  or 
 something  but  you're  genuinely  watching 
 like  you're  listening  to  someone  who's
[09:45] giving  you  advice  who  has  crossed  this 
 I  have  bridged  this  Gap  from  extremely
[09:51] stupid  extremely  lazy  extremely  weak 
 extremely  drug  addicted  extremely  sex
[09:57] addicted 
 to  what  a  lot  of  people  would  call 
 extremely  successful
[10:05] I'm  certainly  not  all  the  way  there  I've 
 got  so  much  more  to  learn  and  you  know 
 to  keep  building
[10:12] but  this  is  the  beauty  this  is  the 
 beauty 
 you're  learning  today  from  someone  who's
[10:17] actually  done  this  journey 
 because  at  the  time  when  I  was  looking 
 at  like  self-improvement  advice  and  you
[10:23] know  how  to  like  stop  playing  video 
 games  and  everything  and  everyone's 
 telling  me  like  oh  you  know  but  you  know 
 like  just  if  you  want  to  play  one  hour  a
[10:29] day  that  you  know  you  go  ahead  and  you 
 know  like  this  and 
 I  was  just  thinking  like
[10:34] I  can't  relate  to  any  of  these 
 [ __ ]  giving  advice  online 
 I  needed  someone  who  was  quite  extreme
[10:39] who  was  gonna  tell  me  like  you're  better 
 than  playing  even  one  second  of  video 
 games
[10:45] and  so  I  became  that  person  for  myself 
 and  so 
 I'm  going  to  walk  you  through  the  exact
[10:50] process  that  I  did 
 and  I  think  this  will  change  your  life
[10:56] as  much  as  it  changed  mine 
 at  the  time  of  recording  this  video
[11:01] we're  close  to  the  end  of  March  in  2023 
 and  I'd  like  you  now
[11:07] just  to  prep  ourselves  and  get  ready  for 
 the  four  steps  of  this  protocol  it's 
 just  to  close  your  eyes
[11:13] and  just  to  imagine  what  you  want  the 
 end  of  this  year  to  be  like 
 what  you  want  December  to  be  like
[11:23] what  do  you  want  to  be  like  who  do  you 
 want  to  be  what  goals  do  you  want  to 
 accomplish  and  how  will  it  feel  when 
 you've  accomplished  those  goals  and  you
[11:29] walk  past  the  people 
 who  doubted  you
[11:34] and  also  how  would  it  feel 
 when  you're  surrounded  by  the  people  who
[11:39] always  believed  in  you  and  they  do 
 finally  see  that  you've  lived  up  to  your 
 potential
[11:45] the  Pats  on  the  back 
 the  warm  welcome  the  respect
[11:51] the  improved  posture  the  way  that  you 
 carry  yourself  now 
 the  way  that  your  shirt  fits  tight  on
[11:57] your  sleeves  because  you've  been  hitting 
 the  gym  hard  and  you've  been  improving 
 your  diets
[12:03] how  awesome  it  feels  that  when  you  do 
 finally  go  out  with  a  bunch  of  good 
 people
[12:08] you  cover  the  bill  like  it's  nothing 
 because  you  are  that  one  now
[12:13] and  you  can  get  to  that  point  faster 
 than  you  think  it  can 
 the  protocol  that  we're  about  to  discuss
[12:18] today  has  four  steps  and  you  must  go 
 through  each  step  consecutively  like  one
[12:24] two  three  four  you  must  do  that  there's 
 gonna  be  points  in  each  of  these  steps 
 that  you're  not  going  to  want  to  do  and
[12:30] there's  going  to  be  points  in  each  of 
 these  steps  that  your  brain  is  going  to 
 start  to  convince  you  and  say  like  oh  no 
 no  you  don't  need  to  do  that  one  yeah  no
[12:36] that's  a  bit  extreme  don't  do  that 
 I  want  to  tell  you  right  now
[12:42] you  are  where  you  are  because  you've 
 listened  to  your  brain 
 so  if  you  look  around  right  now  and
[12:47] again  there's  filth  if  you  look  at  your 
 bank  balance  and  it's  filth
[12:52] if  you  aren't  at  a  good  place  in  life  if 
 you're  a  bad  place  where  you  need  to 
 watch  a  video  like  this  which  is  about
[12:57] how  to  fix  your  life  I'm  telling  you 
 right  now  your  brain  got  you  here
[13:02] for  a  lot  of  people  out  in  the  world  you 
 can't  actually  trust  your  brain  you
[13:07] trusted  your  brain  and  it  got  you  to 
 this  moment  that  you  need  to  fix  your 
 life 
 some  of  the  best  advice  I  ever  heard  was
[13:13] don't  trust  your  own  Brain  Trust  the 
 brain  of  the  person  who's  achieved  what 
 you  want  to  achieve
[13:19] you  trusted  your  brain  and  you  it  led  up 
 to  you  being  in  this  moment  right  now 
 when  you're  probably  broken  on  her
[13:25] unhappy  unhealthy 
 so  when  you're  you're  Jeffrey  brain  when
[13:30] your  lizard  brain  does  pipe  up  and  it 
 does  tell  you  like  oh  no  you  don't  need 
 to  do  do  what  he's  saying  right  now  nah
[13:36] nah  nah  you  don't  have  to  do  that 
 just  understand  that  when  you  have 
 listened  to  your  brain  it  hasn't  LED  you
[13:41] to  a  good  place  in  life 
 let's  go  over  the  four  Pro  steps  of  this
[13:47] protocol  the  first  step  is  to  set 
 reasonable  goals
[13:52] you  see  a  lot  of  people  get  onto  monk 
 mode  or  onto  a  period  where  they  want  to
[13:57] improve  their  lives  like  you've  probably 
 tried  to  improve  your  life  before  but 
 here's  the  issue  when  you  don't  set  a 
 clear  goal  when  you  don't  have  like  a
[14:04] piece  of  paper  like  maybe  I  should  just 
 show  you  you  want  to  see  something 
 look  this  is  literally  my  wall
[14:11] I  have  pieces  of  paper  over  my  wall 
 with  my  goals  written  on  them  and  my
[14:16] plans  what  what  the  paper  like  I  know 
 you're  probably  trying  to  pause  the 
 video  I  think  anyway  I  need  to  see  what
[14:21] it  says  it  doesn't  matter  what  it  says 
 it's  just  simply  my  goals  you  don't  need 
 to  copy  exactly  what  it  says  it's  just
[14:26] literally  okay  I've  got  goals  I've  got 
 notes  and  stuff 
 we're  the  extreme  kind  of  guy  where  we
[14:31] need  to  put  our  goals  in  our  face  you 
 know  some  some  guys  can  literally  just 
 think  of  a  new  goal  and  just  go  and 
 achieve  it  we're  the  kind  of  people  that
[14:37] we  need  to  like  think  of  a  new  goal  set 
 it  as  our  phone  wallpaper  literally 
 write  it  on  paper  and  stick  it  up  on  our
[14:42] [ __ ]  wall  stick  it  up  on  our  door  and 
 everything  to  kind  of  remind  ourselves 
 like  to  obsess  over  it  with  just  those
[14:48] kinds  of  people  we  need  to  be  quite 
 extreme 
 we  need  to  set  reasonable  goals  and
[14:54] specifically  do  sets  written  out  goals 
 for  this  because  a  lot  of  guys  will  try 
 to  improve  their  lives  like  you  may  have
[14:59] and  within  three  days  you  kind  of  lose 
 direction  get  a  bit  bored  it's  a  little 
 bit  too  hard  and  then  you  go  back  to
[15:05] watching  Rick  and  Morty  and  playing 
 video  games  with  your  Discord  friends 
 again  has  that  not  happened  to  you
[15:10] before 
 we  can't  have  that  happen  again  and  the 
 reason  why  this  happens  the  reason  why 
 you  make  a  little  bit  of  progress  and
[15:15] then  you  snap  back  to  where  you  were  is 
 because  you  didn't  set  this  clear  goal
[15:20] to  actually  reach  for  you  didn't  set 
 this  goal  that  you  genuinely  believed 
 you  could  achieve
[15:26] interestingly  before  I  have  said  that  we 
 should  set  massive  goals  I  think  that  we 
 should  be  very  ambitious  men  but
[15:32] when  you're  at  this  point  right  now  when 
 you  need  to  fix  your  life 
 this  is  so  interesting  if  you  set  a  big
[15:38] goal  right  now 
 it  will  actually  be  a  bad  thing  for  you
[15:44] remember  that  if  we  set  a  big  goal  right 
 now  really  big  audacious  you  know
[15:49] ambitious  goals  like  yeah  I  want  to  be 
 really  rich  in  a  year  or  something  it 
 will  be  a  bad  thing  because  you  simply
[15:54] don't  have  the  capacity  for  that  so  this 
 is  gonna  somewhat  hurt  our  egos  but  also
[15:59] slightly  excite  us  because  it's 
 something  we  haven't  tried  we  need  to 
 set  such  a  reasonable  goal
[16:05] that  is  almost  gonna  seem  like  it's 
 below  us  and  we're  gonna  think  again 
 we're  almost  gonna  be  smug  like  yeah  I 
 could  do  that  easily
[16:14] there's  a  lot  of  people  online  right  now 
 who  say  that  you  shouldn't  set  goals  and 
 that  the  journey  is  better  than  the
[16:20] destination  and  that  with  systems  you 
 know  James  Clear  in  his  book  Atomic 
 habits  says  this  and  a  lot  of  people 
 start  pirating  it  our  systems  over  goals
[16:27] you  should  just  you  know  know  like  what 
 habits  and  systems  to  do  over  goals  it's 
 like  all  of  that  is  is  brain  dead  to  me
[16:32] because  the  reason  why  we  set  systems 
 the  reason  why  we  develop  habits  is  for
[16:37] the  goal  with  the  goal  is  like  the 
 navigation  this  is  like  like  when  you 
 get  into  like  in  a  car  you  know  where
[16:42] you're  going  that's  the  whole  point  you 
 set  the  goal  okay  I  want  to  go  to  this 
 this  shop  over  there  that's  the  goal
[16:48] then  you  focus  on  the  road  but  once  you 
 know  that  you're  going  to  that  goal  a
[16:53] lot  of  people  in  these  days  criticize 
 goal  setting  and  say  that  it's  not 
 needed  and  instead  you  should  just  do 
 like  systems  and  you  know  this  wholesome
[16:59] cute  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  that's  not  how  it  works 
 you  need  to  have  the  clear  goal  to  begin 
 with  and  then  you  do  the  [ __ ]  like
[17:05] systems  and  your  daily  habits  to  get 
 there
[17:10] this  is  what  we're  gonna  do  and  I  will 
 do  it  next  to  you  grab  a  piece  of  paper
[17:15] right  now  and  a  pen  you  can  use  a 
 computer  or  a  phone  or  whatever  you  want
[17:20] to  do  but  find  somewhere  that  we  can 
 write  I'm  gonna  do  this  together  right 
 now  so  if  right  now  your  brain's  already 
 telling  you  that  yeah  yeah  just  continue
[17:25] watching  I'll  do  this  later  that  means 
 you're  a  [ __ ]  get  ready  to  write  right 
 now  there's  no  excuses  this  is
[17:30] non-negotiable  if  you're  not  going  to 
 follow  these  steps  then  don't  watch  this 
 video 
 by  now  you  are  literally  ready  to  write
[17:37] agreed  you're  not  just  gonna  say  oh  I'll 
 do  this  later  do  this  with  me  right 
 in  this  paper
[17:43] we're  gonna  write  five  to  ten  goals  that 
 we  want  to  achieve  by  the  end  of  this 
 year  so  by  December  if  you're  watching
[17:48] this  video  later  on  and  it's  like 
 September  maybe  change  it  to  like  six 
 months  from  now  but  by  the  end  of  this
[17:53] year  through  the  month  of  December  we 
 want  to  achieve  these  goals  we're  going 
 to  write  five  to  ten  down  and  so  for
[17:58] example  I  could  say  one  thousand  Subs 
 that  could  be  like  my  first  goal  there
[18:03] one  thousand  Subs 
 go  and  you  do  this  now  right  five  to  ten
[18:08] goals 
 so  over  December  we'll  say  either  by  the
[18:13] end  of  the  new  year  or  maybe  what  I  like 
 to  do  personally  is  to  think  about  what 
 I  will  achieve  through  the  month  of
[18:19] December  so  over  December  I  will  make 
 500  dollars
[18:25] online 
 with  that  see  500  online
[18:32] by  the  end  of  the  year  I  will  also  bulk 
 up 
 15  pounds  gone  write  your  five  to  ten
[18:38] goals  right  now  and  I'll  write  mine  do 
 them  right  now  keep  the  video  playing 
 because  I'm  gonna  write  mine  right  now 
 we'll  do  this  together
[18:54] foreign
[19:03] what  do  you  want  to  achieve  by  the  end 
 of  the  year
[19:09] if  you've  got  five  to  ten  I've  got  six 
 right  now
[19:38] okay  I've  got  eight  done 
 we've  wrote  down  what  goals  we  hope  to
[19:43] achieve  by  the  end  of  the  year 
 we've  got  eight  I  told  you  to  write  five
[19:49] to  ten  right  I  want  you  to  look  at  this 
 list  right  now
[19:54] and  ask  yourself
[19:59] what  two  goals 
 let's  say  two  to  three  at  a  Max  three
[20:06] one  to  three 
 the  the less  you  choose  for  this  the 
 better  right  if  you  can  just  choose  one
[20:11] that's  even  better  if  you  can  choose  two 
 that's  pretty  good  if  you  can  choose 
 three  that's  acceptable  but  just  one 
 from  one  to  three
[20:17] what  one  to  three  goals  here 
 are  the  most  meaningful  most  impactful
[20:22] that  you  would  like  that  are  the 
 priority  look  around  for  these  like  up 
 to  three  you  can  choose  but  if  you
[20:28] choose  one  that's  way  better  if  there's 
 only  one  that  you  really  care  about  but 
 if  for  example  you  can  choose  up  to
[20:33] three  so  if  looking  at  this  list 
 check  out  the  three  that  you  think  that 
 will  change  your  life  the  most  that  you
[20:39] really  want  to  do  you  really  want  to 
 achieve 
 and  for  those  three  just  circle  them
[20:46] Circle  the  three  goals  or  up  to  three 
 goals  that  are  the  most  important
[20:55] so  mine  are  the  three  that  I  wrote  down 
 first 
 I've  got  one  thousand  Subs  500  a  month
[21:02] online 
 bulk  up  15  pounds  and  then  I  have
[21:07] encircled  the  ones  which  are  kind  of 
 less  important  and  they  are  go  traveling 
 make  a  Blog  learn  to  rap  run  a  marathon
[21:15] write  a  book  and  random  other  ones  right 
 you  right  now  should  have  some  goals
[21:20] which  are  circled  and  some  that  aren't 
 this  is  very  important
[21:26] the  goals  that  are  not  circled 
 cross  them  out
[21:32] aggressively  cross  them  out 
 because  it  is  these  goals
[21:41] it  is  these  goals 
 that  will  stop  you  from  achieving  the 
 ones  in  the  circle
[21:49] one  thing  that  I  should  have  said  just  a 
 few  minutes  ago  in  terms  of  what  we've 
 wrote  down  here
[21:54] we  should  also  write  down  the  the  real
[21:59] real  goals  that  you  have 
 you  see  what  we've  wrote  here  like  1  000
[22:04] subscribers  and  500  a  month  online  this 
 is  like  nice  boy  stuff  this  is  like  yeah
[22:09] guys  I  want  to  be  productive 
 but  you  should  also  know  right  now  and
[22:15] don't  [ __ ]  yourself 
 that  you  have  some  dark  desires  that  you 
 have  some  real  reasons  why  you  want  to
[22:21] achieve  these  things 
 you  probably  know  what  I'm  hinting  at
[22:26] we  all  have  these  like  real  goals  inside 
 of  our  mind  inside  of  our  hearts  and
[22:31] inside  of  our  genitals 
 and  it'd  be  worth  it  for  you  to  right 
 now  you  know  as  part  of  the  the  ones
[22:37] we've  just  scribbled  out 
 to  maybe  add  in  there  some  of  those
[22:43] that  show  you  know  the  eight  goals  that 
 I've  wrote  down  here  1  000  subscribers 
 and  learn  to  rap  These  are  nice
[22:49] but  actually  a  big  goal  that  you  have 
 maybe  to  try  and  [ __ ]  as  many  women  as
[22:55] possible 
 a  big  goal  that  you  have  maybe  to  try
[23:00] and  make  enough  money  to  buy  a  car 
 because  you  visualize  yourself  driving 
 through  the  streets  with  this  car  and
[23:06] hopefully  get  some  level  of  status  that 
 will  allow  you  to  sleep  with  more  girls
[23:11] maybe  you  want  to  go  party  maybe  you 
 want  to  go  take  some  drugs  maybe  you 
 finally  want  to  go  get  the  girl  or  make
[23:17] some  friends  who  you  know  might  not  be 
 good  for  you
[23:23] the  reason  why  I'm  making  you  do  this 
 practice  is  to  understand  that 
 we  only  have  a  limited  capacity  for  the
[23:30] things  that  we  can  accomplish  and  if  we 
 can  hyper  focus  on  just  a  few  things
[23:36] we  can  accomplish  them  but  when  we  open 
 up  the  desire  for  more  things  that  will
[23:41] actually  lead  to  less  success 
 these  three  goals  that  I've  circled  here
[23:47] 1  000  subscribers  five  hundred  dollars  a 
 month  online  and  both  got  15  pounds 
 they're  awesome  goals  but  if  I  also  try
[23:54] to  do  some  of  the  other  ones  like  go 
 traveling  and  write  a  blog  and  learn  to 
 rap  and  run  a  marathon  and  write  a  book
[23:59] those  would  actually  distract  you  to  the 
 point  that  you  achieve  nothing
[24:05] the  most  successful  guys  literally  just 
 focus  on  one  thing
[24:10] think  about  it  like  the  reason  why  you 
 look  up  to  a  particular  athlete 
 is  for  one  reason
[24:17] no  one  would  say  to  Mike  Tyson
[24:25] oh  but  you  you  you  you  can't  rap  though
[24:30] but  no  because  he  was  a  boxer 
 do  you  understand  what  I'm  getting  at
[24:35] here 
 the  route  to  success  that  you  actually
[24:41] really  need  is  to  simplify  your  life  and 
 to  destroy  these  distractions  these 
 other  desires  that  you  have
[24:47] and  to  just  focus  in  on  just  the  few 
 that  will  really  change  your  life  and  so 
 if  I  was  going  to  be  honest  to  you  when
[24:53] I  was  in  your  position  a  few  years  ago 
 and  I  was  like  you  know  really  thinking 
 okay  what  I  wanted  to  achieve  in  life
[24:59] I  would  have  wrote  on  this  paper  for 
 goal  number  nine 
 [ __ ]
[25:06] I  wanted  to  [ __ ]  a  lot  of  girls  I  would 
 have  wrote  as  number  10  party
[25:11] because  I  wanted  to  party  and  I  linked 
 that  to  [ __ ]  because  I  wanted  to 
 party  so  I  could  [ __ ]  more  girls
[25:18] and  buy  [ __ ] 
 buy  materialistic  objects
[25:24] probably  because  it  didn't  lead  to  me 
 [ __ ]  more  girls
[25:29] it's  worth  it  right  now  for  you  to  think 
 about  what  your  your  real  desires  are 
 and  you'd  have  to  tell  me  you'd  have  to
[25:34] write  them  on  paper 
 but  don't  [ __ ]  yourself  you  have 
 some  real  desires  that  you  don't  want  to
[25:39] talk  about 
 you  should  own  those  desires  you  should 
 not  be  afraid  of  them  you  should  not  be
[25:44] scared  of  them  in  the  modern  day  we're 
 so  scared  of  our  dark  desires 
 we're  so  scared  of  our  dark  desires  that
[25:51] sometimes  you  desire  to  to  violently 
 violently  dominate  another  man  violently
[25:57] brutally  dominate  a  woman 
 the  modern  day  we're  so  scared  to  say
[26:02] this 
 we  put  on  our  like  happy  faces  yep  yep
[26:07] see  we're  all  civil 
 you  have  inside  of  you  that  the  blood
[26:12] and  the  DNA  from  the  Vikings 
 the  merchants
[26:19] the  Warriors 
 you  have  inside  of  you
[26:24] the  DNA  of  a  man  in  your  bloodline 
 who  smiled  as  he  ripped  apart  another
[26:31] man  and  then  raped  his  wife
[26:37] in  the  modern  day  we  don't  talk  about 
 this  at  all 
 and  that's  actually  a  problem
[26:43] some  little  chump  can  watch  this  and 
 think  yep  see  hums  is  a  misogynist  and 
 he's  promoting  violence  and  like  no
[26:49] that's  clearly  not  what  we're  doing  here 
 we  should  acknowledge
[26:54] all  sides  to  ourselves  especially  our 
 shower  our  shadow  our  dark  side  we
[26:59] should  acknowledge  it  understand  it's 
 there 
 and  realize  how  we  can  even  harness  that
[27:05] dark  desire  for  a  positive  impact  on 
 ourselves  and  the  world
[27:11] you  see  when  I  did  this  and  I  realized 
 that  I  was  deeply  motivated  by  quite
[27:17] frankly  wanting  to  [ __ ]  as  many  girls  as 
 possible 
 this  is  when  my  motivation  to  be
[27:22] productive  and  successful  first  came  in 
 when  I  realized  that  this  was  a  desire 
 that  I  had  that  I  literally  like  if  I'm
[27:28] being  honest  to  you  bro  I  could  imagine 
 no  life  better  than  than  one  of  like
[27:33] Genghis  Khan  just  pillaging  Villages  and 
 stuff  and  taking  all  their  women  and 
 literally  having  thousands  of  babies  I
[27:40] know  that  this  is  [ __ ]  crazy  of 
 course  I'm  not  gonna  do  that  but  like  if 
 I  was  going  to  be  totally  honest  that's 
 like  I've  always  kind  of  felt  that  I've
[27:46] always  known  it  but  like  we  don't  talk 
 about  these  things  right  and  so  I  could 
 have  just  like  you  know  buried  it  deep 
 like  everyone  else  has  and  we've  all  got
[27:52] them  right  so  if  some  little  [ __ ] 
 skinny  neck  chump  is  going  to  look  at 
 this  and  be  like  yeah  this  is  so  evil 
 guys  it's  like  trust  me  the  guys  who
[27:58] think  that  what  we're  talking  about 
 right  now  is  evil  or  scary  they've  got 
 Works  worse  dark  desires  than  like  the
[28:04] guy  who  can  openly  say  it 
 but  what  I  realized  this  years  ago  that 
 I  was  deeply  motivated  by  this  idea  of
[28:10] like  dominating  and  spreading  my  seed 
 and  in  a  way  that  I'm  obviously  not
[28:15] gonna  do  Suddenly  It's  like  I  I  was  able 
 to  reframe  things  like  the  work  that  I'm
[28:20] doing  in  a  way  that  now  started  to 
 deeply  motivate  me  it  was  like  I  was 
 able  to  delude  myself  but  maybe  in  truth
[28:26] that  if  I  become  successful  in  YouTube 
 and  in  business  I  will  [ __ ]  more  girls
[28:33] I  will  elevate  my  status  to  a  point  then 
 where  there's  higher  quality  women
[28:39] who  want  me  to  impregnate  them 
 now  you've  never  heard  someone  talk  like 
 this  before
[28:45] this  is  just  unspoken  about  because  this 
 is  weird  this  is  abnormal  this  is  going
[28:50] to  get  me  branded  as  a  weird  person  but 
 I'm  telling  you  right  now  but  this  saved 
 my  life
[28:55] because  suddenly  I  integrated  that 
 shadow  inside  of  me  and  it  started  to
[29:00] fuel  the  good  habits  that  I  was  doing 
 and  of  course  I  haven't  went  to  any
[29:05] Village  in  [ __ ]  cut  a  man  open  in 
 half  and  raped  his  wife  of  course  if  not 
 bro  but  like  I  was  able  to  take  that
[29:11] core  dark  desire  that  is  inside  of  each 
 of  us  man  and  woman  child
[29:16] is  inside  of  each  of  us 
 and  reframe  that  in  a  way  that
[29:21] slingshotted  me  to  make  it  more  progress 
 on  my  goals 
 I  don't  expect  you  to  be  ready  for  this
[29:28] to  be  ready  to  do  this  task  maybe  you're 
 just  watching  this  thinking  okay  this  is 
 a  bit  weird  what  the  [ __ ]  happening  in 
 this  video  I  just  thought  that  he's  just
[29:33] gonna  teach  us  about  monkey  world  but  he 
 wants  us  to  rape  and  kill  some  people 
 like  no  I  totally  understand  if  you
[29:38] don't  understand  but  there's  gonna  be  a 
 moment  when  you'll  think  back  to  what 
 I'm  saying  here 
 and  you'll  think  oh  [ __ ]  I  could  have
[29:45] actually  made  this  progress  so  much 
 faster  if  I  just  really  thought  about 
 what  he  was  saying
[29:51] once  you  have  these  goals 
 this  is  the  direction  of  our  monk  mode
[29:56] for  me  the  three  goals  that  I  have 
 chosen  reflect  this  period  of  my  life
[30:01] which  is  all  about  business  and  health 
 my  first  goal  which  is  very  ambitious  is
[30:06] to  save  one  million  dollars  this  year 
 not  just  make  but  save  one  million
[30:11] dollars 
 that  means  I  need  to  make 
 just  over  100k  a  month  which  I  know
[30:17] sounds  silly  and  stuff  but  YouTube  like 
 you  make  a  lot  of  money  as  a  big 
 YouTuber 
 second  goal  of  mine  is  to  improve  my
[30:23] health  and  that's  through  some  like 
 Health  metrics  that 
 um a  lot  of  people  don't  really  know
[30:28] about  heart  rate  variability  and  hot 
 resting  heart  rate  and  stuff  so  improve 
 my  health  and  the  third  goal  that  I  have
[30:34] for  this  period  is  to  publish  a 
 life-changing  inspirational  book
[30:39] you've  got  three  major  goals  we've 
 crossed  out  all  of  the  other  ones  we've 
 crossed  out  those  desires
[30:45] one  point  I  will  tell  you 
 is  that  you  can  have  you  know  these
[30:50] three  goals  that  we've  got  of  course 
 they  can  have  like  milestones  and  mini 
 goals  inside  of  them
[30:56] so  for  example  we're  only  going  to do 
 let's  say  three  goals  and  one  of  them 
 for  you  can  be  something  to  do  with 
 weight  lifting  or  making  muscle  you  want
[31:02] to  bulk  up  10  pounds  or  you  want  to  you 
 know  get  stronger  or  something 
 but  inside  of  that  goal  can  be  a  mini
[31:07] goal  of  like  a  milestone  so  for  example 
 one  of  your  goals  could  be  I  want  to 
 bulk  up  to  170  pounds  at  the  end  of  this
[31:14] year  and  a  mini  goal  inside  of  that 
 could  be  to  bench  press  80  kilograms
[31:19] because  it's  kind  of  relevant  you  know 
 it's  tied  to  the  same  Big  Goal  so  you 
 can  have  a  big  goal  which  then  has  like
[31:25] milestones  and  extra  things  which  are 
 completely  tied  to  it  so  that  you  know 
 you've  got  to  achieve  these  things  to  do
[31:30] the  big  goal  so  for  example  my  big  goal 
 is  publish  a  life-changing  book  but  then 
 a  mini  goal  inside  of  that  is  like  is  to
[31:36] get  David  Goggins  to  write  the  forward 
 of  like  you  know  the  start  of  the  book 
 another  goal  okay  the  big  goal  of  mine
[31:42] is  to  save  one  million  dollars  this  year 
 but  then  many  goals  inside  of  that  is  to 
 produce  like  42  videos  like
[31:49] life-changing  videos  once  a  week  onto 
 the  YouTube  channel  and  also  to  send 
 people  to  Adonis  Academy  which  is  like
[31:55] my  like  my  online  community  which  is 
 where  I  make  most  of  my  money  that's 
 Linked  In  the  description
[32:00] three  reasonable  pretty  big  goals  now  my 
 and  mine  are  big  by  the  way  like  mine
[32:05] are  really  big  like  audacious  and 
 ambitious  goals  but  I've  got  to  the 
 point  where  I  can  like  I  can  achieve
[32:11] that  so  for  you  I've  told  you  okay  you 
 don't  really  choose  reasonable  goals  but 
 that's  because  you  know  you're  just
[32:17] starting  this  journey  you  still  you're 
 still  at  the  point  where  you  need  to  fix 
 your  life  I'm  only  three  years  in  and
[32:22] look  how  much  I've  been  able  to  increase 
 my  goals  because  when  I  started  in  your 
 position  my  goals  were  probably  the  same
[32:27] as  yours  1  000  subscribers  by  the  end  of 
 the  year  and  500  pounds  through  the  the
[32:33] month  of  December  online  those  were  my 
 goals  when  I  first  started  so  you  can
[32:38] see  that  in  less  than  like  three  years 
 I  went  from  that  reasonable  goal  to  now
[32:44] what  seems  like  a  stupid  like  my  goal 
 seems  stupidly  ambitious  save  one 
 million  dollars  this  year
[32:51] I  genuinely  think  I  probably  will  I 
 probably  will  will  achieve  that  because
[32:56] they're  still  reasonable  for  me 
 does  this  make  sense  so  we  need  to  you
[33:02] need  to  really  make  sure  the  goal  that 
 you've  set  is  reasonable  for  you  and 
 your  position  in  life  right  now  the
[33:07] number  one  reason  why  you  could  fail  so 
 far  is  because  you've  set  a  goal
[33:12] that  you  genuinely  just  can't  achieve 
 because  you're  not  at  that  level  that 
 you  need  to  be
[33:17] the  bigger  a  goal  is  right  now  the  more 
 it's  actually  going  to  put  you  off  just 
 for  now  and  then  you'll  get  to  a  point
[33:23] when  you're  actually  productive  and 
 you're  working  and  you're  healthy  and  at 
 that  point  you  can  set  some  bigger  goals
[33:28] we're  on  to  the  next  step  the  second 
 step  of  this  protocol  and  this  is  the
[33:33] one  where  your  Jeffrey  brain  is  going  to 
 Hype  up  and  really  piss  you  off  now 
 for  this  step  we're  going  to  cut  out  all
[33:40] bad  habits 
 this  isn't  that  I'm  telling  you  yep  you
[33:45] can  still  play  one  hour  video 
 we're  cutting  out  all
[33:50] 100  of  our  bad  habits
[33:56] there  is  no  protocol  or  self-improvement
[34:01] Guru  online  who  speaks  like  this  all  of 
 them  tell  you  to  have  balance  all  of 
 them  tell  you  that  you  can  go  and  enjoy
[34:06] a  little  bit  don't  be  so  extreme 
 and  those  same  people  if  you  have  a  look
[34:11] at  their  YouTube  channels  or  their 
 profiles  or  whatever  and  you  scroll  down 
 for  months  and  years  you  realize  that
[34:16] they've  actually  not  even  made  that  much 
 progress  in  their  lives  they  literally 
 that
[34:21] so  you  can  choose  you  want  to  live  that 
 life  of  balance  than  you  can  but  I'm 
 telling  you  right  now  that  every 
 successful  guy  is  actually  extreme  I'm
[34:27] just  telling  you the  truth  from  what 
 I've  seen  in  a  successful  guys  they're 
 actually  all  extreme  you  can't  even  get 
 to  a  good  level  of  success  by  being  like
[34:33] a  balanced  guy  you  can  be  extreme  and 
 then  switch  your  focus  of  extremity  to 
 eventually  your  life  is  somewhat
[34:39] balanced  but  you've  got  to  have  like 
 somewhat  of  an  extreme  personality  to 
 get  to  a  good  level  of  success  which  you
[34:44] probably  do  once 
 so  we're  gonna  go  extreme  with  this  and 
 we're  going  to  cut  out  all  bad  habits
[34:50] there's  something  that  I  learned  from 
 this  this  scientist  online  on  YouTube
[34:55] called  Andrew  huberman  you  may  have  seen 
 some  of  his  posts  before  like  this 
 neuroscientist  then  he's  got  like  a  big
[35:00] podcast  with  like  2  million  subscribers 
 and  he  speaks  about  dopamine  and  how
[35:05] this  works  and  you've  probably  heard  the 
 word  dopamine  before  and  I'm  going  to 
 explain  to  you  like  the  Bro  Science 
 version  of  this  I'm  not  a  scientist  but
[35:11] I  do 
 I'm  not  a  scientist  but  I'm  the  kind  of 
 guy  who  implements  the  science  and  then
[35:16] tells  you  in  basic  English  what  to  do  so 
 I'm  going  to  tell  you  from  my 
 perspective  of  how  dopamine  will  change
[35:21] your  life  you  see  dopamine  is  kind  of 
 like  our  hormone  and  a  feeling  inside  of
[35:26] us  that  we  want  to  do  something  dopamine 
 is  like  motivation
[35:31] it's  this  feeling  this  somewhat  positive 
 feeling  that  we  want  to  go  and  do  this
[35:37] thing 
 your  dopamine  receptors  get  fried 
 through  all  bad  habits  because  modern
[35:44] day  inventions  has  has  hyper  stimulated 
 everything
[35:50] not  just  you  know  social  media  but  porn 
 all  kinds  of  internet  related  screen
[35:55] related  things  and  even  Junk  Food  and 
 Drugs  all  of  it's  like  like  a  hyper 
 amount  of  what  it  should  be
[36:02] and  so  now  when  you  do  any  bad  habits 
 your  dopamine  receptors  get  fried  to  the
[36:07] point  that  it  actually  negatively 
 impacts  you  even  when  you're  not  even 
 doing  that  bad  habit  so  if  so  this  is
[36:13] how  it  works  right  every  time  you  do  a 
 bad  habit  it  feels  good  right  so  when 
 you  play  video  games  it  feels  good  when
[36:19] you  watch  porn  it  feels  good  when  you 
 eat  junk  food  it  feels  good  and  so  you 
 get  this  rise  of  like  this  feel  nice
[36:24] feeling  but  as  soon  as  it's  done  like  as 
 soon  as  you're  done  you  know  and  you're
[36:29] cleaning  up  after  you've  just  fat  or 
 you've  you  know  you  swallowed  the  bite 
 of  food  that  was  bad  for  you  like  the
[36:34] chocolate  or  something  you  swallowed  it 
 it's  like  all  of  that  feeling  good  just
[36:39] stops 
 and  it  actually  goes  down 
 and  what's  so  interesting  with  all  of
[36:45] these  bad  habits 
 that  feeling  of  feeling  good
[36:50] it  goes  down  below  where  it  started  up 
 so  what  this  means  is  that  every  single
[36:57] time  you  do  a  bad  habit  it  actually  like 
 you  get  like  a  nice  feeling  for  some 
 time  pleasure  but  after  it's  done  after
[37:05] you've  not  after  you've  logged  off  the 
 video  game  your  Baseline  for  how  good
[37:10] you  feel  goes  down 
 and  now  sure  you  can  go  get  another  high
[37:15] like  another  fix  of  your  bad  habit  of 
 your  of  your  video  games  or  something 
 and  you'll  go  up  in  pleasure  till  you
[37:20] log  off  and  I'll  go  down  and  it'll  go 
 below  the  Baseline  and  you'll  get  a  new 
 low  bass  line  and  then  you'll  go  play
[37:27] video  games  but  you  know  the  game 
 doesn't  feel  any  fun  as  much  anymore  and 
 then  it  goes  down
[37:33] and  then  you  play  video  games  whilst 
 also  eating  junk  food  and  you  know  that 
 feels  really  nice  okay  sweetheart  okay 
 guys  I'm  gonna  go  offline  now  and  it
[37:38] goes  down  and  down  and  down  and  down  and 
 before  you  know  it  your  fat  doctor  tells
[37:43] you  that  you're  clinically  depressed  and 
 you  need  some  pills
[37:49] this  I  think  is  one  of  the  biggest 
 problems  of  the  modern  day  people's 
 dopamine  people's  like  like  feelings  of
[37:56] of  of  well-being  are  so  low  because 
 we've  all  just  overdone  the  bad  habits
[38:01] every  time  you  do  a  bad  habit  it  just 
 drops  your  Baseline  of  feeling  good  even
[38:07] lower  and  lower  and  lower
[38:12] this  is  why  bad  habits  these  modern  bad 
 habits  are  so  Cutthroats
[38:18] it's  not  just  that  you  know  you  once 
 you're  done  okay  you  know  you  get  the 
 high  and  now  okay  things  are  back  to
[38:24] normal  no  no 
 it's  like  when  you  go  back  to  normal  you 
 go  below  where  you  were  beforehand  and
[38:30] you  just  keep  going  below  and  below  and 
 below  and  below  and  before  you  know  it 
 you've  completely  forgotten
[38:36] that  childlike  happiness  that  you  used 
 to  have 
 but  you  remember  how  innocent  and  how
[38:42] genuinely  like  like  happy  and  joyful 
 used  to  be  as  a  child 
 and  we  see  this
[38:48] and  we  often  just  think  that  that's  oh 
 yeah  that's  just  what  children  are  like 
 no 
 there  are  some  adults  out  there  who  have
[38:54] the  same  childlike  happiness 
 it's  not  about  children  it's  not  about
[38:59] genetics  or  any  of  this  [ __ ] 
 it's  that  they  haven't  [ __ ]  up  their
[39:04] Baseline  through  in  excess  of  of 
 dopamine  through  an  excess  of  bad  habits
[39:09] so  what  this  means  for  you 
 is  that  we  know  the  bad  habits  are  bad
[39:16] for  us  we  know  Pawn's  bad  for  us  we  know 
 junk  food  is  bad  for  us  and  you  might  be 
 coping  right  now  there's  this  one 
 particular  bad  habit  that  you  don't
[39:21] think  is  that  bad  and  you  know  it's  not 
 that  much  of  a  problem  the  the  junk  food 
 or  maybe  it's  video  games  for  you  maybe
[39:26] it's  a  bit  of  fapping  for  you  maybe  it's 
 weed  or  something  there's  something  you 
 know  that's  already  in  your  mind  right 
 now  isn't  that  just  be  honest  is  there
[39:32] something  in  your  mind  right  now  some 
 activity  that  you  know  objectively  is 
 bad  but  like  you're  actually  trying  hard
[39:37] to  rationalize  it  and  say  like  oh  yeah  I 
 don't  know  I  don't  actually  feel  that 
 way  about  that  one  no  no  that  that
[39:43] activity  which  is  the  one  I'm  most 
 addicted  to  that  one's  fine  I  swear  guys
[39:49] you're  experiencing  that  in  your  own 
 mind  right  now  aren't  you  didn't  I  tell 
 you  that  your  own  brain  is  literally
[39:54] leading  you  astray 
 I'm  genuinely  telling  you  you  can't  even 
 trust  your  own  brain  the  reason  why
[39:59] unfortunately  is  that  these  [ __ ] 
 companies  that  have  made  these  bad 
 habits  they've  hijacked  your  brain  and 
 literally  can  like  made  you  convince
[40:06] yourself  to  keep  playing  you  know 
 because  they've  made  them  so  addictive 
 this  is  why  you  can't  even  trust  your
[40:12] own  brain  anymore 
 you  don't  even  know  what's  right  or 
 wrong  this  is  why  I'm  able  to  call  you
[40:17] out  and  say  exactly  what  your  brain's 
 going  through  because  I've  been  there 
 now  I'm  on  the  other  side  and  I  see  how
[40:22] [ __ ]  my  brain  was  how  much  I  argued 
 for  weed  how  much  I  argued  for  video
[40:27] games  and  I  look  at  it  now  like  what  the 
 [ __ ]  those  things  were  ruining  my  life 
 and  I  was  defending  them
[40:32] the  reason  why  you  you  know  like  some 
 stupid  girl  defends  Tick  Tock  is  because 
 she's  literally  been  manipulated  by
[40:38] those  software  developers  that  have  made 
 the  app  so  that  it's  so  addictive  that 
 she  fights  for  it  and  it's  the  same  with
[40:44] the  nutritionists  who  make  this  like 
 Ultra  tasty  palatable  junk  food
[40:49] you  realize  this  the  level  that  we've 
 got  to  with  you  know  Scientific 
 Technology  research  and  everything  it's
[40:55] like  these  nerds  know  how  to  make  you 
 fight  for  the  thing  that's  killing  you
[41:00] not  fight  the  thing  that's  killing  you 
 make  you  fight  for  it  in  defense  for  it
[41:09] there  is  something  in  your  mind  some 
 [ __ ]  going  on  as  a  certain 
 activity  that  you  don't  want  to  give  up
[41:15] and  it's  usually  that  one  it  is  that  one 
 that's  the  one  that's  going  to  give  you 
 the  biggest  boost  because  here  is  the
[41:21] opposite  side  of  things  when  we  do  these 
 bad  habits  our  Baseline  Goes  Down  and 
 Down  and  Down
[41:27] but  when  we  do  the  good  habits  the  hard 
 things
[41:32] what  happens 
 well  since  they're  hard  and  oftentimes 
 quite  painful
[41:38] you  know  we  feel  bad  in  some  ways  whilst 
 we  do  it  don't  we  like  exercise  for  a
[41:44] lot  of  people  feels  quite  painful 
 doesn't  it  so  it  you  go  from  here  this 
 bass  line  and  you  actually  go  below  it
[41:50] for  a  little  while  because  it's  painful 
 and  it's  really  uncomfortable  but  then 
 when  you  do  these  good  habits  like
[41:56] exercise  and  reading  and  meditation  and 
 working  hard 
 taking  a  walk  in  nature  you  know  those
[42:02] things  that  you  know  are  good  for  you 
 and  you  know  sometimes  it  feels  a  bit 
 boring  you  don't  really  want  to  and 
 stuff  it  goes  down  like  it  dips  down
[42:09] like  a  little  bit  from  Baseline  of 
 boredom  and  discomfort  but  then  it  rises 
 and  it  rises  above  the  Baseline  and  then
[42:17] you  have  a  new  Baseline 
 okay  now  you're  up  here  and  then  you  do
[42:22] the  same  thing  now  you're  gonna  go  hit 
 like  a  really  hard  workout  okay  it's 
 really  uncomfortable  now  you're  here  and
[42:27] then  you  rise  you  build  the  muscle  you 
 feel  good  about  yourself  and  your  bass 
 lines  went  higher  and  higher  and  higher
[42:32] and  higher 
 when  you  do  the  bad  habits  your  Baseline 
 of  of  how  you  feel  goes  down  and  down
[42:38] and  down  until  eventually  you  literally 
 just  feel  like  [ __ ]  24  7.  even  if  you're 
 not  even  currently  doing  the  the  bad
[42:44] habits  you  know  like  video  gamers  are 
 all  depressed  mostly  right  but  like 
 they're  not  just  depressed  when  they
[42:49] play  the  video  game  they  just  depressed 
 24  7  like  their  bass  Line's  so  [ __ ] 
 low  but  imagine  on  the  opposite  hand
[42:55] imagine  the  guy  who  is  like  a  really 
 good  athlete  he's  really  intelligent
[43:00] he's  a  really  good  student  he's  he's  got 
 like  a  really  awesome  life 
 and  he  does  nothing  right  here  right  now
[43:06] we  just  put  him  into  an  empty  room 
 he'd  just  be  smiling  like  imagine  for
[43:11] you  right  if  we  if  you  literally  over 
 the  next  nine  months  we're  Ultra 
 productive  and  you  achieve  those  three
[43:16] goals  that  you  wrote  down  and  suddenly 
 you've  literally  got  a  [ __ ]  six-pack 
 and  you're  actually  like  happy  about
[43:22] your  life  and  you've  improved  your 
 relationship  and  maybe  you've  got  a 
 girlfriend  you've  improved  your 
 relationship  with  your  family  you  know
[43:27] you've  built  a  good  life  from  doing  the 
 good  habits  and  then  let's  say  we  just 
 locked  you  in  in  an  empty  room
[43:33] you  would  sit  in  that  room  literally 
 just  with  us  like  this  happy  smile  on 
 your  face  wouldn't  you
[43:38] your  Baseline  would  be  so  high  that  you 
 don't  even  need  to  do  anything  to  feel
[43:43] good 
 that  is  when  like  the  snowball  the 
 momentum  hits  and  you  start  to  like  do
[43:48] these  these  good  habits  automatically 
 without  even  feeling  like  they're  like 
 that  hard  to  do
[43:55] people  say  that  they  just  want  to  play 
 some  video  games  and  smoke  some  weed 
 because  it's  fun  but  the  thing  is  it's 
 not  fun  because  those  people  are
[44:00] depressed  so  it's  not  fun  it's  like 
 those  people  literally  you  know  the 
 video  gamer  when  you  think  about  your
[44:05] video  game  friends  they're  not  actually 
 having  that  much  fun  in  their  day
[44:10] if  you  like  you've  watched  your  friends 
 play  video  games  sometimes  right  you've 
 literally  seen  them  just  like  this
[44:16] they're  not  actually  even  having  that 
 much  fun  when  you  really  imagine  the
[44:21] last  time  you  watched  someone  play  video 
 games  they're  literally
[44:26] of  your  [ __ ]  controllers 
 ah
[44:33] it's  like  they're  not  even  having  that 
 much  fun 
 but  when  you  see  someone  who  is  really
[44:38] really  done  a  bunch  of  good  habits  for  a 
 long  time  you  literally  see  them  just
[44:43] smiling  just  for  no  reason 
 so  this  is  the  beauty  about  cutting  out
[44:49] all  bad  habits 
 and  it's  gonna  sound  weird
[44:54] but  if  you  cut  out  all  bad  fun  habits 
 you  will  literally  have  more  fun  than
[45:00] you  did  before 
 when  you  cut  out  all  of  the  bad  habits 
 you  literally  have  more  fun  than  you  did
[45:06] when  you  were  doing  the  fun  stuff 
 but  now  you  have  it  24  7  because  of  the
[45:12] man  that  you've  become  because  the 
 accomplishments  that  you  have  and  the 
 life  that  you've  built
[45:18] video  games  porn  social  media 
 Point  like  just  watching  random
[45:23] pointless  YouTube  videos  Junk  Food  and 
 Drugs  weed  alcohol
[45:30] there's  one  important  part  of  this  and 
 it's  something  that  you  might  not  even 
 accept  right  now  and  if  you  don't  I
[45:37] guarantee  maybe  in  six  months  or  a  year 
 or  two  years  you  might  end  up  seeing 
 this  video  again
[45:42] and  you'll  wish  that  you  had  taken  this 
 piece  of  advice  that  I'm  about  to  tell 
 you
[45:48] secret  to  self-improvements  the  real 
 self-improvement  not  the  kind  of  one 
 that  you  see  like  these  [ __ ]  talk
[45:54] about  online  or  anything  but  the 
 Secret's  actually  fixing  your  life 
 is  to  genuinely  cut  out  all  bad  habits
[46:00] that  last  moment  when  you  cut  out  like 
 literally  all  of  them
[46:05] all  of  these  bad  horrible  things  for  you 
 that's  when  things  just  suddenly  go  like
[46:10] zero  to  one  and  like  the  good  habits  in 
 the  in  your  life  becomes  fun  again
[46:16] when  you  have  this  one  nagging  thing 
 that  you  don't  want  to  get  rid  of  and 
 you  could  probably  think  which  one  it  is
[46:21] for  you  right  now  when  you  keep  that  one 
 thing  in  your  life  it's  not  you  still 
 live  this  like  semi-depressed  life  and
[46:27] that  that  saps  your  spirits  it  saps  like 
 your  productivity  and  your  focus  and 
 you'll  not  achieve  the  goals  that  you
[46:33] wanted 
 remember  we're  not  like  those  average 
 mediocre  people  who  can  live  a  life  of
[46:38] balance  or  anything  we're  not  like  them 
 if  you  were  you  already  would  be  living 
 a  life  of  balance  wouldn't  you  by  you
[46:43] needing  to  fix  your  life  and  being  at 
 such  a  [ __ ]  position  beforehand  you're 
 like  we've  like  you  have  to  be  quite  an
[46:48] extreme  guy  right  because  those  balanced 
 people  they  play  Like  You  Know  video 
 games  twice  two  hours  a  day  or  something
[46:53] and  they're  just  kind  of  like  happy  just 
 being  mediocre  you're  not  one  of  them 
 you're  the  guy  most  likely  that  you've
[46:58] had  an  extreme  like  [ __ ]  life  and  you 
 could  have  an  extremely  good  life  you're
[47:03] not  the  kind  of  guy  who  can  have  like 
 somewhere  in  the  middle  most  people  are 
 near  the  middle  okay  sweet
[47:09] so  what  this  means  is  you  can't  live 
 like  most  people  you  can't  just  keep 
 video  games  in  your  life  and  expect  to
[47:14] actually  have  still  have  a  good  life 
 because  you're  not  the  kind  of  guy  who 
 can  play  one  hour  of  video  games  you  can 
 cope  and  say  like  yeah  you  know  video
[47:19] games  aren't  that  bad  it's  just  one  hour 
 to  find  like  we  can't  play  one  hour 
 we're  the  kind  of  people  we  will  play  as
[47:24] much  as  we  possibly  can  but  there's  just 
 something  like  wrong  with  us  in  that 
 sense  but  when  you  get  rid  of  these
[47:29] distractions  these  awful  things  for  you 
 suddenly  you  will  literally  enjoy
[47:34] working  and  then  it's  like  working  and 
 being  productive  to  your  goals  becomes
[47:39] your  video  game  that  you  can't  stop 
 doing  and  you  become  that  guy  that 
 people  think  like  is  crazy  because
[47:44] you're  doing  two  workouts  a  day  because 
 you're  working  on  your  business  10  hours 
 a  day  and  I  promise  you  that  you'll  only 
 get  there  with  this  major  extreme  level
[47:50] of  success  if  you  cut  out  all  of  these 
 this  is  non-negotiable
[47:55] there's  a  reason  why  you  clicked  on  this 
 video  and  there's  a  reason  why  you 
 stayed  watching  to  my  to  my  words  here
[48:01] because  you  know  that  the  normal  life  is 
 never  going  to  work  for  you  you  know 
 that  you're  not  that  average  mediocre 
 person  who  can  do  the  life  of  balance
[48:08] so  you  must  understand  right  now 
 there's  multiple  bad  habits  that  you're
[48:13] doing  we  need  to  literally  cut  out  all 
 of  them
[48:18] and  I  totally  understand  that  by  the  way 
 I  totally  understand  that  for  me  for  a
[48:23] long  time  it  was  weed 
 I  used  to  smoke  weed  every  single  day
[48:28] and  the  thing  is 
 I  didn't  even  enjoy  it  that  much 
 honestly  like  I  wanted  to  quit  so  many
[48:33] times  you  know  if  there's  like  a  habit 
 that  you've  wanted  to  quit  like  you've 
 tried  to  quit  like  five  times  over  the
[48:39] last  few  years  that  says  it  itself  no 
 one  tries  to  quip  exercise  do  they  no
[48:44] one  tries  to  like  oh  yeah  I'm  really 
 trying  to  quit  exercise  guys  when  I'm 
 strong  no  one  tries  to  quit  reading
[48:49] books  do  they 
 so  when  there's  something  like  an 
 activity  that  you're  defending  in  your
[48:54] mind  that  yeah  but  it's  not  really  a 
 problem  I  swear  it's  like  if  you  you've 
 tried  to  quit  it  like  five  times  before
[49:00] this  that  says  in  itself  that  you  know 
 that  that's  like  a  stupid  thing  for  you 
 you  know  it  so  right  here  right  now  for
[49:06] maybe  the  first  time  in  a  while  we  need 
 to  just  it's  someone  sense  we  need  to 
 just  hold  our  hands  up  and  say  yep  the
[49:12] bad  habits  that  I  do 
 are  bad 
 we  need  to  just  see  them  as  a  bad  thing
[49:18] don't  cope  and  say  they're  productive 
 don't  cope  and  say  you  know  one  hour  I'm 
 just  unwinding  at  the  end  of  a  day  or
[49:23] something  don't  say  that  and  just  say 
 yep  these  are  bad  habits  that  are  bad 
 for  me  that  I  actually  would  be  better
[49:29] off  of  if  I  didn't  do  them  and  I'll 
 explain  exactly  how  to  get  rid  of  all  of 
 these  bad  habits  by  the  way  but
[49:35] there's  two  extra  points  for  this 
 there's  multiple  reasons  to  do  this  you 
 know  it'll  reset  your  dopamine  Baseline
[49:40] it'll  give  you  more  time  and  this  is 
 what  most  people  say  it's  like  you  know 
 you'll  save  the  time  to  then  go  and  use
[49:45] productively  that's  nice  but  actually  I 
 think  there's  a  hidden  benefit  to  this 
 especially  with  things  like  video  games
[49:51] and  social  media  and  porn 
 it  gives  you  more  of  your  mental  load
[49:56] your  brain  power  back  you  see  to  become 
 successful  to  the  level  that  you  want
[50:02] you  need  to  have  as  many  of  your 
 thoughts  directed  to  your  goals
[50:09] what  I  mean  by  this  is  that  your  shower 
 thoughts  must  be  related  to  your  goals
[50:15] the  thoughts  that  you  get  when  you're 
 having  a  [ __ ] 
 when  you're  literally  having  a  piss  the
[50:21] thoughts  that  you  get  must  be  related  to 
 your  goals  if  you  want  to  become 
 successful  like  successful  people  are
[50:27] very  extreme  they  were  literally  getting 
 ideas  once  we're  having  a  [ __ ]  bro
[50:32] so  if  you're  playing  video  games  the 
 thing  is  sometimes  you're  having  a  [ __ ] 
 and  you  think  about  the  video  game  you 
 think  about  oh  man  I'm  gonna  message
[50:37] this  guy  on  Discord  I  can't  wait  to  play 
 with  him  you're  thinking  about  the  the 
 time  you  just  died  or  whatever  on  League
[50:42] of  Legends  or  some  [ __ ] 
 it  takes  your  thoughts  away  from  you
[50:48] these  bad  habits  they  take  your  thoughts 
 away  from  you  that's  unacceptable
[50:55] but  one  of  the  points 
 this  also  includes  hanging  out  with
[51:00] friends 
 being  social
[51:05] and  having  friends  is  an  awesome  thing 
 that's  a  good  habit
[51:11] but  if  you're  watching  this  video  right 
 now 
 and  you  relate  to  this  need  of  of
[51:16] needing  to  fix  your  life  if  you're  at 
 this  position  in  life  right  now  where 
 you  need  to  fix  your  life
[51:22] I  guarantee  you 
 that  your  friends  are  pieces  of  [ __ ]
[51:27] I  guarantee  you  but  your  friends  aren't 
 even  nice  people
[51:33] I  guarantee  you 
 that  you  will  be  better  off  without  them
[51:39] now  I'll  give  you  a  disclaimer  here 
 being  social  is  so  important  like  I'm 
 very  much  a  guy  who  likes  to  think  of
[51:45] like  Primal  stuff  and  we  should  live  in 
 a  tribe  genuinely  we  should  live  in  a 
 tribe  we  should  be  close  to  family  and
[51:50] friends  and  work  together  of  course  we 
 should  but 
 that  means  that  we  should  have  good 
 people  in  our  lives  and  if  you  are  at
[51:55] this  point  right  now  where  you  need  to 
 fix  your  life  bro  that  probably  means 
 you  don't  even  have  any  good  people  in
[52:00] your  life  it  probably  means  that  the  the 
 friends  you  do  have  are  actually  holding 
 you  back
[52:05] because  I  guarantee  that  when  you  do 
 make  progress  in  your  self-improvements
[52:10] when  you  do  make  progress  and  become 
 more  successful  those  people  will 
 actually  look  down  upon  you  they  will 
 feel  negative  towards  your  success
[52:16] they'll  think  worse  of  you  as  you  get 
 better 
 because  they're  crabs  the  crab  is  in  a
[52:22] bucket  they're  trying  to  pull  you  back 
 down  into  mediocrity  amongst  them
[52:27] the  idea  is 
 to  go  out  go  alone  on  monk  mode
[52:33] ruthlessly  improve  yourself  detach  away 
 from  these  Jeffries  and  you  know  just 
 don't  even  reply  to  the  messages  mute
[52:39] all  of  the  group  chats  don't  even  look 
 at  them  even  if  if  you  think  you'll 
 never  be  friends  with  them  again  like  if 
 you  suddenly  became  successful  and
[52:45] intelligent  and  stuff  you'd  probably 
 never  speak  to  them  again  anyway  so  why 
 the  [ __ ]  would  you  still  be  friends  with
[52:50] them  now  if  you  know  you're  not 
 eventually  gonna  be  speaking  to  them 
 long  term 
 the  idea  is  just  detach  away  from  them
[52:56] go  monk  Mode  come  out  a  new  person  and 
 then  attract  like  friends  who  are  of
[53:02] higher  quality 
 those  higher  quality  people  you  can't 
 just  be  friends  with  right  now  because
[53:07] those  higher  quality  people  won't  be 
 friends  with  you  whilst  you're  friends 
 with  low  quality  people  because  if
[53:12] you're  friends  with  low  quality  people 
 it  means  you're  a  low  quality  person  and 
 the  fastest  way  to  to  get  rid  of  this
[53:18] negative  social  influence  is  to  go  it 
 alone  for  some  time
[53:23] you  can  try  like  I'd  love  to  tell  you 
 yeah  you  know  the  wholesome  thing  is  to 
 get  your  friends  on  self-improvement  bro
[53:28] I've  tried  giving  that  advice  so  many 
 times  and  almost  no  one's  ever  been 
 successful  with  it  either  you  find 
 someone  who's  already  on
[53:33] self-improvement  who's  already  going  to 
 the  gym  and  you  grow  together  that's 
 awesome  but  your  old  Jeffrey  friends 
 aren't  just  gonna  suddenly  like  quit
[53:39] playing  video  games  just  because  you're 
 telling  them  to  I  promise  you  you  can 
 try  all  you  want  but  I'm  telling  you
[53:44] right  now  I've  never  once  seen  this 
 actually  work  they  need  to  discover  the
[53:49] truth  the  darkness  of  their  lives  first 
 like  you  did  and  then  go  through  the 
 trials  and  tribulations  for  months  of
[53:55] trying  to  figure  out  what  to  do  just 
 like  you  did 
 you  can't  just  suddenly  take  them  in
[54:00] that  period  where  you  were  at  where  you 
 were  totally  fine  and  content  playing 
 video  games  and  to  try  and  help  them  out 
 of  it  I've  never  seen  that  happen  before
[54:06] but  I'd  love  to  be  proven  wrong  if  you 
 can  save  your  friends  do  it  but  I've 
 never  actually  seen  that  so
[54:11] how  do  you  actually  go  about  creating  a 
 bad  habit  you  know  I'm  telling  you  right 
 now  yeah  we  need  to  quit  all  bad  habits
[54:16] and  it  sounds  like  okay  fair  enough  yeah 
 okay  we  probably  do  but  how  do  you 
 actually  go  and  do  that  what  we  need  to
[54:21] do  is  change  our  basic  attack  now  before 
 you  watch  this  part  of  the  video  which
[54:26] is  going  to  be  very  interesting  you  need 
 to  clarify  right  now  if  you  totally  are 
 convinced  to  give  up  all  bad  habits  be
[54:33] totally  honest  right  now  is  there 
 something  like  just  be  honest  with 
 yourself  is  there  a  habit  like  a  task  an
[54:38] activity  in  your  brain  that  you  don't 
 want  to  give  up  that  your  brain  keeps 
 talking  to  you  about
[54:43] and  they  keep  saying  like  no  no  maybe  I 
 can  do  this  maybe  I  can  do  this  how 
 about  this  no  no  he's  not  talking  about
[54:48] this  thing  like  no  no  it's  not  even  that 
 bad  no  I'm  not  like  him  it's  not  that 
 bad  is  there  something  that  you're  still 
 coping  about
[54:53] if  there  is  I  urge  you  to  re-watch  the 
 previous  section  at  normal  speed  and 
 just  re-watch  it  and  really  take  it
[54:59] seriously  what  I've  just  said  now  if 
 you're  watching  this  section  right  here 
 right  now  that  means  that  you  are
[55:04] totally  convinced  that  we  need  to  get 
 rid  of  all  bad  habits  but  we  just  need 
 to  figure  out  how  to  actually  do  that
[55:09] and  we  do  that  through  changing  our 
 basic  attack 
 a  lot  of  guys  try  and  quit  playing  video
[55:15] games  and  smoking  weed 
 and  they  do  you  know  a  lot  of  guys  will 
 tell  you  maybe  you've  tried  yeah  I've
[55:21] quit  playing  video  games  now 
 but  then  you  have  nothing  else  to  fill 
 your  time  with
[55:27] and  so  you  get  really  really  bored 
 and  then  you  end  up  going  back
[55:34] we're  going  to  change  this  with  our 
 basic  attack  which  is  kind  of  like  a 
 filler  activity
[55:40] there's  a  YouTuber  uh  a  friend  of  mine 
 actually  Ali  abdal  and  he  mentioned  this
[55:46] in  a  video  we  should  change  our  basic 
 attack  so  if  your  chances  are  if  you
[55:51] know  what  I'm  talking  about  right  in  a 
 in  a  video  game  you  have  a  basic  attack 
 and  you  have  special  attacks  special
[55:56] attacks  are  things  that  you  do  every  now 
 and  then  when  you've  got  enough  mana  and 
 energy  and  everything  but  a  basic  attack
[56:02] is  the  thing  that  you  naturally 
 gravitate  towards 
 for  most  of  our  lives
[56:08] our  basic  attack 
 has  been  pointlessly  surfing  on  the
[56:14] internet 
 watching  [ __ ]  on  YouTube  Tick  Tock 
 checking  notifications  on  Snapchat  and
[56:19] stuff 
 playing  video  games  hopping  on  Discord 
 and  then  checking  notifications  then
[56:24] checking  Discord  again  then  hopping  on 
 call  with  Discord  and  one  of  your 
 friends  is  just  eating  he'll  be  there  in
[56:29] 10  minutes  let's  all  go  play  a  few  games 
 League  or  some  [ __ ]  right  our  basic 
 attack  has  always  been  bad  habits  and  so
[56:34] when  we  change  or  when  we  remove  bad 
 habits  as  our  basic  attack  but  we  don't
[56:39] replace  it  with  anything  else  suddenly 
 you're  left  like  just  with  nothing  to  do 
 and  then  you  go  back  to  the  old  basic
[56:45] attack  of  of  bad  habits  right  so  what  we 
 need  to  do
[56:50] we  need  to  change  our  basic  attack  the 
 thing  that  we  just  naturally  do 
 throughout  the  day  when  we've  got
[56:56] nothing  to  do  which  previously  used  to 
 be  video  games  and  social  media  and  [ __ ] 
 we  need  to  change  that  to  something
[57:01] productive  and  there's  two  activities 
 that  you  can  use  here 
 and  they  are
[57:06] reading 
 and  specifically  watching  full  length
[57:11] educational  podcasts  these  are  the  two 
 activities  that  have  most  developed  me
[57:17] and  they  will  develop  you  essentially 
 learning  through  books  and  full  length
[57:22] podcasts  everything  that  I  know 
 everything  that  I've  gotten  the  success 
 that  I've  built  has  come  from  the
[57:28] knowledge  that  I've  gained  from  books 
 and  full  length  of  YouTube  videos  like 
 podcasts  right  now  I'm  going  to  give  you
[57:35] a  disclaimer  which  is  very  interesting 
 in  this  space  because  this  is  something 
 that  actually  most  people  on  on  YouTube
[57:41] disagree  with  me  with  especially  the  the 
 self-improvement  guys
[57:49] this  is  technically  consuming  contents
[57:54] you've  heard  online  that  this  everyone 
 parrots  the  same  phrase  and  it's  gonna 
 seem  so  weird  that  I'm  like  countering
[58:01] this  right 
 everyone  pirates  the  same  phrase  and 
 it's  when  everyone  agrees  on  something
[58:06] it's  probably  wrong  every  single  person 
 on  self-improvement  every  single  person 
 on  YouTube  says  this  you  shouldn't  watch
[58:12] these  kinds  of  content  educational  stuff 
 if  you're  not  gonna  take  action
[58:17] that's  what  everyone  says  right  everyone 
 says  that  watching  self-improvement 
 content  but  not  taking  action  is
[58:23] pointless  reading  self-improvement  books 
 but  not  taking  action  is  pointless  I've 
 actually  realized
[58:29] I  think  that's  wrong 
 I  think 
 consuming  educational  content  and  books
[58:36] and  not  taking  action  is  still 
 infinitely  better
[58:42] than  just  doing  the  bad  habits  that 
 we're  used  to  I  think  it's  better  to
[58:47] simply  just  read  and  not  straight  and 
 like  not  go  and  use  what  you've  read 
 than  it  is  to  play  video  games  now  when
[58:54] I've  said  it  like  that  that's  like  well 
 yeah  of  course  it  is  like  this  is  common 
 sense  right  so  we've  all  had  this  idea
[58:59] that  no  if  you're  gonna  if  you're  gonna 
 watch  a  podcast  and  you've  got  to  make 
 sure  you've  got  to  use  it  if  you're 
 gonna  read  then  you've  got  to  make  sure
[59:04] that  you  take  action  on  it  and  that 
 seems  like  good  advice  but  I  realize 
 it's  actually  wrong  because 
 when  we  don't  take  action  straight  away
[59:11] but  we're  just  reading  a  book  for 
 example  or  we're  watching  a  podcast  it's 
 not  like  nothing's  happening
[59:16] what's  happening  is  that  our  brains  like 
 neurons  and  you  know  the  brain  [ __ ]  it's
[59:21] all  forming  new  Pathways  new  beliefs  new 
 mindsets 
 new  stories  to  look  back  on  that  will
[59:28] actually  lead  us  to  go  and  taking  action 
 in  the  right  way  in  the  future  what  I've
[59:33] seen  in  myself  and  also  probably  you've 
 you're  experiencing  this  right  now  and
[59:38] also  I  have  seen  in  literally  so  many 
 guys  that  have  helped  is  that  there  is 
 an  initial  period
[59:43] of  self-improvements  where  you  only 
 consume  the  content  but  you  don't  take
[59:48] action  and  we  think  that  this  period  is 
 like  a  bad  thing  and  we  feel  [ __ ]
[59:53] horrible  when  we're  in  this  period 
 because  we're  we're  learning  about  the 
 things  that  we  should  do  but  we  don't  do
[59:58] them  and  so  we  feel  really  horrible  but 
 what  I've  realized  is  every  guy  that 
 I've  seen  has  went  through  this  period
[60:03] of  consuming  this  educational 
 self-improvements  box  and  everything  and
[60:08] not  taking  action 
 but  then 
 they  start  taking  action  afterwards  you
[60:14] see  if  you've  been  obsessed  recently 
 with  self-improvement  fixing  your  life 
 monk  mode  and  all  this  all  these  things
[60:20] but  you  haven't  really  used  it 
 consistently  in  person  right  now  you'd 
 probably  be  thinking  like  yeah  this  has
[60:25] all  been  a  failure  I've  not  been  able  to 
 improve  my  life  but  I  promise  you  that  I 
 was  in  the  exact  same  boat  as  you  where
[60:30] I  only  consume  the  contents  didn't 
 actually  really  take  real  action  to  it 
 but  then  eventually  I  went  on  to  and  it
[60:37] was  only  when  I  went  on  to  take  the 
 action  that  I  needed  to  I  looked  back  at 
 the  months  that  I  was  reading  without
[60:42] taking  action  the  months  that  I  watched 
 the  self-improvement  videos  to  realize 
 that  they  were  actually  still  helping  me
[60:47] that  I  needed  to  First  change  my  brain 
 and  my  beliefs  through  that  kind  of
[60:52] content  but  I  didn't  yet  have  the 
 capacity  to  do  the  work  does  this  make 
 sense 
 so  I  know  that  this  sounds  weird  and  I'm
[60:58] not  saying  this  like  in  a  way  that  yeah 
 you  should  just  watch  my  videos  keep 
 watching  my  video  I'm  not  saying  to
[61:03] watch  my  videos  I'm  saying  to  read  books 
 and  to  watch  full  length  educational 
 podcasts  right  my  videos  the  recent  ones
[61:09] like  you  know  I've  got  five  videos  just 
 recently  which  you  can  maybe  say  a 
 podcast  but  most  of  my  videos  are  um
[61:14] like  the  short  clickbaity  style  don't 
 watch  those  kinds  of  videos  what  I'm 
 saying  is  consume  the  good  like  a  long
[61:21] really  long  form  one  to  two  hour  long 
 podcasts  on  YouTube  by  Andrew  huberman
[61:26] Chris  Williamson  the  Diary  of  a  CEO 
 these  kinds  of  guys  who  are  very 
 successful  guys  and  they're  doing  like
[61:32] these  unfiltered  unedited  podcasts  I 
 promise  you  that  every  time  I  sit  down 
 and  really  like  pay  attention  to  a  full
[61:38] length  unedited  podcast  right  so  no  like 
 [ __ ]  memes  no  short  form  no  like
[61:44] highlight  clip  that's  five  minutes  long 
 that's  like  Joe  Rogan's  motivational 
 advice  that  will  change  your  life  no  no
[61:49] not  that  [ __ ]  the  full  length 
 educational  podcast  when  I  sit  down  and 
 watch  one  where  I'm  really  paying
[61:55] attention  to  it  I  swear  to  God  I  I 
 actually  like  it's  like  my  I  feel  my 
 brain  change  and  my  beliefs  change  and
[62:01] suddenly  there's  like  a  new  thing  that 
 I'm  keeping  in  mind  for  like  the  rest  of 
 my  life
[62:06] you  don't  realize  how  valuable  it 
 actually  is  to  consume  content  it's  seen 
 as  a  really  like  bad  thing  these  days
[62:12] consuming  pointless  content  social  media 
 and  [ __ ]  okay  it's  bad  but  education  is
[62:17] fantastic  and  again 
 it  needs  to  be  like  if  you're  watching 
 it  on  YouTube  like  full  length  podcast
[62:24] not  the  Highlight  Clips  not  like  you 
 know  the  five  minute  clip  that  teaches 
 you  or  Andrew  huberman's  dopamine  advice
[62:30] I  don't  know  it's  like  the  full  two-hour 
 Andrew  huberman  episode  on  dopamine  and 
 you  literally  sit  there  take  your
[62:36] fingers  off  the  mouse  stop  scrolling 
 down  to  the  comments  and  just  sit  there 
 and  really  pay  attention  to  it  make  this
[62:42] your  new  basic  attack  make  this  the 
 thing  that  you  do  when  you've  got 
 nothing  to  do  I  keep  like  a  book  open
[62:48] like  the  way  of  the  superior  man  this 
 book  I  keep  this  book  open
[62:53] literally  like  open  like  this  next  to  me 
 so  that  anytime  my  brain  starts  cooping
[62:58] and  I  start  thinking  like  oh  maybe  I 
 should  just  go  waste  some  time  on 
 YouTube  or  you  know  I  could  do  whatever 
 [ __ ]  it's  like  I  just  end  up
[63:03] grabbing  this  and  just  reading  it  and 
 it's  like  my  understanding  of  this  book 
 that  is  an  amazing  book  is  has  leveled
[63:10] up  and  now  I  do  this  with  podcasts  too 
 anytime  like  if  I'm  eating  or  if  I've 
 got  some  free  time  and  I'm  just  kind  of
[63:15] you  know  I'd  end  up  like  killing  time 
 and  doing  some  [ __ ]  I'm  watching 
 something  deeply  educational
[63:22] and  so  yes  this  is  consuming  content 
 Brighton  you  think  that  we've  got  it 
 wrong  when  we  we've  always  thought  if
[63:27] you  consume  content  that's  a  bad  thing 
 my  life  has  changed  improved 
 significantly  because  of  this  like
[63:34] consuming  content  that  we  always  thought 
 was  bad  it's  just  the  the  simple  thing 
 is  just  just  don't  consume  [ __ ]
[63:39] don't  consume  by  people  who  are  making 
 [ __ ]  for  views 
 don't  consume  by  people  who  are  making
[63:46] click  bait  titles  like  the  top  seven 
 passive  income  ways  that  you  can  make 
 500  a  month  like  those  [ __ ]  [ __ ]
[63:52] videos  don't  watch  any  like  [ __ ] 
 clickbait  video  which  is  you  know  10 
 minutes  long  and  it's  like  the  top  seven
[63:58] you  know  this  type  of  [ __ ]  because  those 
 videos  don't  actually  [ __ ]  help  you 
 that  much  you  can  sit  there  and  watch 
 and  think  that  my  old  videos  and  and
[64:04] those  type  of  like  YouTubers  are  helping 
 you  but  the  truth  is  like  your  life 
 doesn't  change  from  those  type  of  ones 
 it  changes  from  when  you  really  invest
[64:10] like  two  hours  straight  into  watching 
 like  an  Andrew  huberman  podcast  where 
 he's  going  into  like  the  Deep  science  of
[64:16] something  that  we  can  Implement  in  our 
 lives 
 recently  I've  been  watching  this  or  the 
 guy  the  Diary  of  a  CEO  and  that's  quite
[64:22] nice  specifically  if  you're  going  to 
 watch  podcasts  specifically  Watch  the 
 episodes  that  are  not  just  interesting
[64:28] but  that  are  specifically  aligned  to 
 your  goals  so  you  can  click  on  some  of 
 these  podcasts  and  there'll  be  something
[64:34] that  like  you  can  go  into  the  Diary  of  a 
 CEO  and  there's  a  podcast  with  like
[64:39] um  Zack  and  Cody  like  you  know  the 
 [ __ ]  the  the  one  like  some  like  teen 
 like  some  childhood
[64:44] um  movie  star  or  something  right  and  I 
 used  to  watch  him  as  well  like  some 
 shows  where  I  clicked  on  it  I  was  like
[64:49] oh  well  it's  that  guy  and  I  was  watching 
 it  for  a  few  minutes  I  was  like  wait  why 
 am  I  watching  this  [ __ ]  it's  like  yeah 
 it's  kind  of  interesting  seeing  like
[64:54] some  kid  that  I  used  to  watch  on  TV  you 
 know  growing  up  like  The  Suite  Life  of 
 Zack  and  Cody
[64:59] um  Cole  Sprouse  or  whatever  his  [ __ ] 
 name  is  right  and  I  was  watching  it  for 
 a  few  minutes  I  was  like  wait  this  isn't 
 going  to  be  educational  it's  like  it's
[65:04] just  some  [ __ ]  celebrity  I  don't  give 
 a  [ __ ]  right  so  one  of  that  and  watched 
 about  some  random  businessman  and  they
[65:10] like  giving  tips  to  each  other  and  like 
 the  the  host  of  this  podcast  the  Diary 
 of  a  CEO  he  starts  talking  about  yeah
[65:15] focus  is  really  important  you've  got  to 
 make  sure  you  focus  on  this  and  this  and 
 this  and  I'm  actually  learning  from  that
[65:20] this  I  think  is  so  amazing  so  don't 
 think  to  yourself  right  now  like  oh  no
[65:25] but  you  know  everyone  said  not  to 
 consume  content  if  you're  not  going  to 
 take  action  again  when  I  say  it  like
[65:30] this  it's  common  sense  right  reading 
 just  a  book  and  even  if  you  don't  take
[65:35] action  on  it  it's  better  than  playing 
 video  games  or  taking  drugs  or  watching
[65:41] porn 
 doing  a  good  habit  that  you  don't 
 immediately  take  action  on  is  better
[65:46] than  a  bad  habit  and  again  all  of  the 
 value  of  this  you  know  these  podcasts
[65:51] and  stuff  it  isn't  that  will  suddenly  go 
 and  take  action  it's  that  our  beliefs
[65:56] change  in  our  mind 
 there's  there's  a  guy  I  really  like  Alex 
 hermosi  and  he's  done  a  bunch  of
[66:02] podcasts  like  he's  not  the  podcast  host 
 he  goes  on  podcasts  and  he's  like  just 
 watching  this  guy  talk  about  business
[66:07] has  I've  not  like  you  know  I'm  not 
 straight  away  taking  action  on  what  he 
 said  but  it's  like  the  beliefs  change  in
[66:13] my  mind  and  then  the  action  I  take 
 literally  six  months  later  is  better
[66:18] because  of  that  podcast  that  changed 
 some  belief  some  mindset  that  I  had
[66:23] so  this  now  could  be  your  your  new  go-to
[66:28] activity  that  anytime  you  don't  really 
 know  what  to  do  anytime  that  you're 
 about  to  just  go  play  video  games
[66:34] anytime  that  you've  got  some  free  time 
 you  just  eat  in  some  food  or  you're  just 
 killing  time  you're  bored  or  whatever  it
[66:39] is 
 just  literally  either  read  a  book  I 
 prefer  books  but  I'd  say  most  guys  just
[66:45] go  onto  YouTube  and  watch  a  full  length 
 podcast  and  again  please  trust  me  the 
 Highlight  Clips  don't  count  shorts
[66:52] obviously  don't  count  but  like  the 
 Highlight  you  know  Joe  Rogan's  advice  no 
 you  go  on  to  the
[66:57] um  the  podcast  you  know  YouTuber  page 
 and  often  they'll  post  their  highlight 
 there  which  is  a  bit  more  clickbait  into
[67:03] your  little  Jeffrey  Brian  will  want  to 
 click  on  it  don't  watch  the  full  like 
 two  hour  one  and  a  half  hour  length
[67:08] episode  take  your  hands  off  don't  check 
 the  comments  don't  look  at  the  suggested 
 videos  and  literally  just  watch  it  like
[67:13] you're  like  you're  an  intellectual  who 
 actually  cares  about  knowledge  and 
 education  and  I  promise  you  you  won't
[67:18] like  realize  this  just  yet  but  maybe  you 
 will  know  your  beliefs  about  things  will
[67:23] start  to  change  and  this  is  deeply 
 valuable 
 I  am  where  I  am  today  because  at  that
[67:28] moment  of  my  monk  mode  like  two  and  a 
 half  years  ago  like  you  know  like  three 
 years  ago  I  was  in  the  degenerate  stage
[67:33] but  then  after  a  little  while  I  got  into 
 monk  mode  that  I  spent  a  lot  of  my  time
[67:38] just  learning  and  educating  myself  on 
 like  the  things  that  I  was  eventually 
 going  to  implement
[67:44] learning  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  I  was 
 able  to  surpass  everyone 
 in  the  self-improvement  niche
[67:51] think  about  it  I  started  the 
 self-improvement  YouTube  channel  when 
 everyone  was  telling  me  it  was  too
[67:56] saturated 
 I  started  and  I  I  ended  up  becoming  like 
 the  biggest  like  self-improvement
[68:01] Channel  out  there 
 because  I  literally  spent  most  of  my  day
[68:06] just  learning  I  spent  hours  just  reading 
 because  I  had  nothing  else  to  do  because 
 I  wasn't  doing  bad  habits  anymore
[68:12] does  that  make  sense  so  like  we  cut  out 
 all  of  the  bad  habits  and  now  anytime  we
[68:17] would  have  done  the  bad  habits  anytime 
 we  would  have  hopped  online  with  our 
 little  Discord  Jeffrey  friends  who  keep 
 pressuring  us  to  play  video  games  or
[68:22] anytime  you  want  to  watch  like  some 
 [ __ ]  pointless  non-educational 
 YouTube  video
[68:27] we  now  literally  just  fill  it  up  with 
 learning  think  to  yourself  right  now
[68:32] like  this  new  identity  that  you  can  have 
 of  yourself 
 of  like  you  know  like  like  a  wise  man
[68:38] like  if  you  could  imagine  a  man  like 
 like  Thomas  Edison  Theodore  Roosevelt's
[68:43] like  you  know  like  the  the  like  some 
 high  quality  like  old  school  men  and
[68:49] they  literally  would  have  like  they  they 
 spend  hours  a  day  just  reading  and 
 thinking  and  they  were  able  to  become
[68:55] very  capable  men  because  of  that 
 you  should  think  of  yourself  in  the  same 
 way  like  we  are  young  men  full  of
[69:01] knowledge 
 full  of  good  beliefs  and  education  and 
 what  we  really  value  like  learning  the
[69:07] the  knowledge  and  wisdom  of  more 
 successful  men  so  that  we  can  go  and  use 
 it
[69:12] so  even  if  you  find  yourself  I  I  will 
 say  one  thing  though  if  you've  watched
[69:17] normal  self-improvement  videos  like  a 
 lot  of  my  videos  that  I've  posted  to 
 this  channel  like  probably  not  the  last
[69:22] like  five  videos  that  I've  posted  but 
 before  you  know  recently  I've  been 
 posting  like  longer  videos  with
[69:27] absolutely  no  edits  and  stuff  I  think 
 these  videos  are  really  educational  but 
 before  that  let's  get  posted  700  videos
[69:33] to  my  channel  but  you  can  scroll  down  my 
 channel  and  it's  like  the  top  seven  ways 
 why  girls  won't  like  I  don't  think  those
[69:38] videos  really  [ __ ]  help  you  and  so  I 
 think  that  you  know  all  this  time  we've 
 been  saying  oh  you  shouldn't  consume 
 content  if  you're  not  going  to  take
[69:43] action  I  think  the  reason  why  we  say 
 that  is  because  those  kinds  of  videos 
 aren't  worth  watching
[69:48] the  issue  is  as  a  Creator  and  you  know  I 
 don't  blame  YouTubers  like  most 
 YouTubers  do  this  they  make  these  like
[69:54] clickbait  videos  I  like  samosie 
 unfortunately  does  this  now  most 
 YouTubers  just  do  this  they  make  them 
 more  clickbait  short  edited  video  the
[70:00] reason  why  is  just  because  more  people 
 just  watch  the  more  people  at  Jeffries 
 who  aren't  actually  like  wanting 
 knowledge  they  just  want  stimulation  but
[70:07] you  are  not  that  kind  of  guy  anymore 
 you're  not  the  guy  who  searches  for 
 stimulation  you're  the  guy  who  searches
[70:12] for  education 
 and  so  you  will  watch  these  like  full 
 length  podcasts  like  the  two-hour  ones
[70:18] and  I'm  not  even  saying  my  videos  I'm 
 going  find  like  some  podcasts  that  you 
 really  like  I  like  Andrew  huberman  Chris
[70:23] Williamson  and  the  Diary  of  a  CEO  and  if 
 you  can  find  some  other  ones  that  you 
 like  go  and  watch  them  one  extra  tip
[70:28] I'll  give  you  is  I  think  watching  it  on 
 YouTube  is  better  than  just  listening  to
[70:33] it  on  Spotify  that's  something  that 
 again  that  the  the  guy  I  keep  mentioning 
 Alex  hamosi  that's  something  that  he
[70:38] mentions  at  the  start  of  this  book  it's 
 like  this  research  to  show  that  if  you 
 can  watch  and  listen  at  the  same  time
[70:45] that  will  help  your  brain  more  than  if 
 you  just  listen  you  know  it's  like 
 another  like  visual  like  um  another
[70:51] sense  that's  being  used  so  essentially 
 like  watch  the  full  length  podcast  so 
 you  can  literally  see  the  people  and
[70:56] stuff  rather  than  listen  to  it  still 
 listen  to  podcasts  on  Spotify  when 
 you're  driving  or  when  you're  doing  the
[71:01] dishes  or  something  but  I  would  say  like 
 a  solid  few  hours  like  literally  four  to
[71:06] six  hours  of  your  day  you  could 
 genuinely  spend  watching  full  length 
 podcasts  writing  notes  getting  ideas  and
[71:12] trying  to  just  trying  to  implement  sense 
 one  little  thing  you  watch  a  two  hours 
 podcast  by  Andrew  huberman  and  he  talks
[71:18] about  how  to  use  cold  and  heat  to 
 improve  your  health  and  just  from  that
[71:23] if  all  you  do  is  go  and  take  a  cold 
 shower  for  30  seconds  with  the  thought 
 that  oh  yeah  Andrew  guberman  said  that
[71:29] it's  healthy  to  take  cold  showers  now 
 you've  taken  action  not  only  have  you 
 got  the  new  belief  that  you  know  like
[71:34] being  cold  is  good  for  your  health  but 
 that  now  you're  actually  taking  action 
 with  it 
 be  okay  with  literally  watching  podcasts
[71:41] and  reading  for  six  to  eight  to  ten 
 hours  a  day  because  doing  that  a  day 
 like  a  day  where  you  read  for  10  hours
[71:47] is  better  than  a  day  where  you  play 
 video  games  for  10  hours  it  like  simply 
 like  that  right  that's  all  you've  got  to
[71:52] think  of  and  of  course  it's  not  going  to 
 be  10  hours  you  still  got  to  go  eat  and 
 work  out  and  stuff  but  anytime  you've
[71:57] got  some  free  time  just  learn 
 don't  stimulate
[72:04] so  now  at  this  point 
 you're  you're  beginning  to  replace  all
[72:09] of  your  bad  habits  for  learning
[72:15] your  entire  day  is  filled  up  of  you 
 gaining  the  knowledge  that  you  need  to
[72:20] eventually  become  successful  which  is 
 amazing 
 now  we  need  to  actually  do  the  specific
[72:26] tasks  that  will  get  you  to  those  goals 
 that  we  set  before  you  remember  the  the 
 page  of  goals  that  we  wrote  down  and  we
[72:32] scribbled  a  bunch  of  them  and  we  circled 
 the  three  goals  that  we  need  this  is 
 easy  right  so  right  now  think  about  it
[72:37] we've  already  eliminated  most  of  your 
 bad  habits  right  pretty  much  all  of  your 
 bad  habits  should  be  gone  at  this  point
[72:42] any  time  that  you  find  yourself  doing  a 
 bad  habit  just  like  quickly  go  back  to 
 reading  or  to  watching  the  podcast  and
[72:47] it's  not  going  to  be  perfect  by  the  way 
 you  know  over  the  next  few  days  you're 
 gonna  find  that  you  really  want  to
[72:52] um you  know  you'll  find  yourself  just 
 playing  video  games  by  accident  or 
 something  it's  normal  but  just  keep 
 coming  back  to  just  spending  most  of
[72:58] your  time  as  learning  and  now  we're  on 
 the  easy  part  we  can  almost  imagine  in 
 an  ideal  situation  that  your  entire  day
[73:04] is  just  filled  up  of  learning  you're 
 learning  some  really  good  things  now  we 
 just  need  to  do  the  specific  tasks  the
[73:10] best  most  important  tasks  that  will  get 
 you  to  your  goals  and  we  just  use  a 
 simple  like  formula  for  this  and  this  is
[73:16] the  80  20  rule  you've  probably  heard  of 
 this  like  productivity  tactic  before  the 
 80  20  ruling  Pareto  Principle  the  idea
[73:23] is  that  you  just  just  try  to  figure  out 
 what  is  the  most  impactful  highest 
 leverage  task  that  will  get  you  to  most
[73:30] of  where  you  want  to  be  so  for  example 
 my  first  goal  on  this  so  you  can  look  at 
 your  goal  list  right  my  first  goal  is  1
[73:36] 000  subscribers  we  would  ask  ourselves 
 okay  what  is  the  most  important  crucial 
 80  task  that  would  get  us  to  a  thousand
[73:43] subscribers  what  is  like  the  task  that 
 would  get  us  most  of  the  way  there  think
[73:48] about  it  what  is  the  task  that  would  get 
 us  most  of  the  way  to  a  thousand 
 subscribers
[73:53] recording  videos  literally  just  you're 
 not  getting  your  phone  or  your  camera 
 and  recording  the  video  and  then  also
[73:58] maybe  scripting  the  video 
 that's  it  that's  the  most  important  task 
 right  there
[74:04] another  way  you  can  do  this  which  I  like 
 is  for  for  each  goal  that  you  have
[74:09] 1  000  subscribers  500  a  month  online 
 bulk  up  15  pounds  for  each  goal  that  you
[74:14] have 
 ask  yourself  if  you  could  do  just 
 literally  one  task  for  that  goal  just
[74:19] one  task  forever  for  that  goal  what 
 would  it  be  if  you  could  literally 
 there's  only  one  task  that  likes  one
[74:25] specific  task  that  you  could  do  to  get 
 to  1  000  subscribers  what  would  it  be  if 
 you  chose  for  example  R  writing  a  script
[74:31] then  you'd  fail  because  you  could  write 
 the  script  but  like  we  can  only  do  one 
 task  so  you  wouldn't  be  able  to  record 
 because  that's  a  separate  task  right  so
[74:36] if  to  get  to  a  thousand  subscribers  The 
 One  task  that  you  if  you  can  only  do  one 
 task  it  would  be  to  simply  just  record
[74:41] the  video  right  it  wouldn't  be  to  go 
 update  your  channel  Banner  it  wouldn't 
 be  to  go  reply  to  everyone  who  commented
[74:46] on  your  video  and  go  comments  on  other 
 people's  videos  or  you  know  like  the 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  YouTubers  do  that  like  the
[74:51] small  YouTubers  they  like  they'll  save  a 
 quote  ready  for  when  I  post  and  then 
 they'll  quickly  post  their  quote  like
[74:56] hoping  that  someone  will  click  on  their 
 Channel  or  something  you  wouldn't  do 
 that  right  if  you  could  only  do  just  one
[75:01] task  for  your  goal  what  would  it  be 
 ask  yourself  that  question  and  then
[75:06] think  to  yourself  whatever  the  task  is 
 always  prioritize  that  one  task
[75:12] whatever  that  task  is  the  highest 
 leverage  most  important  task  always 
 prioritize  that  one  task  for  the  1  000
[75:19] subscriber  goal  it's  recording  for  the 
 500  a  month  online
[75:25] honestly  it'd  probably  still  be 
 recording  if  I  was  going  to  make  like  a 
 YouTube  business  business  run  they're 
 probably  still  recording  for  the  bulk  up
[75:31] 15  pounds  it  would  be  to  eat  the  calorie 
 Surplus  per  day  to  eat  200  grams  of
[75:36] protein  per  day 
 so  this  right  here
[75:41] is  where  it  gets  very  interesting 
 because  this  is  how  you  add  in  in  my
[75:46] opinion  the  most  effective  protocol  for 
 you  to  get  you  to  your  goals  you  fill  up 
 your  day  as  much  as  possible  with
[75:52] learning  and  of  course  you're  not  adding 
 in  eating  and  adding  your  workout  and 
 stuff  right  and  added  sleep  and  stuff  of
[75:57] course  right  but  most  of  your  day  is 
 just  learning  then  what  you  do  is  you 
 figure  out  what  would  be  the  highest
[76:02] important  task  for  the  three  goals  that 
 you  wrote  down  and  then  you  add  just
[76:07] those  tasks  inside  so  most  of  your  day 
 is  actually  still  learning  you're  still
[76:13] developing  your  skills  but  you  have  the 
 highest  important  task  that  will 
 actually  make  you  some  progress  so  for
[76:19] example  if  you  wanna  if  you're  like  a 
 new  YouTuber  most  of  your  day  should  be 
 spent  like  researching  and  learning  but
[76:24] you  should  upload  a  video  to  your 
 YouTube  channel  every  single  day  it's 
 when  you  open  yourself  up  to  too  many
[76:29] [ __ ]  mini  like  tasks  that  feel 
 productive  like  you  know  the  [ __ ] 
 YouTubers  like  to  reply  to  everyone's
[76:35] comments  and  they'll  comment  a  little 
 bit  like  when  you  do  that  you  begin  to 
 like  lose  time  from  learning  that  would
[76:40] have  actually  pushed  you  further  I  can 
 give  you  one  more  good  tip 
 when  you  do  find  out  what  the  task  is
