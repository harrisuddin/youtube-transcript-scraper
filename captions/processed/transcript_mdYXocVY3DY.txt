[00:00] my  girlfriend  is  a  pain  in  the  ass  I'm 
 at  my  computer  desk  doing  deep  work  now 
 Focus  work  like  this  has  built  my  entire
[00:06] business  I've  almost  retired  my  entire 
 family 
 my  phone  rings
[00:12] Focus  lost 
 thanks  baby  I  hope  this  is  important
[00:17] but  it  never  is  now  I'm  in  the  kitchen 
 making  tea  and  it's  all  splashing 
 everywhere  it's  a  health  hazard  but  then
[00:22] I  feel  hands  start  caressing  me  and  she 
 looks  up  at  me  so  lovingly
[00:28] God  she's  so  [ __ ]  annoying  I'm 
 walking  through  the  bathroom  door  and 
 then  I  hear  footsteps  behind  me  I  got
[00:34] lonely  can  I  come  with  you  what  it's 
 been  three  seconds
[00:40] and  then  I'm  at  the  front  door  of  our 
 house  and  I  hear  shuffling  behind  me
[00:45] it's  her 
 and  her  bags  are  packed  I  kiss  my 
 girlfriend  goodbye  not  knowing  when  I'm 
 gonna  see  her  again  we  both  wave  to  each
[00:52] other  she  gets  into  the  car  pulls  out  of 
 the  driveway  and  a  car  disappears  into
[00:57] the  distance  she  does  this  commute  every 
 single  weekend
[01:02] 460  miles  it  takes  her  around  eight 
 hours  to  come  and  see  me
[01:08] and  spend  about  six  hours  with  me  she 
 would  be  a  terrible  entrepreneur  with
[01:13] that  kind  of  return  on  investments 
 but  she  is  actually  an  awesome 
 girlfriend  even  though  I  call  her
[01:18] annoying  I'm  glad  it's  her  who's 
 annoying  me  so  I'll  take  every

 you  will  always  have  problems  trying  to
[01:34] escape  problems  it's  like  trying  to 
 escape  reality  David  Goggins  has

[01:42] Rogan  has  problems  Elon  Musk  Jeff  Bezos 
 Mark  Zuckerberg  they  all  have  problems

 choose  which  problems  you  want  to  solve
[01:52] and  trying  to  make  money  is  all  about 
 solving  problems  so  are  you  going  to 
 choose  the  problems  that  feel  brain
[01:58] numbing  and  boring 
 and  pointless 
 or  might  it  be  better  to  choose  the
[02:06] problems  that  get  you  up  out  of  bed 
 first  thing  in  the  morning  where  you 
 feel  super  motivated  disciplined  and
[02:12] excited  to  work  on  them  choosing  the 
 right  problem  to  solve  for  money  is 
 going  to  be  the  difference  between
[02:18] feeling  purposeful  or  feeling  lost  it's 
 going  to  be  the  difference  between 
 building  a  business  that  thrives  or  one
[02:24] that  barely  survives

 scrubby  little  fingers  off  the  mouse  and
[04:23] off  your  phone  and  you  just  stare  at 
 this  with  the  best  Focus  that  you  can 
 come  up  with  I've  been  waking  up  at  5am
[04:29] every  single  morning  to  make  this  guide 
 and  not  only  that  for  the  last  three 
 years  I  have  worked  ruthlessly  hard  on
[04:35] my  business  to  create  the  level  of 
 success  that  I  have  I'm  gonna  be  sharing 
 those  lessons  from  my  own  business  and
[04:40] also  the  hundreds  of  hours  that  I've  put 
 into  learning  about  money  from  books  and
[04:45] courses  and  seminars  and  programs  and 
 teachers  if  you're  broke  this  is  going 
 to  be  perfect  for  you  if  right  now
[04:50] you're  jumping  around  from  business 
 model  to  business  model  Tate  said  that 
 this  business  model  is  good  Iman  said
[04:55] this  one  happens  I  said  be  a  YouTuber 
 and  you  don't  even  know  which  path  to 
 stick  to  this  is  really  going  to  help
[05:01] you  if  you  already  have  started  to  make 
 some  progress  in  your  business  and  you 
 want  to  start  to  scale  and  see  more
[05:06] results  this  is  going  to  help  you  and  if 
 you're  actually  quite  Advanced  and  quite 
 rich  and  you've  got  money  to  spend  then
[05:12] this  guide  will  also  help  you  step  one  a 
 more  powerful  money  mindset
[05:18] think  about  how  sad  this  is 
 that  making  money  is  the  overlapping
[05:24] directing  force  in  the  majority  of 
 people's  lives  by  the  time  they're  15  16
[05:30] 17  years  old  the  concept  of  making  money 
 is  like  very  very  important  is  just
[05:35] implanted  in  and  that  is  like  their 
 priority  for  the  rest  of  their  lives  how 
 their  entire  life  is  set  up  who  they
[05:41] spend  time  with  who  they  are  as  a  person 
 how  they  dress  it's  all  just  related  to 
 their  career  now  Imagine  This
[05:48] the  majority  of  people  don't  even 
 fulfill  this  goal 
 they  dedicate  their  entire  lives  to  a
[05:55] goal  and  they  don't  even  accomplish  it
[06:02] that  should  really  make  you  sad  like 
 imagine  those  goals  that  you  have  in 
 your  mind  and  imagine  if  you  try  to
[06:07] accomplish  one  of  those  goals  for  the 
 rest  of  your  life  and  you  dedicated  as
[06:12] much  of  your  life  as  like  the  average 
 person  did  and  you  still  weren't  even 
 close  to  accomplishing  it  the  average
[06:18] person  works  so  hard 
 they  actually  do  genuinely  dedicate
[06:23] their  lives  to  making  money  and  then  at 
 60  years  old  they've  still  got  nothing 
 to  show  for  it  because  they're  going
[06:29] about  it  the  wrong  way 
 they  think  that  they  can  just  get  a 
 career  and  that  hopefully  they'll  be
[06:35] fine  that  hopefully  Daddy  the  boss  will 
 take  care  of  them  many  young  men  know 
 that  that's  not  the  case  we  know  that  we
[06:41] have  to  grip  Life  by  the  horns  and 
 direct  it  to  where  we  want  to  go
[06:47] so  I  want  you  to  do  something  very 
 important 
 think  about  what  you  want  the  money  for
[06:54] think  about  what  you'll  buy  think  about 
 the  lifestyle  that  you  want  maybe  you'll
[06:59] see  flashes  of  how  Andrew  Tate  is  living 
 the  watches  the  cars  maybe  there's
[07:04] parties  that  you  want  to  go  to  maybe 
 there's  women  who  you  want  to  look  at 
 you  whilst  you're  wearing  the  nice  suits
[07:11] forget  all  of  it 
 destroy
[07:16] all  of  those  desires
[07:21] if  you  really  want  this  full  guide  to 
 help  you 
 you  must  understand
[07:26] 99  of  people  make  no  progress  in  making 
 money  do  they
[07:31] so  why  are  you  still  trying  to  go 
 through  the  same  route  as  the  99
[07:37] the  99  dream  of  the  same  things  as  you 
 they  want  the  flashy  cars  they  want  the
[07:43] fame 
 so  you  know  the  better  way  to  start 
 making  money
[07:49] is  the  start  with  a  way  more  powerful 
 mindset  which  is  so  interesting  because
[07:54] the  most  powerful  mindset  that  you  can 
 have  to  start  making  money
[07:59] is  to  not  give  a  [ __ ]  about  it  it's  to 
 not  care  about  it  at  all  it's  the  almost
[08:05] devalue  money  and  think  to  yourself  that 
 I  don't  even  want  to  buy  anything
[08:10] now  this  isn't  to  say  that  we're  not 
 going  to  make  money  this  isn't  to  say 
 that  we're  not  going  to  be  able  to 
 eventually  buy  things  but  when  you're
[08:15] first  starting  off  your  greatest 
 priority  should  be  to  have  a  clear  mind 
 so  that  you  can  focus  on  your  business
[08:21] or  maybe  high  level  career 
 too  many  people  are  so  pulled  by  these
[08:27] materialistic  desires  that  then  they 
 have  no  hope  of  ever  amassing  like  real 
 wealth  because  if  they  do  make  any
[08:33] progress  in  business  they  wipe  it  down 
 by  just  buying  the  thing  that  they 
 thought  they  were  supposed  to  buy  when
[08:38] they  don't  realize  that  the  person  who's 
 showing  you  that  lifestyle  with  the 
 watch  and  the  cars
[08:43] one  they've  got  a  lot  more  money  so  they 
 can  spend  it  on  those  things  but  two  the 
 thing  is  even  for  them  it  wasn't  that
[08:49] much  of  a  smart  purchase  either 
 to  stay  hooked  at  this  level  right  now
[08:55] where  you  look  up  to  the  big  boys  and 
 you  think  oh  I  want  the  the  private  jets 
 I'm  on  the  car  I  want  to  be  able  to  move
[09:00] out 
 these  things  you  can  eventually  get  but 
 only  if  you  stop  caring  about  them  right
[09:05] now  because  you  know  what  happens  when 
 you  care  about  these  things 
 you're  gonna  go  watch  another  five  hour
[09:10] tape  podcast  and  cope  and  say  that  it 
 was  productive
[09:15] right  you're  gonna  go  keep  watching  more 
 teach  shorts  but  you're  still  broke  it's
[09:20] not  actually  helping  you  that  much 
 if  that's  all  it  takes  someone  with  a
[09:25] fancy  watch  to  literally  steal  an  hour 
 or  two  of  your  time  if  that's  all  it 
 takes  then  how  are  you  gonna  become
[09:30] successful  do  you  think  those  successful 
 people  who  show  you  that  lifestyle  are
[09:35] sat  there  right  now  looking  at  people 
 showing  their  lifestyle 
 they're  working
[09:41] so  you  need  to  stop  this  fascination 
 with  spending  with  materialism  to  with
[09:48] needing  more  and  at  this  level  let's 
 assume  you  are  totally  broke  you  want  to 
 know  the  best  advice  I  could  give  to  you
[09:54] act  and  think  like  a  stoic 
 like  these  things  are  beneath  you  like
[10:00] you  have  no  it  you  don't  even  care  about 
 these  worldly  things  hey  you  are  a  man
[10:06] of  character  a  man  of  of  mental  strength 
 think  like  a  stoic  that  you  don't  need
[10:11] more  than  any  desire  you  get  for  wanting 
 more  wanting  this  object  wanting  that 
 car  wanting  those  clothes  you  just
[10:17] destroy  it  you  just  see  it  for  what  it 
 actually  is  a  mirage  of  the  thing  that 
 you  really  wanted  you  never  wanted  the
[10:23] clothing  or  or  the  the  car
[10:28] you  want  to  love 
 you  wanted  Health  you  wanted  Community 
 you  wanted  sunlight  and  sleep
[10:35] you  wanted  some  kind  of  way  to 
 contribute  to  your  people
[10:41] when  you  start  with  this  mindset  you'll 
 actually  go  on  to  make  a  lot  more  money
[10:46] because  you  come  from  a  place  of 
 abundance 
 of  like  yeah  if  I  make  money  that's
[10:52] awesome  it's  not  that  I  hate  money 
 yeah  if  I  make  some  awesome  sweet
[10:57] but  I  am  who  I  am  with  or  without  the 
 money 
 and  imagine  this  compared  to  the  people
[11:03] you  know  your  age  who  was  the  exact 
 opposite  who  are  crazy  like  skimping
[11:09] trying  to  get  as  many  pennies  as 
 possible 
 you  probably  know  someone  in  your  family 
 who  will  happily  waste  an  hour  of  their
[11:15] life  to  save  one  dollar  don't  you 
 think  about  how  mad  that  is  they  could 
 work  minimum  wage  make  ten  dollars  but
[11:21] they'll  spend  an  hour  of  their  life  to 
 save  one  dollar  this  is  what  happens 
 when  you  get  in  this  ultimate  scarcity
[11:27] mode  and  you  see  all  these  pictures  you 
 know  women  see  like  Kim  Kardashian  in 
 the  fancy  dress  and  they're  like  oh  wow
[11:32] okay  if  I  get  that  that's  what  success 
 looks  like  then  everyone  will  kind  of 
 validate  me  and  I'll  get  the  you  know
[11:37] the  unconditional  love  that  I  wanted  as 
 a  child  and  for  the  young  men  seeing  the 
 gentleman  up  there  who  have  got  the  nice
[11:42] suits  the  watches  the  cars  the  lifestyle 
 the  women  hey  you  are  like  a  little  dog
[11:47] looking  up  in  master  and  ask  you  know 
 like  he  he's  got  a  new  two  hour  five 
 hour  video  but  there's  no  actual  real
[11:53] value 
 but  here  you  are  just  watching  like  a 
 fan
[11:58] not  really  gaining  anything  but  just 
 watching 
 listening  to  their  every  word
[12:07] not  only  do  you  need  a  strong  mindset  at 
 this  stage 
 you  need  to  bring  this  into  real  life
[12:14] and  start  to  live  in  a  like  a  very  cheap 
 low  expense  life
[12:20] to  take  the  pressure  off  you  can  you  see 
 the  advantage  of  this  because  if  right 
 here  right  now  you  are  totally  broke  but
[12:26] you  desire  these  these  expensive  things 
 you  will  act  in  such  like  a  short  term
[12:31] like  money  grabbing  kind  of  way  and 
 usually  those  kinds  of  people  don't  do
[12:36] so  well  in  business 
 instead  if  at  this  level  you're  able  to
[12:42] create  a  life  and  also  a  mind  which 
 doesn't  actually  need  much  it  doesn't
[12:47] need  much  material  success  that  brings 
 you  strength  in  business  that  will  make
[12:52] you  a  stronger  entrepreneur  because  any 
 money  you  make  will  feel  nice  but  you'll 
 think  to  yourself  like  I  don't  even  care
[12:58] about  spending  it  right  now 
 so  I  I'll  just  reinvest  it  back  into  my
[13:04] business  which  will  make  more  money  and 
 more  money  and  more  money  so  if  you're
[13:09] living  at  home  with  your  parents  right 
 now  and  you  want  to  move  out  you  know 
 it's  not  perfect  you  don't  have  enough
[13:14] space  or  freedom  and  if  you're  being 
 honest  you'd  like  to  live  by  yourself  so 
 that  you  could  [ __ ]  let's  just  be  honest
[13:20] don't  [ __ ]  lie 
 you'd  like  to  be  able  to  invite  some 
 friends  over  and  get  some  kind  of 
 validation  that  you've  got  your  own
[13:25] place  you'd  like  to  be  able  to  hop  on 
 Tinder  and  Instagram  maybe  get  some 
 girls  you  know  bring  like  a  date  back
[13:30] it'd  be  nice  right 
 what  if  just  for  now 
 you  just  click  your  fingers  and  just
[13:35] destroy  that  desire  from  your  mind  and 
 suddenly 
 that  monthly  expense  of  like  a  thousand
[13:41] dollars  has  just  disappeared 
 it's  taken  some  level  of  of  pressure  off
[13:48] that  you  needed  to  make  money  right  now 
 that  is  a  gift  to  your  future  self
[13:53] because  now  your  future  self  can  think 
 for  the  long  term  how  to  make  not  just
[13:58] like  an  okay  amount  of  money  1000  a 
 month  but  how  to  make  a  way  more
[14:04] for  me  in  2020  this  is  exactly  what  I 
 did 
 I  already  was  renting  an  apartment  I  was
[14:10] living  with  my  girlfriend  who  I  was  with 
 at  the  time  people  both  like  Gamers  I
[14:15] had  a  full-on  gaming  PC  she  did  I  had  a 
 gamer  girlfriend  who  I  got  to  have  sex 
 with  every  day  you  know  how  awesome  is
[14:20] that  there  I  am  living  in  the  city 
 thinking  that  I'm  an  adult  and 
 everything  I've  got  a  full-time  job  like
[14:25] somewhat  comfortable  life  and  I  smoke 
 weed  so  it's  like  you  know  it's  kind  of 
 fun  we  eat  junk  food  and  stuff  we've  got 
 a  nice  physique  I  had  a  couple  of
[14:30] friends 
 and  that  made  me  a  garbage  entrepreneur
[14:35] every  little  business  model  that  you 
 know  someone  would  be  talking  about  on 
 YouTube  I'd  try  it  but  I'd  need  to  make
[14:41] money  fast  and  I  couldn't  because  I 
 needed  to  work  full  time  I  needed  to  say 
 like  you  know  try  and  save  money  but 
 make  money  and  imagine  how  much  there  is
[14:47] in  your  mind  when  you've  got  all  of 
 these  random  things  that  are  that  are 
 taking  from  your  bank  account  that  are
[14:52] taking  from  your  energy  account  from 
 your  time
[14:57] so  what  did  I  do 
 I  downscaled  my  life  I  took  a  hit  to  my
[15:02] ego  to  this  this  materialism  that 
 everyone  values 
 and  I  moved  out  of  the  apartments
[15:08] and  where  did  I  move  to  I  moved  back 
 home  with  my  family
[15:13] no  [ __ ]  no  weed  no  friends  coming 
 over 
 just  work  and  when  I  moved  back  I  didn't
[15:20] go  with  this  idea  of  like  okay  as  soon 
 as  I  make  money  I'm  gonna  move  back  out 
 because  I  I  knew  I  could  just  feel  that
[15:26] if  I  am  obsessed  and  needy  with  money 
 that  it's  gonna  be  elusive  away  from  me
[15:32] but  if  I  act  like  I  don't  even  need  it 
 then  it  will  come  towards  me  exactly 
 like  a  woman
[15:38] and  so  with  absolute  minimum  expenses 
 I  started  my  business  here  in  this  very
[15:45] house 
 and  there  was  actually  a  point  where  I 
 considered  getting  a  job  you  know
[15:51] just  today  we  drove  past  the  warehouse 
 that  I  went  for  an  induction  at  Royal
[15:56] Mail  if  Royal  Mail  is  like  the  postage 
 service  a  big  Warehouse  close  to  my 
 house
[16:01] we  drove  past  that  today  and  I  couldn't 
 help  but  think  back  to  like  the 
 induction  day  that  I  had  there  that  I
[16:06] literally  went  when  I  was  trying  to 
 become  a  YouTuber  100  subscribers  200 
 subscribers  and  I  thought  you  well  you
[16:11] know  maybe  I  should  just  get  a  job 
 because  that's  what  everyone  thinks  is 
 normal  to  do 
 and  I  went  and  I  just  it  just  felt  so
[16:18] depressing  being  in  this  warehouse  and  I 
 remember  sitting  at  home  and  really  just 
 thinking  okay  like  I  could  get  this  job
[16:26] and  it  would  take  a  lot  of  my  time 
 it  would  give  me  like  a  fair  amount  of 
 money  you  know  I'd  be  working  full-time
[16:32] making  a  thousand  one  thousand  five 
 hundred  a  month  and  I've  got  like  no 
 expenses  so  I'll  be  able  to  like  get 
 this  money  right  now  that's  kind  of  nice
[16:37] right 
 but  I  realized 
 that  it  wasn't  money  that  was  gonna
[16:43] change  my  life  like  not  this  amount  of 
 money  1K  a  month  working  full-time 
 that's  not  going  to  change  my  life
[16:48] because  I'm  still  working  full-time  in  a 
 job  I  hate  what  was  going  to  change  my
[16:53] life  was  the  ability  to  put  all  of  my 
 focus  into  my  business  that  would  make  a 
 lot  more  money  in  the  future  and  I
[17:00] couldn't  do  that  if  I  was  working 
 full-time  so  do  you  see  how  I  sacrificed 
 money  and  material  success  at  this  level
[17:07] and  that  actually  led  to  way  more  money 
 and  material  success  in  the  future
[17:12] too  many  young  men  are  trying  to  make  as 
 much  money  as  possible  right  now  because 
 they're  so  brainwashed  like  zombies  when
[17:19] they  see  Tate  with  the  fancy  car  and 
 they  think  to  themselves  yes  okay  this 
 is  what  success  looks  like  this  is  what 
 success  looks  like  oh  okay  private  jet
[17:25] you  know  first  class  lights  are  or  Nice 
 Clothing  this  is  what  success  looks  like 
 for  you  that's  not  what  success  is
[17:32] for  you  success  would  be  that  you  don't 
 even  need  to  work  a  job  that  you  can 
 spend  all  your  time  developing  something
[17:37] like  your  craft  your  skill  your  business 
 so  that  you  can  take  that  off
[17:42] it's  not  about  cashing  out  right  now  and 
 getting  the  car  and  getting  the  watch 
 and  the  clothes  to  like  look  good  in
[17:48] front  of  the  people  who  know  you  right 
 now  we  don't  care  about  them  in  five  to 
 ten  years  time  it's  about  setting  up
[17:54] something  for  the  long  run  that  means 
 you're  gonna  have  to  put  in  the  years  it 
 I'm  not  gonna  [ __ ]  lie  to  you  if  this
[18:00] was  gonna  be  like  a  [ __ ]  video  and 
 if  I  was  gonna  try  and  sell  you  some 
 course  I'd  tell  you  that  Yep  this  is
[18:05] gonna  just  take  a  you  know  a  few  weeks 
 haha  this  is  going  to  take  years  of  your 
 life
[18:11] if  you  don't  like  that  get  out  of  this 
 video  and  go  watch  another  tape 
 motivational  podcast  go  watch  some  more
[18:18] shorts 
 It's  Gonna  Take  Years  of  your  life  but 
 guess  what
[18:23] this  is  what  I'm  offering  you  here 
 years
[18:28] this  is  what  the  rest  of  the  world  is 
 offering  you  decades
[18:33] I  want 
 two  hours  however  long  this  video  is 
 going  to  be  two  hours  of  your  life  to
[18:40] get  you  to  the  point  where  money  is 
 checked  off 
 the  materialistic  World  wants  your  soul
[18:49] chances  are  if  you're  watching  this 
 video  you've  also  watched  like  many  bits 
 of  content  from  all  these  male
[18:54] influencers  who  are  in  my  space  and  it 
 makes  me  very  sad  that  you  actually 
 genuinely  don't  have  almost  any  good
[19:01] male  role  model  the  thing  the  ones  that 
 you  think  are  good  once  you  take  a 
 deeper  look  into  them  you'll  realize
[19:06] that  they're  trapping  you  in  the  exact 
 same  way  that  they're  pretending  to  free 
 you  from  it's  not  that  making  a  lot  of
[19:12] money  and  being  able  to  spend  it  makes 
 you  powerful 
 it's  not  needing  money  that  makes  you
[19:19] more  powerful 
 now  imagine  not  needing  money
[19:24] but  you  end  up  making  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  it 
 anyway  now  imagine  that  level  of  power
[19:29] and  certainty  and  confidence 
 reassurance  conviction  that  you  would
[19:35] have  in  yourself  when  you  didn't  need 
 much  money  but  you're  making  so  much  of 
 it
[19:42] this  is  where  your  feeling  of  power  and 
 freedom  comes  from  one  little  extra  trip
[19:48] I'll  just  give  about  the  male 
 influencers  because  no  one  talks  about 
 this  you  know  how  they  all  live  in  Dubai 
 and  you  know  how  they  all  talk  about
[19:53] like  yeah  freedom  is  really  important 
 bro  you  know  they're  not  actually  free 
 you  know  that  they  have  to  live  in  Dubai
[19:58] for  three  to  six  months  of  the  year 
 they're  not  actually  allowed  to  leave 
 they  don't  actually  say  this  to  you
[20:03] because  it  doesn't  sound  as  you  know  the 
 device  seems  really  cool  it's  like  yeah 
 like  bro  I  moved  there  just  like  oh  yeah
[20:09] you  know  I'm  a  high  value  man  I've  got 
 the  watch  and  I  move  there  right  this  is 
 what  none  of  them  will  actually  tell  you 
 it's  like  they've  traded  their  freedom
[20:15] for  money  when  you  move  over  to  Dubai 
 yeah  you  get  zero  percent  taxes  you're
[20:20] not  allowed  to  leave 
 you're  not  allowed  to  go  back  to  your 
 home  country  for  more  than  like  90  days
[20:25] a  year  they've  traded  their  freedom  and 
 also  happiness  and  also  health  for  more
[20:31] money  oh  yes  they  won't  tell  you  this 
 because  it  doesn't  sound  as  cool  they 
 won't  tell  you  the  fact  that  like  you've
[20:37] struggle  to  breathe  when  you're  in  Dubai 
 the  air  pollution's  all  crazy  there 
 you  can't  even  drink  the  water  there
[20:43] that  you're  drinking  from  plastic  water 
 bottles  that  are  estrogenic  you're 
 genuinely  trading  your  health
[20:49] your  happiness  your  Soul's  fulfillment 
 your  purpose  as  a  man  for  more  numbers
[20:54] in  your  bank  account  and  and  some  stinky 
 hole  when  a  girl  opens  her  leg  this  is 
 what  these  men  are  wow  amazing  role
[21:01] models
[21:07] I'm  gonna  help  you  to  get  to  a  more 
 powerful  position  in  them  here's  your 
 first  actionable  step  and  it's  a
[21:12] visualization 
 visualize  more  of  the  secret  millionaire
[21:18] lifestyle 
 visualize  more  of 
 the  stoic  way  of  making  money
[21:27] what  do  you  see  if  you  close  your  eyes 
 and  you  thought  of  this  simple  life 
 imagine  you  think  of  a  life  where  you
[21:33] get  to  do  exactly  what  you  want  to  do 
 with  your  day 
 obviously  that  doesn't  mean  to  be  a
[21:39] complete  degenerate  yeah  yeah  I  want  to 
 do  crack  but  like  in  terms  of  you  know 
 good  things  for  yourself  for  your  family
[21:46] for  Humanity  is  your  contribution  to  the 
 world  what  would  your  ideal  life  look
[21:51] like 
 because  when  you  ask  a  young  man  who's 
 went  deep  into  you  know  watching  these
[21:56] influencers  his  answers  to  this  it  can 
 be  quite  materialistic  it's  like  yeah
[22:01] you  know  it's  the  car  that  yeah  that's 
 always  been  my  dream  car  but  when  you 
 take  a  step  back  and  you  ask  a  young
[22:06] person  okay  why  is  your  ideal  life  got 
 this  object 
 you'll  always  see  them  stutter  and  cope
[22:13] because  they're  unable  to  say  well 
 because  it  would  increase  my  status  in
[22:18] the  social  hierarchy  so  hopefully 
 unintelligent  people  would  like  me  more 
 and  there  might  be  some  women  who  let  me
[22:24] penetrate  them  because  I  enjoy 
 ejaculation 
 that's  the  answer
[22:30] don't  [ __ ]  yourself  is  that  not  the 
 answer  if  you've  got  some  like 
 materialistic  thing  that  you  want  that
[22:35] was  the  answer  wasn't  it  and  I  I'll  be 
 honest  yeah  100  it  is  for  me  I  bro  I've
[22:40] spent  years  of  my  life  doing  that  years 
 of  my  life  but  I'm  able  with  awareness 
 to  be  able  to  say  yep  it  was  like  I  was
[22:46] a  little  monkey  little  degenerate  just 
 chasing  ejaculation  like  a  lot  a  lot  of 
 these  like  high-level  men  are  literally
[22:52] still  little  monkeys  chasing  for 
 ejaculation  literally  like  once  you  look 
 at  look  at  the  the  men  that  you  look  up
[22:57] to  in  this  lens  of  just  thinking  like  he 
 actually  has  structured  his  life  and
[23:02] he's  disciplined  his  life  in  a  very 
 interesting  way  just  like  a  very  like 
 intelligent  monkey  would  have  to  just
[23:08] achieve  ejaculation  more 
 when  you  really  think  about  it  it's  like 
 that's  actually  [ __ ]  sad
[23:16] so  I'm  asking  you  what  is  your  ideal 
 life  genuinely  gonna  look  like  imagine 
 if  you  didn't  need  money  at  all
[23:24] would  you 
 really  want  the  life 
 where  you're  there  living  in  Dubai
[23:33] with  the  air  pollution 
 and  the  the  bus  of  the  Indian  slaves
[23:38] Pakistani  slaves  being  driven  across  and 
 they're  all  working  in  the  little 
 building  there  is  that  the  kind  of
[23:44] environment  that  you  want  to  live  in 
 where  everyone  flies  in  and  out  no  one's
[23:49] staying  there  long  term  so  you  don't 
 have  any  like  genuine  real  friends  and 
 the  friends  you  may  have  in  that  kind  of 
 environment  are  all  like  on  some  kind  of
[23:55] substances  and  yeah  of  course  there's 
 substances  in  Dubai  and  in  these  Islamic
[24:00] countries  they  don't  tell  you  this  on 
 the  internet  they're  as  degenerate  as  as 
 all  of  them
[24:07] would  you  like  to  wake  up  and  have  that 
 as  your  life  experience  really  think  to
[24:12] yourself  imagine  if  money  didn't  exist 
 imagine  if  this  this  craving  for  this 
 you  know  this  like  validation  from
[24:17] unintelligent  people  didn't  exist 
 what  would  your  dream  life  look  like  the
[24:23] thing  is  for  most  people  I  genuinely 
 believe  if  we  slap  some  [ __ ]  sense 
 into  you  and  we  told  you  like  stop
[24:30] caring  about  them  they're  not  even 
 thinking  about  you  it's  okay 
 if  we  like  shock  you
[24:36] and  try  to  [ __ ]  help  you  and  save 
 years  of  your  life  eventually  you'd  be
[24:42] honest  and  say  you  know  what 
 I  want  to  have  children  I  wanna  have
[24:48] like  a  Wi-Fi  it  doesn't  sound  cool 
 anymore  because  everyone  online  is 
 telling  me  like  not  to  get  married  and 
 stuff  but  like  I  want  to  have  one  wife  I
[24:55] want  to  go  live  in  like  a  nice  house 
 where  it's  safe 
 and  I  want  there  to  be  a  lot  of  nature 
 around  me  and  I  want  to  have  some  kind
[25:01] of  work  that  feels  meaningful  and  fun 
 for  me  to  do  and  it's  like  you  know 
 because  it's  fun  it  doesn't  even  feel
[25:07] like  work  so  I  can  go  and  do  that  for  a 
 few  hours  a  day  then  I  can  play  with  my 
 children  I  can  play  with  my  dog
[25:12] I've  got  my  wife  who  I  love  dearly  we 
 actually  really  have  like  an  awesome 
 healthy  relationship  I  can't  believe
[25:18] I've  ever  actually  genuinely  been  this 
 level  of  like  open  and  loving  towards 
 another  person  and  they  have  to  me
[25:24] I  have  my  faith 
 I  have  like  a  few  like  interesting 
 hobbies  that  I  like  I  like  like  team
[25:30] sports  like  I've  been  playing  Cricket 
 with  the  local  team  and  like  we've  been 
 actually  doing  really  well  and  people
[25:35] actually  seem  to  like  like  me  there
[25:42] this  is  like  coming  back 
 to  power  where  you  don't  need  much  else
[25:48] you  don't  you're  not  there  thinking  oh 
 man  you  know  I  hope  my  video  pops  off  on 
 YouTube  oh  yeah  you  know  you  know  that
[25:55] Instagram  picture  that  they  posted  was 
 so  good  I  really  want  a  lifestyle  like 
 them
[26:01] four  wives  you  know  because  it  is  just 
 shut  up  [ __ ]  red  pill  podcast  this  is
[26:08] who  you're  taking  your  life  Direction 
 from 
 degenerates  glorified  little  monkeys  who
[26:14] who  are  addicted  to  ejaculation
[26:19] what  is  your  ideal  life
[26:24] you  don't  realize  how  important  this 
 actionable  step  is
[26:29] if  you  can  take 
 I  was  going  to  say  an  hour  but  honestly 
 if  you  can  take  days
[26:35] to  think  about  this  deeply  you  might 
 save  Decades  of  your  life 
 think  about  your  real  ideal  life  and
[26:43] keep  asking  yourself  why  when  a  young 
 man  hears  this  question  and  he  does 
 write  down  something  like  oh  yeah  he
[26:48] wants  the  car  he  wants  the  Tate 
 lifestyle  a  few  years  ago  I  would  have 
 told  you  the  Dan  Bilzerian  lifestyle
[26:53] where  I  get  to  throw  parties  with  like 
 with  Coke  and  hookers  and  and  weed  and 
 [ __ ]  I  can't  believe  I  would  I  spent
[26:59] years  of  my  life  with  that  kind  of 
 Desire  just  because  it  like  it  looked 
 kind  of  cool  on  social  media  you  just
[27:05] wasted  years  of  of  peeling  back  the 
 layers  of  your  purpose
[27:10] you  just  wasted  like  years  of  the  time 
 that  you  could  have  spent  deepening  the 
 love  with  the  people  who  actually  matter
[27:16] and  here  you  are  just  so  so  like 
 perturbs  this  is  like  the  opposite  of
[27:21] masculinity  what  these  masculine 
 creators  are  putting  it  on  to  you
[27:28] what  would  actually  be  your  real  ideal 
 life
[27:35] when  you  strip  away  the  [ __ ]  and  you 
 keep  asking  why  and  you  realize  how  sad 
 it  is  to  like  put  your  life  down  the
[27:41] line  where  you're  literally  just  doing 
 it  for  this  like  validation  for  other 
 people  you're  doing  this  because  there's
[27:46] like  unintelligent  people  it's  always  on 
 intelligent  people  that  they  might  look 
 at  you  and  smile  at  you  and  like  be  nice
[27:52] to  you 
 you  realize  how  sad  it  is  to  spend  your 
 life  like  that
[27:58] so  this  doesn't  mean  that  you  need  to  be 
 broke  and  to  be  hungry  this  doesn't  mean
[28:03] that  you're  not  going  to  be  making  money 
 it  isn't  my  belief
[28:08] you'll  actually  make 
 so  much  more  money  this  way
[28:14] when  you  almost  pursue  the  more  simple 
 life  of  not  really  being  materialistic
[28:23] there's  two  men  who  I  know  one  of  them 
 you  probably  know 
 who  portray  this  really  well
[28:29] Alex  hamozi  and  Alex  Becker  these  are
[28:34] two  entrepreneurs  but  there's  actually 
 many  of  them  that  Sam  Walton  the  creator 
 of  Walmart  Jeff  Bezos  like  um  Mark
[28:41] Zuckerberg  these  men  they  live  very 
 simple  lives  and  they've  become 
 millionaires  or  even  billionaires
[28:48] you  see  outside  of  this  social  media 
 lens  like  you  spend  all  your  time  on 
 social  media  let's  be  honest  it's
[28:53] actually  kind  of  sad  when  you  think 
 about  it  because  YouTube  still  is  a 
 social  media  podcast  [ __ ]  tape 
 podcast  still  a  social  media  right  so
[28:59] you've  got  to  be  honest  like  we're 
 actually  still  [ __ ]  losers  like  we 
 still  go  on  social  media  for  hours  a  day
[29:04] yeah  we  yeah  it's  YouTube  oh  yeah 
 hamza's  got  a  new  video  it's  still 
 [ __ ]  social  media  so  you're  still  a 
 bit  of  a  loser  like  so  am  I  right  so
[29:10] it's  like  we're  probably  not  that 
 advanced  but  when  you  think  of  like  some 
 genuine  billionaires 
 when  you  think  of  those  guys  who  have
[29:16] built  like  literal  companies  which  have 
 taken  over  the  entire  world  like  Walmart 
 like  Amazon
[29:22] they  live  simple  lives  they're  not 
 they're  flashing  their  picture  of  the 
 fancy  car  because  they  don't  need  to
[29:28] show  you  because  they  weren't  doing  it 
 for  the  ego  they  did  it  just  because 
 they  genuinely  just  wanted  to  build  a
[29:34] good  company  that  like  would  help  a 
 certain  kind  of  person  and  then  here  you
[29:39] are  this  person  who's  looking  over  at 
 these  like  social  media  Stars  thinking 
 that  that's  the  right  way  to  go  about
[29:44] business 
 and  you've  tried  it  that  way
[29:49] you're  not  making  much  progress  right  so 
 you've  tried  it  this  way  of  looking  at 
 these  little  influences  you've  tried
[29:54] buying  their  courses  and  everything 
 you've  tried  watching  the  five  hour  tape 
 podcast  and  it  hasn't  actually  served
[29:59] you  that  well  because  you're  still  broke 
 so  if  you're  still  like  I  know  that 
 sounds  horrible  but  the  truth  is  come  on
[30:04] let's  be  smart  if  you've  tried  something 
 for  a  little  while  and  you  still  feel 
 clueless  you're  still  thinking  Which 
 business  model  you  know  you've  switched
[30:09] over  business  muscle  models  how  many 
 times  be  honest  how  many  times  over  the 
 last  six  months  have  you  switched
[30:14] business  model  to  business  model  four 
 five  six  oh  maybe  it  should  be  YouTube 
 maybe  I  should  sell  course  uh
[30:19] copyrighted  on  this  one  ages  ago  you 
 keep  switching  around  you're  not  making 
 any  real  progress
[30:24] so  whatever  you're  doing  right  now  isn't 
 working  is  it  it's  a  different  mindset 
 that  you  need
[30:30] if  right  now  you're  not  feeling  totally 
 convinced  or  certain  you  might  be 
 valuable  for  you  to  re-watch  this  like
[30:37] this  mindset  part  of  this  full  guide 
 and  just  let  it  convince  you  and  to
[30:42] destroy  those  beliefs  in  your  brain 
 because  I'm  not  gonna  lie  to  you 
 if  I  was  in  your  position  again  as  I  was
[30:49] I  would  feel  quite  a  lot  of  fear  right 
 now  I  don't  know  if  you're  feeling  it  if 
 you  if  you  have  the  sort  of  body
[30:54] awareness  to  feel  fear  inside  of  your 
 body  I  often  feel  it  in  my  stomach  if  I 
 was  in  your  position  right  now  I  would
[31:00] feel  some  level  of  fear  considering  okay 
 not  going  down  the  materialistic  path
[31:05] that  you've  been  probably  making  some 
 kind  of  progress  to  with  your  desires 
 because  that  would  mean  that  you're  not
[31:10] going  to  seem  as  cool  in  front  of  other 
 people  it  would  mean  that  you  don't  get 
 to  like  sort  of  you  know  go  all  in  on
[31:15] the  sort  of  Tate  mindset  or  the  you  know 
 whatever  influencer  whoever's  famous 
 these  days  it's  like  you've  built  up
[31:20] that  life  of  thinking  yeah  I  can  be  that 
 guy  who's  really  high  status  and  girls 
 will  really  like  me  and  then  you  know
[31:25] I'll  be  able  to  ejaculate 
 and  when  you  start  to  rip  that  away  like 
 I'm  doing  from  you  I'm  ripping  away  this
[31:31] desire  that  you've  had  now  it  feels  like 
 now  you're  roaring  naked  and  now  you 
 have  to  face  the  world  to  realize  that
[31:36] you've  just  wasted  the  last  six  months 
 of  your  life  maybe  12  months  maybe  three 
 years  of  your  life  going  down  a  path
[31:41] that  you  knew  that  was  never  gonna  serve 
 you  anyway  because  the  thing  that  would 
 be  right  for  you  is  nowhere  near  as  cool
[31:47] socially  validated  as  everything  else 
 admit  it  to  yourself  take  some  time  to
[31:52] say  it  you  know  what 
 my  real  desire  it's  not  as  cool  I  want
[31:57] to  have  that  house  in  the  countryside  I 
 want  to  like  just  live  with  my  family  I 
 wanna  just  have  like  the  car  that's
[32:03] actually  really  nice  to  drive  but  not 
 the  Supercar  that  would  turn  people's 
 heads  because  I  don't  care  about  those
[32:08] people  on  the  street 
 I  don't  care  about  the  unintelligent 
 women  who  will  like  my  Instagram
[32:13] pictures 
 I  want  something  deeper  than  that
[32:19] I  would  be  so  scared  if  I  was  in  your 
 position  if  I  was  like  aware  of  it  I 
 don't  know  if  you  are  I  don't  know  if  I
[32:24] seem  really  crazy  maybe  it'll  take  you  a 
 few  more  years  to  get  to  the  point  where 
 you're  able  to  understand  what  I'm
[32:29] saying  maybe  you'll  want  to  check  back 
 to  this  video  in  2025  2026  2027  and
[32:34] maybe  then  you'll  realize  that  this  was 
 making  a  lot  more  sense  than  you  you 
 were  able  to  comprehend
[32:39] I'm  trying  to  save  Decades  of  your  life 
 and  I  wish  someone  did  this  for  me
[32:45] I'm  very  lucky  that  I  was  able  to  pull 
 myself  out  of  this  like  this  money 
 greedy  I  need  as  many  pennies  as
[32:50] possible 
 and  again  the  best  part  about  what  I'm
[32:55] telling  you  is  that  you'll  make  more 
 money  this  way  but  you  have  to  take  a 
 leap  of  faith  the  way  you'll  make  more
[33:00] money  is  because  it's  just  like  how 
 you'll  get  girls  when  you're  not  being 
 needy  for  them  when  you  don't  need  the
[33:06] girl  that's  when  you're  actually  more 
 attractive  it's  the  exact  same  with 
 money  when  you're  not  there  trying  to 
 like  you  know  like  thinking  oh  you  know
[33:12] how  can  I  spend  one  more  money  how  can  I 
 get  more  money  how  can  I  get  more  money 
 then  you'll  make  more  money  because 
 you'll  make  better  long-term  decisions  I
[33:18] am  not  against  money  I'm  not  against  you 
 working  hard  and  contributing  and  giving
[33:23] value  and  making  money  I'm  not  against 
 spending  money  I'm  not  even  against  some 
 like  materialistic  objects  not  at  all
[33:29] but  I'm  against  the  false  messaging  the 
 brainwashing  that  is  inside  of  your  mind 
 that  has  convinced  you  that  this  is  like
[33:35] the  only  path  to  consider 
 that's  pulling  you  away  from  friends  and
[33:40] family  that's  pulling  you  away  from  your 
 own  health  because  to  an  extreme  level 
 is  this  not  what  your  parents  went
[33:46] through  why  they've  been  sleep  deprived 
 for  20  years  is  this  is  this  not  the
[33:51] same  thing 
 it's  just  that  you  seem  enlightened 
 because  you  know  about  business  and  yeah 
 there's  faster  ways  to  make  money  then
[33:57] you  know  that  your  parents  know  fine 
 but  the  way  that  you  look  at  your 
 parents  is  if  they're  following  like
[34:02] some  kind  of  outdated  script  and  they 
 don't  know  about  them  the  better  way  of 
 life
[34:07] is  the  way  that  more  intelligent  people 
 are  just  looking  at  you  thinking  yep  he 
 doesn't  know  now  trust  me  when  I  say
[34:12] that  those  people  on  social  media  the 
 the  men's  influences  they're  very 
 intelligent  they  know  that  they're 
 selling  you  like  a  false  god  they  know
[34:18] that  they're  selling  you  this  lifestyle 
 that  will  get  them  what  they  want  but 
 not  get  what  what  you  want
[34:28] and  you'll  keep  following  them 
 because  they  soothe  that  sort  of  Primal
[34:33] stupid  unintelligent  part  inside  of  you 
 that  just  wants  to  be  accepted  by  others
[34:39] they'll  twist  the  knife  of  your  Primal 
 pain  of  a  lack  of  like  consistent  love
[34:44] and  Community  as  you  see  in  these  days 
 where  you  know  everyone's  so  separated 
 everyone's  so  lonely  they'll  twist  the
[34:50] knife  tell  you  that  men  are  so  lonely 
 and  then  they'll  tell  you  well  yeah  you 
 know  the  Cure  of  that's  making  money
[34:55] haha 
 hmm 
 is  that  what  it  is
[35:02] so  why  are  people  lonelier  in  wealthier 
 countries
[35:07] it  doesn't  sound  anywhere  near  as  cool 
 but  I  you  know  what  I  almost  want  to
[35:12] start  like  a  new  movement  of  us 
 confidently  making  like  the  real  natural
[35:17] human  part  of  us  cool  again  of  wanting 
 more  of  the  simple  life  of  of  wanting
[35:22] mud  and  grass  between  our  feet  of 
 thinking  how  cool  it  would  be  to  have 
 like  I  don't  know  like  a  cabin  in  the
[35:28] woods  with  people  that  you  love  of  like 
 one  of  the  greatest  Joys  being  like 
 getting  a  dog  and  playing  with  it
[35:34] of  not  needing  to  go  fly  around  the 
 country  podcast  the  podcast  yeah  you 
 know  so  a  high  value  man  is  like  just
[35:41] shut  up  bro  shut  up  however  it's 
 actually  what  do  you  want  about  high 
 volume  one  and  this  and  this  and  this  go
[35:47] sell  your  [ __ ]  program
[35:54] a  high  value  man  is  not  the  guy  who's 
 making  the  most  amount  of  money  bro 
 because  the  thing  is
[36:00] I'm  making  a  lot  more  money  than  I  was 
 six  months  ago
[36:05] but  if  I  was  doing  this  while  selling  my 
 soul 
 it  would  be  worthless  you've  heard  about
[36:12] how  important  purpose  is  for  men  purpose 
 you've  heard  that  so  much  but  none  of
[36:17] these  guys  online  will  actually  explain 
 it  to  you
[36:22] there  is  like  a  great  mission  for  you 
 here  on  Earth  there  absolutely  is  I
[36:28] thought  that  this  was  like  woo-woo  BS 
 but  I'm  so  much  seeing  this  as  the  truth 
 now  there  is  like  a  real  reason  a
[36:35] mission  for  you  to  be  here  and  it  is  not 
 to  follow  these  random  influences 
 including  myself  it  is  not  to  like  make
[36:41] them  the  hero  like  odd  guys  you've  seen 
 you  take  podcasts  but  rather  to  see 
 yourself  and  it  sounds  cringe  like  to
[36:46] see  yourself  as  the  main  character  and 
 to  to  peel  back  the  [ __ ]  that's  been
[36:51] put  across  this  core  part  of  you  that 
 knows  what  you  should  do  with  your  life 
 because  it  was  there  at  the  beginning
[36:57] like  this  clear  message  what  you  should 
 have  done  with  your  life 
 and  other  people  the  education  system
[37:03] your  parents  family  social  media 
 influencers  everything  has  just  put 
 their  own  message  on  top  so  now  you
[37:09] don't  even  know  who  you  are 
 so  you're  living  this  weird  inauthentic
[37:15] like  shallow  breathing  lifestyle 
 so  is  there  any  wonder  why  sometimes
[37:21] your  dick  doesn't  work  is  any  wonder  why 
 like  you  can't  even  feel  like  much  in 
 your  body  like  you  almost  feel  AFK  in
[37:27] your  own  body  these  days  because  we 
 don't  do  natural  things
[37:32] you're  here  with  like  like  the  sweaty 
 stinky  computer  chair
[37:37] that  smells  like  ass  another  tape 
 podcast  oh  yes  yes  let's  push  my  purpose
[37:43] off  for  another  few  hours 
 yeah  I  gotta  make  money  guys  yeah  making 
 money  is  really  important  guys
[37:51] there's  a  better  way  to  go  about  this 
 I  apologize  if  it  seems  like  I've  just 
 wasted  a  bunch  of  times  with  the  rants
[37:57] but  I've  wanted  to  say  that  for  a  good 
 while  now 
 when  I've  taken  a  step  back  from  the
[38:02] internet  and  from  technology 
 I've  realized  just  how  much  [ __ ]  is
[38:07] going  on  here 
 now  I  will  teach  you  this  the  real  truth
[38:14] about  making  money  and  there  is  no 
 upsell  in  this  there's  no  course  that 
 you  need  to  buy
[38:19] but 
 I  am  warning  you  that  by  the  time  you 
 get  to  the  end  of  this  video  you'll
[38:24] realize  that  if  this  was  a  weird  wrong 
 almost  path  to  go  down
[38:31] but  I  had  to  go  down  this  path  myself 
 and  so  I  don't  blame  you  for  needing  to
[38:36] experience  it  and  to  see  the  light 
 yourself  either 
 so  my  hope  is  that  I  can  get  you  to
[38:43] maybe  this  realization  faster 
 why
[38:51] honestly  I  just  want  more  guys  in  the 
 world 
 who  see  the  truth
[38:57] not  the  truth  that's  trying  to  be  sold 
 to  you  whether  it's  the  education  system 
 or  or  these  same  guys  who  are  pretending
[39:04] to  free  you  from  the  Matrix  like  all  of 
 them  I'm  not  even  just  blaming  Tate 
 obviously  I'm  just  using  his  name 
 because  he's  the  most  famous  but  I
[39:10] haven't  seen  a  good  male  influence  I've 
 not  even  seen  one  single  one  it's  so 
 upsetting  I've  not  seen  one  single  one
[39:16] because  they're  all  just  here  like 
 inside  of  this  box  pretending  like  the 
 box  is  like  all  there  isn't  that  this  is
[39:21] maybe  the  line  maybe  they  actually  know 
 the  truth  or  maybe  they're  not  actually 
 that  advanced  but  like  here  they  are  in
[39:26] this  box  selling  you  more  secrets  inside 
 of  this  box
[39:31] but  you  can  take  a  step  out  of  the  box 
 and  realize  how  foolish  it  is  to  stay  in 
 there
[39:36] and  it  actually  hurts  my  heart  to  see 
 how  many  managers  riddle  inside  of  this
[39:41] this  box  of  of  wasted  potential  of  just
[39:46] random  desire  of  materialism  of  status 
 yeah  I  gotta  you  know  my  shoulder  needs
[39:51] to  be  a  little  bit  more  muscular  this 
 way  and  then  I'll  feel  worthy  of  love 
 you  can  shortcut  the  thing  that  you  want
[39:57] because  when  you  really  boiled  it  down 
 it  wasn't  actually  money  that  you  wanted 
 it  was
[40:02] what  was  it  was  Freedom  love  happiness 
 health  Joys  purpose  contribution
[40:08] Community  those  were  the  things  you 
 actually  wanted  in  in  this  modern  world 
 including  in  the  people  who  act  like
[40:14] they're  against  modernity  they're  just 
 putting  materialism  as  the  the  fix  of
[40:20] all  your  problems  and  yet  when  you 
 achieve  those  materialistic  desires  if 
 you're  actually  honest  you'll  realize
[40:25] that  it  didn't  fix  anything 
 so  it  becomes  a  massive  waste  of  time 
 and  I'm  sudden  that  I  spent  years  of  my
[40:31] life  like  three  or  four  three  years  like 
 full-time  sort  of  mastering  the  game  of
[40:36] money  and  getting  it  to  the  point  where 
 like  I  make  more  than  enough  money  I 
 could  ever  spend  now
[40:41] I  did  that  about  30  times  faster  than 
 most  people  would  or  I  don't  know  10
[40:46] times  20  times  faster  right  in  three 
 years  I  became  financially  free  I  don't 
 need  to  make  money  but  like  it  just  it
[40:51] just  comes  to  me  now  I  just  make  money 
 like  automatically  with  the  things  that 
 I  like  to  do  a  lot  of  it
[40:58] and  I  don't  need  it  remember  before  like 
 I  don't  need  the  money  like  what  what  am
[41:03] I  going  to  spend  every  now  and  then  I 
 like  to  go  stay  in  like  an  Airbnb  every 
 now  and  then  I'll  go  yeah  let  restaurant 
 and  stuff  fine  but  I  could  sit  in  the
[41:09] mud  and  smile  anyway 
 do  you  see  the  power  that  this  gives  me
[41:14] the  money  has  like  no  effect  I  can 
 imagine  speaking  to  my  younger  self 
 right  now  he  would  have  like  a  sadness
[41:19] in  his  heart  because  he'd  been  going 
 down  this  pursuit  of  thinking  that  this 
 was  going  to  cure  his  problems  and  so
[41:24] it's  almost  like  a  sad  feeling  so  if  you 
 want  you  can  click  away  and  go  get  like 
 a  nice  happy  little  bubbly  Feeling  by
[41:29] going  to  watch  some  like  motivational 
 video  yeah  you  know  go  get  some  money 
 yeah  you  know  what  like  yeah  do  it  you
[41:34] know  make  some  make  the  money  yeah  it's 
 not  gonna  get  you  what  you  actually  want 
 what  you  think  money  is  going  to  get  you
[41:42] it  won't 
 it  really  won't
[41:47] it  will  get  you  some  some  very  good 
 things  as  we'll  explain  in  the  spending 
 money  section  of  of  this  video  it  will
[41:53] actually  like  be  a  benefit  to  your  life 
 absolutely
[41:58] but  it's  important  to  realize  that  you 
 have  real  genuine  desires  inside  of  you 
 that  must
[42:04] be  appreciated 
 and  when  you  go  down  this  path
[42:09] especially  when  you're  following  the 
 wrong  people
[42:14] well  then 
 you're  selling  your  soul  for  a  few  bucks
[42:19] step  two 
 what  you  can  do  for  money
[42:26] imagine  a  fisherman 
 in  the  18  or  1700s  he  wakes  up  next  to
[42:33] his  beautiful  gorgeous  wife  amongst  his 
 children 
 at  sunrise  in  the  most  beautiful  sunrise
[42:39] and  he  goes  out  into  the  dark  and  he 
 starts  fishing 
 he  fuels  the  the  fishing  string  pull
[42:47] and  he  gets  one  and  two  and  three  and  he 
 actually  feels  really  good  about  himself 
 he  you  know  he's  good  at  this  skill  he's
[42:52] been  fishing  for  many  many  years 
 he  comes  home  passes  the  fish  over  to
[42:59] his  wife  she  cooks  it  they  have  a  lovely 
 meal  together  Daddy  brought  us  this  this
[43:04] food  we  eat  because  of  him 
 the  joy  and  the  love  that  he  would
[43:09] experience  and  also  the  purpose  of  him 
 providing 
 I  believe  this  kind  of  simple  life  is
[43:15] the  one  that  is  right  for  us
[43:20] but  others  don't 
 what  happened  to  this  fisherman  when  the
[43:25] Industrial  Revolution  starts  and  the 
 factories  overtaken  the  the  sea  is 
 polluted  he  goes  out  day  after  day  but
[43:31] zero  fish  they've  all  gone  they've  all 
 died  the  water's  contaminated  so  what  is
[43:36] he  gonna  do  he  can't  use  his  skill 
 anymore  the  thing  that  he  actually 
 enjoyed  doing  to  provide  to  his  family
[43:42] so  he  needs  to  go  work  inside  of  the 
 factory 
 he  gets  work  inside  of  the  factory  there
[43:47] he  is  all  day  it's  no  longer  like  we 
 wake  up  at  sunrise  nice  beautiful  time 
 silent  it's  like  this  loud  grinding
[43:53] machine  which  is  like  chattering  in  his 
 ear  working  next  to  all  the  weird  men 
 who  are  actually  being  horrible  towards
[43:59] him  boss  doesn't  even  like  him  before 
 Health  regulations  dust  clouds  and  black 
 smoke
[44:05] and  here  you  are  chump  some  gold  coins 
 and  what  does  he  do  with  these  coins
[44:13] well  he  goes  and  buys  a  fish  and  he 
 takes  that  home  and  gives  it  to  his 
 family  and  they  cook  it
[44:20] so  don't  you  see  that  you're  gonna  spend 
 a  few  hours  or  many  hours  of  your  day
[44:25] working  contributing  doing  some  kind  of 
 task
[44:31] you  could  do  the  wholesome  task  that 
 would  actually  be  like  amazing  for  your
[44:36] life  quality 
 or  you  could  go  and  like  do  the  thing
[44:42] that  might  make  you  more  money  so  that 
 you  can  just  get  what  you  wanted  from 
 the  life  quality  to  begin  with
[44:50] too  many  people  are  choosing  the  wrong 
 option  this  part  of  this  guide  will  help
[44:55] you  to  finally  figure  out  what  to  do  to 
 make  money
[45:00] what  business  model  to  get  into  maybe 
 what  career  to  get  into
[45:05] because  for  so  long  I  can  imagine  I've 
 spoke  to  many  young  guys  hundreds  of 
 guys  have  actually  told  me  this  exact
[45:10] same  problem 
 they  keep  flipping  around  from  business 
 model  to  business  model  maybe  you've
[45:16] wanted  to  try  becoming  a  YouTuber  maybe 
 you've  wanted  to  try  the  agency 
 marketing  or  the  copywriting  or  the  paid
[45:21] ads  and  all  these  different  kind  of  ways 
 to  make  money  you've  considered  a  couple 
 of  careers  but  you  know  you  like  there's
[45:26] too  many  people  saying  bad  things  about 
 careers  these  days  you  wouldn't  do  that 
 and  you've  got  no  idea  you're  making
[45:31] shallow  progress  you're  not  sure  what  it 
 is  that  you  should  do  with  your  life  you 
 just  know  one  thing  for  certain  you  want
[45:36] to  make  money 
 that's  the  problem
[45:41] that's  why  you're  stuck 
 if  you  can  go  into  step  one  like  we  said
[45:46] before  destroy  that  need  for  money  and 
 now  let's  start  from  a  Baseline  and 
 let's  figure  out  actually  the  right
[45:52] thing  for  you  to  do 
 this  is  the  thing  you  could  actually 
 commit  yourself  to  for  decades  imagine
[45:59] how  good  that  would  be  by  the  end  of 
 just  this  step  here  you  will  have  the 
 thing  that  you  could  genuinely  do  for
[46:04] decades  that  means  that  you'll  be  able 
 to  master  this  craft  this  skill  that 
 we're  about  to  find  out  for  you  which
[46:10] means  over  the  long  run  you're  going  to 
 make  a  lot  more  money  than  the  guys 
 flipping  around  from  business  model  to
[46:15] business  model  what  did  we  learn  from 
 the  story  of  the  fishermen 
 it's  that  your  life  quality  just  comes
[46:22] down  to  like  what  you  do  with  the  hours 
 of  your  day  and  working  is  going  to  be  a
[46:27] big  part  of  that  the  truth  is  that 
 making  money  is  nice  but  if  you  make
[46:32] money  while  sacrificing  the  hours  of 
 your  day  to  do  something  that  wasn't
[46:38] like  nice  for  you 
 then  the  benefit  of  the  money  actually 
 like  goes  away  like  okay  the  the
[46:45] fisherman  is  there  in  the  factory  let's 
 say  he's  going  to  get  the  equivalent  of 
 like  more  money  more  value  more
[46:50] resources  at  the  end  of  that  day  but  now 
 he's  literally  there  working  this  task 
 that  he  doesn't  like  that  isn't  healthy
[46:56] that  pulls  him  away  from  his  family  that 
 he's  kind  of  okay  up  and  not  really 
 amazing  at  like  he  is  with  fishing  but
[47:02] he  makes  more  money  that  he  can  use  to 
 exchange  for  a  fish 
 which  lifestyle  would  you  rather  have  in
[47:08] this  there's  no  real  answer  to  this  some 
 men  would  say  yep  I  just  want  to  make 
 the  money  I  just  want  to  make  the  money 
 those  men  even  though  it  sounds  horrible
[47:14] and  this  is  speaking  to  younger  me 
 because  he  was  one  of  those 
 it  sounds  horrible  they've  they've  got
[47:20] severe  problems  it  takes  years  to 
 counteract  that 
 and  I  know  that  I  sound  like  some  uh
[47:26] yeah  I'm  just  being  horrible  it's 
 actually  like  the  person  who  would 
 sacrifice  his  own
[47:32] health  and  experience  of  life  to  just  be 
 able  to  afford  something  that  will
[47:39] heighten  him  in  society  and  to  gain  some 
 status
[47:44] it's  actually  worrying 
 now  of  course  if  making  a  certain  amount
[47:50] of  money  would  genuinely  save  your  life 
 because  you're  in  a  war-torn  country 
 that's  different  because  think  about  how 
 like  gut  wrenching  it  is  for  this
[47:56] fisherman  where  he  had  like  those  hours 
 of  the  day  where  he  was  doing  something 
 which  was  still  productive  it  was  still
[48:01] getting  him  the  resources  he  needed  but 
 it  was  something  he  genuinely  enjoyed 
 and  because  of  that  he  was  able  to  get
[48:06] really  good  at  it  as  well  so  at  this 
 point 
 what  you  need  to  do  is  to  figure  out
[48:11] what  your  Flow  State  task  is  this  is  in 
 my  belief  that  single  greatest  way  to  go
[48:18] about  your  money  making  journey  is  to 
 narrow  in  on  what's  called  your  Flow
[48:24] State  task  this  is  a  task  that  you  do 
 that  you  naturally  get  like  zero
[48:29] thoughts  during  it's  a  task  that  you  do 
 which  could  be  like  work  for  someone  but
[48:34] it  feels  fun  and  enjoyable  almost  like  a 
 game  for  you  you'll  know  it's  your  Flow
[48:40] State  task  because  you  usually  will  have 
 zero  thoughts  whilst  you  do  it  for  me 
 it's  always  been  speaking  when  I  speak
[48:46] and  I  give  advice  and  explain  Concepts  I 
 always  have  zero  thoughts  in  my  brain 
 it's  still  hard  it's  like  this  demanding
[48:52] difficult  strenuous  task  but  at  the  same 
 time
[48:57] I  feel  like  I'm  in  some  kind  of  weird 
 like  Haze  right  now  like  I  I've  had  zero
[49:02] thoughts  in  my  mind  for  the  last  one  and 
 a  half  hours  and  that's  like  the  peak 
 human  experience  with  your  monkey  mind
[49:07] quietens  down  and  you  can  actually  just 
 be  here  presence  I  won't  go  into  more 
 detail  for  this  Flow  State  guide  I  made
[49:12] a  whole  like  two  hour  guide  on  my 
 channel  the  Flow  State  Focus  guy  just  go 
 watch  that  when  you  have  the  time  and
[49:17] until  then  just  think  about  whatever 
 your  Flow  State  task  could  be  the  kind 
 of  task  that  feels  Pleasant  for  you  but
[49:23] it  actually  still  is  pretty  productive 
 it's  speaking  for  me  maybe  it's  writing 
 for  you  maybe  it's  coaching  for  another
[49:28] person  maybe  it's  teaching  maybe  it's 
 like  lifting  weights  and  exercising 
 maybe  it's  it's  um  reading  like  whatever
[49:35] it  is  there's  got  to  be  something  which 
 really  just  aligns  to  you  that
[49:41] thing  that  you're  gonna  use  for  money 
 that  is  your  gift  to  humanity
[49:47] that  is  something  that  you  were  born 
 with  which  is  different  from  everyone 
 else
[49:52] I  believe  that  that  was  what  you  were 
 supposed  to  get  really  good  at  as  a  gift
[49:57] to  other  people 
 and  when  we  use  entrepreneurship  in  a 
 capitalist  society  when  we  give  that
[50:03] gift  to  other  people  they'll  give  us 
 money  in  return 
 do  you  see  how  my  gift  that  I  was  born
[50:08] with  because  I  was  four  years  old  when  I 
 knew  that  I  liked  explaining  Concepts  to 
 people  this  gift  of  speaking  I'm  using
[50:15] to  help  you 
 and  this  has  made  me  a  lot  of  money
[50:21] imagine  if  I  didn't  do  this  and  I  just 
 tried  to  chase  the  money  and  I  went  and 
 worked  at  the  warehouse
[50:27] I  would  have  made  more  money  back  then 
 right  I  would  have  made  more  money  back 
 then
[50:34] but  when  you  find  this  Flow  State  task 
 when  you  find  this  this  task  that  just
[50:40] feels  right  for  you  that  feels  enjoyable 
 for  you  even  though  it  might  not  be  the 
 thing  that's  going  to  make  a  lot  of
[50:45] money 
 naturally  you  get  really  good  at  it 
 because  you  just  want  to  do  it  all  the
[50:50] time  so  even  when  I'm  not  working  I'm 
 speaking  to  people  I'll  be  in  the  gym 
 and  I'll  end  up  like  meeting  a  new
[50:55] person  and  I  can't  help  but  to  like 
 speak  motivational  Concepts  and 
 everything  at  them  I  can't  help  it
[51:00] because  it's  just  enjoyable  for  me  to 
 like  say  things  out  of  my  mouth  and 
 explain  things  in  the  way  that  I
[51:06] understand  them  myself 
 that  means  that  you're  going  to  get 
 really  good  at  it  it  means  that  you're 
 going  to  practice  24  7  just  naturally  it
[51:13] means  that  you're  going  to  put  in  more 
 hours  than  everyone  else  and  actually 
 enjoy  it  and  this  is  the  best  part  if 
 you're  a  new  entrepreneur  if  you're
[51:18] trying  to  figure  out  like  you  know  which 
 business  to  make 
 when  you  know  your  Flow  State  task  you
[51:24] don't  jump  around  from  business  to 
 business  because  you  just  know  the  thing 
 that  you  can  go  all  in  on  for  me  it's
[51:29] speaking  so  there  might  be  you  know 
 YouTube  there  might  be  twitch  or  some 
 other  ways  being  a  motivational  speaker
[51:34] in  person  there's  different  things  I 
 could  do  but  as  long  as  the  skill  the 
 task  is  consistent  as  it  is  for  me  which
[51:39] is  speaking  it  Narrows  down  like  the 
 things  that  I'll  consider  right  now  you
[51:44] might  be  thinking  wait  wait  I  don't 
 really  know  my  flow  State  task  I  don't 
 even  understand  what  it  means  so  I'll 
 just  ask  you
[51:49] what  is  something  that  is  kind  of  like 
 work 
 but  you  do  it  and  it's  actually  kind  of
[51:55] fun  and  you  often  have  zero  thoughts  in 
 your  mind  whilst  you  do  it  if  you're  not 
 sure  of  the  answer  it  would  be  valuable
[52:01] for  you  to  just  keep  this  question  in 
 mind  and  maybe  go  through  your  life 
 because  there  probably  is  something  that
[52:06] you're  doing  right  now  or  maybe 
 something  that  you'll  eventually  find 
 where  this  will  become  more  apparent
[52:11] this  advice  is  going  to  sound  lame  but 
 if  you're  just  going  like  try  new  things 
 sometimes  you'll  be  able  to  go  and  find
[52:16] like  the  thing  that  puts  you  into  more 
 of  a  flow  State  there's  zero  thoughts  in 
 your  mind  it  feels  super  enjoyable  you
[52:21] integrate  with  the  task  you  almost  lose 
 your  sense  of  self  and  why  is  this  so 
 hard  to  find  why  is  no  one  ever  taught
[52:26] you  this  before 
 well  because  it's  not  as  cool
[52:32] you  see  when  you're  trying  to  figure  out 
 what  your  Flow  State  task  is  it  might 
 not  be  the  thing  that's  going  to  make 
 like  potentially  the  most  amount  of
[52:38] money  right  now  it  might  not  be  the  most 
 trending  thing  and  so  why  isn't  this 
 spoken  about  more  if  this  is  such  great
[52:43] advice  why  is  no  one  else  speaking  about 
 this 
 I  think  it's  because
[52:48] this  isn't  a  way  to  guarantee  that 
 you'll  make  the  most  amounts  of  money 
 but  it  is  the  way  to  guarantee  that  you
[52:54] will  have  the  most  amount  of  fulfillment 
 and  purpose  in  your  life  so  you  need  to 
 choose  right  now  if  there's  one  that  you
[52:59] would  sacrifice  would  you  sacrifice  your 
 purpose  as  a  man  or  would  you  sacrifice 
 more  money  let's  say  you're  not  going  to
[53:05] be  totally  broke  which  one  would  you 
 sacrifice  the  reason  why  you  exist 
 or  material  success
[53:12] most  people  would  literally  sacrifice 
 their  purpose  that's  why  they  stay
[53:17] average  that's  why  they  stay  as  the  99 
 but  there  are  some  strong
[53:22] stoic-minded  men  Superior  men  who  would 
 always  choose  purpose  over  the  material
[53:28] success  school  did  not  prepare  you  for 
 this  in  fact  it  did  the  exact  opposite 
 School  brainwashed  you  to  think  that  you
[53:34] should  do  whatever  it  takes  to  just  get 
 into  the  career  that  will  just  be  the
[53:40] highest  salary  possible 
 School  brainwashed  you  like  that  but 
 then  unfortunately  all  these  internet
[53:46] entrepreneurs  brainwashed  you  to  think 
 that  you  should  just  do  whatever 
 business  makes  the  most  money  as 
 possible
[53:51] again  this  is  a  weak  place  to  come  from 
 why  optimize  your  life  for  material
[53:56] success  when  you  can  optimize  it  for 
 like  a  real  masculine  purpose
[54:01] it's  just  worrying  because  mask  like 
 seemingly  masculine  men 
 say  this  and  so  it  seems  weird  now  that
[54:08] I'm  like  calling  it  out  because  you're 
 realizing  yeah  it  is  [ __ ]  weird  how 
 like  wow  they're  telling  you  to  like  not
[54:13] follow  your  purpose  and  instead  of  just 
 trying  to  make  as  much  money  as  possible 
 but  that  might  not  be  your  purpose
[54:19] what  if  you  were  going  to  feel 
 absolutely  spiritually  enlightened  happy 
 loved
[54:25] purposeful  as  a  man 
 but  you  are  going  to  be  more  of  this 
 like  starving  artist  kind  of  person
[54:30] where  you  were  going  to  contribute  to 
 humanity  greatly  but  you  weren't  gonna 
 make  much  material  success  and  maybe  at
[54:36] times  you  might  be  slightly  like  you 
 might  be  like  homeless  that  sounds  awful 
 in  some  ways  but  like  what  if  that  was
[54:42] the  life  that  actually  would  have  led 
 you  to  the  greatest  actual  genuine  life
[54:48] our  fear  of  our  lack  of  material  success 
 and  status  is  gonna  make  us  sacrifice
[54:55] our  purpose  as  men  and  that  is  the 
 priority  of  Our  Lives  that  is  the  reason 
 why  we  exist  and  every  step  that  you
[55:00] take  away  from  your  purpose  will  always 
 pain  you  every  step  that  you  take 
 towards  your  purpose  will  always  serve
[55:05] you 
 foreign 
 this  is  a  big  step  towards  your  purpose
[55:10] and  again 
 I  know  that  this  doesn't  sound  very  like 
 YouTuber  mode  of  me  but  I  understand  if
[55:17] you  want  to  take  a  break  from  this  video 
 and  you  want  to  come  back  in  in 
 two  or  three  years  I  actually  understand
[55:22] and  I  know  that  seems  like  weird  to  say 
 but  if  16  year  old  me  or  17  18  19  20  21
[55:28] 22  23  year  old  me  had  watched  this  video 
 it  would  just  be  too  overwhelming  and
[55:33] I'd  be  too  scared  to  continue  watching 
 it  past  a  certain  points  if  you  are 
 gonna  think  to  yourself  yeah  you  know
[55:38] this  is  kind  of  weird  yeah  I'll  think 
 about  this  later  just  know  that  you  are 
 wasting  your  life  in  the  meantime  when
[55:43] you  go  away  for  like  a  year  or  two 
 you're  not  going  to  follow  this  advice 
 for  now  you've  wasted  those  two  years 
 you  won't  believe  it  but  eventually  you
[55:48] will  look  back  and  realize  that  it  was 
 just  pointless  to  go  and  pursue 
 something  that  wasn't  even  your  purpose
[55:53] and  there's  a  brilliant  question  that 
 can  come  up  right  now  and  you  might 
 think  okay  I  know  my  flow  State  task  I
[55:58] well  I  kind  of  know  okay  it's  probably 
 this  this  thing  right  it's  probably 
 writing  let's  say  but  what  if  it  doesn't
[56:03] make  much  money  what  if  it  can't  make 
 much  money  and  that's  a  brilliant 
 question  to  ask  but  I  would  say  don't  be
[56:08] so  sure  that  your  Flow  State  task  might 
 not  make  much  money  because  mastering  a
[56:13] skill  over  decades  inevitably  makes  you 
 like  a  high  income  earner  comparing  to
[56:19] the  person  who's  just  flipping  around 
 own  business  model  so  you're  definitely 
 got  to  be  better  off  going  all  in  on
[56:24] something  that's  not  very  profitable 
 than  like  flipping  around  and  not  making 
 any  progress  in  profitable  businesses
[56:30] that  you're  not  even  actually  making 
 progress  in  the  beauty  of  going  all  in 
 on  your  Flow  State  task  like  your  gift
[56:35] to  humanity  for  me  it's  speaking  is  that 
 this  is  the  thing  that  you  can  do  for
[56:40] decades  and  over  that  amount  of  time 
 what  is  trending  what  makes  a  lot  of
[56:45] money  right  now  inevitably  that  changes 
 and  if  it  crosses  and  overlaps  onto  your
[56:51] gift  you  will  make  a  lot  of  money 
 so  for  example  when  I  first  started  like
[56:56] these  YouTube  videos  and  it  felt  really 
 good  to  do  it  I  didn't  know  about  this 
 concept  of  flow  States  it  just  felt  kind
[57:02] of  like  right  for  me  to  give  advice  to 
 people  to  speak 
 eventually  I  started  making  a  lot  of
[57:08] money  from  this  and  I  had  to  learn  all 
 the  skills  and  you  know  go  through  the 
 trials  and  tribulations  and  everything 
 but  I  didn't  start  thinking  that  I  would
[57:14] make  this  much  money  I  just  wanted  to 
 make  like  one  or  two  thousand  dollars  a 
 month  that  was  I  literally  just  wanted
[57:19] to  make  enough  so  I  didn't  need  to  work 
 like  a  full-time  job  that  I  hated  it 
 just  so  happened  that  the  sort  of
[57:24] markets  of  where  the  money  is  going 
 moved  onto  social  media  attention
[57:31] influences  and  I  happen  to  just  grow 
 like  crazy 
 I  don't  believe  I  got  lucky  in  the
[57:37] growth  of  my  channel  I  think  I  really 
 put  in  the  work  for  that  and  I  leveled 
 up  the  skill  but  I  certainly  got  lucky
[57:43] with  the  fact  that  at  this  time  when  I 
 had  been  leveling  up  my  skill  was  when
[57:48] like  the  new  meta  of  making  money  is  now 
 currently  on  like  social  media
[57:53] influences  like  that's  like  the  the  best 
 job  or  business  that  you  can  begin  right 
 now  for  like  young  sort  of  not  that
[58:00] extremely  experienced  people  now 
 straight  away  you  might  be  thinking  okay 
 sweet  so  I'll  just  do  that  but  again
[58:05] don't  just  follow  the  money  because  this 
 will  change  this  will  have  inevitably 
 changed  in  the  next  few  years  it's  like
[58:10] you  know  people  might  find  like 
 influences  and  YouTubers  cringe  in  five 
 or  ten  years  from  now  in  this  Ai  and
[58:15] there's  so  many  new  things  coming  out 
 that  like  the  market  will  eventually 
 change  if  you're  following  the  market 
 like  a  little  dog  seeing  okay  what's
[58:21] trending  right  now  then  you're  just 
 constantly  going  to  be  like  too  far 
 behind  the  only  way  in  my  opinion  to  get
[58:26] really  really  rich 
 is  you  go  all  the  way  into  your  Flow
[58:31] State  task  for  me  it's  speaking  and  if 
 the  market  just  ends  up  actually 
 overlapping  and  then  you  get  super  super
[58:37] rewarded  it's  like  you  got  lucky  in  some 
 ways  and  also  you  forced  it  in  others  I
[58:42] think  that's  the  way  that  you  get  rich 
 these  days 
 people  just  end  up  rewarding  your  Flow
[58:48] State  task  just  because  that's  like  the 
 nature  of  like  business  has  just  moved 
 around  you  know  our  interests  have  just
[58:54] moved  around  imagine  the  guy  who  is 
 studying  AI  artificial  intelligence  10
[58:59] years  ago 
 it  was  kind  of  like  you  know  like  who 
 who  the  [ __ ]  was  talking  about  this  I'm
[59:04] sure  like  though  that  space  knew  that  it 
 was  still  going  to  be  massive  but  it's 
 like  normal  people  we  weren't  thinking
[59:09] about  AI  10  years  ago  when  you  were  like 
 12  years  old  or  however  old  you  are 
 minus  10  years  we  weren't  thinking  about
[59:15] it  right  so  there  was  a  guy  studying  it 
 not  even  thinking  that  he  had  ever 
 become  rich  from  it
[59:20] and  then  the  market  moved  over  and 
 overlapped  his  interest  his  flow  States
[59:25] then  he  became  a  millionaire  because  or 
 billionaire  because  he's  made  some  like 
 AI  product  now
[59:32] but  I  think  that's  the  better  way  to  go 
 about  it  and  then  a  fantastic  question 
 you  could  ask  is  okay  but  what  if  the
[59:38] market  never  really  overlaps  my  flow 
 State  task 
 if  that  happens  honestly  this  sounds
[59:43] kind  of  lame  but  I'll  just  tell  you  use 
 the  same  mindset  from  the  step  one  which 
 is  like  yep  I  don't  even  care  about
[59:48] money  I'm  doing  the  thing  which  really  I 
 enjoy  you  know  here  I  am  the  fisherman 
 like  I'm  having  an  awesome  life  because
[59:53] of  that  as  long  as  you're  never  hungry 
 as  long  as  you're  meeting  the  Baseline 
 you  know  you're  making  a  few  k  a  month 
 which  you  absolutely  will  if  you  go  all
[59:59] in  on  one  skill  for  decades  you're  gonna 
 get  to  the  point  where  you're  making  at
[60:04] least  five  to  10K  a  month  even  way  way 
 more  than  that  imagine  that  it  doesn't 
 even  matter  if  it's  not  even  like  a
[60:09] great  like  fancy  skill  to  get  into  but 
 if  you  literally  did  it  for  decades  good
[60:15] get  to  the  point  where  naturally  you'll 
 see  the  opportunities  inside  of  that 
 business  model  and  everything  it'd  be
[60:20] absolutely  fine 
 and  if  the  market  does  overlap  then  okay 
 sweet  then  you  know  rinse  it  out  enjoy
[60:26] the  extra  money  but  it's  like  with  this 
 powerful  mindset  like  you  don't  even 
 care  so  the  market  overlapped  my  flow
[60:32] State  task 
 I  became  quite  successful 
 here  I  am  in  the  same  house  because  the
[60:39] success  and  the  money  doesn't  actually 
 Define  me 
 it  doesn't  change  me  if  it  changes  you
[60:44] then  it  shows  that  you're  quite  like  a 
 weak  person  so  you  can  either  follow 
 what's  hot  and  trending  right  now
[60:50] or  you  can  just  stay  on  your  Flow  State 
 task  the  gift  that  you  have  to  humanity
[60:56] and  just  keep  giving  that  at  a  greater 
 level  the  impact  that  I'm  hoping  for 
 with  this  video  is  that  more  young  men
[61:02] actually  are  taking  up  a  intelligent 
 path  to  wealth  a  more  secure  and  actual
[61:08] actually  strong  path  again  even  though 
 they  like  there's  male  influencers  who
[61:14] seem  strong  their  advice  is  actually 
 awfully  weak  and  I  want  to  raise  the
[61:19] strength  of  men  I  want  men  to  be  more 
 masculine  that  comes  from  you  following 
 your  purpose  your  flow  stick  task  is
[61:24] likely  your  purpose 
 so  my  advice  isn't  as  cool  it's  not
[61:30] gonna  probably  not  gonna  get  you  like  as 
 much 
 like  Club  [ __ ]  like  you  know  random
[61:36] girls  messaging  you  and  stuff  it's 
 probably  not  going  to  get  you  that 
 you're  not  going  to  get  as  many  likes  on 
 Instagram  and  stuff  but
[61:43] it  will  get  you 
 enlightenment
[61:48] it  will  get  you  love  it  will  get  you 
 faith 
 instead  of  like  the  random  girls  like
[61:54] you  know  sending  you  messages  you'll  get 
 more  of 
 the  higher  quality  spiritual  open  loving
[62:01] women  who  trust  you 
 and  you'll  have  better  sex  with  them  as 
 well  by  the  way
[62:07] then  like  the  little  degenerates  I  just 
 want  more  young  men  to  be  like  happy  and 
 productive  and  to  have  like  something  to
[62:13] work  hard  for  and  it  really  saddens  me 
 to  see  so  many  young  men  just  jumping 
 around  business  models  just  chasing  the
[62:19] money  in  such  a  weak  mindset  and  you 
 know  feeling  so  bad  about  themselves 
 when  there's  such  a  stronger  way  to  go
[62:24] about  this  pursuit  of  wealth
[62:30] if  you'd  like  to  help  that  mission 
 just  do  something  very  quick  if  you  just
[62:35] scroll  down  right  now  and  click  on  the 
 like  button  or  maybe  you  can  write  a 
 comment  the  YouTube  algorithm  will  like
[62:41] share  this  video  around  more  young  guys 
 can  see  it  so  here's  your  actionable 
 step  for  this  part  of  the  guide  we  want
[62:46] you  to  figure  out  your  Flow  State  task 
 I'll  have  a  card  come  up  on  screen  where 
 you  can  go  on  my  channel  and  it's  the
[62:51] Flow  State  Focus  full  guide  it's  really 
 worth  watching  figure  out  what  your  Flow
[62:56] State  task  is  it's  really  worth  your 
 time  to  know  what  work  what  task  what 
 like  hour  of  your  day  do  you  have  zero
[63:02] thoughts  which  just  puts  you  into  this 
 beautifully  present  mode  as  I  am  here
[63:07] with  zero  thoughts  in  my  mind  you  know 
 why  this  actionable  step  is  worth  doing 
 because  when  you  figure  out  your  Flow
[63:12] State  task  you  finally  know  what  to  go 
 all  in  on  no  more  jumping  around
[63:17] business  model  to  business  model  you've 
 got  something  which  doesn't  change  and 
 you  can  literally  just  stick  to  it  now
[63:22] okay  this  is  the  thing  I'm  gonna  like 
 use  to  make  money  step  three  who  you're
[63:27] going  to  sell  to  what's  the  purpose  of  a 
 car 
 just  answer  that  question  in  your  mind
[63:33] what's  the  purpose  of  a  car 
 to  get  to  a  destination  right
[63:39] imagine  if  there  was  an  unintelligent 
 person  who  answered  that  question  and 
 said  like  oh  well  to  go  to  the  gas
[63:45] station  to  buy  gas 
 the  purpose  of  a  car  is  to  buy  gas
[63:50] yeah 
 no  it's  nice  to  get  to  the  destination 
 right
[63:56] but  then  why  are  you  that  unintelligent 
 guy  when  it  comes  to  business  because  a
[64:01] business  and  a  car  are  actually  quite 
 similar 
 their  purpose  is  to  get  to  some  kind  of
[64:07] destination  to  achieve  something  and 
 they  use  fuel  to  get  there  the  fuel  for
[64:13] a  business  is  money  the  purpose  of  a 
 business  is  not  to  make  money  the  money 
 is  the  fuel  to  get  to  some  kind  of
[64:20] destination  or  impact  but  so  many  young 
 men  have  the  wrong  mindset  when  it  comes 
 to  business  and  they've  believed  that
[64:25] you  get  into  business  to  make  money 
 but  if  that's  your  mindset  you  stay
[64:30] broke 
 because  you're  needy 
 how  do  you  attract  a  girl
[64:37] do  you  act  needy  desperate  do  you  focus 
 on  her  or  do  you  focus  on  your  own
[64:43] destination  where  you  want  your  life  to 
 go  and  the  woman  is  such  a  beautiful
[64:48] addition  but  not  the  entire  part  of  your 
 life 
 being  needy  repels  the  girl  being  needy
[64:55] repels  the  money  think  of  business  as 
 money  is  the  same  topic  your  business  is
[65:00] to  achieve  some  kind  of  mission  some 
 cause  to  help  some  kind  of  people  and
[65:05] you  use  money  to  do  that  so  who  do  you 
 want  to  help 
 because  we've  got  to  the  point  now  where
[65:10] you  kind  of  are  understanding  your  Flow 
 State  task  what  you  might  do  for  money 
 who  do  you  want  to  use  that  flow  State
[65:16] task  that  gift  for  who  do  you  want  to 
 work  hard  for  not  just  who  will  give  you
[65:21] money  imagine  if  you  were  a  billionaire 
 imagine  if  you  had  tens  of  billions  and 
 unlimited  credit  card
[65:27] who  would  you  want  to  help 
 who  are  your  people
[65:32] for  me  it's  young  men  who  are  struggling 
 young  men  who  remind  me  of  my  younger 
 self  who  were  so  clueless  and  who  didn't
[65:38] really  have  like  a  single  good  Mentor 
 out  there  I  had  my  brother  but  then  life 
 kind  of  splits  us  apart  my  father  was
[65:45] overworking  80  hours  a  week  the 
 education  system  let  me  down  the  the  fat 
 obese  obese  female  teachers  who
[65:52] throttled  the  masculinity  inside  of  me 
 who  made  me  sit  straight  with  my  legs 
 cross  squishing  my  balls  that  pissed  me
[65:59] off 
 and  so  finally  when  I  was  21  years  old 
 22  years  old  and  I  was  trying  to  make 
 something  of  myself  it  was  so  difficult
[66:05] to  sit  down  and  work  because  all  of  my 
 life  these  beliefs  had  been  implanted 
 into  my  mind  that  I  couldn't  like  sit
[66:11] down  and  do  work  by  myself  because  I 
 needed  a  teacher  an  authority  figure  to 
 tell  me  what  to  do  first  I  need  a  daddy
[66:18] to  come  and  give  me  homework  that  I 
 didn't  feel  like  a  man  let  alone  even 
 understanding  what  being  a  man  was  and
[66:24] so  what  did  I  do 
 I  made  progress  on  myself
[66:30] I  dedicated  myself  to  the  kind  of  vision 
 mission  and  goals  for  myself
[66:36] and  then  when  I  looked  around  and  I  saw 
 so  many  men  struggling  with  the  exact 
 same  thing  and  I  knew  that  I  had  like
[66:41] the  answers  in  my  mind  the  system  the 
 framework  to  help  other  guys
[66:47] and  my  flow  State  task  for  me  like  you 
 know  the  the  thing  the  work  task  that
[66:52] doesn't  really  feel  like  work  is 
 speaking 
 it  became  obvious  I  want  to  help  you  I
[66:57] want  to  help  young  men  who  are 
 struggling  in  in  this  modern  world  young 
 men  who  don't  know  their  place  young  men
[67:03] who  haven't  developed  the  skills  the 
 mindset  the  beliefs  the  values  that  they 
 need  to  achieve  some  kind  of  good  life  I
[67:09] want  to  develop  more  men  honestly  for  my 
 own  selfish  reason  I  just  want  more  men 
 who  are  like  me  so  that  I  can  have  more
[67:16] friends  because  it's  a  lonely  Journey 
 when  you  start  to  embark  on  this  path  I 
 want  to  go  into  the  gym  and  see  more
[67:21] guys  in  there 
 I  want  to  walk  past  the  guy  and  know 
 that  he's  been  meditating  for  the  last
[67:27] two  years  that's  why  I  do  what  I  do  so 
 relentlessly  and  so  you  can  think  about 
 this  who  would  be  your  people  what  would
[67:35] be  your  cause  your  mission  your 
 movements  this  is  the  beauty  of  a
[67:40] business  and  I  really  want  to  give  you 
 this  mindset  because  it  will  really  help 
 you  this  belief  that  we  can  put  into 
 your  mind  the  point  of  a  business  is  for
[67:47] you  to  create  some  kind  of  impact  in  the 
 world  so  what  impact  do  you  want  to 
 create  you  use  money  to  help  create  that
[67:53] impact  so  for  example  the  money  that  my 
 business  makes  I'm  able  to  hire  teachers 
 and  experts  to  teach  inside  of  my  online
[67:59] school  so  you  can  see  that  my  movements 
 my  impact  is  to  try  and  help  young  men 
 to  educate  them  and  the  money  that  I
[68:05] make  for  my  business  I  reinvest  it  for 
 the  mission  and  of  course  it  gets  the
[68:10] point  when  you're  profiting  so  much  and 
 you  can't  even  like  spend  more  money  in 
 the  business  and  so  you  get  to  like 
 upgrade  your  lifestyle  and  you  make  more
[68:16] money  personally  but  as  we  discussed 
 like  you  making  more  money  is  it's  Not 
 Gonna  Change  Your  Life  as  much  as  you
[68:21] think  but  you  creating  a  positive  impact 
 for  the  people  you  genuinely  care  about 
 will  so  this  is  the  point  that  so  many
[68:27] people  struggle  and  they  literally  waste 
 like  six  to  12  months  of  their  lives 
 because  when  they  chase  the  money  when
[68:33] someone's  mindset  is  just  thinking  okay 
 business  I  want  to  make  money  fast  they 
 go  wherever  they've  just  heard  about 
 monies  okay  so  this  one  this  one  this
[68:39] business  model  this  this  customer  and 
 you've  probably  heard  of  these  business 
 models  that  I'm  talking  about  where
[68:44] you've  seen  the  advice  on  YouTube  where 
 it's  like  oh  yeah  how  to  like  start  an 
 agency  to  to  market  for  chiropractors  or
[68:51] something 
 my  advice  is  to  not  go  down  the  route 
 where  you're  just  trying  to  chase  money
[68:57] and  you're  trying  to  like  get  into  this 
 profitable  Market 
 because  if  you  don't  care  about  them  if
[69:03] you  don't  care  about  helping  Cairo 
 practice  scale 
 why  would  you  want  to  spend  your  life
[69:08] doing  that  just  to  make  money 
 what  if  you  did  it  the  other  way  around 
 what  if  you  still  made  a  lot  of  money
[69:14] but  your  business  was  about  helping  the 
 people  that  you  cared  about  the  kind  of
[69:19] people  that  you  cared  about  the 
 movements  maybe  it's  not  even  people 
 maybe  it's  animals  maybe  it's  the 
 environment  maybe  it's  it's  wanting  to
[69:25] get  into  space  travel  maybe  it's  wanting 
 to  help  video  Gamers  quit  playing  games 
 maybe  it's  wanting  to  help  guys  who  keep
[69:31] watching  porn  and  they  hate  themselves 
 for  it  maybe  it's  guys  who've  got  bad
[69:36] mental  health  and  you've  experienced 
 that  so  that's  your  big  movement  is  like 
 I  want  to  help  guys  who  are  suffering 
 from  depression  and  anxiety  I  want  to
[69:42] help  men  who  are  overworked  I  want  to 
 you  know  it  could  be  so  specific  I  want 
 to  help  men  who  have  literally  just  lost
[69:47] a  child 
 because  what  if  you  went  through  that 
 yourself  and  it  was  so  brutally  hard  and
[69:53] so  this  could  become  your  business 
 that's  what  you  work  hard  on
[69:58] naturally  when  you  work  hard  in  these 
 like  capitalistic  societies  people  will 
 end  up  paying  you  money  for  it  you  use
[70:04] that  money  to  further  your  cause 
 so  this  is  a  mini  actionable  step  for
[70:09] you 
 just  try  and  think  of  the  kind  of  people
[70:14] or  cause  or  Mission  that  would  actually 
 mean  a  lot  for  you 
 what  would  get  you  genuinely  out  of  bed
[70:21] in  the  morning  would  it  be  to  help 
 chiropractors  scale  to  six  figures 
 agency  marketing  for  these  people  would
[70:27] it  really  be  that 
 or  would  it  be  maybe  like  helping 
 your  younger  self
[70:33] a  guy  who  experienced  like  one  problem 
 that  you  had  business  is  all  about  just 
 helping  people  with  their  problems
[70:40] and  so  whose  problems  what  people  do  you 
 want  for  help  I  believe  that  this  is  the
[70:45] right  way  the  powerful  way  to  go  about 
 your  business  we're  actually  focused
[70:50] more  on  other  people  and  your  business 
 becomes  like  a  gift  to  the  world  any 
 money  that  you  make  when  you're  living
[70:56] so  purposefully 
 feels  like  a  brilliant  bonus
[71:01] but  it's  just  that  it's  it's  a  bonus  on 
 top  of  an  already  good  life
[71:07] and  again  what  does  that  sound  like 
 like  women
[71:12] don't  you  see  making  money  and 
 attracting  a  woman  is  very  very  similar 
 when  you're  needy  when  you  chase  the
[71:18] money  when  you  chase  the  girl  that 
 eludes  you  it  runs  away  from  you  it's 
 disgusted  by  you
[71:25] but  when  you're  not  needy  when  you  have 
 this  abundant  mindset  when  you're 
 focused  on  something  else  when  you're
[71:30] focused  on  your  purpose  that's  when  it 
 naturally  comes  to  you  and  it's  like  you
[71:35] care  you  value  it  or  since  I  have 
 but  you're  fine  either  way  that's  such  a
[71:41] powerful  mindset 
 and  how  are  you  fine  either  way 
 because  the  actions  and  the  life  that
[71:48] you've  set  up  the  business  that  you've 
 set  up 
 is  there  for  the  right  reason  it's  not
[71:53] just  for  the  money  your  life  isn't  set 
 up  just  for  the  woman
[71:58] it's  there  for  purpose  for  impact  for 
 community  and  contribution
[72:03] who  do  you  want  to  contribute  to 
 what  kind  of  people  would  you  like  to 
 help  what  kind  of  people  would  you  like
[72:09] to  have  around  you  your  people 
 and  then  don't  you  see  we're  going  to
[72:14] use  our  Flow  State  task  kind  of  like  a 
 gift  to  these  people  you  are  like  my
[72:19] people  you're  a  young  man  who  wants  to 
 improve  his  life  and  my  gift  to  you  is 
 my  skill  of  speaking
[72:25] if  this  makes  no  money  at  all 
 I'm  fine
[72:32] because  I  have  no  thoughts  in  my  brain 
 my  monkey  mind  is  quiet  and  there's 
 there's  impact  and  purpose  and
[72:38] contribution  to  humanity  that  makes  me 
 feel  awesome  24  7.  I  don't  need  the 
 extra  dopamine  or  validation  because  I'm
[72:44] helping  you 
 and  when  this  does  make  money
[72:49] well  then  it's  like  such  an  awesome 
 bonus 
 and  it  makes  more  money  than  you  realize
[72:54] probably  more  than  just  chasing  the 
 money  because  I've  got  the  Abundant 
 mindset  I  work  super  hard  because  it
[73:01] just  feels  like  fun  for  me  so  how  could 
 many  people  compete  with  me  when  I'm 
 doing  this  for  fun  for  as  many  hours  of
[73:07] the  day  as  possible  and  someone  else  is 
 doing  this  for  money
[73:12] when  he  makes  enough  money  he's  gonna 
 stop 
 I  don't  stop
[73:17] because  I'm  just  playing  a  game  I'm  just 
 literally  just  helping  my  Bros  out
[73:22] do  you  see  how  this  actually  makes  you  a 
 lethal  competitive  capable  entrepreneur 
 so  we  want  to  choose  your  markets  the
[73:28] kind  of  people  you  want  to  help  your 
 dream  Avatar  the  ideal  customer
[73:34] how  do  you  find  that  out 
 well  it's  just  through  asking  yourself 
 about  your  interests  and  and  what  you
[73:40] value  what  you  care  about  who  do  you 
 like 
 who  do  you  want  to  help  who  do  you
[73:45] understand  whose  problems  could  you 
 genuinely  help  with
[73:50] for  a  lot  of  us  watching  the  easiest 
 answer  and  perhaps  the  best  answer  is
[73:55] your  younger  self  just  like  if  you  think 
 back  six  months  or  12  months  or  maybe 
 even  years  and  you  think  about  a
[74:00] specific  problem  that  your  younger  self 
 was  going  through  maybe  you  just  decide 
 to  help  them  once  you  have  an  idea  of
[74:07] what  it  could  be  you  know  the  kind  of 
 person  you  want  to  help  but  you  don't 
 feel  too  certain  I'll  give  you  the  best 
 advice  I  could  give  so  I  hope  you  take
[74:12] this  seriously  just  choose  one  and 
 commit  to  it  what  kind  of  person  could
[74:17] you  help  the  first  thing  that  comes  to 
 your  mind  is  like  my  younger  selfie  was 
 addicted  to  video  games  boom  just  go 
 with  that  just  go  with  that  because
[74:23] naturally  over  the  next  few  months 
 you're  kind  of  fine-shun  and  correct 
 course  and  know  what  you  like  know  what
[74:28] you  don't  like  but  trying  to  overthink 
 this  right  now  and  thinking  of  the 
 perfect  market  and  everything  like  this
[74:33] like  this  overthinking  of  so  many  young 
 guys  get  into  you  make  no  progress  so 
 just  choose  one  right  now  and  let's  dive
[74:38] deep  into  it  there's  a  fantastic 
 question  that  comes  up  especially  when 
 we  start  to  think  about  our  younger
[74:43] selves  as  like  the  market  that  we  want 
 to  help  the  people  we  want  to  help  and 
 that  is  what  if
[74:49] my  ideal  person  or  or  customer  doesn't
[74:54] have  so  much  money 
 so  what  if  for  example  your  people  that 
 you  want  to  help  is  young  men  who  are
[75:00] addicted  to  video  games 
 but  of  course  you  know  we  want  to  make  a 
 business  we  do  want  to  make  money  but
[75:06] those  guys  don't  really  have  that  much 
 money  to  give  you  right  compared  to  like 
 what  you've  heard  on  online  on  YouTube
[75:11] where  if  you  make  like  an  agency  for 
 chiropractors  or  for  for 
 um  orthodontists  or  something  they've
[75:16] got  a  lot  of  money  so  you  know  it  might 
 be  better  to  go  with  them 
 here's  where  I  would  disagree
[75:21] because 
 let's  imagine  like  a  stereotypical  16 
 year  old  young  guy  he's  broke  right  he
[75:28] can't  afford  any  product  that  we  want  to 
 sell  him  right 
 is  that  so
[75:35] what  shoes  is  he  wearing 
 Nike  trainers  hundred  and  fifty  dollars
[75:42] how  much  new  shoes  these  days  a  lot  of 
 [ __ ]  even  16  year  old  broke 
 kids  they  don't  buy  pre-owned  shoes  from
[75:48] eBay  or  anything  right  they  go  into  the 
 store  and  buy  them  just  like  new  as  you 
 would  expect  right  from  Nike  or  JD  or
[75:54] Adidas  whatever  how  much  are  shoes  100 
 150  and  they're  spending  that  every
[75:59] couple  of  months  on  new  shoes 
 and  what  has  he  got  inside  of  his  ears
[76:04] airpods  how  much  are  airpods  200  dollars 
 his  shirt  35  40  dollars
[76:13] so  they've  got  money  right  so  don't 
 [ __ ]  yourself  because  I  used  to  do 
 this  and  I  this  is  something  I  see  all
[76:18] the  time  with  young  guys  who  are  getting 
 into  business  and  they'll  always  say 
 this  like  oh  but  you  know  my  I'm  really
[76:23] young  people  in  my  country  don't  make  as 
 much  money  this  is  this  I'm  strong 
 they've  got  airpods  they've  got  trainers
[76:29] what  do  you  want  about  that  they  don't 
 have  money  to  buy  your  services  yes  they 
 do  that's  a  limiting  belief  destroy  it 
 right  now
[76:34] think  to  yourself  with  this  like  like  a 
 bit  of  a  stronger  mindset  they're
[76:39] spending  money  on  stuff  why  not  your 
 stuff 
 if  this  is  the  kind  of  person  you  want
[76:44] to  help 
 and  you  want  to  go  all  in  on  this  market 
 like  your  people  and  you  want  to  help
[76:49] them  and  also  make  money 
 then  don't  be  scared  think  at  all  but 
 usually  you  know  most  young  people  don't
[76:54] have  as  much  money  yeah  it's  a  fact  that 
 young  people  have  less  money  than  all 
 people  okay  fine  that's  a  fact  but
[76:59] they've  got  more  than  enough  to  make  a 
 lot  of  money  for  you  if  you've  got  a 
 good  product  and  a  way  to  Market  which
[77:04] will  cover  in  this  guide 
 so  I  think  it's  way  better  to  choose  the 
 market  the  people  that  you  genuinely
[77:10] care  about  even  if  it  seems  like  they 
 don't  have  as  much  money  as  like  a 
 different  Market  which  you  would  only
[77:15] try  to  help  for  the  money  like  if  you 
 have  a  passion  to  help  Cairo  practice
[77:20] and  physiotherapists  and  dentists  scale 
 up  their  businesses  then  sure  do  that 
 but  if  you  like  if  you're  thinking  like
[77:26] why  the  who  what  the  [ __ ]  is  a 
 chiropractic  like  then  don't  pursue
[77:32] trying  to  help  people  that  you  don't 
 even  know  or  care  about 
 rather  just  go  with  the  kind  of  people
[77:37] that  you  want  to  help  now  look  at  Andrew 
 says  he's  made  a  lot  of  money  in  the
[77:42] last  few  years  right  but  like  if  you  do 
 the  math  probably  hundreds  of  Millions 
 whose  is  his  Market
[77:49] specifically  broke  young  men 
 he  appeals  to  the  broke  young  man  and
[77:56] yet  he's  made  Millions  from  them 
 because  they  still  have  enough  money  to 
 add  up  to  get  you  to  a  crazy  amount
[78:05] destroy  that  limiting  belief  and  this  is 
 going  to  get  interesting  this  is  where 
 you're  going  to  learn  a  marketing  term
[78:10] it's  called  customer  Avatar  the  dream 
 Avatar
[78:15] the  idea  is  that  we  want  to  construct 
 this  understanding  of  like  the  dream
[78:20] perfect  person  that  you're  trying  to 
 help  you  see  you  don't  want  to  keep  it
[78:25] in  Mind  of  a  group  of  people  that  you 
 want  to  help  you  don't  want  to  keep  in
[78:30] mind  lots  of  people  you're  rather  very 
 much  personalize  your  message  your
[78:35] marketing  or  your  product  everything  for 
 maybe  a  specific  person  so  this  is  a
[78:41] great  marketing  tactic  that  you  can  do 
 what  we  want  to  do  is  create  our  Dream 
 Avatar  so  this  is  your  actionable  step
[78:46] load  up  a  documents  on  your  computer 
 maybe  your  phone  or  a  piece  of  paper  and
[78:52] just  title  it  like  dream  Avatar  customer 
 Avatar  what  we  want  is  pure
[78:59] autistic  detail  about  the  kind  of  person 
 that  we  want  to  help  with  our  business
[79:04] I'm  talking  detail  like  we  want  to  know 
 the  first  few  thoughts  that  pop  into
[79:09] their  mind  the  moment  that  their  eyes 
 open  when  they  wake  up  we  want  to  know 
 not  just  what  they  say  out  loud  publicly
[79:17] that  they  want  but  what  they  really  want 
 what  they  might  not  talk  about  outside 
 of  like  their  own  mind  we  want  to  know
[79:23] their  fears  their  hopes  their  dreams 
 their  goals  we  want  to  know  what  content
[79:28] they're  consuming  what  websites  they're 
 on  we  want  to  know  the  bad  habits  and 
 the  good  habits  that  they  get  into  we
[79:33] want  to  have  like  a  document  which 
 outlines  one  specific  like  imaginary 
 person  maybe  it's  not  even  imaginary
[79:39] maybe  it's  you  maybe  it's  your  younger 
 self  maybe  it's  someone  that  you  know 
 give  it  a  name  maybe  even  a  picture
[79:44] construct  like  a  character  and  the  idea 
 is  once  we  have  this  document  this 
 understanding  that  this  is  who  we're
[79:50] trying  to  sell  to 
 we  constantly  just  think  about  this  one 
 person  this  imaginary  character  that
[79:56] we've  made  up  anything  that  we  do  from 
 now  on  we're  gonna  do  to  help  this  one
[80:01] person  because  can  you  see  how  powerful 
 this  is  here  we  are  we're  going  to 
 obsess  over  this  one  person  and  there's
[80:07] millions  of  people  like  that 
 but  every  time  we  speak  now  let's  say
[80:13] when  I  speak  to  you  on  camera 
 does  it  feel  like  I'm  speaking  to 
 millions  of  people  right  now  you  know
[80:20] through  this  video  has  it  felt  like  I'm 
 speaking  to  two  million  guys  has  it  been 
 like  have  I  started  the  video  saying  Hey
[80:26] guys  and  so  I  wanted  to  help  you  all 
 with  this  imagine  how  much  less  you 
 might  like  me  and  invest  in  the  videos
[80:32] that  I  make  if  I  spoke  in  that  way  where 
 I  was  recording  this  right  now  for  my
[80:37] audience  instead  of  you 
 truthfully  I  record  these  videos  not
[80:44] really  even  for  you  or  for  my  audience 
 before  younger  Hamza  younger  Hamza  is
[80:50] like  a  character  that  I've  created  in  my 
 mind  that's  my  like  dream  customer 
 Avatar  and  I've  even  got  documents  on  my
[80:56] PC  which  are  like  very  detailed  where 
 I've  literally  spoke  about  like  his  real 
 desires  that  he  wouldn't  have  said  out
[81:01] loud  and  some  of  them  I've  wrote  is  like 
 he'll  act  like  a  normal  person  but  he's 
 really  obsessed  with  wanting  to  [ __ ]  as
[81:07] many  girls  as  possible  it's  like  a  real 
 Primal  desire  inside  of  him  he  won't 
 talk  about  it  much  but  like  it's  the
[81:12] truth  so  if  you  can  appeal  to  that  he's 
 more  likely  to  follow  you
[81:17] he  wants  the  bill  of  muscle 
 specifically  so  that  he  can  get  more 
 likes  on  Tinder  now  this  was  like  the
[81:23] sort  of  Avatar  I  was  attracting  you  know 
 last  year  on  YouTube  right  and  I
[81:28] followed  that  to  a  t  in  my  channel  blew 
 up  because  younger  Hamza  is  not  so
[81:33] unique  there's  millions  of  him  around 
 the  world 
 but  when  you  focus  specifically  on  like
[81:40] one  person  that  you're  imagining  like 
 right  now  I  always  speak  on  camera  as  if 
 I'm  speaking  to  my  younger  self
[81:46] it  makes  each  person  in  the  audience  or 
 each  customer  feel  like  more  committed
[81:52] to  your  message  to  your  business 
 you  get  a  greater  understanding  of  who
[81:59] you're  trying  to  help  and  what  product 
 to  make  and  the  way  to  speak  and  the  way 
 to  Market  and  sell 
 so  this  is  very  powerful  this  might  take
[82:05] you  about  half  an  hour  to  an  hour  either 
 do  it  right  now  pause  the  video  or  do  it
[82:10] like  as  soon  as  you've  got  like  a  deep 
 work  block  like  some  high  level  thinking 
 maybe  you  wake  up  tomorrow  morning  and 
 you  do  this  you  create  your  dream  Avatar
[82:16] documents  and  what  I'll  do  for  you  for 
 free  I  wasn't  planning  to  do  this  I'll 
 make  a  template  for  like  the  customer
[82:22] Avatar  and  I'll  just  link  it  in  the 
 description  there's  no  email  sign  up 
 nothing  to  buy  or  anything  it's 
 literally  just  like  a  notion  documents
[82:27] I'll  make  it  right  now  and  then  I'll 
 link  it  there  so  you  can  just  use  that 
 as  like  a  template  so  all  the  questions
[82:32] are  there  just  to  make  it  easier  for  you 
 I'm  a  nice  guy  man  if  you're  going  to 
 use  the  template  please  help  me  please
[82:37] share  the  video  man  come  on  at  least 
 like  give  me  some  value  back  bro  share 
 this  video  click  on  the  like  button
[82:43] um  comments  and  rate  and  subscribe 
 whatever  they  [ __ ]  YouTubers  say  I 
 don't  know  if  that  stuff  makes  a 
 difference  man  but  if  you  can  share  this
[82:48] video  if  you  can  ever  mention  it  to 
 someone  else  if  you've  got  some  friends 
 who  are  interested  in  this  topic  if  you
[82:53] end  up  getting  into  a  conversation 
 somewhere  in  real  life  or  on  the 
 Internet  a  month  from  now  if  you  ever
[82:58] just  say  out  loud  or  write  it  down  in  in 
 the  comments  on  the  Internet  or  you
[83:03] should  go  watch  how  money  full  guide 
 that  would  mean  a  lot  to  me  as  many
[83:08] comments  like  that  that  you  could  leave 
 around  the  internet  oh  yeah  hamza's  full 
 guide  hamza's  money  guide 
 spreading  Word  of  Mouth  for  this  work  is
[83:15] very  very  powerful  and  it  would  mean  a 
 lot  to  me  if  like  these  guides  ended  up
[83:20] helping  more  people  and  of  course  that 
 would  also  grow  my  business  so  it's  a 
 win-win  for  everyone  really  if  you
[83:26] wanted  to  do  that  please  do  that  once 
 you've  got  that  document  and  you've 
 started  to  think  okay  this  is  you  know 
 it  makes  sense  this  is  about  who  I'm
[83:32] trying  to  attract  and  you  might  not  feel 
 perfect  on  it  of  course  like  as  the 
 months  go  by  your  correct  course  you'll
[83:37] change  a  few  things  in  there  that's 
 absolutely  fine  what  you  want  to  do  now 
 to  stand  out  from  your  potential
[83:43] competition 
 to  be  able  to  sell  the  product  which 
 we're  about  to  make  in  the  rest  of  this 
 guide
[83:48] you  want  to  know  this  type  of  person  as
[83:53] well  as  possible 
 to  really  make  a  lot  of  money  in  the 
 future
[83:58] I  want  you  right  now  to  go  above  and 
 beyond  to  get  to  know  this  this  Avatar
[84:03] this  person  so  there  might  be  some 
 people  that  you  know  who  are  already 
 like  that
[84:08] speak  to  them 
 ask  them  questions
[84:14] ask  them  what  are  your  goals  what's  you 
 know  what  are  you  doing  what  which  video 
 are  you  more  likely  to  click  on  get
[84:19] constant  feedback  if  you  wear  your  own 
 avatar  for  example  mine's  my  younger
[84:24] self  I've  done  something  which  I  call 
 Avatar  journaling  which  is  where  I'll 
 kind  of  put  myself  into  the  state  of
[84:30] feeling  like  I  am  my  younger  self  the 
 person  I'm  trying  to  attract  for  these 
 videos  for  my  business  and  I'll  write  as
[84:35] if  I  am  him  and  the  thoughts  that  I  can 
 kind  of  imagine  he  was  getting  and  the 
 desires  and  the  problems  and  the  fears
[84:40] and  the  hopes  and  dreams  and  everything 
 and  I'll  write  as  if  I'm  him  just  to 
 gain  a  better  understanding  of  what  he's
[84:46] going  through  what  kind  of  videos  he 
 might  end  up  watching  what  product  he 
 might  end  up  buying  you  can  think  about
[84:51] that  level  of  extra  detail  and 
 understanding  that  I  was  getting  to  be 
 able  to  attract
[84:56] someone  like  you  and  then  I  went  even 
 further  I  started  to  do  a  one-to-one
[85:01] video  call  every  single  morning  for 
 months  months  and  months  and  months
[85:08] just  to  kind  of  understand  the  kind  of 
 people  that  I  was  trying  to  help  to
[85:13] further  just  create  the  kind  of  like 
 mind  that  I  needed  to  be  able  to  help 
 someone  like  you
[85:18] so  I  just  started  to  hop  on  calls  with 
 people  all  the  time  there  was  a  point 
 when  I  literally  was  doing  hours  of  free
[85:25] calls  a  day  just  for  a  few  weeks  just  to 
 really  like  sort  of  put  my  trajectory  of
[85:30] understanding  this  avatar  on  The  Fast 
 Track  and  it  was  super  super  powerful  to 
 do  that  by  doing  this  actionable  step
[85:35] now  which  you  could  probably  Breeze 
 through  in  about  15  minutes  you  will 
 significantly  improve  how  much  money
[85:41] you're  about  to  make  because  you'll  just 
 be  better  at  marketing  and  knowing  who 
 you're  speaking  to  but  of  course  doing
[85:47] this  actionable  step  knowing  who  you're 
 speaking  to  is  almost  pointless  if  you
[85:52] don't  have  a  product  to  sell  them  so 
 let's  get  to  that  step  four  creating 
 your  product  in  this  part  of  this  guide
[85:58] you're  going  to  know  exactly  what  you're 
 going  to  sell  you're  going  to  create  a 
 product  that's  genuinely  literally
[86:05] 10  times  better  than  your  competitors 
 I'm  not  exaggerating  when  I  say  that  you 
 are  going  to  create  a  product  that  is  10
[86:11] times  better  than  what  your  competitors 
 are  selling  and  for  a  nice  wholesome 
 benefit  of  this  guide  this  is  going  to
[86:17] give  you  something  interesting  and  fun 
 to  work  hard  for  often  when  I  ask  young
[86:24] guys  inside  of  my  own  like  Pro  I  have 
 like  a  private  online  school  and  when  I
[86:29] ask  them  this  question  I  always  see  like 
 the  chat  flood  up  I  always  ask 
 who  here  is  willing  to  work  super  hard
[86:36] to  make  a  lot  of  money  type  one  in  the 
 chat  right  now  and  it  floods  with  ones
[86:42] so  it  tells  me  and  you'll  probably 
 relate  to  what  I'm  about  to  say  that 
 young  men  are  willing  to  work  really
[86:48] hard  to  improve  their  lives  and  to  make 
 money  to  create  success  the  problem  is
[86:53] just  that  you're  not  really  sure  on  what 
 to  actually  work  hard  for  and  so  this
[86:59] part  of  the  guide  is  going  to  walk  you 
 through  literally  step  by  step  exactly 
 what  to  do  to  make  your  product  and  your
[87:04] product  is  going  to  be  a  lot  better  than 
 you've  ever  imagined  I  wouldn't  usually 
 hype  up  like  a  section  of  the  guide  that
[87:10] I'm  making  like  this  but  I'm  really 
 being  honest  this  part  of  the  guide 
 really  deserves  your  full  attention  and
[87:16] it's  really  worth  just  like  being  super 
 focused  black  coffee  Focus  full  screen
[87:21] pay  attention  this  is  some  super  high 
 leverage  work  that  we're  about  to  do 
 together  now  so  we  have  an  understanding
[87:27] of  our  Dream  Avatar  the  kind  of  person 
 that  we  want  to  help  if  you  don't  know
[87:32] what  that  is  just  re-watch  like  the 
 previous  section  because  we've  just 
 covered  it  there  then  the  actionable 
 step  was  to  make  the  documents  make  sure
[87:38] you've  done  that  before  you  get  here  we 
 know  who  our  Dream  Avatar  is  now  there's 
 one  question  that  we  want  to  keep  in
[87:43] mind  what  is  their  dream  outcome  what  is 
 the  result  that  they  really  really  want
[87:48] so  for  example  for  me  for  my  business 
 the  dream  Avatar  is  like  my  younger  self 
 younger  Hamza  and  his  dream  outcome  his
[87:56] results  let  me  know  if  this  is  similar 
 to  like  you  personally 
 is
[88:01] to  make  progress  in  life  so  he  doesn't 
 feel  like  much  of  a  loser  anymore  so
[88:06] that  he  gets  to  the  point  where  he 
 actually  likes  himself  and  he  gets  some 
 like  pretty  good  materialistic  success
[88:11] along  the  way  he's  increases  his  ability 
 to  attract  girls  he  makes  some  money  he
[88:16] makes  some  good  friends  he's  got  some 
 status  and  some  respect  from  others  and 
 he  also  feels  mentally  happy  and  healthy
[88:22] with  himself  would  you  say  that  that 
 like  defines  you  chances  are  if  you've 
 got  this  far  of  this  guide  you're  very
[88:27] similar  to  younger  Hamza  my  ideal  dream 
 customer  we  know  that  dream  result  the
[88:32] thing  that  they  really  really  want 
 now  what  we  need  to  do 
 is  to  figure  out
[88:38] every  single  problem  on  the  way  to  that 
 dream  result  so  to  make  this  easy  let's
[88:44] say  I  was  going  to  make  a  Fitness 
 business  a  business  on  how  to  lose  some
[88:51] fat  and  increase  your  muscles  so  that 
 you  look  good  so  imagine  I  was  appealing 
 to  like  18  year  old  guys  who  wanted  to
[88:56] get  into  the  gym  and  build  like  a 
 physique  that  looks  good  so  that  they 
 could  probably  get  likes  on  Instagram  or 
 something  I  imagine  that  was  my  business
[89:01] right  their  dream  result  what  do  you 
 think  it  would  be  to  build  a  nice 
 physique
[89:07] grow  their  Instagram  following  hopefully 
 get  girls  to  message  them  something  like 
 that  right  what  are  the  problems  on  the
[89:14] way  there  well  Okay  so  we've  got  to 
 build  the  physique 
 building  the  physique  inside  of  that
[89:19] there's  probably  going  to  be 
 how  many  problems 
 hundreds
[89:27] they've  got  to  eat  clean  but  to  eat 
 clean  they've  got  to  go  out  and 
 shop  for  groceries  but  they  need  to  know
[89:33] what  things  to  buy  which  are  healthy 
 they  need  to  cook  the  food  they  need  to
[89:38] learn  how  to  cook  but  they  don't  enjoy 
 cooking  think  about  all  the  micro 
 problems  that  would  go  into  just
[89:43] building  the  physique  they've  got  a 
 train  in  the  gym  but  sometimes  they're 
 too  sore  and  they  don't  wake  up  in  time
[89:48] and  there's  not  enough  time  because  they 
 also  go  to  school  the  gym  is  too  far 
 away  sometimes  the  Gym's  packed  because
[89:53] they  have  to  go  at  peak  times  can  you 
 think  do  you  see  all  of  these  little 
 problems 
 you  know  what's  very  interesting  about
[89:58] these  problems 
 one  of  these  problems  will  be  the  reason
[90:04] why  your  dream  customer  doesn't  buy  your 
 product  so  we're  going  to  make  your
[90:09] products  soon  but  this  is  something  that 
 we  need  to  cover  first  one  of  these 
 problems  will  be  the  reason  why  you
[90:15] don't  get  a  sale 
 just  one  of  them  so  imagine  if  we  were 
 going  to  sell  this  Fitness  product  like
[90:20] a  fitness  course  or  a  workout  routine  or 
 something  and  imagine  we  didn't  address
[90:25] one  of  these  problems  in  like  our  sales 
 page  our  pitch  and  there's  our  Dream
[90:30] customer  he's  like  reading  the  sales 
 website  but  he  keeps  thinking  to  himself 
 no  about  the  Gym's  too  far  away  now  but
[90:35] I  can't  you  know  I  can't  go  to  the  gym 
 because  it's  too  far  away  it's  too  far 
 away  ah  whatever  and  he  leaves  it  and 
 imagine  that  all  we  needed  to  do  was
[90:41] address  that  one  problem  that  was  inside 
 of  his  mind  and  he  would  have  actually 
 bought  our  product
[90:49] powerful  right  so  what  we  need  to  do  is 
 like  a  mini  actionable  step  it's  to 
 create  an  absolutely  massive  problem
[90:58] list  you  start  with  the  dream  results 
 that  they  want  then  you  think  of  each 
 micro  problem  that  they  would  go  through
[91:04] on  the  way  to  getting  that  result  what 
 is  like  the  hard  part  the  issues  the
[91:09] obstacles  on  the  way  to  the  thing  that 
 they  want 
 and  not  just  a  few  things  you  know  like
[91:15] oh  yeah  like  they  have  to  go  to  the  gym 
 they  have  to  eat  clean  just  inside  of 
 eating  clean  there's  probably  like  20
[91:22] problems  right  because  they've  got  to 
 know  what  clean  eating  even  is  then 
 they've  got  to  go  out  and  buy  the
[91:27] groceries  but  they  can't  afford  the 
 fancy  groceries  and  then  you  know  they 
 can't  like  they're  spending  time  to  go
[91:32] and  buy  the  groceries  but  their  parents 
 buy  the  groceries  and  then  they  have  to 
 cook  but  they  don't  like  cooking  but
[91:37] their  parents  always  cook  for  them  they 
 can't  afford  that  like  you  can  see 
 there's  so  many  many  problems  inside  of
[91:43] just  the  one  main  problem  of  clean 
 eating 
 you  could  probably  get  a  list  of  about  a
[91:48] hundred  right  now  right  200. 
 now  your  brain  is  probably  starting  to 
 tick  and  you're  probably  getting  some
[91:53] but  it  almost  feels  a  little  bit  hard 
 now  doesn't  it  it  you're  beginning  to
[91:58] realize  like  now  we're  gonna  have  to  put 
 in  some  [ __ ]  work  are  you  ready 
 so  what  I'll  do  again  I'll  make  a
[92:05] document  a  notion  template  that  you  can 
 have  for  free  no  email  signups  no 
 nothing  like  that  you  don't  have  to  give 
 me  anything  but  I'll  make  that  a  layout
[92:10] for  you 
 and  I  want  you  to  go  in  and  make  an
[92:15] absolutely  massive  list  of  problems  that 
 your  dream  Avatar  would  experience  on
[92:21] the  way  to  his  dream  results 
 it  could  be  over  a  hundred  problems  we
[92:27] just  want  pure  quantity  volume  so  the 
 more  you  write  down  the  better  micro 
 problems
[92:32] he  wakes  up  too  late  the  Gym's  too  far 
 away  his  mum  needs  to  take  him  to  the 
 gym  but  sometimes  she  doesn't  want  to
[92:37] drive  that  far  sometimes  he  has  to  stay 
 in  school  too  late  so  he  can't  go  he 
 can't  eat  high  protein  because  his
[92:43] parents  think  that  it'll  be  bad  for  him 
 his  parents  won't  let  him  go  to  the  gym 
 because  they  think  that  it'll  stunt  his
[92:49] growth  imagine  that  level  of  autistic 
 detail  that  you  could  do  to  carry  a  list 
 of  100  200  300  problems  let  me  give  you
[92:55] some  ideas  that  I've  wrote  down  this  is 
 actually  an  example  from  the  Fitness 
 course  that  I  used  to  sell  over  a  year
[93:01] ago  this  is  the  level  of  detail  that  I 
 went  in  for  the  problems  this  is  just
[93:06] for  the  exercising  section  I  don't  have 
 a  gym  membership  the  gym  is  too  far  away 
 I'm  too  busy  with  work  I'm  not  motivated
[93:12] to  go  to  the  gym  when  I'm  in  the  gym  I 
 don't  know  what  to  do  it's  intimidating 
 being  in  the  gym  I  don't  know  how  to
[93:17] train  safely  I  feel  insecure  with  what  I 
 look  like  in  the  gym  working  out  hurts 
 too  much  I  get  too  sore  I  get  bored  in
[93:23] the  gym  and  I  just  want  to  go  home  I  get 
 tired  easily  I  find  it  hard  to  push 
 myself  I  lose  my  focus  I'm  not  making
[93:28] any  progress  in  the  gym  look  at  that 
 level  of  thinking 
 that  is  just  a  few  problems  for  one  area
[93:35] of  like  the  results  that  we're  trying  to 
 like  get  our  customers  to  so  it's  time 
 for  you  to  make  your  massive  list  of
[93:41] problems  and  I've  got  some  ideas  that 
 could  help  you  there's  three  areas  that 
 you  could  base  your  problem  list  around
[93:47] one  is  the  perceived  likelihood  of 
 achievements  their  belief  in  whether  or
[93:53] not  it  will  work  for  them  so  what  is 
 their  belief  about  the  the  results  that
[93:58] you're  trying  to  get  them  to  for  example 
 the  fitness  course  that  we're  going  to 
 sell  just  as  an  example  right  what
[94:04] belief  might  our  16  year  old  that  we're 
 trying  to  help  get  into  the  gym  and 
 build  a  good  body  have  you  might  believe
[94:10] that  he's  got  bad  genetics  he  might 
 believe  that  he's  not  even  going  to  be 
 able  to  make  any  progress  he  might
[94:15] believe  that  going  to  the  gym  is  going 
 to  be  bad  for  him  maybe  he  doesn't  trust 
 Fitness  YouTubers  that  I  don't  blame  him
[94:21] then  another  section  of  your  problems 
 list  can  also  be  about  time  like  how 
 long  it's  gonna  take  because  when  you
[94:26] think  about  how  much  like  people  want 
 fast  progress  these  days  they  all  want 
 instant  gratification  when  we  think
[94:32] about  trying  to  help  a  young  guy  get 
 into  the  gym  and  we  have  to  tell  him  the 
 truth  that  yeah  sure  you'll  make  some 
 progress  but  like  the  body  that  you  want
[94:38] from  those  pictures  that  you  see  on 
 Instagram  that's  going  to  take  a  few 
 years  of  dedication
[94:44] so  what  problems  is  he  going  to 
 experience  well  it's  gonna  take  too  long 
 I'm  not  seeing  any  results  yet  you  know
[94:49] I  step  on  the  scale  every  day  but  it's  I 
 don't  see  the  progress  It's  not  the 
 skills  not  going  down  I'm  not  gaining
[94:54] muscle  it's  going  to  take  too  long  to  to 
 get  up  to  the  bench  press  wait  or  to  get 
 the  pecks  and  then  another  theme  of  the
[94:59] problems  list  that  you're  writing  down 
 can  be  about  effort  and  sacrifice  the 
 hard  things  they  have  to  do  that  they
[95:05] don't  really  feel  like  doing  and  also 
 the  nice  things  that  they  like  which 
 they  might  have  to  stop  doing
[95:12] it's  going  to  be  too  hard  to  go  to  the 
 gym  it's  going  to  take  too  much  effort 
 it's  going  to  take  too  much  time  I  don't
[95:17] you  know  I  don't  have  the  schedule  for 
 it  it's  too  it  makes  me  too  sore  but 
 also  I'll  have  to  stop  eating  the  food
[95:24] that  I  like  I'll  have  to  like  replace 
 the  two  hours  that  I  usually  spend  on
[95:29] video  games  with  going  to  the  gym  every 
 day 
 so  you're  getting  some  ideas  now  just
[95:35] create  a  massive  list  of  problems  now 
 with  this  massive  list  of  problems
[95:40] whether  you've  made  it  already  or  it's 
 like  a  task  you're  gonna  do  like 
 tomorrow  morning  or  something  what  we're 
 going  to  do  now
[95:45] we're  going  to  create  a  massive  list  of 
 solutions  we're  going  to  look  at  each  of
[95:51] the  problems  that  we've  wrote  down  these 
 are  reasons  why  someone  wouldn't  buy 
 from  you  your  dream  customer  wouldn't
[95:56] buy  like  the  potential  product  that 
 you're  going  to  help  them  with  what 
 we're  going  to  do  is  write  down  like  a 
 pretty  much  equal  number  of  solutions  to
[96:03] each  problem  does  that  make  sense  so  we 
 know  who  we're  trying  to  sell  to  the 
 dream  Avatar  we  know  his  dream  results
[96:09] like  what  he  wants  out  of  life  we  know 
 the  problems  on  the  way  to  that  result 
 and  now  we're  going  to  think  okay  well
[96:14] how  do  we  give  him  a  solution  to  this 
 this  is  entrepreneurship
[96:19] write  this  down  entrepreneurship  is  just 
 Solutions  entrepreneurship  equals 
 Solutions
[96:24] so  we  want  to  solve  the  problems  that 
 our  Dream  customer  has  well  how  do  we  do
[96:29] that  we  look  at  every  single  point  in 
 that  problem  list  and  we  think  of  a  way
[96:35] that  we  can  just  like  ease  their  pain 
 and  get  them  to  overcome  it
[96:40] every  single  problem 
 this  is  going  to  set  you  apart  from  that
[96:45] lesser  version  of  yourself  this  is  going 
 to set  you  apart  from  the  competition  of 
 like  beginner  entrepreneurs  because
[96:50] everyone  else  this  is  how  pathetic  most 
 like  young  men  are  no  offense  to  them
[96:55] but  like  when  they  get  into  business 
 they  will  literally  try  to  solve  about 
 five  to  ten  percent  of  the  potential
[97:01] problems  their  customers  have  and  that's 
 it  and  then  complain  that  they  don't  get 
 sales  you're  gonna  aim  for  100
[97:08] every  problem  on  the  list  we  want  to 
 have  a  solution  for  so  this  is  exactly 
 how  you  create  the  solutions  list  you
[97:15] want  to  keep  the  flow  State  task  that 
 you  know  about  in  mind  so  remember  at 
 the  start  of  this  video  we  discussed
[97:21] flow  States  and  we  said  that  that  will 
 be  kind  of  like  your  gift  to  humanity  to 
 your  people  for  me  it's  speaking  you
[97:27] want  to  keep  that  in  mind  and  maybe  for 
 you  it's  learning  maybe  for  you  it's 
 writing  maybe  it's  speaking  whatever  it
[97:32] is  and  we  want  to  try  and  use  that  for 
 as  many  of  these  problems  as  possible  so 
 we  want  to  come  up  with  anything  that  we
[97:37] could  do  to  help  our  customers  with 
 these  problems  and  there's  a  few  formats 
 that  we  could  do  this  in  and  this  will
[97:43] help  help  you  because  right  now  it  feels 
 a  bit  vague  okay  what  do  you mean 
 Solutions  think  to  yourself  we  could 
 solve  these  problems  with  information
[97:49] with  education  with  maybe  some  kind  of 
 physical  product  with  maybe  a  service
[97:54] where  we  actually  do  something  for  them 
 with  maybe  some  kind  of  plan 
 accountability  the  best  way  to  solve  the
[98:00] problem  in  my  opinion  is  information 
 like  education  so  this  literally  means 
 to  make  this  like  super  clear  for  you
[98:06] that's  to  solve  the  problem  that  they've 
 got  about  like  oh  but  I  don't  enjoy 
 cooking  or  I  don't  know  like  what
[98:12] healthy  food  to  buy 
 to  solve  that  problem 
 we  could  record  a  video
[98:18] that  tells  them  the  best  healthy  foods 
 to  buy 
 and  a  problem  would  be  solved  we  could
[98:23] go  on  a  live  call  with  them  and  walk 
 them  through  which  healthy  foods  to  buy
[98:28] like  one  to  one  maybe  a  group  call  we 
 could  text  but  there's  different  formats 
 that  solve  the  same  problem  if  we  could
[98:33] make  a  video  and  like  the  video  is  just 
 there  so  we  can  always  send  it  to  every 
 new  customer  we  could  write  a  PDF  if  we
[98:39] prefer  writing  instead  of  of  speaking 
 and  recording  we  could  even  create  like
[98:44] templates  like  you  know  I've  mentioned 
 those  notion  templates  that  you  can 
 completely  have  for  free  and  everything 
 we  could  make  those  like  a  checklist  we
[98:50] could  make  documents  we  could  even  make 
 workout  routines  like  when  I  sold  a 
 course  on  Fitness  I  just  downloaded  like
[98:55] a  fitness  app  like  a  weightlifting  app 
 went  in  made  the  workout  routines  and 
 then  shared  it  inside  of  the  program
[99:01] which  meant  that  they  just  clicked  on  a 
 link  and  then  boom  the  workout  routine 
 just  opened  on  their  phone  once  they
[99:06] downloaded  the  app  imagine  like  that's 
 valuable  they  had  the  problem  of  like  oh 
 but  I  don't  know  which  workout  to  do  and
[99:11] instead  of  just  writing  it  down  and 
 telling  them  okay  do  this  exercise  for 
 this  many  reps  I  just  made  it  on  an  app
[99:16] and  they  just  got  got  it  on  their  phone 
 like  that  problem  solved  so  to  test  your 
 thinking  how  about  this  if  our  customers
[99:22] problem  was  but  I  don't  even  have  a  gym 
 membership  and  I  don't  know  how  to  sign
[99:27] up  to  a  gym  I've  never  done  it  before 
 and  it  kind  of  scares  me  how  could  we 
 solve  that  problem 
 think  about  it  what  are  the  ways  that  we
[99:33] could  solve  the  problem  of  like  some 
 anxious  kind  of  scared  guy  who  doesn't 
 really  leave  his  bedroom  too  much  and  he
[99:38] doesn't  even  know  how  to  sign  up  to  a 
 gym  and  he's  never  been  to  a  gym  before 
 how  could  we  solve  that  problem  think
[99:43] about  all  the  ways  we  could  record  a  gym 
 guide  we  could  even  write  down  like  a 
 gym  guide  or  PDF  we  could  hop  on  a  video
[99:49] call  with  him  and  get  him  to  share  his 
 screen  and  we'll  find  like  the  gym  that 
 he  should  go  to  he  shows  you  like  the
[99:54] website  there  maybe  he  tells  you  like 
 his  location  you  find  a  good  gym  for  him
[100:00] but  he  still  feels  anxious  what  are 
 other  things  we  could  do 
 you  could  literally  hop  on  a  video  call 
 on  our  phones  and  he  goes  to  the  gym  for
[100:07] the  first  time  and  where  they're  on  a 
 live  call  with  him  whilst  he  walks  into 
 the  gym  and  he  tries  the  machines  and
[100:12] you  tell  him  okay  just  show  me  right 
 yeah  go  on  that  machine  over  there  so 
 yeah  go  on  this  one  here  so  this  is 
 called  the  bench  press  so  what  you  want
[100:17] to  do  is  grab  that  Bob  okay  put  it  there 
 put  it  onto  the  second  a  little  bit 
 there  okay  so  grab  that  1.5  plate  boom
[100:24] problem  solved  to  a  very  powerful  level 
 now  the  more  time  and  effort  and
[100:29] intimate  Your  solution  the  more  you're 
 going  to  be  able  to  charge  for  it  so  for
[100:34] example  if  your  solution  is  just  going 
 to  be  one  to  many  like  I  record  a  video
[100:39] that's  just  kind  of  there  you  know  I 
 record  the  video  today  and  five  months 
 down  the  line  the  same  videos  being  sent
[100:44] out  which  tells  people  like  how  to  sign 
 up  to  the  gym  that's  kind  of  nice  that's 
 valuable  sweet  but  if  you're  willing  to
[100:49] put  in  the  extra  work  you  will  make  more 
 money  if  you  make  it  more  intensive  now 
 if  you've  got  the  time  and  effort  to  go
[100:55] above  and  beyond  and  work  harder  then 
 why  don't  you  why  don't  you  hop  on  the 
 call  with  them  the  live  call  to  pick  out
[101:01] the  gym  with  them  why  don't  you  offer 
 that  as  part  of  your  solution  list  my 
 advice  of  like  how  much  effort  and  how
[101:07] intensive  you  should  make  your  Solutions 
 is  that  if  you  are  a  younger  man  and
[101:12] you've  got  time  and  the  efforts  that 
 you're  willing  to  put  into  your  business 
 to  make  a  lot  of  money
[101:18] then  do  it 
 think  of  the  solutions  you  could  have 
 and  just  make  them  bigger  instead  of  it
[101:24] just  being  like  the  pre-recorded  video 
 where  you  show  them  like  whatever  you 
 know  how  to  overcome  the  problem  with
[101:29] education 
 go  on  the  live  call  with  them  because  if 
 you've  got  the  time  to  do  it  and  if
[101:34] right  now  you  know  making  money  is  like 
 your  priority  you  will  make  more  money 
 if  you  simply  just  work  harder  and  you
[101:40] put  more  of  your  time  into  your  business 
 you  make  more  active  income  if  you'd  be 
 willing  to  work  eight  hours  a  day  10
[101:46] hours  a  day  then  why  don't  you  for 
 example  just  go  on  the  the  10  minute 
 phone  call  with  your  potential  clients
[101:52] twice  a  day  to  help  them  imagine  how 
 much  more  like  expensive  you  could  make 
 your  product  when  you  said  two  calls  a
[101:59] day  10  minutes  each  time  now  you  won't 
 be  able  to  scale  this  up  Master  you  know 
 because  there'll  be  a  point  when  you're
[102:04] just  working  too  much  but  if  to  get  your 
 first  few  sales  so  that  you  make  some 
 money  from  your  business  I  think  that's
[102:10] a  really  good  idea  and  then  obviously  in 
 the  future  a  month  or  two  months  from 
 now  you  can  kind  of  scale  it  down 
 slightly  change  the  product  and  stuff
[102:16] and  think  you  know  too  much  of  my  time 
 is  going  so  I'm  not  going  to  do  those 
 calls  anymore  the  price  has  decreased  by 
 like  whatever  amounts  you  can  do  that
[102:22] Alex  amosi  has  this  saying  where  he  says 
 start  with  flow  so  start  by  having  like
[102:27] a  product  that  you're  just  over 
 delivering  your  solutions  to  their 
 problems  is  like  very  intensive  hey  you
[102:33] are  literally  doing  one-to-one  or  group 
 calls  or  everything  like  that  you  know 
 like  super  putting  your  time  into  it  and
[102:39] then  once  you're  making  like  a  good 
 amount  of  money  and  you  know  that  you're 
 getting  some  sales  and  you  feel  good 
 about  your  business  that's  where  you
[102:44] scale  it  down  and  you  add  friction  to 
 the  sale  that's  where  you  reduce  like
[102:49] how  much  of  your  own  time  and  effort  is 
 going  into  those  Solutions  and  then  if 
 you  really  want  more  times  you  can  focus
[102:55] on  like  scaling  up  or  something  then  you 
 can  take  away  parts  of  like  this  offer 
 and  reduce  the  price  in  the  future  this
[103:01] way  you'll  get  lots  of  early  customers 
 and  you  won't  be  like  that  guy  who 
 started  his  business  but  then  gets  like
[103:07] no  sales  so  you'll  avoid  that  you'll  get 
 those  early  customers  you'll  be  super
[103:12] intensive  with  those  early  customers  and 
 so  you'll  be  helping  them  get  really 
 good  results  they'll  give  you  good 
 testimonials  it'll  increase  your  own
[103:18] self-image  because  you  see  that  this 
 stuff  is  actually  working  for  them  so 
 it's  a  very  positive  feedback  loop  to
[103:23] just  think  to  work  as  hard  as  possible 
 to  over  deliver  like  crazy  to  really 
 think  to  yourself  you  know  what  I  don't
[103:29] want  passive  income  I  want  active  income 
 I'm  going  to  work  super  hard  for  this 
 I'll  call  them  twice  a  day  it's  not  like
[103:35] it's  going  to  take  me  five  minutes  when 
 I'm  in  the  gym  on  a  rest  break  or  if  I'm 
 in  the  cardio  machine  or  something  I 
 could  just  call  them  for  10  minutes  and
[103:41] check  them  up  and  it's  like  they  would 
 think  that  was  valuable  they  would 
 eventually  tell  the  people  about  how 
 much  I  helped  them  and  how  much  like
[103:47] progress  and  results  they  got  that's 
 awesome  I'm  gonna  make  more  money  the 
 more  I  work  and  the  more  effort  I  put  in
[103:52] right  now  what  you  want  to  do  is  go 
 through  the  problem  list  and  write 
 potential  Solutions  no  matter  even  if
[103:58] they're  crazy  just  next  to  them  and  I'd 
 even  ask  you  to  just  spike  your  thinking
[104:03] to  go  bigger 
 to  even  think  okay  if  your  customers
[104:08] paid  you  a  hundred  thousand  dollars  what 
 would  you  do  then  like  imagine  for  some 
 reason  a  billionaire  bought  your  fitness
[104:14] program  and  his  problem  was  that  he 
 didn't  know  how  to  like  go  to  the  gym  he
[104:20] didn't  know  what  to  do  and  he  paid  you  a 
 hundred  thousand  dollars  what  would  you 
 do  for  that  money  what  would  you  do 
 would  you  just  you  know  message  him  haha
[104:26] just  you  know  has  the  workout  routine 
 seven  times  eight  bicep  curls  but  if  he 
 paid  you  that  much  what  would  you  do  you
[104:31] might  even  fly  out  to  his  location 
 literally  drive  him  to  the  gym  and  walk 
 him  to  the  bench  press  and  load  up  the
[104:37] rack  for  him  right 
 so  why  don't  you  do  that  because  soon
[104:42] we'll  be  talking  about  the  pricing  for 
 our  product 
 the  more  intimate  the  more  intensive
[104:48] that  you  make  your  Solutions  the  higher 
 you  can  charge  so  what  I'd  ask  you  right 
 now  though  is  to  think  of  specifically
[104:55] the  sort  of  Life  quality  life  experience 
 work  task  that  you  would  want  do  you
[105:02] want  to  for  example 
 have  a  low  amount  of  work  hours  so  that 
 it  can  feel  a  bit  more  passive  you  can
[105:08] record  like  a  huge  selection  of  guides 
 and  videos  and  everything  and  then  just 
 sell  that  as  like  a  package  of  like  like
[105:13] a  course  or  do  you  want  to  maybe  make  a 
 bit  more  of  like  an  intensive  service 
 where  you  do  it  with  the  clients  and  you
[105:20] charge  them  way  more  you  see  there's 
 three  ways  that  you  can  help  someone  and 
 this  is  going  to  help  you  with  your
[105:25] solution  list  there's  DIY  do  it  yourself 
 this  is  like  the  lowest  level  this  is
[105:30] where  you  kind  of  give  them  the  the 
 knowledge  that  they  need  and  they  need 
 to  go  and  do  it  themselves  so  for
[105:35] example  DIY  do  it  yourself  is  what  I  do 
 with  these  YouTube  videos  I'm  making
[105:40] this  right  now  but  you  have  to  do  it 
 yourself  after  I've  made  this  video  it's 
 like  you're  just  left  to  yourself  right
[105:45] so  with  this  it's  very  scalable  it's 
 that  you  can  make  it  and  then  they  can 
 do  it  without  your  time  the  issue  is
[105:52] because  there's  less  involvement  from 
 you  naturally  you  can't  charge  as  much
[105:57] for  this  so  if  I  was  going  to  make  like 
 a  video  course  if  that  video  course 
 would  be  at  a  cheaper  price  and  it  would
[106:02] make  me  less  money  if  it  was  just  a 
 video  modules  where  the  customer  had  to 
 like  just  watch  them  and  Implement  them
[106:07] the  next  level  is  done  with  you  dwy  done
[106:12] with  you  this  is  where  you  make  like  the 
 the  sort  of  product  Again  the  video 
 course  or  whatever  but  there's  some  kind
[106:17] of  interactive  component  with  it  where 
 like  me  and  you  will  do  something 
 together  so  for  example  let's  say  the
[106:22] fitness  course  you've  got  the  videos  and 
 everything  but  there  might  be  weekly 
 check-ins  with  me  you  get  to  message  me
[106:28] and  tell  me  about  your  progress  I  see 
 that  okay  this  exercise  isn't  good  for 
 you  so  maybe  I  change  that  a  little  bit
[106:33] and  there's  a  bit  more  like  interaction 
 and  and  intimacy  there  in  our  business 
 relationship  because  of  that  it's  going
[106:39] to  take  more  work  more  time  from  us  so 
 we're  going  to  charge  more  for  it  and 
 you  can  see  how  the  sort  of  work  task
[106:45] changes  the  work  task  for  DIY  was  just 
 like  record  the  course  write  down  the
[106:50] PDFs  whatever  the  work  task  for  the 
 second  level  done  with  you  now  changes 
 to  being  like  you're  supporting  this
[106:56] person  maybe  online  with  some  check-ins 
 calls  and  everything  the  final  level
[107:01] which  goes  very  very  expensive 
 is  done  for  you  that's  where  you  take
[107:07] control  of  the  situation  and  you  don't 
 give  them  like  the  course  or  anything 
 like  that  you  try  and  do  as  much  as
[107:13] possible  for  them  so  they  don't  even 
 need  to  do  anything  yourself  so  you 
 can't  do  this  with  certain  things  so  for
[107:18] example  you  can't  do  like  done  for  you 
 as  like  a  personal  trainer  you  know  like 
 a  fitness  thing  because  you  can't  do  the
[107:24] exercise  for  them  you  can  do  some  parts 
 you  can  drive  them  to  the  gym  you  can 
 load  the  weights  and  that  kind  of  night 
 but  you  can't  actually  do  the  most  of  it
[107:30] you  can't  eat  the  food  for  them  you 
 can't  lift  the  weight  for  them  but  when 
 you  imagine  a  different  kind  of  business
[107:35] like  for  example  if  you  make  websites 
 let's  say  your  business  is  like  making
[107:40] websites  that  could  be  done  for  you 
 right  most  of  the  people  who  actually 
 make  websites  will  do  a  dfy  done  for  you
[107:46] where  for  example  I  could  pay  someone  to 
 make  my  website  and  they  don't  teach  me 
 anything  they  don't  need  me  to  do
[107:52] anything  they'll  just  make  me  the 
 website  and  so  they  can  charge  like  a 
 fair  amount  for  their  time  because  I
[107:57] don't  need  to  do  anything  and  they  do 
 all  the  work  so  it'd  be  interesting 
 right  now  for  you  to  just  kind  of  you
[108:02] know  visualize  and  sort  of  dream  about 
 your  ideal  life  and  your  ideal  work  task
[108:07] what  would  it  be  because  it  depends  what 
 experience  of  life  you  want  any  of  these
[108:12] can  scale  up  and  make  a  lot  of  money  for 
 example  with  my  business  model  I  have 
 Adonis  school  which  is  the  only  product
[108:17] that  I  sell  that's  done  with  you  that's 
 where  we  have  like  a  bunch  of  courses 
 for  the  students  who  join  the  online
[108:23] community  but  they're  done  with  you 
 aspect  is  that  there's  myself  and  many 
 of  the  teachers  that  will  like  literally
[108:29] be  there  on  live  calls  and  support  and 
 um  the  community  posts  and  everything  so
[108:34] there's  like  that  interactive  element 
 where  you  get  extra  support  compared  to 
 just  a  course  it's  not  done  for  you
[108:40] because  for  the  students  of  Adonis 
 school  I  can't  get  them  results  in  real 
 life  I  can't  meditate  for  them  I  can't
[108:45] like  you  know  get  them  in  I  can't  force 
 them  to  be  in  the  gym  with  this  kind  of 
 business  model  but  you  could  do  so  which
[108:53] one  would  you  rather  do  for  example 
 would  you  rather  make  content  DIY  would 
 you  rather  make  content  and  also  go  onto
[109:00] calls  with  people  or  would  you  rather  go 
 as  absolutely  intensive  as  possible  and
[109:06] literally  try  to  like  force  the  person 
 to  get  results  or  even  literally  just 
 get  the  results  for  them  yourself
[109:13] which  one  you  can  charge  more  but 
 obviously  you'll  you'll  take  on  less 
 clients  like  less  number  less  scale  for
[109:20] these  higher  end  packages  which  might  be 
 a  good  thing  because  you  sell  to  better 
 people  let  me  give  you  an  example  for
[109:25] like  the  fitness  and  and  health  business 
 level  one  DIY  is  you  make  a  fitness
[109:31] course  it's  just  literally  like  10 
 videos  where  you  explain  how  to  like 
 increase  your  bench  press  or  something
[109:36] okay  it's  kind  of  nice  you  might  sell  it 
 for  like  ten  dollars  twenty  dollars  or 
 something 
 level  two  done  with  you  you  go  on  to
[109:44] video  calls  weekly  check-ins  you  message 
 the  clients  and  he  tells  you  about  the
[109:49] weight  he's  used  and  then  you  tell  them 
 okay  do  this  next  week  try  this  wait 
 next  week  that's  pretty  nice  you  can 
 charge  a  lot  more  maybe  hundreds  of
[109:55] dollars  a  month  for  that 
 done  for  you  you  can't  lift  the  weight
[110:00] for  them  but  you  could  probably  move  to 
 the  house  cook  them  the  meals  make  sure
[110:05] they're  in  bed  on  time 
 and  literally  go  to  the  gym  with  them 
 drive  them  to  the  gym  load  up  the  bench
[110:11] press  literally  observe  their  form  you 
 you  spot  them  yourself  you  could  charge 
 thousands  of  dollars  for  that
[110:19] now  imagine  which  kind  of  person  would 
 buy  the  high  ticket  program 
 richer  wealthier  higher  status  higher
[110:26] level  you'd  be  able  to  network  with 
 those  people 
 so  it's  not  a  bad  idea  to  pursue  one  of
[110:32] those  I  don't  have  that  business  model 
 all  I've  got  is  just  done  with  you  and 
 I'm  quite  happy  with  that  but  it  is
[110:37] something  to  to  consider  honestly  like  I 
 I  almost  fantasize  about  it  sometimes 
 when  I  think  back  about  business
[110:43] a  few  years  ago  you  create  a  product 
 like  that  where  like  you'll  go  move  in 
 with  someone  to  help  them  perfect  their
[110:48] sleep  for  two  weeks 
 you  could  charge  twenty  five  thousand
[110:53] dollars  for  that 
 and  that's  your  life  is  like  flying  out 
 to  this  random  country  we're  like  this
[110:58] you  know  entrepreneur  lives  like  let's 
 say  Cape  Town  Dubai  or  something  and  you 
 just  go  stay  in  their  apartment  for  two
[111:03] weeks  you  track  their  like  Health  stats 
 and  here  you  are  like  there's 
 professional  working  amongst
[111:08] professionals  and  like  you're  networking 
 with  them 
 it's  very  powerful  and  the  more  help  you
[111:14] give  them  the  more  results  they're  going 
 to  get  the  more  results  they  get  the 
 more  testimonials  and  everything  so  it's
[111:20] very  powerful  just  to  think  which  level 
 you  would  want  to  work  at  also  when 
 you're  thinking  about  the  solutions  that
[111:26] you  could  have  to  these  problems  think 
 about  how  many  people  you  want  to  help 
 at  once  would  you  like  it  to  be  a
[111:33] one-to-one  interaction  so  you've  got  a 
 live  call  texting  with  this  one  person 
 maybe  even  like  in  person  helping  your
[111:39] customer  with  the  problem  would  you  want 
 it  to  be  in  a  group  setting  where  maybe 
 there's  multiple  people  you're  helping
[111:44] at  once  in  the  live  call  texting 
 community  community  or  anything  would 
 you  want  it  to  be  lots  of  people  so  for
[111:50] example  Adonis  school  is  with  lots  of 
 people  there's  a  high  amount  of  scale 
 now  the  more  people  there  are  the  less
[111:55] you  can  charge  because  your  attention  is 
 kind  of  spread  out  the  less  people  there 
 are  if  you're  doing  a  one-to-one  it's
[112:01] far  more  expensive  and  in  some  ways  it's 
 usually  better  for  happiness  like  when
[112:06] you  really  think  about  the  human 
 happiness  it  would  be  better  for  your 
 happiness  and  fulfillment  for  you  to  put
[112:11] so  much  more  more  effort  into  just  one 
 person  and  see  them  grow  than  it  would 
 for  you  to  disperse  your  attention  over
[112:18] like  many  others  so  it  just  depends  what 
 kind  of  person  you  are  what  interest  you
[112:23] are  do  you  want  to  help  multiple  people 
 at  once  do  you  want  it  to  be  a 
 one-to-one  just  think  of  the  problems
[112:28] list  that  you  have  and  just  think  to 
 yourself  would  you  want  to  help  as  many 
 people  as  possible  like  you  know  you
[112:33] make  a  video  and  50  500  a  thousand 
 people  can  watch  the  video  to  solve  the 
 problem  that  you've  got  on  your  list  or
[112:38] would  you  rather  it  be  like  okay  one  to 
 one  you're  gonna  really  really  deeply 
 help  this  one  person  overcome  this
[112:44] problem  so  this  is  another  actionable 
 step  create  an  absolutely  massive
[112:50] Solutions  list  to  every  single  problem 
 that  you've  thought  of  that  your  dream
[112:55] customer  is  going  to  have  getting  to 
 their  results  now  think  about  how  you 
 would  solve  every  one  of  those  problems
[113:00] in  a  way  that  you  would  kind  of  enjoy 
 that  actually  would  get  them  to  the 
 dream  results  maybe  it's  with  education
[113:05] you  record  the  videos  maybe  you  hop  on 
 the  live  calls  maybe  you  text  them  maybe 
 you  make  the  the  templates  the  workout
[113:10] routines  think  of  solutions  that  every 
 single  one  of  their  problems  this  is 
 some  high  leverage  work  it  will  fry  your
[113:16] brain  it  is  going  to  be  a  little  bit 
 like  you  know  time  consuming  and 
 difficult  but  this  is  really  going  to
[113:21] help  you  make  a  lot  more  money  in  the 
 future  so  this  is  worth  your  attention 
 go  and  do  that  actionable  step  one  final
[113:26] thing  that  you  can  add  to  your  Solutions 
 list  is  a  question  that  you  should  just 
 answer  to  yourself
[113:32] if  my  customers 
 barely  paid  me  anything  at  all  let's  say
[113:37] one  tenth  like  10  of  what  I  was  probably 
 gonna  charge  for  the  product  that  you 
 know  we're  gonna  create  this  into  or  if
[113:43] they  paid  me  like  five  dollars  nothing 
 right 
 and  I  still  had  to  make  these  Solutions
[113:48] valuable  how  would  I  do  it  what  would  I 
 add  into  it
[113:54] because  there's  a  lot  of  things  you 
 could  add  to  a  package  like  these 
 Solutions  which  would  be  kind  of  free
[114:00] for  you  to  give  to  someone  just  you  had 
 to  make  them  first  once  so  courses
[114:06] ebooks  templates  workout  routines
[114:11] um recorded  lectures  and  recorded  q  and 
 A's  maybe  something  that  doesn't  require 
 much  maintenance  like  a  community
[114:17] Discord  server  School  your  Facebook 
 group  go  and  create  your  full  massive 
 list  of  solutions  by  this  point  we  want
[114:23] you  to  have  a  massive  list  of  solutions 
 to  all  of  their  problems  so  this  could 
 be  a  hundred  random  Solutions  you've  got
[114:30] there's  this  video  you're  going  to  make 
 this  course  this  PDF  file  this  workout 
 routine  you'll  do  this  call  you'll  do
[114:36] this  you'll  send  these  messages  a 
 massive  list  of  solutions  to  all  their 
 problems  now  what  we're  going  to  do  is
[114:41] look  at  the  solutions  and  actually  be  a 
 little  bit  more  realistic  and  think  to 
 ourselves  do  I  really  want  to  do  that
[114:46] would  our  customer  actually  find  this 
 particular  solution  valuable  we  want  to
[114:52] go  through  and  trim  and  stack  this  list 
 of  solutions  so  that  all  that's  left  is
[114:57] the  things  that  would  actually  do  and 
 also  that  we  assume  our  Dream  customer 
 would  value  so  do  that  right  now  we  want
[115:03] this  clean  list  of  solutions  and  one  of 
 the  tip  that  I  can  give  you  is  that  we 
 want  it  to  be  as  many  how  high  value  one
[115:12] to  many  things  in  them  so  high  value 
 means  that  our  customer  would  actually
[115:17] like  this  solution  they'll  think  that 
 this  is  awesome  that  you've  like  made 
 this  thing  or  that  you're  offering  this
[115:22] thing  and  one  to  many  means  that  you  can 
 give  it  to  many  people  at  once  meaning
[115:27] that  you  could  make  it  once  and  maybe 
 just  keep  giving  it  to  more  people 
 essentially  what  this  means  is  like  you
[115:32] want  to  always  have  as  part  of  your 
 offer  as  part  of  your  product  a  bunch  of
[115:37] things  that  can  always  be  replicated 
 like  for  example  videos  you  could  record 
 a  video  and  have  like  the  little  video
[115:43] file  there  and  you  can  keep  giving  that 
 to  people  as  like  a  training  video
[115:49] for  years  and  you  don't  have  to  do  more 
 work 
 so  if  for  example  the  main  solution  that
[115:55] you've  got  is  okay  you'll  do  video  calls 
 and  you'll  walk  them  through  this 
 process  that  you  know  they  care  about 
 like  fat  loss  if  you  recorded  like  a  20
[116:02] minute  training  video  of  you  shopping 
 like  how  to  sign  up  to  the  gym  of  you 
 talking  about  the  ingredients  which  are
[116:07] really  good  for  you  or  really  bad  for 
 you  you  can  just  add  that  to  like  the 
 value  that  you're  giving  and  just
[116:13] constantly  keep  giving  it  keep  in  pretty 
 much  all  of  the  things  that  will  take 
 you  quite  a  while  to  make  right  now  but
[116:19] once  it's  done  you  can  just  keep  giving 
 it  more  and  more  and  more  PDFs  workout 
 routines  videos  courses  one  extra  tip  to
[116:26] manipulate  people  I  don't  know  why  this 
 is  but  people  absolutely  love  things
[116:31] like  templates  and  checklists  so  you've 
 seen  me  on  this  video  I've  mentioned  a 
 few  times  that  I'll  make  like  the  notion
[116:37] template  for  you  when  you  heard  that 
 whether  you  were  conscious  of  it  or  not 
 you  just  liked  me  more
[116:44] you  liked  me  like  five  percent  more  just 
 because  I  mentioned  that  I'll  go  and 
 make  like  a  five  minute  template  for  you
[116:50] that's  just  added  like  how  valuable  this 
 video  is  because  I've  said  that  I'll  go 
 and  make  like  this  template  or  habit
[116:55] tracker  or  a  checklist  or  whatever  it  is 
 for  you  people  love  these  kinds  of
[117:00] things  so  notion  is  like  a  software  you 
 can  use  for  free  and  you  can  make  all 
 the  habitators  templates  everything  so
[117:06] if  you  add  that  to  your  Solutions  list 
 like  if  one  of  their  problems  is  I  can't 
 get  into  the  gym  consistently  like  I'm
[117:11] not  consistent  in  the  gym  you  could  say 
 the  solution  to  that  is  like  a  habit 
 tracker  that  keeps  you  accountable  and
[117:17] you'll  give  them  a  notion  template  habit 
 tracker  for  that  when  we  eventually  make 
 our  sales  page  when  we  mention  what  the
[117:22] customer's  gonna  get  and  they  see  like 
 notion  habit  tracker  to  Skyrocket  you're 
 consistent  that  sees  it  to  go  to  the  gym
[117:28] they  literally  like  people  just  love 
 that  stuff  they'll  be  way  more  likely  to 
 buy  it  takes  you  like  five  minutes  to
[117:34] set  it  up  once  and  you  give  it  to 
 everyone  who  buys  it  now  you  still 
 probably  want  to  do  some  of  the
[117:39] Intensive  things  that  require  your  time 
 so  the  video  calls  maybe  even  meeting 
 people  in  person  maybe  the  texting  the
[117:45] accountability  because  that's  like  the 
 core  offer  that's  like  the  biggest  most 
 important  most  valuable  part  of  the
[117:52] product  that  we're  going  to  sell  this 
 big  package  I  know  that  everything  I've 
 made  you  go  through  over  the  last  like 
 10  minutes  20  minutes  of  this  video  is
[117:58] quite  a  lot  and  I  don't  expect  you 
 watching  this  right  now  so  we've  done 
 all  that  you're  probably  thinking  okay 
 I'll  watch  a  bit  more  of  the  guide  then
[118:03] I'll  do  that  soon  that's  absolutely  fine 
 when  I  was  going  through  this  process 
 myself  about  two  years  ago  I  remember
[118:09] that  doing  this  task  like  making  the 
 massive  problems  list  the  massive 
 Solutions  list  try  me  trimming  it  and
[118:15] everything  I  remember  that  taking  me 
 like  a  solid  week  of  waking  up  early  at 
 5am  black  coffee  and  grinding  it  out  and
[118:22] honestly  it  was  absolutely  worth  it  so 
 when  you  do  have  the  the  sort  of  mental
[118:27] bandwidth  for  this  maybe  starting  like 
 today  or  tomorrow  start  waking  up  early 
 black  coffee  and  just  like  get  to  work
[118:34] when  it's  still  dark  outside  making  this 
 massive  problems  and  solutions  list 
 whilst  you're  fasted  you  haven't  ate  any
[118:40] food  because  this  is  like  the  Deep  work 
 like  the  grind  that  you've  always  wanted 
 I  know  it  can  seem  a  bit  kind  of  scary
[118:45] and  mentally  fatiguing  to  think  of  this 
 big  task  I've  got  to  think  of  hundreds 
 of  problems  hundreds  of  Solutions  but
[118:52] the  question  I  always  keep  asking  is  as 
 a  young  guy  are  you  willing  to  work 
 super  hard  to  make  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  money
[118:58] well  yes 
 so  why  don't  you  try  to  start  waking  up 
 at  5am  tomorrow  like  I  do  I  wake  up  at
[119:03] five  every  or  half  four  actually  every 
 morning 
 and  just  grind  this  through  grind  these
[119:09] tasks  through  this  is  a  lot  of  work  I'm 
 not  going  to  [ __ ]  you  this  is  in 
 some  like  side  hustle  thing  that  you  can
[119:14] like  those  [ __ ]  YouTubers  they  make 
 videos  like  this  top  seven  ways  to  to 
 side  hustles  to  get  money  online  like
[119:20] this  it's  gonna  require  active  income 
 you  want  to  make  more  money  well  then 
 you've  got  to  work  harder  for  it  of
[119:25] course  you  do  you  want  to  make  more 
 money  you've  got  to  put  in  more  of  your 
 own  like  active  time  into  it  of  course
[119:30] you  do 
 you've  been  fine  with  this  idea  well  now 
 it's  time  to  put  in  the  work  for  it  so
[119:35] now  we  have  this  sort  of  cultivated  list 
 of  solutions  this  massive  list  like
[119:40] numbered  lists  and  it  says  you  know 
 we'll  make  this  course  we'll  do  this 
 call  we'll  text  them  like  this  we'll
[119:45] give  them  these  reminders  we'll  give 
 them  these  templates  these  are  the 
 things  that  we're  actually  willing  to  do 
 and  it's  like  a  massive  sort  of
[119:51] unorganized  list  of  solutions  to  all  of 
 their  problems 
 all  we  need  to  do  now  it's  very  clever
[119:57] marketing  trick  that  you  can  do  just  to 
 make  you  seem  like  more  of  an  authority
[120:02] figure  what  we  want  to  do  is  bundle  the 
 solutions  that  we  have  into  separate
[120:07] parts  so  you  could  call  this  for  example 
 your  seven  steps  to  Fat  Loss  the  four
[120:13] phases  of  fat  loss  or  something  like 
 that  so  you  would  bundle  it  in  a  certain 
 number  of  steps  you  know  if  you  look  at
[120:18] your  solution  list  right  now  or  you  can 
 just  imagine  the  kind  of  solutions  you 
 will  have  if  you're  going  to  do  this 
 soon  just  think  about  what  could  go  into
[120:25] the  same  like  topic  so  for  example  if 
 we're  selling  a  fitness  program  then  all
[120:30] of  the  things  about  exercise  would  go 
 into  the  same  part  right  and  then  all 
 the  ones  about  cooking  would  be  there
[120:35] then  all  the  ones  about  healthy  eating 
 all  the  ones  about  recovery  so  then  what 
 we  do  is  like  we're  just  kind  of  use
[120:42] sort  of  cool  sounding  words  and  names  to 
 instead  of  us  saying  yeah  we'll  give  you
[120:48] all  of  this  random  stuff  what  we  say  is 
 I'm  gonna  take  you  through  my  four-step 
 framework  of  fat  loss  think  about  what
[120:54] level  of  like  professionalism  the 
 difference  is  there  one  guy  just  says
[120:59] yeah  it  has  a  massive  list  I'm  going  to 
 give  you  right  he  has  a  bullet  point 
 list  of  72  things  which  is  all  random
[121:04] and  everything  the  other  guy  says  I've 
 got  a  seven  step  framework  to  muscle 
 building  and  I'm  gonna  walk  you  through
[121:09] it  the  first  step  is 
 um  I  don't  know  your  measurements  the
[121:14] second  step  is  the  fat  loss  the  third 
 step  is  is  the  workout  routines  and
[121:19] inside  each  step  or  inside  each  phrase 
 or  block  or  whatever  you  want  to  call  it 
 is  like  the  solutions  that  are  relevant
[121:25] to  that  step  this  just  makes  you  seem 
 like  more  of  a  professional  and  it'll 
 just  increase  the  amount  of  sales  that
[121:30] you  eventually  get  once  we  make  the 
 sales  page  so  for  example  inside  of  the 
 package  that  you're  selling  you  could
[121:36] have  four  different  steps  and  one  of 
 them  could  be  healthy  eating  for  noobs
[121:42] that's  the  second  step  framework  for 
 your  bodybuilding  program  healthy  eating 
 for  noobs  inside  of  that  would  be  the
[121:48] list  of  solutions  that  are  relevant  to 
 that  sort  of  topic  or  block  or  you  know 
 healthy  eating  for  noobs  so  it'd  be  it'd
[121:53] be  the  video  of  you  describing  the  foods 
 they  should  eat  it  should  be  maybe  like 
 the  Amazon  wish  list  of  the  ingredients
[121:59] that  you  know  the  foods  they  should  buy 
 it  should  be  videos  of  you  literally 
 cooking  the  food  that  they  should  be
[122:04] cooking  so  that  they  can  watch  you  cook 
 it  should  be  like  the  offer  of  like  yeah 
 I'll  go  on  one  call  with  you  on  WhatsApp
[122:09] a  live  call  whilst  you're  in  your 
 kitchen  and  I'll  give  you  some  feedback 
 of  like  whilst  you  cook  live  so  I'll
[122:14] tell  you  okay  yeah  yeah  turn  over  the 
 meat  now  so  yeah  yeah  okay  looks  good 
 okay  no  no  put  it  on  like  220  degrees  or
[122:19] something  and  that's  like  one  block  of 
 your  package  now  imagine  10  of  those
[122:24] healthy  easing  for  noobs 
 starting  the  gym  guide 
 maxing  out  the  PRS  whatever  you've  got
[122:31] like  five  ten  different  parts  to  your 
 package  and  they're  all  worded  or  named
[122:37] in  a  way  that  makes  you  seem  like  you 
 know  what  you're  doing  and  that  you've 
 created  this  sort  of  special  unique
[122:43] system  so  now  think  about  where  we  are 
 we've  autistically  thought  about  every 
 problem  that  the  customer  has  then  we
[122:48] thought  about  solutions  to  every  problem 
 then  we  trimmed  that  list  of  solutions 
 so  that  it's  actually  relevant  and
[122:55] reasonable  okay  these  are  the  things  we 
 could  do  these  are  the  things  they'd 
 actually  value  and  then  we've  just  sort 
 of  packaged  those  Solutions  and  bundled
[123:01] them  up  so  now  what  we  have  is  like  a 
 cool  sounding  list  of  you  know  seven 
 phases  to  Fat  Loss  three  ways  of
[123:07] whatever  you  want  to  like  sort  of  name 
 it  this  is  actually  what  we're  selling 
 think  about  how  different  this  is  we're
[123:13] selling  this  huge  package  inside  of  it 
 is  the  same  things  it's  the  call  it's
[123:18] the  courses  it's  the  workout  routines 
 it's  it's  the  accountability  the  the 
 templates  and  everything  but  instead  of
[123:23] us  just  selling  a  product  like  for 
 example  just  like  a  one-to-one  video
[123:28] call  you  can  see  that  we're  not  really 
 selling  a  product  anymore  it's  more  like 
 we're  selling  the  solution  we're  selling
[123:35] their  dream  results  we're  not  going  to 
 be  telling  them  like  oh  hey  you  know 
 like  this  is  the  thing  that  I  sell  it's
[123:40] one-to-one  video  calling  this  and  this 
 and  this  and  this  we're  rather  gonna  say 
 like  okay  you  have  this  problem  where 
 you're  struggling  to  lose  weight  just  as
[123:46] an  example  in  the  fitness  niche  I  have 
 the  solution  which  is  my  seven  step 
 framework  and  I'm  going  to  take  you
[123:52] through  that  how  much  is  the  problem 
 worth  for  you  to  solve  well  you've  been 
 stressing  out  about  weight  loss  for  the
[123:57] past  five  years  and  most  people 
 literally  struggle  with  weight  loss  for 
 most  of  their  lives  so  it's  worth  a  few 
 grand  right
[124:02] so  I'm  gonna  fix  that  problem  for  you 
 doing  it  in  my  seven  step  framework  too
[124:07] noobs  guide  to  whatever  you  want  to  call 
 it  and  you  can  see  how  much  more  you 
 seem  like  a  professional  this  is  your
[124:13] core  package  done  this  is  the  thing  that 
 we  are  actually  gonna  sell  you're  no 
 longer  selling  this  one  random  thing
[124:19] you're  selling  the  whole  package  the 
 solution  to  their  problem  that  means 
 that  you  can  charge  whatever  you  want
[124:26] which  is  very  powerful  we'll  get  to  the 
 pricing  very  soon  but  there's  a  quick 
 way  that  we  can  just  increase  the  value
[124:32] of  this  package  that  you've  made  even 
 more  step  five  enhancing  your  product  I
[124:37] played  a  video  game  called  RuneScape  and 
 I  was  addicted  to  it  for  most  of  my  life
[124:42] from  childhood  to 
 teenage  or  even  adult  years  I  had  about 
 10  000  hours  on  that  game  bro  [ __ ]  me  so
[124:49] it's  like  an  MMORPG  game  you  probably 
 know  what  that  is  it's  kind  of  like 
 you've  got  your  own  character  like  your
[124:54] own  accounts  that  you  log  into  every  day 
 and  you  level  it  up  but  also  there's 
 everyone  else  and  they  level  up  their
[124:59] characters  too  and  there's  like  Monsters 
 to  kill  and  quests  to  do  and  everything 
 and  on  this  game  there's  kind  of  like  a
[125:05] Marketplace  like  there's  items  that  gets 
 dropped  from  Monsters  or  you  know  from
[125:10] the  ground  whatever  and  you  get  them 
 they're  worth  a  certain  amount  of  like 
 gold  like  cash  and  you  can  start  to
[125:15] trade  it  with  people  you  can  go  it's 
 like  What's  called  the  Grand  exchange 
 which  is  like  a  big  shop  where  we  can
[125:20] all  buy  and  sell  each  other's  products 
 and  I  want  you  to  really  think  about 
 this  game  right  I  want  you  to  think 
 imagine  there's  like  a  sword
[125:26] what  would  happen  if  the  developers  of 
 this  game  release  the  new  patch  notes
[125:31] saying  this  sword 
 is  now 
 significantly  stronger  the  attack  level
[125:38] like  the  strength  or  you  know  like  the 
 power  of  this  sword  has  just  been  three 
 times  imagine  they  just  released  that
[125:43] like  the  developers  right  what  would 
 happen  inside  the  game  for  the  price  of 
 the  sword
[125:49] if  you  go  up 
 why  would  it  go  up  really  think  about  it 
 why  would  it  what  action  would  cause  it
[125:55] to  go  up 
 more  people  would  be  buying  it  because
[126:02] it's  better  it  would  cause  a  demand  and 
 when  the  demand  goes  up  the  price  goes
[126:09] up  because  if  this  sword  was  for  a 
 hundred  gold  points  like  that's  the  cash 
 in  this  game  100  gold  points  but  we've
[126:16] just  doubled  how  powerful  the  sword  is 
 well  then  more  people  are  instantly
[126:21] gonna  log  in  and  think  oh  man  I'm  gonna 
 go  buy  that  sort  of  800  gold  coins  or 
 whatever  the  guy  who's  got  it  and  now  he
[126:27] has  like  three  people  message  him  or 
 I'll  say  to  him  like  oh  I'll  buy  it  for 
 a  hundred  I'll  buy  it  for  110  I'll  buy 
 it  for  150  I'll  buy  it  for  200.  just
[126:35] doubled  in  price  the  bids  keep  going 
 higher  and  higher 
 when  we  make  something  better
[126:42] the  demand  goes  up  and  therefore  the 
 price  goes  up
[126:48] why  not  do  that  with  your  package 
 why  not  think  to  yourself  how  could  you
[126:53] be  the  that  developer 
 who  just  tweaks  a  few  things  and  then 
 makes  that  that  sword  better
[127:02] how  could  you  make  your  package  better 
 so  that  it  cause  more  of  a  demand  more 
 people  want  to  buy  it  and  then  you  can
[127:07] just  raise  the  prices  this  is  demand  but 
 what  about  Supply  you've  heard  the  term 
 before  supply  and  demand  Supply  is  the
[127:14] quantity  of  the  thing  simply  put  the  the 
 more  quantity  like  the  more  of  a  thing
[127:21] the  less  valuable  it  is  that  makes  sense 
 right  so  this  sword  here  is  worth  100
[127:26] gold  points  and  there's  a  thousand  in 
 the  game 
 if  the  developers  say  oh  yeah  the
[127:32] monster  that  drops  this  sword  it's  only 
 gonna  drop  the  sword  half  as  much
[127:38] what's  gonna  happen 
 the  supply  of  the  sword  coming  you  know
[127:43] generated  into  the  game  with  RNG 
 generated  into  the  game  it's  going  to  be 
 cut  in  half  which  means  that  the  supply
[127:48] of  the  sword  is  going  to  be  lowered 
 which  means  that  the  sword  is  going  to 
 be  rarer  which  means  that  again  the
[127:54] price  goes  up 
 Supply  the  quantity
[128:01] so  how  could  you  lower  the  supply  of 
 your  package
[128:09] what  could  you  do  to  like  lower  the 
 amount  that  is  available
[128:16] you  can  use 
 scarcity 
 and  urgency
[128:22] scarcity  is  when  you  limit  the  quantity 
 of  the  product  or  service  that  you  have
[128:29] and  you  say  okay  there's  only  a  certain 
 amount  that  is  available
[128:36] now  you  see  this  when  you  when  you  go 
 into  like  some  sales  Pages  you  see  this 
 often  where  the  person  will  say  like  oh
[128:41] yeah  like  you  know  there's  only  like 
 seven  left  or  I've  only  have  set  five 
 more  spots  or  whatever  it  is  let's  be
[128:46] honest  it  kind  of  looks  a  little  bit 
 like  sleazy  but 
 it's  the  name  of  the  game  it's  just  like
[128:52] it  you  will  undeniably  get  more  sales  if 
 you  just  have  some  kind  of  scarcity  and
[128:57] urgency  so  if  you've  got  like  some  kind 
 of  limiting  belief  right  now  I  think  I 
 always  hate  that  when  I  see  it  on  like  a 
 website  when  they  say  like  oh  only  seven
[129:03] more  left  only  this  you  know  the  sale 
 ends  on  Friday  why  do  you  think  every
[129:08] single  store  in  the  entire  world  uses 
 like  the  concept  of  a  sale  oh  yeah  you
[129:13] know  this  the  sale  we've  got  lower 
 prices  but  it  ends  next  like  you  know 
 next  week
[129:18] it's  because  it  works  so  if  you're  gonna 
 play  the  game  of  Entrepreneurship  that
[129:23] you  may  as  well  win  the  [ __ ]  game 
 play  it  properly  don't  be  scared  of  like 
 playing  the  game  and  thinking  oh  man  but
[129:28] you  know  it  doesn't  sound  so  cool  like 
 it  doesn't  make  me  feel  good  like  just 
 [ __ ]  play  the  game  right  use  the 
 tactics  that  are  available  because  they
[129:34] work  so  scarcity  is  when  you  lower  the 
 quantity  that  is  available  and  what  I
[129:39] would  say  that  would  work  for  pretty 
 much  everyone  who's  watching  this  just
[129:44] use  honestly  about  your  capacity  what 
 this  means  is  like  be  honest  about  how
[129:51] many  people  you  could  actually  help  like 
 that  you've  got  the  brain  power  for 
 chances  are  your  package  is  going  to  be
[129:58] a  big  mix  of  things  but  it's  gonna  have 
 some  kind  of  interactive  component  so 
 you  might  make  for  example  whatever  your
[130:04] like  niches  the  problem  the  result  is 
 you  know  the  fat  loss  let's  say  you'll 
 do  a  bunch  of  things  like  oh  yeah  notion
[130:10] templates  and  courses  and  whatever  you 
 want  to  add  in  but  chances  are  you'll 
 probably  add  in  a  little  bit  of  like 
 your  own  time  to  it  maybe  a  one-to-one
[130:16] call  maybe  a  group  call  maybe  some 
 accountability  ability  and  everything 
 but  you  can  only  do  so  much  of  that
[130:22] so  technically  it's  like  it's  absolutely 
 true  that  you  could  only  actually  handle
[130:28] certain  number  of  sales  right  a  certain 
 number  you  could  probably  only  sell  like 
 a  few  people  a  week  until  you  had  too
[130:35] many  people  in  your  message  you  know  you 
 had  to  wake  up  and  message  like  10  of 
 your  clients  or  something  or  you  had  to
[130:40] like  serve  a  bunch  of  people  and  it 
 started  to  get  like  quite  painful  and 
 quite  um  overwhelming  for  you  you  have
[130:45] your  own  limit  with  work 
 so  that  can  be  your  scarcity  tactic  you 
 can  literally  write  on  your  sales  page
[130:51] which  we  will  be  making  soon  I  can  only 
 take  on  five  clients  this  month  and  I've 
 already  got  four  so  as  soon  as  the  next
[130:57] person  books  in  you  can't  buy  it  till 
 the  next  month  so  if  you  want  to  buy  it 
 like  make  sure  you  buy  it  before  like
[131:02] anyone  else  does  that  will  actually 
 increase  your  sales  significantly 
 urgency  is  another  way  to  enhance  your
[131:08] package 
 urgency  is  specifically  about  the  time 
 so  first  is  the  quantity  that's  scarcity
[131:15] urgency  is  just  time  there's  like  a 
 deadline  okay  you  can  only  buy  by 
 midnight  tonight  otherwise  the  price
[131:22] goes  up  you  can  also  use  guarantees  to 
 increase  the  demand  of  your  product  so 
 guarantee  is  kind  of  like  you  giving
[131:28] reassurance  that  your  product  or  your 
 package  is  actually  going  to  help  them 
 and  that  you  know  they'll  get  the  value
[131:34] that  they've  assumed  so  the  most  common 
 guarantees  are  just  like  the  refunds 
 saying  okay  if  you're  not  happy  if  you
[131:39] want  a  refund  then  I'll  give  you  a 
 refund  in  general  it's  pretty  much 
 always  worth  to  turn  that  on  and  to  just
[131:45] say  like  yeah  you  know  what  within  seven 
 days  days  or  14  days  you  can  use  the 
 thing  if  you  don't  like  if  you  want  a
[131:50] refund  just  get  a  refund  boom  I'm  not 
 gonna  like  stop  you  just  send  me  an 
 email  and  I'll  give  you  a  full  refund
[131:55] and  obviously  like  I'll  revoke  your 
 access  to  the  product  after  that 
 generally  you'll  get  like  an  e  like  more
[132:03] sales  that  to  the  point  that  it's  worth 
 it  so  it  can  seem  kind  of  like  annoying
[132:08] to  think  where  I'm  gonna  like  you  know 
 give  people  a  refund  I  don't  want  to  do 
 that  you  know  they've  used  my  thing  as 
 well  they've  got  to  like  see  my  courses
[132:14] maybe  I  did  a  one-to-one  time  but  you'll 
 get  a  lot  more  sales  if  you  do  offer  the 
 guarantee  so  it's  kind  of  like  it's
[132:20] pretty  much  always  worth  it  this  is 
 something  you  can  experiment  on  but  as  a 
 beginner  if  I  could  just  give  you  advice
[132:25] that  you'd  like  blindly  follow  but  I 
 will  say  it's  just  like  just  allow  the 
 refunds  allow  just  give  this  guarantee
[132:30] full  refund  within  seven  or  maybe  14 
 days  if  you're  not  happy  you  literally
[132:35] just  send  me  an  email  and  I'll  just  give 
 you  a  full  refund  that's  it  so  you've 
 got  nothing  to  worry  about  I  want  you  to 
 be  super  happy  and  I'll  try  my  best  to
[132:40] make  you  happy  and  like  I'll  try  my  best 
 to  make  sure  that  you  don't  want  a 
 refund  that's  it  you'll  actually  get  way
[132:45] more  sales  to  the  point  that  it's 
 actually  worth  turning  that  on  so  here's 
 your  actionable  step  for  this  part  of 
 the  guide  which  you  can  take  some  time
[132:51] on  think  about 
 how  you  can  add  scarcity 
 urgency  guarantees  and  also  how  you
[132:57] could  just  increase  the  demand  of  your 
 product  by  making  it  better  can  you 
 think  of  any  more  bonuses  that  you  could
[133:02] add  in  there 
 think  about  that  patch  notes  that  the 
 developer  are  going  to  say  like  oh  yeah
[133:07] the  sword  is  better  how  could  you 
 uh  buff  yeah  the  video  game  terminal
[133:13] like  oh  they  buffed  the  sword  or  they 
 nerfed  the  sword  how  could  you  buff  like 
 each  part  inside  of  your  uh  package
[133:20] think  of  that  right  now  maybe  write  it 
 down  spend  a  few  minutes  thinking  and 
 then  continue  watching  step  six  charge
[133:26] high  prices  and  make  it  worth  it  in  this 
 part  of  the  guide  you're  going  to  learn 
 exactly  what  to  price  your  package  and
[133:32] it's  actually  going  to  be  worth  it  and 
 the  price  is  actually  going  to  be  super 
 high  so  this  is  how  beginners  who  never
[133:39] make  any  money  in  business  this  is  how 
 they  choose  their  pricing  they  go  and 
 see  what  competitors  are  doing
[133:46] Tate  has  a  program  which  is  it's  47  a 
 month  sneako  had  one  which  is  about  47  a
[133:53] month 
 I  want  to  make  something  similar  so  I'll 
 make  mine  35  a  month
[133:59] do  that 
 if  you  are  a  terrible  entrepreneur  this
[134:04] is  like  no  offense  to  them  but  this  is 
 what  like  brown  like  immigrants  do  it's
[134:09] just  like  I  see  this  so  often  with  the 
 the  sort  of  lower  end  businesses  of  you
[134:14] know  making  the  corner  store  and 
 everything  it's  always  okay  look  at  your 
 competition  and  literally  price  your
[134:19] products  a  few  pennies  cheaper  than 
 theirs  hoping  that  that's  going  to  be 
 the  reason  why  you  get  a  sale  when  you 
 try  and  like  undercut  your  competition
[134:25] by  by  just  making  your  price  cheaper 
 than  them  it's  just  a  purely  depressing 
 experience  because  you're  just  making
[134:31] less  money  and  you  hear  you  are  like 
 fighting  for  the  scraps  going  lower  and 
 lower  and  lower  and  lower  a  new  guy
[134:36] comes  in  and  his  his  thing  is  lower  then 
 your  thing  is  lower  then  his  thing  is 
 lower  than  your  thing  is  lower  and  then
[134:41] before  you  know  it  no  one's  actually 
 making  any  money  the  top  tier 
 entrepreneurs  don't  do  that
[134:48] they  look  around  what  everyone's  doing 
 and  they  honestly  don't  even  let  it
[134:54] influence  the  idea  of  pricing
[134:59] instead  what  they  do 
 they  think  about  how  much  the  solution
[135:05] of  the  problem  is  worth  to  that  dream 
 customer
[135:11] you  see  you  don't  want  a  price 
 for  the  product  you  don't  want  a  price
[135:16] for  the  package  so  you're  thinking  okay 
 how  much  is  a  live  call  with  me  worth 
 how  much  is  like  this  notion  template
[135:21] this  course  worth  you  don't  want  to  do 
 that  this  is  what  low-level 
 entrepreneurs  do  what  you  want  to  do  is
[135:26] think  to  yourself  how  much  is  it  worth 
 for  my  person  like  my  customer  to
[135:31] finally  fix  this  problem  that  they've 
 had  for  however  long  think  about  how
[135:36] powerful  that  is  let's  say  it's  weight 
 loss  for  middle-aged  women  let's  say 
 that's  like  our  market  and  our  product 
 our  Solutions  are  about  weight  loss
[135:43] we  could  think  to  ourselves  yeah  you 
 know  like  my  training  programs  worth 
 twenty  dollars  and  like  one  to  one  call 
 fifty  dollars  this  is  okay  whatever  it's
[135:49] a  bit  long  okay  or  we  could  think  how 
 much  is  this  problem  worth  for  this
[135:54] middle-aged  woman  who  struggled  with 
 weight  loss  already  for  10  years  and 
 will  continue  to  struggle  for  the  rest
[136:00] of  her  life  thousands 
 thousands  if  we  can  finally  fix  this
[136:07] problem  for  her  it  is  literally  like 
 tens  of  thousands  hundreds  of  thousands 
 [ __ ]  Millions  she's  gonna  spend
[136:14] hundreds  thousands  of  her  hours  of  her 
 mental  fatigue  literally  feeling 
 self-conscious  and  and  jealous  every
[136:22] time  she  goes  into  the  supermarket  and 
 she  sees  a  woman  who's  got  a  better 
 physique  than  her  she  will  literally  get
[136:27] like  a  mental  slight  twinge  of  mental 
 illness 
 it's  worth  tens  of  thousands  if  not
[136:34] hundreds  of  of  thousands  of  pounds  to 
 fix  this  problem  for  her
[136:44] now  you're  talking  now  you're  not  gonna 
 go  and  charge  but  most  likely  you're  not 
 going  to  charge  a  hundred  thousand
[136:49] pounds  for  this 
 but  you're  gonna  actually  like  have  some 
 confidence  about  you  thinking  like  [ __ ]
[136:54] me  yeah  if  I  help  them  solve  this 
 problem  I  will  literally  save  them
[136:59] [ __ ]  Decades  of  just  spinning  around 
 in  circles  I'll  save  them  like  years  of
[137:04] experiencing  pretty  much  mental  illness 
 jealousy  insecurity  self-hatred
[137:10] the  thing  I've  got  is  actually  amazing 
 now  you're  talking
[137:15] and  so  you  think  to  yourself  okay  well 
 what's  a  what's  a  pretty  high  price  for 
 this
[137:22] and  in  general 
 the  higher  the  better
[137:29] what  I  would  do  is  I  would  align  how 
 much  you're  going  to  charge 
 with  how  intimate  and  intensive  your
[137:38] program  is  so  remember  we  say  like 
 there's  the  DIY  done  with  you  done  for
[137:43] you  if  it's  like  a  DIY  like  you're  just 
 going  to  make  the  courses  and  stuff  and 
 it's  kind  of  like  done  it's  automated
[137:48] after  that  I  would  have  it  less  if  it's 
 done  with  you  and  you're  gonna  do  like 
 these  weekly  check-ins  or  calls  or
[137:54] something  then  I  would  price  it  more  and 
 if  it's  done  for  you  if  you're  able  to 
 like  literally  be  there  and  like  kind  of
[137:59] do  as  much  as  possible  to  literally  just 
 force  them  to  get  the  results  and  you 
 pretty  much  like  in  Fitness  you  can't  do
[138:05] this  you  can't  lift  the  weights  for  them 
 but  you  do  as  much  as  you  possibly  could 
 then  that's  the  most  expensive
[138:10] it  could  be  hundreds  of  dollars  for  DIY 
 thousands  of  dollars  for  done  with  you
[138:17] and  tens  of  thousands  for  done  for  you
[138:22] and  this  might  scare  you  straight  away 
 you're  thinking  no  no  the  Ham's  is  wrong 
 I  I  couldn't  price  minor  hundreds  of
[138:27] dollars  or  thousands  of  dollars  on  and  I 
 couldn't  I  couldn't 
 yeah
[138:33] yeah 
 if  that's  what  the  belief  you  have  in 
 your  mind  then  you  couldn't  yeah  you
[138:38] couldn't 
 if  you  think  you  can't  then  you  can't 
 simple  as  that
[138:45] but  your  dream  customers  one  percent  of 
 them  or  0.1  percent  of  them  are  buying
[138:52] similar  products 
 with  a  similar  price
[138:57] from  someone  else  right  now 
 someone  else  is  selling  a  similar  thing
[139:03] that  you've  got  and  they're  making  the 
 money  that  you're  scared  of  making 
 this  isn't  the  objective  truth  of  the
[139:09] universe  that  you  couldn't  charge  that 
 month  this  is  your  own  limiting  belief 
 because
[139:15] yeah  why  did  you  get  this  limiting 
 belief  was  it  a  teacher  when  you  were 
 seven  years  old  who  who  said  some  snide
[139:20] comments  is  it  one  of  your  parents  who 
 ended  up  saying  oh  you  can't  do  anything 
 when  they  were  angry  at  you  when  you 
 were  12  years  old  which  one  was  it
[139:27] this  limited  belief  you  kept  in  your 
 mind  for  10  years  and  you're  still  gonna 
 let  it  rule  you 
 that's  how  you  want  to  live  your  life
[139:33] right 
 sounds  pretty  [ __ ]  stupid  to  live 
 your  life  like  that  right
[139:38] so  what's  stopping  you  right  now 
 grabbing  that  limiting  belief  destroying 
 it  and  thinking  to  yourself  yeah  [ __ ]
[139:43] yeah  the  solution  to  that  problem  is 
 worth  thousands  of  dollars  I'm  gonna 
 help  them  to  solve  this  problem  for  the
[139:49] rest  of  their  lives  like  they  are  done 
 once  they  have  my  program  they'll  never 
 struggle  with  weight  loss  or  whatever 
 the  the  topic  is  that  you're  helping
[139:55] them  with  ever  again  that  is  worth 
 thousands 
 yeah  I  am  worth  thousands  yeah  I  can
[140:00] charge  a  package  that's  worth  thousands 
 and  I  will  get  them  the  happy  results 
 that  they  want
[140:06] because  when  you  have  that  belief 
 well
[140:11] yeah  you  will  if  you  believe  that  you 
 you  your  product  is  worth  it
[140:16] and  you  believe  that  you  can  get  them 
 the  results  and  you're  willing  to  work 
 hard  as  [ __ ]  you  know  stay  in  like
[140:21] communication  with  them  see  where 
 they're  at  then  yeah 
 then  you  will  this  is  a  sticking  point
[140:26] for  many  young  men  because  your 
 self-image  is  very  important  here  so
[140:31] this  is  going  to  sound  kind  of  weird  we 
 clicked  on  this  section  because  you  just 
 wanted  to  make  money  you  wanted  to  know
[140:36] what  to  price  your  product  actually  this 
 section  needs  to  be  about  your  own
[140:41] psychology  and  your  own  deep  beliefs 
 about  yourself  because  how  much  you  will 
 price  your  product  how  much  you're
[140:46] willing  to  make  per  year  is  purely  based 
 on  how  you  see  yourself  some  people  some
[140:52] men  do  see  themselves  as  too  high  and 
 they  make  no  progress  you  know  some  some 
 guys  will  start  off  in  in  their  shitty
[140:58] like  first  business  and  expect  to  become 
 like  a  millionaire  within  six  months  you 
 know  they'll  be  setting  smart  goals  or
[141:03] something  and  that's  like  you'd  be  into 
 it  again  come  on  let's  slow  it  down  a 
 little  bit  you  you've  got  like  too  much
[141:08] self-belief  which  in  itself  isn't  even 
 self-belief  it's  more  like  the  same  kind 
 of  fear  that  holds  the  other  opposite
[141:13] end  of  the  Spectrum  which  is  the  people 
 who  don't  have  the  belief  to  begin  with 
 either  way  or  this  problem  is  just  stems
[141:18] from  like  fear  and  resentment  and  lack 
 of  love  and  um  conditional  love  that  you
[141:23] experience  as  a  child  I  know  this  sounds 
 really  deep  but  it's  absolutely  the 
 truth  You've  Got  Deep  psychological
[141:28] wounds  and  like  [ __ ]  up  beliefs  about 
 the  world  which  is  why  you're  struggling 
 in  business  because  if  you  did  have  the
[141:33] right  kind  of  self-belief  you  wouldn't 
 struggle  to  sell  a  PR  a  package  for  what 
 it  was  worth  if  there's  a  good  price  for
[141:39] your  your  Solutions  and  you're  thinking 
 oh  yeah  I'll  just  you  know  I'll  just 
 lower  it  a  little  bit  because  of  X
[141:45] reason  whatever  it  is  Yo  Yo  I  just  want 
 to  get  some  experience  oh  you  know  my 
 people  don't  have  much  money  they've  got
[141:51] airpods  how  many  times  do  we  need  to  go 
 over  this  the  people  that  you're  selling 
 to  have  money
[141:57] you  need  to  destroy  any  limiting  belief 
 you  have  inside  of  you  right  now  and 
 think  to  yourself  okay  [ __ ]  me  like  I'm 
 willing  to  work  super  hard  to  make  a  lot
[142:03] of  money  right  I'm  willing  to  Skyrocket 
 my  active  income  I'm  willing  to  work
[142:08] like  five  hours  a  day  to  make  sure  that 
 this  client  actually  gets  the  results 
 I'm  willing  to  over  deliver
[142:15] and  if  I'm  gonna  do  that  I  need  to  be 
 motivated  to  do  if  I  charge  them  100  or 
 200  then  I'm  not  gonna  go  above  and
[142:21] beyond  but  if  I  charge  them  a  thousand 
 two  thousand  three  thousand  like  dollars 
 for  this  package
[142:27] I'm  gonna  feel  the  pressure  I'm  gonna 
 wake  up  early  and  literally  message  them 
 saying  yo  come  on  get  up  like  do  the 
 thing  that  you  bought  my  package  for
[142:33] you  see  there  is  a  cycle  a  positive 
 feedback  loop  to  pricing  high  like
[142:39] increasing  your  prices  when  you  increase 
 your  prices  you  care  more  you're  more
[142:44] motivated  because  you're  getting  paid 
 for  it  the  beauty  of  a  capitalistic 
 society  when  you  increase  your  prices
[142:49] they  care  more  because  they've  invested 
 more  so  they  take  it  more  seriously  you 
 might  have  heard  of  the  study  where  the
[142:55] participants  have  brought  in  and  given 
 three  bottles  of  wine  to  taste  and 
 there's  like  the  cheap  bottle  the  median
[143:00] price  bottle  and  the  high-end  bottle  and 
 they're  asked  to  give  them  a  rating  of 
 like  the  taste  or  the  or  the  like  how
[143:05] good  they  are  and  they  rate  the  cheap 
 bottle  as  the  worst  taste  the  medium 
 bottle  is  the  medium  taste  and  the
[143:11] expensive  bottle  is  the  best  taste 
 they're  all  the  same  wine  it  was  all  the 
 same  but  you  just  told  them  you  just
[143:17] made  them  believe  that  one  was  more 
 expensive  if  something  is  more  expensive 
 people  just  believe  that  it's  more
[143:22] valuable  that  it's  better  and  so  they 
 get  better  results  with  it 
 so  literally  a  fast  way  of  you  getting
[143:29] your  people  more  resulted  simply  to  just 
 charge  more  and  then  if  we're  being
[143:34] honest 
 if  we're  being  totally  honest  which 
 might  offend  some  people
[143:39] when  you  charge  more  you  get  better 
 customers 
 you  simply  just  get  better  customers
[143:44] when  you  charge  less  you  attract  the 
 worst  people  you  attract  like  cheap
[143:49] [ __ ]  you  never  want  to  sell 
 like  a  cheap  product  because  especially 
 when  there's  like  a  service  when  you
[143:54] want  to  like  you  know  do  some  kind  of 
 interactive  component  with  them  the 
 amount  of  like  emails  and  complaints  you 
 get  from  like  lower  tier  people  broke
[144:00] people  because  they've  like  imagine  like 
 a  broke  person  who's  barely  got  any 
 money  and  hey  you  are  trying  to  sell  him
[144:05] like  a  10  a  month  thing  they  will 
 [ __ ]  like  they  will  ruin  your  mental 
 health  you  don't  want  to  sell  anything
[144:11] like  low  ticket  the  lowest  thing  that 
 I'll  ever  sell  is  like  500  because  that 
 means  that  like  the  absolute  brokies
[144:17] can't  afford  it  which  I  know  sounds 
 horrible  but  it's  the  absolute  truth 
 that  sounds  horrible  you  can  criticize
[144:22] me  all  you  want  but  it's  the  absolute 
 [ __ ]  truth  you  don't  want  to  sell  to 
 like  absolute  broke  people  because
[144:27] they're  the  worst  customers  by  far  you 
 want  us  like  the  more  expensive  your 
 product  can  be  simply  the  better  the
[144:34] customer  will  be  the  more  they'll  care 
 the  more  they'll  respect  you  the  the 
 higher  end  they  are  that  you  might  even 
 want  to  network  with  imagine  if  you  sell
[144:40] something  for  5K  for  10K  for  50k  for  25k 
 for  example  imagine  the  level  of
[144:46] difference  between  the  person  who  would 
 actually  be  interested  in  that  when  they 
 start  off  as  like  better  customers
[144:51] because  they  can  afford  your  more 
 expensive  product  they'll  care  more 
 they'll  invest  more  into  it  they'll  get
[144:56] better  results 
 when  they  get  better  results  you  get  to 
 Showcase  that  you  get  testimonials  which
[145:02] add  also  your  own  self-belief  about  your 
 own  program  your  package  goes  up  because 
 they've  got  great  results  and  so  you
[145:08] start  getting  conviction  which  is  the 
 most  important  part  of  sales  is  like  you 
 genuinely  believe  that  your  package  will
[145:13] work 
 so  it's  a  very  positive  feedback  loop 
 when  you  charge  higher  prices  now
[145:18] imagine  the  exact  opposite  now  imagine 
 we  decrease  our  price  we  start  with  a 
 very  low  price  then  you  attract  the
[145:25] worst  customers  the  most  demanding 
 customers  the  guys  who  won't  even  put  in 
 any  any  real  effort  because  they've
[145:30] barely  spent  any  money  so  they  don't  put 
 in  effort  because  they  didn't  invest 
 financially  they  don't  get  the  results
[145:37] and  then  they  blame  you  they  didn't  even 
 do  what  was  required  and  they'll 
 literally  blame  you
[145:42] and  now  instead  of  getting  testimonials 
 and  positive  reviews  you're  getting  hate
[145:47] hate  like  posts  and  you  know  people 
 saying  oh  yeah  I  bought  this  thing  for 
 seven  dollars  it  wasn't  even  worth  it
[145:52] guys  it's  just  the  scam  guys 
 you  don't  want  to  be  selling  to  those 
 people  and  also  if  we're  totally  honest
[145:57] you  don't  want  to  be  interacting  with 
 those  people  either  you  don't  want  to  be 
 interacting  with  the  kind  of  person 
 who's  sending  you  like  a  list  of
[146:02] questions  before  he  buys  for  something 
 for  like  ten  dollars  where  he's  like 
 autistically  trying  to  okay  so  is  it
[146:08] like  this  or  is  it  like  this  and  if  I 
 buy  it  like  this  like  you  don't  want  to 
 be  like  interacting  actually  spending 
 hours  of  your  day  with  those  kinds  of
[146:14] people  do  you  you're  an  entrepreneur  you 
 don't  want  to  be  like  serving  the  lowest 
 sort  of  financial  tiers  it's  just  the
[146:21] the  brutal  truth  of  the  world  this  will 
 offend  many  people  but  a  certain  like 
 the  entrepreneurs  and  like  a  certain
[146:26] class  of  of  people  of  intelligence  of  of 
 maturity  and  values  will  understand  what 
 I'm  getting  at  here  and  you'll  be
[146:31] thinking  like  thank  [ __ ]  actually  Hans 
 is  absolutely  right  here  like  the  more 
 expensive  I  can  sell  the  better  you  want
[146:36] to  have  like  gatekeep  some  of  like 
 access  to  you  you  don't  want  to  have
[146:41] just  any  one  of  like  the  the  lower 
 Financial  levels  to  be  able  to  buy  it
[146:46] because  often  they  are  the  worst  now 
 this  isn't  always  the  case  there's  a  guy
[146:51] in  India  who  makes  a  thousand  times  less 
 than  than  me  but  he's  a  better  person
[146:56] that  I  could  ever  imagine  to  be  of 
 course  there's  always  exceptions  to  this 
 but  in  general  money  does  rule  it  it
[147:02] really  does  it's  it's  not  so  much  that 
 you  know  money  makes  the  person  or 
 anything  it's  just  that  when  a  broke
[147:08] person  spends  like  whatever  pennies  they 
 have  it  becomes  a  headache  for  the 
 seller  who  has  to  like  deal  with  that
[147:14] customer  but  when  you  charge  hundreds  of 
 dollars  you've  just  taken  out  99  of  the
[147:19] population  they  can't  buy  it  anymore 
 guess  what  that  means
[147:25] you're  selling  to  the  one  percent 
 that's  better  you're  selling  to  like  the
[147:30] one  percent  of  young  men  let's  say  for 
 me  for  my  product  I'm  selling  for  the 
 one  percent  of  young  men  who  actually
[147:35] would  buy  like  an  educational  product 
 for  500  because  they  actually  think  it's 
 worth  it  if  I  made  my  product  like  I'd
[147:41] done  a  school  five  dollars  or  ten 
 dollars  or  twenty  dollars 
 imagine  that  the  kind  of  people  who
[147:47] would  flood  in  who  weren't  willing  to 
 spend  more  on  their  education  they'll
[147:52] certainly  there'll  be  a  percentage  of 
 those  new  people  who  come  in  who  like 
 actually  really  care  about  education  but 
 they  just  simply  couldn't  afford  it
[147:57] because  you  know  the  conversion  rates  of 
 currency  in  India  and  stuff  absolutely 
 but  most  of  the  people  who  would  join
[148:02] would  be  like  would  care  less  they'd 
 start  like  [ __ ]  posting  low  quality 
 posts  they  would  they'd  like  you  know
[148:08] watch  like  20  minutes  of  the  course  then 
 like  not  even  take  any  more  of  it  and 
 then  complain  that  their  YouTube  channel
[148:13] isn't  growing  with  like  my  YouTube 
 course  for  example  and  then  they'd  leave 
 bad  reviews  saying  yep  it  didn't  work
[148:18] it's  just  the  scam  guys  haha  like  you 
 can  just  find  it  online  for  free
[148:23] you  don't  want  to  be  selling  to  those 
 people  and  so  when  you  charge  high 
 prices  you  cut  them  off  way  better  the
[148:29] broke  14  year  olds  who  don't  understand 
 entrepreneurship  and  money  might  get 
 angry  at  you  and  this  is  something  I'm
[148:34] just  going  to  be  honest  with  you  when 
 you  do  charge  the  higher  prices  it  is 
 like  it's  so  unfortunate  that  the  game
[148:39] of  Entrepreneurship  is  so  hated  these 
 days  that  when  you  do  charge  the  higher 
 prices  especially  when  you're  like  an 
 influencer  if  you're  going  through  it
[148:45] about  like  you  know  these  sort  of 
 YouTube  routes 
 you  will  get  some  level  of  hate  you  will
[148:50] do  it's  always  like  sad  when  I  see  it 
 when  I'll  see  like  someone  will  just 
 comment  like  oh  yeah  a  scammer  you  can 
 you  know  you  don't  need  like  hamza's
[148:55] course  or  his  program  you  can  just  find 
 everything  online  it's  like  yeah  like 
 you  can  go  and  find  like  education  and
[149:00] information  about  any  topic  online  fine 
 go  ahead  but  like  isn't  your  biggest
[149:05] problem  in  life  your  content  consumption 
 anyway  isn't  your  biggest  problem  that 
 you  spend  like  four  hours  a  day  on
[149:11] YouTube  and  you're  just  watching  [ __ ]  to 
 your  like  content  if  I've  got  a  YouTube 
 course  yeah  you  can  go  and  learn  YouTube
[149:16] online  for  free  but  like  join  me  like  it 
 just  it  starts  that  like  play  on  you 
 absolutely  I'm  not  going  to  sugarcoat
[149:22] things  if  you  are  gonna  sell  as  like  an 
 influencer  a  YouTuber  Tick  Tock  or 
 whatever  and  you're  gonna  sell  at  high
[149:28] prices  you  will  get  people  who  complain 
 but  here's  the  thing  if  you  sold 
 anything
[149:33] for  one  dollar 
 you'd  get  people  who  complain  that  it 
 wasn't  for  free  let's  just  be  honest  99
[149:38] of  people  are  [ __ ]  losers  they're 
 gonna  try  and  pull  you  down  the  [ __ ] 
 crabs  in  the  bucket  they're  gonna  be
[149:44] they'll  literally  pull  you  down  and  keep 
 you  there  like  just  being  absolutely 
 broken  amongst  them  when  they  see  you
[149:51] hey  you  are  trying  to  be  an  entrepreneur 
 they  will  try  and  bring  you  down  they 
 will  question  it  and  be  like  oh  but  why
[149:56] don't  you  just  like  people  have  said 
 this  to  me  why  don't  you  just  make  your 
 business  for  free  why  don't  you  just 
 make  it  for  free  I'm  thinking  bro  the
[150:01] [ __ ]  YouTube  videos  are  free  what  are 
 you  on  about  I'm  sat  here  with  a  throat 
 that  [ __ ]  hurts  because  I've  been 
 recording  for  four  hours  today  this  is
[150:07] for  free  for  you 
 let  me  make  some  [ __ ]  money  there's  a
[150:12] product  which  I  can  like  if  I  sell  it  at 
 a  good  price 
 not  only  do  we  have  all  those  positives
[150:19] of  you  know  like  the  best  customers  come 
 in  they're  more  invested  so  they 
 actually  get  more  more  value  but  when
[150:24] that  product  makes  me  money  then  I 
 reinvest  back  into  it  and  then  I've 
 hired  teachers  and  coaches  and  more 
 moderators  and  everything  so  the  product
[150:30] gets  even  better 
 people  will  question  this  and  they  will 
 like  dislike  you  for  it  I'm  just  giving
[150:36] you  the  truth  and  this  is  something  that 
 like  it  doesn't  hurt  me  anywhere  near  as 
 much  as  it  used  to  but  this  used  to  be
[150:41] like  the  biggest  pain  that  I  had  in  this 
 entire  business  of  being  a  YouTuber  and 
 having  a  product  because  it  would  really
[150:47] get  to  me  when  people  would  write  like 
 little  words  like  you  know  a  14  year  old 
 saying  like  haha  he's  a  scammer  like  you
[150:52] can  just  watch  all  this  stuff  for  free 
 online  and  it  I'd  be  there  like  thinking 
 like  what  how  do  I  respond  to  this  I
[150:57] can't  be  the  big  YouTuber  who  responds 
 to  a  14  year  old  they're  trying  to  break 
 it  down  how  they're  a  [ __ ]  idiot 
 saying  like  yes  like  information  is
[151:04] readily  available  but  it  isn't  about  the 
 information  like  like  if  you  can  learn 
 it  for  Freedom  why  aren't  you  a  [ __ ]
[151:09] YouTuber  if  I've  got  this  YouTube  course 
 and  you're  saying  Oh  but  you  can  learn 
 it  for  free  why  aren't  you  like  why 
 aren't  you  growing  on  YouTube  then
[151:14] because  it's  more  than  just  finding  it 
 for  free  on  YouTube  or  it's  a  scam 
 because  you  can  just  get  it  for  free 
 like  it  it  rarely  got  to  me  for  a  good
[151:20] few  years  it  does  a  lot  less  now  I  think 
 just  because  of  like  exposure 
 intolerance  but  if  you're  quite  new  to
[151:26] this  I  really  do  want  to  just  give  you 
 this  slight  like  sort  of  mental 
 preparation  to  get  ready  but  get  warmed
[151:32] up  for  this  [ __ ]  because  when  you  do 
 open  the  floodgates  and  you  do  announce 
 it  by  the  way  I've  got  this  product  and 
 I'm  going  to  be  selling  it  to  my
[151:37] followers 
 let's  say  90  of  people  will  see  it  and 
 think  I'm  not  really  interested  nine
[151:44] percent  of  people  will  literally  start 
 to  dislike  you  for  it  because  people 
 just  dislike  someone  else  making  money
[151:50] these  days  it's  just  the  sad  truth  of  it 
 and  it's  even  even  young  men  which  which 
 sadded  me  because  I'm  just  thinking  like
[151:56] how  do  you  not  think  that  this  is  cool 
 how  do  you  not  look  at  it  and  like 
 instead  of  hating  the  like  the  game  or
[152:02] the  player  of  the  game  why  don't  you 
 look  at  it  and  think  oh  damn  that's 
 that's  a  pretty  good  way  to  make  money
[152:07] like  I'm  not  gonna  buy  it  but  like  I'm 
 just  kind  of  smart  with  this  okay  he's 
 done  that  okay  he's  done  that  I  might 
 try  so  I  might  learn  the  lesson  there
[152:13] like  nine  percent  of  people  will  just  be 
 the  haters  and  one  percent  of  people 
 your  loyal  fans  they'll  buy  it  the  one
[152:20] percent  of  people  they'll  buy  it 
 whatever  price  it  is  they'll  buy  it 
 you're  selling  to  them  don't  think  about
[152:26] the  90  who  aren't  really  interested 
 don't  think  about  the  nine  percent  who 
 might  be  like  the  haters  you  think  only
[152:32] about  the  one  percent  and  what  they're 
 willing  because  they're  literally  there 
 thinking  oh  man  another  day  where
[152:37] they've  stepped  on  a  scale  and  the 
 weights  gone  high  and  they  really  wish 
 there  was  a  solution  to  this  problem 
 they've  got  2K  or  3K  sat  in  the  bank
[152:43] right  now  they're  just  kind  of  saving  it 
 up  for  like  no  clear  reason  if  you  were 
 going  to  guarantee  them  that  forever
[152:49] their  problem  of  like  weight  loss  was 
 going  to  be  fixed  they'd  be  thinking  you 
 know  they'd  be  scared  of  spending  that 
 much  but  they'd  be  thinking  you  know
[152:54] what 
 it's  actually  kind  of  worth  it  and  I 
 really  like  this  guy  I  really  trust  him 
 I  might  do  it
[153:00] they're  who  you  want  to  sell  to  those 
 are  the  people  that  you  can  actually 
 really  help  you  can  change  their  lives
[153:08] and 
 if  we're  being  totally  honest  which  is 
 absolutely  okay  you  need  to  be  motivated
[153:14] for  it  and  so  when  that  person  transfers 
 you  over  3  000  pounds  for  your  fitness
[153:20] program  where  you're  gonna  go  on  to  a 
 daily  call  with  them  to  make  sure  that 
 they  don't  eat  any  [ __ ]  food  or  anything
[153:25] you're  gonna  care  because  you're 
 thinking  [ __ ]  me  they  just  gave  me 
 thousands  of  dollars  I  used  to  like  I
[153:30] needed  to  work  for  about  two  months  to 
 make  that 
 I'm  gonna  make  sure  this  this  fat
[153:35] [ __ ]  loses  weight  right  you're 
 gonna  you're  gonna  really  care  about 
 them  you're  gonna  like  make  like  you  see
[153:40] the  Habit  tracker  I've  got  there  this  is 
 like  my  for  my  own  one  right  right  there 
 this  um  this  one  here  yeah  so  this  is  my
[153:46] own  like  habit  I  take  them  off  you're 
 gonna  make  one  for  your  client  thinking 
 okay  I've  got  to  make  sure  he  ticks
[153:51] these  habits  off  you're  gonna  message 
 him  at  like  7pm  I'm  like  have  you  done 
 that  thing  no  no  do  it  do  it  do  it  do  it 
 do  it  call  him  like  no  no  what  are  you
[153:57] doing  resting  bro  just  do  it  for  five 
 minutes  come  on  like  you're  literally 
 like  pressing  them  because  you  want  to 
 get  them  the  result  because  they've  paid
[154:03] you  a  lot  this  makes  you  a  way  better 
 entrepreneur  because  you're  actually 
 getting  results  and  that's  what  I  want
[154:08] for  you  I'm  super  interested  about  your 
 thoughts  of  this  last  section  especially 
 about  the  concept  of  charging  higher
[154:13] prices  but  then  some  people  might  kind 
 of  like  hate  you  for  that  what  do  you  do
[154:18] with  the  haters  like  what's  your  opinion 
 on  that  if  you  go  and  comment  that  right 
 now  I  just  be  like  what  I'm  interested
[154:23] to  see  but  of  course  too  if  you  do  that 
 the  YouTube  algorithm  will  promote  this 
 video  so  it's  like  a  win-win  I'll  be
[154:28] reading  some  of  the  comments  so  I'm  just 
 very  interested  like  how  are  you  gonna 
 cope  with  it  when  you  do  see  a  comment
[154:33] from  someone  saying  like  oh  yeah  he's  a 
 scammer  what  are  you  gonna  do  it's  very 
 like  it's  a  very  powerful  practice  to  um
[154:40] think  about  the  bad  things  that  could 
 happen  you  know  the  obstacles  that  could 
 arise  and  how  you'd  overcome  them  it's  a
[154:45] very  powerful  practice  doing  that  so 
 this  can  just  be  your  practice  of 
 thinking  okay  but  I  do  get  some  kind  of 
 hater  or  someone  who's  like  complaining
[154:51] saying  like  oh  my  business  isn't  for 
 free  that  I'm  not  working  for  free 
 what  am  I  going  to  do  how  would  I
[154:58] respond  would  I  respond  would  I  reply  to 
 their  comments  what  would  I  do  go 
 comment  your  answer  to  that  below  right
[155:03] now  step  7  getting  customers  now  we  have 
 a  package  that's  ready  to  sell  but  we
[155:08] need  to  actually  get  the  customers  who 
 are  interested  in  our  package  and 
 there's  four  ways  that  you  can  get
[155:14] customers 
 there's  only  really  one  way  that  is
[155:19] worth  it  in  my  opinion  from  you  and  for 
 most  of  the  guys  watching  this  like  for
[155:24] my  younger  self  there's  only  one  way 
 that  I  would  recommend  but  there  is  four 
 ways  you can  get  customers  and  they  are
[155:29] warm  Outreach  warm  Outreach  is  where  you 
 message  people  that  you  know
[155:34] so  straight  away  like  this  just  seems 
 cringe  to  me  because  it's  imagine 
 messaging  like  your  old  high  school
[155:39] friends  on  on  Instagram  if  they  want  to 
 buy  this  package  that  you've  set  for  a 
 few  thousand  dollars  like
[155:45] Joe  I  mean  if  like  if  you're  a 
 professional  and  you're  30  years  old  and 
 you  know  loads  of  business  men  okay  fair
[155:50] enough  but  if  you're  like  a  young  guy 
 and  you  only  know  like  other  young  guys 
 I  don't  think  warm  Outreach  the  people
[155:55] you  know  is  gonna  like  work  so  well  you 
 could  try  and  you  know  message  the 
 people  that  you  know  who  are  the  most
[156:01] successful  maybe  the  head  teacher  of 
 your  school  but  again  it's  like  it's 
 still  a  little  bit  like  there's  quite  a 
 lot  of  friction  and  almost  embarrassment
[156:07] for  most  young  guys  to  consider  that  the 
 second  is  cold  Outreach  that's  where  you
[156:12] message  people  that  you  don't  know  maybe 
 you  try  and  find  like  random  phone 
 numbers  online  or  email  addresses  or
[156:17] message  random  people  on  Instagram  and 
 pretty  much  say  like  oh  hey  bro  wanna 
 you  wanna  buy  my  my  things  for  like  it
[156:24] can  work  and  people  do  get  a  good  level 
 of  success  with  it  but  it's  not  what  I 
 would  recommend  and  the  third  is  paid
[156:31] ads  that's  where  you'll  go  on  to 
 websites  like  for  example  YouTube  Google 
 Instagram  and  on  those  platforms  you
[156:38] could  pay  like  you  can  pay  the  platform 
 to  put  your  advert  in  front  of  people 
 this  means  that  you're  going  to  be
[156:43] paying  25  50  a  hundred  dollars  per  day 
 to  get  your  like  advert  scene  in  front
[156:49] of  other  people  and  you'll  need  to  learn 
 the  skill  of  like  how  to  actually  get 
 the  ROI  which  is  quite  difficult  and
[156:55] it's  going  to  require  quite  a  lot  of 
 upfront  money  if  you  could  spend  50  or 
 100  every  single  day  then  this  could  be
[157:01] something  you'd  consider  but  most  young 
 guys  can't  do  that  and  so  in  my  opinion 
 we  are  left  with  actually  the  best  way
[157:06] to  get  customers  which  is  to  post  free 
 content  and  to  build  up  an  audience
[157:12] that's  exactly  what  I've  done  here  which 
 is  the  business  model  so  I  actually  feel 
 very  strong  in  teaching  you  this  because
[157:17] you  can  see  this  like  on  my  channel  I've 
 built  up  an  audience  of  two  million  guys 
 and  then  it's  just  those  same  guys  that
[157:22] I  mentioned  my  product  to  this  is  in  my 
 opinion  the  single  greatest  way  to  to 
 get  customers  in  this  modern  day  because
[157:28] not  only  do  you  get  the  customers  but 
 you  also  build  the  loyal  audience  which 
 is  genuinely  the  most  valuable  asset
[157:34] that  you  could  accumulate  in  business 
 plus  just  think  about  the  scale  imagine 
 being  a  completely  new  YouTuber  is  it
[157:41] absolutely  unreasonable  to  think  that  a 
 new  guy  who's  you  know  posting  his  first 
 few  videos  would  get  a  hundred  views  on
[157:47] a  YouTube  video  is  that  unreasonable 
 like  crazy  like  not  really  most  guys 
 will  probably  only  get  like  10  views  on
[157:52] the  first  video  that's  fine  but  it's  not 
 crazy  to  think  that  you  get  a  hundred 
 right 
 well  to  match  that  you'd  need  to  go  and
[157:59] send  out  a  hundred  messages  or  a  hundred 
 DMS  when  you  really  think  about  like  how
[158:04] tedious  it  would  be  going  on  Instagram 
 and  sending  everyone  a  message  going 
 like  you  know  calling  a  hundred  people
[158:09] and  not  even  knowing  like  who  the  [ __ ] 
 they  are  sending  emails  it's  like  it 
 seems  kind  of  quick  but  you  could 
 imagine  sending  every  cold  email
[158:15] actually  takes  like  five  ten  minutes 
 whereas  you  could  record  a  video  where 
 you  just  talk  about  you  know  some  topic
[158:22] like  oh  hey  guys  I  just  discovered  this 
 new  weight  loss  trick  which  is  really 
 really  good  you  know  this  is  all  you  do 
 you  take  a  picture  of  your  meal  and  I
[158:28] actually  literally  that's  all  you  have 
 to  do  is  just  take  a  picture  of 
 everything  you  eat  and  automatically
[158:33] you'll  end  up  losing  more  weight  than 
 usual  just  because  you're  way  more  held 
 accountable  to  it  and  if  you  even  send
[158:38] that  picture  to  someone  else  then  you 
 know  you'll  lose  even  more  weight 
 because  of  the  accountability  and 
 everything  and  by  the  way  I've  got  a
[158:43] fitness  course  just  go  click  on  the  top 
 Link  in  the  description  boom  it's  not 
 unreasonable  to  think  that  you'd  get  100
[158:48] views  in  a  social  media  post 
 maybe  a  thousand
[158:53] now  we  can  say  I'm  kind  of  like  a 
 professional  here  and  I've  been  doing 
 this  and  practicing  this  for  a  few  years
[158:58] and  maybe  I  got  lucky  in  some  areas  but 
 how  many  views  does  this  video  have  I've 
 mentioned  my  product  a  few  times  in  this
[159:03] video 
 look  at  the  views  of  this  video  imagine 
 if  I  had  to  message  that  many  people  so
[159:09] you  can  see  that  posting  content  gives 
 you  a  huge  number  of  people  that  you  can 
 reach  out  to  so  we'll  choose  this  as  our
[159:15] path  to  getting  customers  so  what  we're 
 going  to  do  is  we're  going  to  post  onto 
 a  social  media  that  we  can  learn  to
[159:21] master  over  time  and  this  is  where  we 
 need  to  decide  okay  well  Which  social 
 media  should  we  get  good  at  is  just
[159:26] telling  me  to  be  a  YouTuber  but  Tick 
 Tock  is  doing  really  well  right  now 
 isn't  it  and  Alex  Mosey  says  that
[159:31] Twitter  is  really  good  so  maybe  we 
 should  do  Twitter  and  you  know  maybe 
 you're  bouncing  around  which  one  which 
 social  media  platform  should  you  do  what
[159:37] I  recommend  is  what  I've  learned  from 
 another  entrepreneur  named  Dan  Co  and  he 
 said  first  figure  out  if  you  want  to
[159:43] speak  or  write  so  I'd  ask  you  this  do 
 you  want  to  be  a  speaker  like  I'm 
 speaking  right  now  perhaps  being  on
[159:49] camera  or  maybe  would  you  enjoy  typing 
 words  on  a  keyboard  instead  which  one
[159:54] would  you  enjoy  more  which  one  would  you 
 actually  like  want  to  do  more  as  hard  as 
 it  is  to  like  you  know  set  up  recording
[160:00] and  speak  for  an  hour  or  two  hours  or 
 three  hours  straight  I  actually  have 
 more  fun  doing  this  that  I  would  just
[160:06] typing  and  bashing  my  like  another 
 keyboard  and  so  this  is  what  I've  chosen 
 so  speak  or  write  which  one  would  you
[160:12] rather  do  once  you  have  your  idea  then 
 we  choose  the  social  media  platform 
 based  on  which  skill  that  we  want  to
[160:18] level  up  for  speaking  there's  podcasts 
 YouTube  maybe  Tick  Tock  if  you  want  to
[160:23] make  like  educational  content  on  there 
 and  if  you  want  to  write  then  Twitter  is 
 probably  the  best  place  in  general  if
[160:29] you're  trying  to  figure  out  which  social 
 media  you  should  post  on  the  easiest 
 answer  is  like  just  post  on  the  one  that
[160:34] you  consume  on  Chances  Are  YouTube  is 
 probably  like  your  most  popular  social 
 media  that  you're  watching  on  right  now
[160:39] it's  the  one  that  you  spend  your  most 
 time  on  just  post  on  that  you  understand 
 it  you  know  how  it  works  you  see  which
[160:46] videos  do  quite  well  you  see  like  the 
 creators  who  have  got  a  certain  style 
 and  you  see  the  trends  and  and  the  hot
[160:52] topics  so  just  go  with  the  one  that  you 
 actually  spend  your  time  consuming  a 
 quick  powerful  tip  once  you  have  chosen
[160:58] whether  you're  gonna  speak  or  write 
 the  single  highest  Roi  activity  that  you
[161:06] could  do  in  your  entire  business  like 
 the  single  most  powerful  activity  you
[161:12] could  do 
 in  work 
 is  to  level  up  either  the  skill  of
[161:18] speaking  or  writing 
 because  with  everything  that  we've 
 covered  with  making  money  we've  talked
[161:24] about  you  know  the  package  and  the 
 problems  and  solutions  everything  like 
 that
[161:29] the  most  powerful  leverage  that  we  have 
 right  now  is  social  media  if  you  can  pop
[161:34] off  on  social  media  that  is  the  single 
 like  greatest  thing  that  could  happen  to 
 you  in  like  a  business  sense  might  not
[161:40] be  good  for  your  mental  health  it 
 probably  won't  be  but  for  business  it 
 will  be  really  good  and  so  the  single
[161:45] greatest  thing  you  could  do  to  pop  up  on 
 social  media  is  not  to  just  like  try  and 
 get  lucky  or  some  [ __ ]  but  it's 
 rather  to  think  okay  I  chose  to  speak  on
[161:52] YouTube  then  you  just  level  up  your 
 speaking  skill  you  go  and  get  books  on 
 speaking  or  for  example  if  you  wrote  if
[161:58] you  chose  writing  then  you'll  get  books 
 on  writing  you  go  search  for  a  speaking 
 coach  or  a  writing  coach  depending  on
[162:03] with  social  media  you've  chosen  and 
 you'd  literally  just  level  it  up  for 
 speaking  there's  also  storytelling  so
[162:08] for  example  I  have  a  speaking  coach  and 
 also  a  storytelling  coach  and  now  my 
 videos  are  doing  better  than  ever  so
[162:13] this  is  what  you  do  to  get  customers  you 
 start  your  own  social  media  profile  okay 
 you've  made  your  YouTube  channel  or  your
[162:19] Twitter  account  then  what  you  do  is  you 
 post  free  content  so  you  write  tweets 
 maybe  threads  or  you  post  YouTube  videos
[162:25] where  all  you're  thinking  about  you're 
 not  trying  to  grow  an  audience  you're 
 not  trying  to  get  views  all  you're
[162:31] trying  to  think  of  is  I  want  to  give  as 
 good  advice  as  possible  to  my  dream
[162:37] customer  remember  like  the  dream  Avatar 
 the  kind  of  person  we're  trying  to  help 
 all  you're  thinking  about  is  just  trying
[162:43] to  help  them  as  much  as  possible  and 
 working  super  hard  at  that  I  want  you  to 
 really  think  right  now  like  this  video
[162:49] that  you're  watching  think  about  how 
 hard  and  difficult  this  video  is  for 
 hours  I've  been  speaking  I've  had  to 
 take  breaks  because  my  throat  literally
[162:55] hurts  my  brain  feels  like  not  very  foggy 
 but  quite  like  weirdly  heavy  right  now 
 because  of  how  how  I  can't  even  speak
[163:02] properly  like  do  you  literally  see  hear 
 me  stuttering  as  I  try  and  explain  to 
 you  how  hard  I've  worked  for  this  and 
 think  about  this  now  this  video  is  going
[163:08] to  make  a  fair  amount  of  money  on 
 AdSense  and  everything  but  really  just 
 think  about  my  intention  here
[163:14] it's  to  help  you 
 it's  to  get  you  insane  results  because
[163:20] if  this  video  can  be  so  good  that  you 
 literally  follow  it  and  actually  make 
 some  money  in  real  life  you're  going  to
[163:26] like  me  right  you're  actually  gonna  like 
 really  really  like  me  you  might  even 
 send  this  video  to  a  few  people
[163:33] when  you  end  up  speaking  to  someone 
 maybe  even  six  months  from  now  maybe 
 five  years  from  now  you  might  even  end
[163:38] up  telling  them  oh  you  should  watch 
 hamza's  money  guide  that's  how  I  started 
 maybe  you'll  be  like  it's  like  famous  in
[163:44] a  year  from  now  mentioning  the  start  of 
 like  your  business  was  when  you  watched 
 hamza's  money  guide  and  this  video  keeps
[163:49] popping  off  more  and  more  and  more  and 
 more  and  maybe  if  you  wanted  more 
 support  because  you  liked  me  because  you
[163:55] know  this  video  has  helped  you  because 
 you  trusted  me  because  my  advice  worked 
 for  you
[164:00] you'd  see  that  the  one  program  that  I 
 sell  at  Donna's  School  you'd  look  at  it
[164:05] and  think  damn  I  can  actually  afford  it 
 now 
 I  mean  if  his  video  worked  I  wonder  what
[164:12] his  online  school  would  be  like 
 and  then  you  might  consider  buying  it 
 that's  the  exact  process  that  we  want
[164:18] you  to  follow  you  make  super  helpful 
 content  like  the  greatest  kind  of 
 content  the  most  helpful  content  that
[164:24] you  could  think  of  you  know  for  your 
 dream  customers  problems  so  for  example 
 if  we're  in  the  fitness  Niche  we're
[164:29] thinking  okay  these  fatties  are 
 struggling  with  losing  weight  and  why 
 because  they've  got  all  those  remember 
 that  massive  problem  list  they've  got
[164:35] all  those  problems  like  oh  but  you  know 
 I  don't  even  know  how  to  sign  up  to  the 
 gym 
 then  we  just  make  a  piece  of  content
[164:42] titled  how  to  sign  up  to  the  gym 
 complete  beginner's  guide 
 and  there's  someone  who's  going  to  see
[164:48] that  as  a  title  and  be  like  wait  that's 
 [ __ ]  perfect  that's  exactly  what  I 
 they're  fat  as  [ __ ]  that's  exactly  what
[164:53] I  needed  if  this  guy's  got  a  workout 
 routine  I  might  end  up  buying  it  you 
 want  to  know  why  most  people  struggle  at
[164:58] this  point  and  they  never  get  any  growth 
 on  social  media 
 because  they're  obsessed  with  the  growth
[165:04] is  the  guy  who's  obsessed  with  the  girl 
 who's  needy  for  the  girl  is  he  gonna  get
[165:09] her 
 probably  not  right  you  understand  this 
 as  young  men  we've  we've  really  been
[165:14] hearing  this  message  recently  like  being 
 needy  for  girls  is  a  bad  thing  not  right 
 but  most  most  little  YouTubers  that  I
[165:21] speak  to  they  are  needy  for  subs  and 
 Views  they're  like  little  [ __ ]  for 
 like  views  they'll  do  anything  for  a
[165:27] little  a  new  view  or  a  like 
 the  issue  is  that  people  can  see  that 
 like  the  viewer  can  see  that  they  can
[165:33] see  that  this  guy  is  too  needy  and  it's 
 just  kind  of  repulsive  he's  making  like 
 whatever  video  he  can  possibly  try  and
[165:39] get  some  views  on  it's  not  nice  for  the 
 viewer  to  see  that  what  you  want  to  do 
 is  give  the  best  most  effective  advice
[165:46] that  you  can  to  that  population  that 
 you're  trying  to  help  the  dream  customer
[165:52] the  Avatar  that  you've  been  thinking  of 
 and  you  can  just  go  down  your  problems 
 list  and  literally  just  make  a  bunch  of
[165:57] content  just  aimed  at  them  when  these 
 potential  customers  of  yours  stumble
[166:02] upon  your  content  and  it  actually  helps 
 them  get  results  not  like  some  random
[166:07] [ __ ]  little  shallow  video  like  most 
 like  creators  you  know  new  people  will
[166:12] be  making  think  about  how  different  this 
 video  is  that  you're  watching  compared 
 to  like  the  videos  like  I'm  used  to  make
[166:17] and  I  could  be  making  right  now  the  top 
 seven  ways  to  make  money  online
[166:22] videos  that  are  helping  no  one 
 but  if  you  literally  imagine  if  you 
 literally  make  a  few  hundred  dollars  by
[166:28] following  this  guide  that  I've  put 
 together  over  like  hours  of  brain 
 numbing  studying  and  journaling  and
[166:33] thinking  and  everything  right 
 when  you  make  the  few  hundred  dollars 
 and  you  see  that  I've  got  a  program  that
[166:39] I  sell  and  my  advice  on  a  YouTube  video 
 has  worked  you  might  be  interested  in 
 actually  buying  from  me  this  is  how  you
[166:46] make  money  from  social  media  you  first 
 literally  get  people  results  just
[166:51] through  your  content  which  means  that 
 your  content  like  the  advice  you  give 
 needs  to  be  powerful  it  needs  to  be 
 actually  right  it  means  that  you  hold
[166:57] nothing  back  you  give  all  your  gifts 
 you're  all  all  your  understanding  the 
 best  like  teaching  that  you  can  do  and
[167:03] then  when  they  realize  that  your  stuff 
 works  and  that  you've  got  some  kind  of 
 paid  product  people  are  very  interested
[167:09] in  that  because  it's  it  kind  of  like 
 people  aren't  stupid  like  if  your  advice 
 works  for  them  and  they've  seen  that  it
[167:15] works  they  automatically  assume  like 
 okay  well  I  can  follow  this  guy  and  I 
 can  afford  that  thing  now  I'll  probably
[167:22] buy  it  there's  a  very  powerful  mindset 
 here  that  I  got  from  Alex  hamosi  give 
 away  the  secrets  sell  the  implementation
[167:29] think  about  this  video  here 
 I  genuinely  could  have  sold  as  a
[167:34] thousand  dollar  course  really  could  have 
 like  let's  just  give  me  like  a  little 
 bit  of  credit  there  I  genuinely  could
[167:39] have  made  this  into  a  thousand  dollar 
 course  and  if  I  just  sold  it  passively 
 it  would  have  added  about  10  20  30  000  a
[167:45] month  to  my  monthly  income  which  would 
 have  been  nice  right 
 but  20  people  a  month  would  have  bought
[167:51] it  30  people  a  month  would  have  been 
 helped  by  it 
 again  look  at  the  views
[167:56] so  I'm  sacrificing  like  let's  say  20  or 
 30  000  a  month  by  just  making  this  video
[168:01] and  putting  it  out  there  instead  of  just 
 making  it  a  thousand  dollars  in  people 
 like  you  know  10  20  30  people  would
[168:06] actually  buy  it  per  month  right 
 I'm  sacrificing  like  thirty  thousand 
 dollars  up  front
[168:12] but  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  are 
 going  to  be  helped  by  this  but  probably 
 Millions  let's  say  after  a  few  years
[168:18] this  is  gonna  have  a  few  million  views 
 I'm  quite  sure  of  it 
 of  those  few  million  people  let's  say
[168:25] just  one  hundred  thousand  actually  get 
 some  kind  of  like  positive  results  in 
 real  life
[168:31] and  of  those  100 
 000 
 let's  say  one  thousand  their  lives
[168:36] changed  forever  because  of  this  guide 
 which  isn't  like  totally  crazy  right  if 
 this  got  a  million  views  we  could
[168:41] imagine  that  for  1  000  people  of  that 
 million  their  lives  changed 
 significantly  like  forever  because  of
[168:47] this  guy  because  of  what  they've  learned 
 and  and  you  know  kind  of  like  set  the 
 motion  to  change  their  life  with  making
[168:52] money  and  Financial  Freedom  and 
 everything  right  when  those  people  make 
 500  and  they  see  my  programs  five
[168:58] hundred  dollars 
 they'd  buy  it 
 now  I  sacrificed  about  30k  a  month  let's
[169:03] say  but  when  the  thousand  people  spend 
 five  hundred  dollars  and  I've  just  made 
 half  a  million
[169:11] DC 
 I'm  giving  away  the  secret  in  such  a
[169:16] powerful  way  that  has  hooked  your 
 attention  that  is  growing  my  audience 
 that  is  spreading  this  powerful  word  of
[169:21] mouth  because  people  are  like  holy  [ __ ] 
 comes  as  this  video  is  really  powerful 
 and  the  thousand  people  or  so  who  really
[169:27] like  go  ahead  and  take  advantage  of  this 
 video  of  the  advice  that  I've  given  here 
 who  really  take  the  steps  seriously
[169:34] we'll  they'll  go  ahead  and  buy  my 
 program  which  means  that  although  I 
 could  have  made  30  000  a  month  by
[169:40] selling  this 
 I'm  going  to  actually  make  about  half  a 
 million  from  this  video  alone
[169:48] I  just  have  to  wait  about  five  years  for 
 it 
 half  a  million  I've  just  added  for  30
[169:54] year  old  or  31  year  old  me 
 because  I've  just  worked  on  this  for  the 
 last  two  days  think  about  that
[170:01] powerful  isn't  it  you  want  to  know  how  I 
 got  there 
 give  away  the  secrets
[170:07] you  can  you  can  probably  hopefully  tell 
 I'm  not  holding  any  anything  back  now
[170:12] there's  certainly  like  things  that  I 
 sell  which  would  maybe  add  on  to  this 
 you  know  it's  inside  of  a  Donna  school 
 and  stuff  but  you  can  tell  that  I'm  not
[170:17] sat  here  thinking  oh  no  I  won't  teach 
 them  that  thing  because  you  know  that's 
 something  we've  got  inside  of  a  donor
[170:22] School  my  mindset  is  that  I  know  that 
 this  guide  will  only  actually  go  viral 
 if  I  make  it  as  good  as  possible  with  no
[170:28] holding  back  so  every  secret  that  I  know 
 about  making  money  is  here  I'm  not 
 getting  scared  with  this  idea  of  like  oh
[170:34] but  what  if  like  they  they  use  it  and 
 then  they  don't  need  to  buy  my  product 
 you  know  what  if  they  I  give  them  the
[170:39] really  good  advice  and  then  they  use  it 
 what  if  you  give  them  bad  advice  and
[170:45] then  no  one  uses  it  and  then  no  one  even 
 likes  your  content  and  then  no  one 
 spreads  it  or  if  anything  when  people
[170:50] mention  your  content  they  say  ah  it's 
 crap  it's  like  it's  just  a  waste  of  time 
 when  you  give  away  the  secrets  in  your 
 content  and  you  hold  nothing  back  you
[170:56] just  try  and  give  as  much  of  your 
 valuable  knowledge  that  you  know 
 what  happens  is  that  99  of  the  viewers
[171:04] they  weren't  gonna  buy  your  product 
 anyway  and  they're  still  not  gonna  buy 
 it  but  those  99  will  now  actually  like
[171:11] you  and  you  know  feel  in  some  ways  like 
 indebted  to  you  that  they  can't  help  but
[171:16] to  mention  your  content  to  other  people 
 that's  what  causes  growth  that's  what
[171:22] causes  growth  let  me  just  give  a  quick 
 tip  to  all  of  the  YouTubers  out  there
[171:27] just  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  about  the 
 algorithm  just  like  so  many  guys  are
[171:32] obsessed  with  it  the  algorithm 
 click-through  rate  all  of  this  literally 
 just  forget  about  that  and  just  think  to
[171:37] yourself  let  me  make  a  video  that's  so 
 good  that  the  viewers  will  just  be 
 sharing  it  more  and  more  and  more
[171:43] literally  just  like  make  yourself 
 believe  that  the  only  way  that  you  could 
 get  new  viewers  and  new  subscribers  is
[171:50] if  your  current  viewers  however  small 
 that  amount  is  it's  only  if  those 
 current  viewers  shared  your  video
[171:57] so  your  video  has  to  be  so  good  that  the 
 limited  amount  of  people  who  see  it 
 right  now  are  sharing  it  to  others
[172:04] everyone's  trying  to  play  this  game  and 
 it's  always  so  [ __ ]  embarrassing 
 seeing  like  this  entire  space  of
[172:09] YouTubers  trying  to  grow  and  getting 
 like  look  at  the  metrics  of  like 
 click-through  rate  watch  time  click 
 through  late  watch  that  and  I'm  like  bro
[172:14] just  shut  up  and  just  treat  like  the 
 algorithm  is  just  people  just  treat  them 
 like  people  just  like  make  the  humans
[172:20] who  watch  your  video  so  impressed  that 
 they  just  keep  sharing  it  they  can't 
 stop  mentioning  it  if  you  stop  making  it
[172:26] like  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  money  after  this 
 video  you're  going  to  mention  this 
 you're  gonna  mention  it  because  if  it's
[172:31] helped  you  it  will  probably  help  like 
 this  friend  that  you  end  up  meeting  who 
 probably  don't  want  to  walk  someone
[172:36] through  a  five-hour  conversation  you  can 
 just  send  them  the  link  to  this  video 
 knowing  that  it  worked  for  you  and  it's
[172:41] going  to  work  for  your  future  friends 
 and  if  it  works  for  them  and  you  and  you 
 sort  of  introduce  them  to  something  of 
 value  then  they  accredited  that  value  to
[172:47] you  and  your  status  goes  up  so  it's  a 
 win-win-win  situation  because  of  how
[172:52] good  this  guide  actually  is  now  there's 
 going  to  be  some  insecure  people  who 
 don't  like  the  way  that  I'm  speaking
[172:57] thinking  like  oh  well  you  shouldn't  be 
 saying  good  things  about  yourself 
 because  that  makes  me  feel  even  more 
 secure  they  can  go  [ __ ]  themselves  I
[173:02] know  that  this  is  a  good  guide  you  know 
 the  that  this  is  a  good  guide  you 
 wouldn't  have  put  hours  of  your  time  to
[173:07] watch  this  you  need  this  level  of  like 
 arrogance  to  think  like  this  is  some 
 good  content  that  I've  made  like  all  the
[173:13] little  rubbish  pieces  of  like  content 
 videos  that  I've  I've  watched  so  far 
 they  can't  compare  with  this
[173:19] do  you  see  this  conviction 
 so  now  I  will  go  and  share  my  own  videos
[173:25] I  will  go  and  promote  them  and  I  will 
 like  I'm  going  to  tell  you  to  share  this 
 to  other  people  when  you  meet  someone
[173:30] who  needs  to  make  money  tell  them  just 
 send  them  here  you  don't  need  to  walk 
 them  through  a  five-hour  step-by-step
[173:35] process  I've  set  it  here  when  you 
 introduce  them  to  this  and  it  works  for 
 them  you've  got  another  friend  who's
[173:41] actually  making  money  that  you  can 
 travel  with  now
[173:46] see  how  powerful  this  is 
 I  have  spent  the  last  few  days  making 
 this  and  you  will  share  this  for  me
[173:53] growing  my  business  for  the  next  few 
 years  simply  because  this  guide  is  so
[173:58] good  that  it's  helped  you  and  you 
 literally  just  want  it  to  help  other 
 people  that  you  care  about  you're
[174:03] literally  going  to  help  me  grow  my 
 business  and  I'm  not  even  like  paying 
 you  for  it
[174:09] that's  the  power  when  you  give  away  the 
 secrets  and  you  really  put  in  the  work
[174:14] other  people  will  literally  help  you 
 grow  your  business  for  free  then  the 
 second  part  of  this  is  sell  the
[174:19] implementation  so  it's  give  away  the 
 secrets  sell  the  implementation  we  make
[174:24] content  where  we  literally  just  think  to 
 ourselves  I'm  gonna  expose  everything  in 
 this  Niche  like  you  know  how  to  lose
[174:29] weight  I'm  gonna  make  a  full 
 step-by-step  guide  which  has  got  so  much 
 detail  and  like  I'm  I'm  gonna  make  all
[174:34] the  you  see  the  um  habit  trackers  and 
 everything  else  like  I'm  just  going  to 
 give  as  much  resources  as  much  great
[174:40] advice  as  possible  walk  someone  through 
 this  problem  step  by  step 
 you  give  away  the  secrets  and  then  what
[174:46] you  do  is  your  paid  program  the  package 
 a  lot  of  that  is  about  the 
 implementation  because  90  something
[174:52] percent  of  people  they'll  watch  the 
 video  but  they  won't  actually  take
[174:57] action  on  it  it's  just  the  the  shame  of 
 like  the  DIY  you  know  do  it  yourself 
 like  this  video  is  a  do-it-yourself  a
[175:03] course  is  like  do  it  yourself  in  the 
 case  that  like  the  Creator  just  kind  of 
 makes  it  and  then  he's  out  of  the
[175:08] picture  then  it's  up  to  you  the  consumer 
 to  use  it  90  of  people  have  already  like
[175:13] literally  the  point  that  we're  on  in 
 this  video  95  of  people  have  already 
 clicked  off  you're  genuinely  in  the  top
[175:19] five  percent  of  like  people's  attention 
 spans  and  commitment  to  this
[175:24] that  means  that  barely  five  percent  of 
 people  actually  genuinely  like  use  the
[175:29] content  and  see  results  it's  just  the 
 way  that  it  is 
 now  the  idea  is  that  for  the  guys  who
[175:34] use  it  and  Who  start  you  know  seeing 
 some  kind  of  results  and  start  trusting 
 the  Creator
[175:40] a  lot  of  them  will  want  extra  help  with 
 it  a  lot  of  them  will  want  guidance  on
[175:45] how  to  implement  what  they've  just 
 learned  you  want  to  give  all  the 
 education  away  for  free  but  you  want  to
[175:51] be  available  there  with  your  package  if 
 anyone  wants  like  your  intensive  extra 
 help  and  that's  exactly  what  my  program
[175:57] is  this  is  exactly  what  I'm  suggesting 
 to  you  I'm  telling  you  literally  just 
 like  you  can  see  it's  working  for  me
[176:03] copy  it  make  super  super  helpful  videos 
 that  really  just  help  a  bunch  of  people
[176:08] that  you  know  it's  like  just  free 
 education  that  we're  putting  out  there 
 and  for  the  small  percentage  of  people
[176:14] who  appreciate  that  education  but  also 
 want  your  extra  help  and  they've  got  a 
 bit  of  money  to  spend
[176:19] well  they'll  buy  your  product  we  just  do 
 this  long  term  so  we  start  posting  onto
[176:24] social  media  and  retirement  gets 
 valuable  as  possible  and  we  get  into 
 like  a  nice  Cadence  like  a  system  a
[176:29] schedule  an  upload  schedule  so  on 
 Twitter  you  could  discipline  yourself  to
[176:34] write  three  tweets  a  day  maybe  five 
 tweets  a  day  on  YouTube  you  could 
 discipline  yourself  to  post  once  a  week
[176:39] maybe  twice  a  week  three  times  what 
 depends  on  like  how  long  your  video  is 
 you  can  see  with  these  videos  since 
 they're  so  long  I  go  once  a  week  but  if
[176:45] my  videos  were  only  10  minutes  or  20 
 minutes  I  would  be  posting  every  single 
 day  at  the  same  time
[176:51] once  you've  got  that  consistent  schedule 
 what  we  want  to  do  is  start  to  capture 
 the  sale  so  okay  we're  understanding
[176:57] that  the  people  who  watch  our  content 
 who  are  really  helped  would  want  to 
 potentially  buy  from  us  how  do  we
[177:02] actually  get  the  sale  but  it's  simply 
 with  just  like  putting  the  links  in  the 
 description  as  you've  seen  here  we're
[177:07] going  to  be  creating  the  sales  page  in 
 just  a  second  I'll  give  you  the  link 
 there  you  can  see  like  my  top  Link  in
[177:12] the  description  in  the  Donna  school  and 
 what  we  just  need  to  do  is  a  very 
 specific  term  called  CTA  call  to  action
[177:19] what  this  means  is  inside  of  our  content 
 every  now  and  then  we  will  tell  the
[177:24] viewer  exactly  what  to  do  so  for  the 
 last  few  minutes  I've  mentioned  it  on  a 
 school  to  you  but  not  actually  to  try
[177:30] and  sell  it  to  you  I  didn't  tell  you 
 yeah  go  and  check  out  the  the  link  in 
 the  description  that  go  and  buy  the 
 product  but  rather  I  was  just  using  it
[177:35] as  an  example  because  it's  relevance  for 
 this  but  a  CTA  would  be  for  me  saying 
 okay  you  go  you  want  to  be  an
[177:40] entrepreneur  if  you  want  my  help  with 
 that  go  and  click  the  top  Link  in  the 
 description  description  right  now  that's 
 a  CTA  when  you  say  it  like  that  the
[177:47] amount  of  people  who  will  click  on  the 
 link  Skyrocket  so  you  must  tell  like  the 
 viewer  the  consumer  exactly  what  to  do
[177:53] so  interspersed  in  your  content  let's 
 say  in  these  long  videos  maybe  I'll  say
[177:58] it  twice  in  like  a  shorter  video  like  10 
 minutes  or  20  minutes  long  I'll  just  say 
 it  once  for  literally  about  just  10
[178:04] seconds  and  if  you  want  to  learn  more 
 about  this  go  click  on  the  top  Link  in 
 the  description  that's  Adonis  schools  my 
 paid  program  but  that's  it  for  Twitter
[178:10] for  example  you'd  write  a  few  tweets 
 like  normal  you're  writing  quotes 
 whatever  and  then  maybe  you'll  write
[178:15] like  one  tweet  which  is  about  your  paid 
 product  you  post  it  and  then  you  go  back 
 to  writing  your  normal  tweets  straight
[178:21] after  that  you've  got  to  make  sure  you 
 don't  oversell  you've  got  to  identify 
 that  pretty  much  every  time  you  try  and 
 sell  to  your  audience  it  kind  of  like
[178:28] lowers  how 
 good  or  positive  they  view  you  right  now
[178:33] so  I  could  give  you  like  this  amazing 
 like  this  guide  here  and  if  I  didn't 
 mention  it  on  his  school  even  once  in
[178:39] this  video  you'd  like  me  even  more  the 
 issue  is  like  we  still  we  want  to  make 
 our  money  we  want  to  sell  the  product  so
[178:44] it's  like  you  want  to  use  some  call  to 
 actions  mention  your  product  but  you 
 don't  want  it  to  be  like  too  much  or  too
[178:50] long  you  don't  want  to  have  like  you  see 
 those  sort  of  the  old  school  like  shitty
[178:55] YouTubers  who  do  like  the  sponsorships 
 and  it's  a  two-minute  thing  of  them 
 talking  about  the  the  little  [ __ ] 
 Dollar  Shave  Club  or
[179:01] um  I  don't  know  the  website  or 
 skillshare  or  whatever  the  [ __ ]  they've 
 been  like  sponsored  by  and  they  just 
 waste  like  five  minutes  of  your  time  per
[179:07] video  you've  never  seen  me  do  that 
 [ __ ]  have  you  it's  just  one  it's 
 cringe  and  it's  like  I  think  this  is  a 
 big  part  of  the  reason  why  I  was  able  to
[179:13] grow  so  quickly  was  because  I  very  much 
 undersold  for  a  long  time  and  kept  like
[179:18] my  courses  and  stuff  previously  like 
 very  hidden  I  tried  not  to  like  sell  too 
 much  it's  only  in  the  last  few  months
[179:24] that  I've  wanted  to  like  actually  like 
 bump  up  my  income  level  up  my  business 
 and  now  it's  like  I'm  at  the  phase  of
[179:29] like  wanting  to  slow  down  because  I  want 
 my  audience  to  grow  so  when  you  want 
 your  audience  to  grow  don't  sell
[179:35] anywhere  near  as  much  when  you  want  to 
 make  more  money  then  sell  more  call  to
[179:40] actions  you've  got  to  just  find  this 
 subtle  balance  if  you're  first  starting 
 off  I  would  say  literally  just  put  the
[179:45] call  to  action  in  every  video  but 
 literally  just  five  to  ten  seconds  right 
 at  the  last  and  also  by  the  way I've  got
[179:51] a  paid  program  top  Link  in  the 
 description  that's  it  literally  just 
 that  boom  move  on  to  the  next  here's
[179:56] your actionable  step  for  this  part  of 
 the  guide  you  need  to  decide  if  you  want 
 to  be  a  speaker  or  a  writer  for  your
[180:01] social  media  content  if  you're  unsure 
 just  ask  yourself  do  you  want  to  be  on 
 like  video  like  on  YouTube  or  maybe  just
[180:07] speaking  into  the  mic  on  like  Spotify 
 you  know  podcasts  or  do  you  want  to  for 
 example  write  tweets  or  blogs  or  any  any
[180:13] kind  of  like  keyboard  writing  thing  just 
 make  the  decision  and  you  don't  have  to 
 get  like  two  like  you  know  ah  which  one
[180:19] is  it  going  to  be  I  don't  know  just 
 choose  one  right  now  don't  say  you'll  do 
 both  or  any  [ __ ]  just  choose  one  go
[180:24] all  in  and  then  we're  just  gonna  choose 
 the  social  media  platform  for  it 
 honestly  I  just  say  just  do  YouTube
[180:29] you're  watching  this  long  video  on 
 YouTube  you  use  YouTube  Fairly  regularly 
 if  you  use  for  or  like  Spotify  podcasts
[180:37] twice  as  much  as  you  actually  watch 
 YouTube  then  fair  enough  choose  one  of 
 those  ones  but  in  general  most  of  the
[180:43] people  watching  this  would  be  like 
 fantastic  at  YouTube  Just  because  you've 
 already  watched  so  much  content  here  so
[180:48] you  kind  of  understand  what's  going  on 
 so  you  know  exactly  Which  social  media 
 now  to  go  all  in  now  just  spend  a  second
[180:54] just  to  think  about  the  right  mindset  to 
 posting  we're  just  trying  to  help  our
[181:00] Dream  customer  our  Avatar  if  you  can  go 
 and  have  a  look  at  the  problems  list  if 
 you've  made  one  already  or  if  you're
[181:06] going  to  do  that  very  soon  that  massive 
 problems  list  is  our  content  ideas  and 
 we're  just  going  to  try  and  like  give
[181:11] away  the  secrets  the  the  knowledge  that 
 we  know  about  this  area  step  8  how  to
[181:18] sell  in  this  part  of  the  guide  you  are 
 going  to  learn  the  skill  of  sales  you
[181:23] know  you've  probably  clicked  and  watched 
 those  videos  that  say  like  the  top 
 skills  to  to  learn  how  to  make  money  and
[181:28] they  always  say  sales  but  they  never 
 actually  explain  to  you  what  sales  is  do
[181:33] they  it's  all  these  [ __ ]  [ __ ] 
 YouTubers  will  make  the  same  videos  as 
 always  sales  sales  sales  will  help  you
[181:38] for  every  interaction  but  they  don't 
 even  explain  what  sales  is  sales  is  the
[181:43] skill  of  destroying  someone  else's 
 limiting  beliefs  about  your  product
[181:48] I'll  say  that  again  you  must  listen 
 sales  is  the  skill  for  destroying 
 someone  else's  limiting  beliefs  like
[181:54] their  objections  their  problems  we're 
 going  to  set  you  up  to  learn  this  skill 
 and  to  literally  like  use  it  in  live
[182:01] video  calls  with  people  who  will  like 
 see  your  content  and  book  calls  with  you 
 so  this  is  what  we  need  in  this  section
[182:07] we  need  a  way  for  people  to  book  video 
 calls  with  us  using  a  link  that  we'll
[182:12] put  inside  of  our  social  media  content 
 you  know  like  our  social  media  bio 
 YouTube  descriptions  with  the  bio  we
[182:18] want  a  link  there  that  when  someone 
 Clicks  in  they  can  see  like  a  calendar 
 like  our  schedule  and  they  can  book
[182:24] video  call  slots  with  us  we'll  see  that 
 we've  got  like  a  notification  okay  sweet 
 we've  got  a  call  with  Jack  today  at  five
[182:30] we'll  come  to  our  computer  we'll  start 
 the  call  we'll  end  up  speaking  to  them 
 about  like  you  know  what  they're
[182:35] interested  in  with  the  topic  so  it's 
 like  let's  say  if  you  sold  like  a 
 fitness  program  it  would  hype  it  all  up
[182:40] yeah  if  you  know  Fitness  is  really 
 awesome  when  you  get  muscle  it  feels  so 
 awesome  so  what  are  your  fitness  goals 
 I'll  tell  you  how  to  like  actually  sell
[182:46] something  to  someone  and  then  you  can 
 them  to  buy  your  product  straight  after 
 the  call  you'll  send  them  a  payment  link
[182:52] that  you  can  set  up  for  free  and  that 
 they'll  be  able  to  like  buy  and  you 
 start  work  with  them  so  the  first  thing
[182:57] we  need  to  do  here  is  we  need  to  set  up 
 that  sort  of  video  calling  system  the 
 booking  system  there's  a  software  which
[183:02] is  very  well  known  it's  called  calendly 
 I'll  link  it  in  the  in  the  description 
 so  I'll  go  and  find  a  guide  on  how  to
[183:09] set  up  calendly  you  can  go  find  like  a 
 different  software  if  you  want  to  this 
 is  the  one  that  I've  always  used  this  is
[183:14] the  one  that  I've  seen  other  big 
 YouTubers  use  so  it's  just  the  one  that 
 I'd  recommend  let's  say  you've  got  that 
 set  up  you've  got  the  calendly  set  up
[183:19] people  can  book  a  call  with  you  now  and 
 you  put  that  calendar  link  on  your 
 social  media  Post  in  the  description  the
[183:25] Twitter  bio  the  YouTube  channel  profile 
 thing  now  you  just  keep  posting  the
[183:30] valuable  content  that  you  are  on  social 
 media  tell  people  to  book  the  call  with 
 you  if  they're  interested  in  like  the
[183:36] high  ticket  like  package  that  you  offer 
 and  you  should  hopefully  very  soon  see
[183:42] your  first  call  booked  this  means  that 
 you're  about  to  go  on  to  like  maybe  your 
 first  ever  sales  call  which  was  it's
[183:48] quite  an  exhilarating  experience  if 
 you've  ever  called  approach  to  women  in 
 public  like  you  know  or  at  night  time  or
[183:54] something  you  know  in  clubs  or  parties 
 it's  a  very  similar  experience  to  that 
 like  your  heartbeat  will  go  because
[183:59] you're  like  getting  girls  and  sales  is 
 the  exact  same  thing  by  the  way this  is 
 why  most  guys  were  good  at  sales  will
[184:05] get  girls  most  guys  who  are  good  at  like 
 picking  up  girls  speaking  to  them  pick 
 up  artists  type  of  stuff  they're  very
[184:10] good  at  sales  as  well  now  I'll  walk  you 
 through  how  to  sell  I'm  not  a  master 
 salesman  like  at  all  I  only  know  like
[184:16] the  basics  but  honestly  the  basics  is 
 more  than  enough  because  you  don't  want 
 to  go  like  hard  sales  mode  to  the  point
[184:22] that  people  think  that  you're  acting 
 like  a  scammer  or  sleazy  or  anything 
 these  days  the  sort  of  softer  sales
[184:28] approach  Works  probably  better  so  you 
 hop  onto  the  call  you  see  their  little 
 screen  open  up  you've  got  yours  on  and
[184:34] you  literally  just  speak  to  them  like 
 you  take  an  interest  in  them  and  it's 
 Matthew  for  example  is  that  oh  Matthew
[184:39] looking  also  what  what  brought  you  to  my 
 um  my  call  today  Matthew  will  say  oh 
 yeah  you  know  like  I  saw  your  video  on
[184:45] like  Fitness  it  was  really  good  so 
 you'll  and  you  just  start  speaking  to 
 him  literally  just  about  his  goals  okay
[184:50] so  yeah  if  you've  got  fitness  goals  like 
 what  do  you  desire  with  that  what  do  you 
 want  with  Fitness  and  I  say  yeah  I  just
[184:55] want  to  lose  like  a  little  bit  off  my 
 stomach  and  stuff  you  say  okay  what  have 
 you  tried  so  far  and  he  says  oh  yeah  I
[185:00] tried  this  diet  and  this  diet  and  this 
 diet  but  it  didn't  I  didn't  really  work 
 then  straight  away  you  get  something  in
[185:06] your  mind  where  you're  thinking  oh  yeah 
 I  know  why  it  didn't  work  it's  because 
 of  this  like  because  you  could  kind  of 
 understand  your  own  Niche  your  own  topic
[185:12] their  their  pains  and  problems  so  you 
 teach  them  a  little  something  you  say 
 like  oh  yeah  you  know  yeah  it's  hard  for
[185:17] that  diet  to  work  because  you  probably 
 didn't  have  this  did  you  and  he's  like 
 oh  no  I  didn't  actually  you  teach  him
[185:22] something  so  he's  like  he  kind  of  thinks 
 oh  damn  this  guy  is  really  an  expert 
 then  you  start  to  just  really  hype  up
[185:27] how  good  the  dream  result  is  gonna  be  so 
 you  don't  actually  want  to  tell  them
[185:33] like  oh  like  yeah  you  know  losing 
 weight's  so  awesome  losing  weights  like 
 this  no  no  it's  not  about  losing  weight
[185:39] the  dream  result  is  that  he  doesn't  have 
 that  fat  anymore  the  dream  result  is
[185:44] that  his  shirt  fits  and  he's  got  more  of 
 an  aesthetic  taper  that  like  women 
 notice  and  he  gets  more  likes  on  Tinder
[185:51] that's  the  dream  results 
 that's  what  you  want  to  be  talking  about
[185:56] how  awesome  it  is  chances  are  you  might 
 even  have  their  dream  results  so  if  it's 
 for  Fitness  if  I  was  doing  like  Fitness
[186:01] sales  calls  I'd  say  like  bro  I've  been 
 in  a  relationship  for  the  past  few  years 
 but  when  I  was  single  when  I  would  make
[186:07] a  new  Tinder  account  I  honestly  just 
 because  of  my  physique  I  would  get
[186:13] if  you  wouldn't  even  believe  me  I  would 
 get  honestly  more  than  20  to  30  likes 
 per  day  like  it  was  like  a  super  male
[186:19] supermodel  level  just  because  of  my 
 physique  literally  just  because  of  that 
 I  don't  think  my  face  is  like  overly
[186:24] attractive  or  anything  just  because  I'm 
 good  at  taking  shirtless  pictures  where 
 like  I  look  like  a  like  a  [ __ ]  like
[186:29] Chad  in  a  certain  way  and  it's  it's  nice 
 it's  nice  because  growing  up  is  the  guy 
 who  never  really  got  the  attention  from
[186:35] the  girls  this  really  meant  a  lot  to  me 
 for  a  long  time  when  I  say  this  to  him 
 and  he's  literally  thinking  like  oh  yeah
[186:40] yeah  it  must  be  nice  supposed  to  be  nice 
 he's  gonna  do  anything  possible  now  to 
 go  and  experience  that  so  when  you
[186:45] mention  to  him  and  so  let  me  tell  you 
 about  my  package  in  my  package  I'm  gonna 
 get  you  to  this  result  in  three  months
[186:51] it's  a  three  month  thing  we're  gonna  do 
 this  or  it's  a  one  month  thing  whatever 
 it  is  right  you  tell  your  package  we're 
 gonna  do  weekly  calls  we're  gonna  do
[186:56] this  we're  gonna  do  this  I'll  even  give 
 you  this  I'll  give  you  this  I  literally 
 I'll  give  you  this  this  which  means  that
[187:01] right  here  right  now  that  pain  that 
 you're  experiencing  you  know  that  like 
 that  sort  of  feeling  of  insecurity  it 
 will  go  forever  not  only  will  I  work
[187:07] with  you  till  we  see  the  results  that 
 you  want  but  I'll  also  set  up  the  system 
 and  train  you  in  a  way  that  you  will 
 maintain  this  progress  for  the  rest  of
[187:13] your  life  we  will  change  the  beliefs 
 that  you  have  so  that  you  will  always 
 have  that  tight  shirt  around  your
[187:18] stomach  that  it'll  never  be  like  flabby 
 anymore  that  you'll  always  be  able  to 
 attract  more  women
[187:24] you  down 
 ready  to  get  started  the  package  is  2500 
 the  package  is  a  thousand  dollars
[187:30] whatever  you  want  to  say 
 at  that  moment  quite  a  few  people  will 
 be  like  oh  oh  I  didn't  realize  oh  I
[187:36] didn't  realize  you  were  selling  right  I 
 thought  it  was  going  to  be  free  your 
 scammer  like  10  of  people  are  just  going
[187:41] to  be  absolute  dumbasses  they'll  be  like 
 that  maybe  about  70  I  don't  know  what 
 the  percentage  but  like  a  certain  number
[187:46] of  people  will  be  like  oh  yeah  that's 
 too  expensive  for  me  you  can  try  and 
 sell  them  harder  those  people  who  say
[187:51] it's  too  expensive 
 if  I'm  honest  for  me  personally  I 
 wouldn't  try  and  like  sell  harder  to
[187:57] someone  who  just  says  like  oh  yeah  yeah 
 it's  too  expensive  I  don't  know  if  I  can 
 afford  it  whatever  what  you  want  is 
 maybe  the  five  to  ten  percent  of  people
[188:03] who  will  literally  just  be  like  yep  done 
 let's  go  that's  it
[188:08] boom 
 do  you  hang  up  the  call  you  tell  them 
 obviously  yes  we  are  selling  you  the 
 payment  link  it  will  begin  straight  away
[188:13] I'm  so  excited  you're  gonna  get  this 
 you're  gonna  get  this  you're  gonna  get 
 this  you're  gonna  like  you  know  feel 
 confident  in  your  body  which  when  you
[188:18] think  about  it  how  awesome  that  is  that 
 most  people  even  don't  ever  get  to  the 
 point  where  they  feel  even  nice  in  their
[188:23] own  skin  and  we're  gonna  get  that  for 
 you 
 I'll  send  you  the  payment  link  after 
 this  you  end  the  call  you  create  what's
[188:29] called  a  stripe  payment  link  you  can 
 just  uh  YouTube  it  I'll  find  you  a 
 YouTube  I'll  do  everything  for  you  but
[188:35] I'll  find  you  the  YouTube  tutorial  on 
 how  to  set  up  a  stripe  payment  link  I'll 
 link  it  below  and 
 you  just  set  it  up  it's  very  easy  it's
[188:41] like  free  to  do  with  stripe  stripe  takes 
 like  a  one  up  two  percent  or  whatever  it 
 is  from  your  payment  which  is 
 unfortunate  but  like  you  don't  actually
[188:47] pay  for  Stripes  so  it's  kind  of  nice  so 
 whatever 
 um  and  then  you  just  send  that  link  over 
 to  them  maybe  on  email  or  phone  number
[188:52] whatever  they  pay  for  it  and  you  begin 
 working  with  them  now  that's  the  process 
 of  a  sales  call  it's  a  very  exhilarating
[188:58] part  of  business  honestly  it's  probably 
 like  the  most  exciting  part  of  a 
 business  is  sales  because  you  are  there
[189:05] like  one  to  one  like  almost  hand-to-hand 
 combat  like  immediate  feedback  Flow 
 State  trying  to  sell  this  person  to  your
[189:11] thing  it's  like  every  sentence  you  say 
 every  little  facial  detail  that  you  make 
 slightly  changes  there  but  there
[189:18] um percentage  chance  of  buying  from  you 
 so  at  first  it's  literally  just  about 
 volume  just  get  on  to  100  sales  calls  no
[189:25] problem  but  soon  you're  going  to  want  to 
 level  your  skill  up  which  we'll  talk 
 about  in  The  Next  Step  but  first  your
[189:30] actionable  step  for  this  part  of  the 
 guide  is  to  set  up  your  calendly  booking 
 page  you  can  use  whatever  software  I'm
[189:36] not  affiliated  with  calendly  whatever 
 you  can  use  whatever  software  I  just 
 like  colored  leads  to  my  one  that  I've 
 always  used  is  the  one  that  I  understand
[189:41] and  I  do  think  it's  really  nice  set  up 
 the  calendly  page  also  set  up  your
[189:46] stripe  payment  link  and  then  add  your 
 calendly  link  not  the  straight  one  but 
 the  currently  link  to  your  social  media
[189:52] profiles  and  from  now  on  when  you  make 
 social  media  content  every  now  and  then 
 just  very  quickly  mention  that  if
[189:58] they're  interested  in  like  a  high  ticket 
 or  like  you  know  package  a  paid  package 
 to  get  to  their  dream  results  remember
[190:04] the  dream  result  isn't  like  weight  loss 
 it's  to  be  skinny  there's  a  difference
[190:09] right  the  dream  thing  that  they  want 
 isn't  to  go  through  the  progress  It's  to 
 be  at  the  end  point  so  you  mentioned
[190:15] that  in  every  video  from  now  on  oh  yeah 
 go  and  book  a  call  with  me  let's  see  if 
 you're  a  good  fit  boom  step  nine  more
[190:21] better  new  this  is  a  phrase  by  Alexa 
 MOSI  that  has  served  me  really  well  so  I
[190:27] wanted  to  just  teach  you  it  more  better 
 new  now  this  is  what  most  beginners  do
[190:32] when  they  start  with  their  business 
 they  make  tiny  bit  of  progress  in 
 setting  up  like  maybe  let's  say  for  you
[190:37] you've  set  up  the  calendly  okay  you've 
 set  up  like  you  know  the  pro  the 
 problems  your  customer  is  going  to  have
[190:42] the  solutions  social  media  whatever 
 you've  set  some  stuff  up  you  made  some 
 progress  and  before  they  know  it  they've 
 clicked  on  another  video  that  said
[190:48] actually  there's  a  better  business  model 
 you  can  go  try  agency  instead 
 copywriting  YouTube  there's  just
[190:53] different  businesses  and  they  go  and  try 
 something  new  over  and  over  and  over 
 again 
 most  people  at  this  stage  they  will
[191:00] suffer  and  stay  in  the  state  of  just 
 staying  like  broke  because  they're 
 addicted  to  new  they're  addicted  to  new
[191:07] things  new  business  models  new  ways  of 
 doing  things  you  don't  deserve  to  start 
 doing  anything  new  right  now  you  don't
[191:13] need  anything  new  any  business  model  can 
 work  the  idea  that  you've  got  will  work 
 but  you  need  to  exhaust  more  and  better
[191:19] first  what  this  means  is  that  there  is  a 
 step-by-step  process  of  the  things  that 
 you  should  focus  on  and  new  doing
[191:25] something  new  is  at  the  end  of  it  right 
 now  what  we  want  you  to  focus  on  is  more 
 doing  more  of  the  exact  same  thing  that
[191:32] simply  just  means  do  more  volume  so  if 
 you  look  at  your  package  you  know  that 
 massive  Solutions  list  and  we  created  it
[191:38] into  this  bundle 
 what  if  you  just  offer  more  what  if  you 
 literally  just  did  more  right  now  you
[191:43] want  to  get  more  sales  you  want  to  get 
 like  your  customer  better  results  so 
 that  you  know  they  actually  genuinely
[191:48] change  their  lives  and  they  thank  you 
 for  it  and  they  make  the  testimonial  and 
 the  review  and  you  feel  better  because
[191:53] you  know  that  you're  you'll  think  that's 
 results  right 
 you  know  a  really  fast  easy  way  to  get
[191:58] them  more  results  is  to  just  add  more  of 
 what  you've  already  got  inside  of  your 
 package  for  example  if  you've  told  them
[192:04] you'll  do  a  weekly  call  with  them 
 what  if  you  just  did  two  calls  a  week  or 
 three  calls  a  week  and  again  this  is
[192:11] where  like  so  many  young  guys  will  stop 
 it  like  their  brains  will  fart  and 
 they'll  say  like  oh  but  wait  that's  like
[192:16] that's  a  you  know  that's  that's  more 
 time  I'm  not  trading  time  for  money  I'm 
 like  bro  again  are  you  willing  to  work
[192:22] hard  to  make  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  money  yes  or 
 no  you  said  yes  every  single  time  have 
 you  not  so  why  not  work  harder  to  make
[192:28] more  money  right  now  if  this  is  your  big 
 goal  in  like  you  know  this  is  like  the 
 thing  you're  focused  on  are  you  spending
[192:33] like  pretty  much  all  day  thinking  about 
 money  anyway  just  be  honest  you're 
 probably  all  right  so  either  you  can  do
[192:38] more  which  will  actually  get  you  money 
 or  you  can  keep  coping  watching  [ __ ] 
 take  videos  Hamza  [ __ ]  videos  right
[192:44] so  do  you  want  to  make  more  money  right 
 so  you  may  as  well  work  just  do  more  of 
 the  the  valuable  things  so  for  example
[192:50] change  the  weekly  call  to  three  times 
 what  if  you  just  did  something  crazy 
 what  if  you  did  literally  a  call  every
[192:57] single  day  just  a  little  WhatsApp  one 
 you've  got  like  it  sounds  crazy  but  like 
 you've  got  the  time  for  it  right  you
[193:02] could  literally  call  someone  on  Whatsapp 
 for  10  minutes  a  day  and  you'd  actually 
 have  the  time  for  it  now  imagine  that
[193:07] that's  gonna  get  you  like  twice  as  many 
 sales  why  wouldn't  you  do  it  if  this  is 
 the  biggest  thing  in  your  life  right  now
[193:12] now  again  you  want  to  get  to  the  point 
 where  you  can  have  like  a  bit  more 
 passive  income  and  freedom  and  less  time
[193:17] involved  in  business  I  understand  that 
 that's  a  nice  goal  to  have  but  right  now 
 at  these  earlier  levels  you  really  need
[193:24] way  more  momentum  and  you'll  get  that 
 from  just  offering  more  like  like 
 craving  more  active  income  instead  of
[193:29] passive  income  in  the  future  you  can 
 minimize  this  and  and  you  know  kind  of 
 like  turn  it  down  okay  I'll  do  one  call
[193:34] a  week  I'll  change  my  package  I'll  do 
 this  sorry  if  you  got  a  current  customer 
 you're  like  sorry  I  can  give  you  a 
 refund  if  you  want  but  I'm  only  gonna  do
[193:40] one  call  that's  like  in  the  future  when 
 money  doesn't  feel  important  to  you  but 
 right  now  you're  watching  this  because 
 it  does  so  you  may  as  well  work  more  so
[193:46] offer  the  the  two  times  weekly  call  or 
 the  three  times  calls  or  the  daily
[193:51] texting 
 add  more  to  it  and  then  that's  just  your 
 package  how  about  for  your  marketing  for
[193:56] the  the  content  you're  making  to  get 
 customers  you're  making  content  on 
 Twitter  on  YouTube  what  if  you  just  made
[194:02] more  what  if  you  posted  more  often  right 
 now  if  you're  posting  on  YouTube  three 
 times  a  week  why  not  just  scale  that  up
[194:07] to  four  times  five  times  and  this  is 
 where  the  cope  will  come  in  and  people 
 will  say  oh  no  but  I've  got  school
[194:12] because  I've  got  this  I've  got  this 
 chances  are  you  do  actually  have  the 
 time  to  do  more  it's  just  that  you're
[194:17] wasting  like  at  least  an  hour  a  day  I  at 
 least  waste  an  hour  a  day  so  if  you  tell 
 me  you  don't  waste  an  hour  a  day  I  know
[194:22] it's  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  because  I'm  I'm 
 like  a  boasting  whatever  but  but  I'm
[194:27] very  [ __ ]  good  at  keeping  my  calendar 
 in  check  that  my  phone's  been  on 
 airplane  mode  do  not  disturb  my  every
[194:32] minute  is  tracked  of  my  day  I  still 
 probably  waste  about  an  hour  a  day  so  if 
 you  tell  me  that  you  you  don't  I  don't
[194:37] believe  you  so  there  you've  just  got  an 
 hour  boom  post  more  content
[194:42] tweet  more 
 when  you  do  more  you  get  more  it's 
 literally  it's  just  as  simple  as  that
[194:47] the  business  world  doesn't  work  the  same 
 as  like  as  building  muscle  there  isn't 
 diminishing  returns  and  this  is  actually
[194:52] more  kind  of  like  linear  or  even 
 exponential  like  if  you  post  more  on 
 social  media  you  will  simply  just  grow
[194:58] more  you  will  get  more  results  it's  as 
 simple  as  that 
 if  you  add  more  to  your  package  of  like
[195:03] the  things  that  are  actually  valuable 
 for  example  the  live  calls  with  you 
 you'll  simply  just  get  more  sales  so
[195:09] just  start  with  that  then  once  you  feel 
 like  you've  maxed  out  the  volume  that 
 you  could  do  and  you're  actually  working 
 pretty  much  like  all  day  and  you're
[195:15] thinking  yeah  I  couldn't  post  more  I'm 
 literally  posting  every  day  or  I  do 
 really  long  videos  like  this  one  and  I 
 post  weekly  or  maybe  twice  a  week  for
[195:21] example  you  can't  add  more  that's  when 
 you  start  to  consider  okay  better  how  do 
 you  do  the  current  things  but  better  at
[195:28] a  higher  skill  level  so  for  this  you 
 could  look  at  your  package  at  every 
 little  bit  that  you've  got  in  there  you
[195:33] know  if  you've  got  the  course  you've  got 
 the  live  calls  you've  got  their  daily 
 accountability  you've  got  this  and  now 
 you  could  be  thinking  okay  how  do  I  make
[195:39] every  little  part  of  this  better  and 
 more  effective  at  getting  the  customer
[195:44] the  results  that  they  want  so  maybe  you 
 look  at  your  course  that  you've  made 
 like  if  you've  made  a  collection  of
[195:49] videos  for  example  training  videos  and 
 you  look  at  them  and  you  think  you  know 
 what  this  is  a  20  minute  video  I  could
[195:54] probably  say  this  in  about  10  minutes 
 that  probably  means  that  like  more 
 people  will  watch  through  it  because  you
[195:59] know  some  people  end  up  clicking  off 
 because  it's  too  long  whatever  I  could 
 make  this  video  better  this  um this
[196:04] template  that  I  made  I  could  make  this 
 better  the  live  calls  that  I  have  with 
 them  you  know  what  sometimes  my  focus
[196:09] Falls  away  maybe  I  could  meditate  for 
 five  minutes  first 
 maybe  you  can  even  make  the  sales
[196:15] process  better  so  you  can  go  and  study 
 books  on  sales  level  up  your  scale  of 
 sales  to  know  what  like  a  couple  more
[196:20] like  tactics  that  you  can  use  and  then 
 you  can  actually  bring  that  to  your 
 sales  calls  making  them  better  and
[196:25] you're  more  likely  to  get  money  then  you 
 can  also  make  your  social  media  content 
 better  you  can  learn  more  things  about
[196:31] YouTube  about  like  leveling  up  your 
 thumbnails  about  your  speaking  skill 
 about  storytelling  maybe  you're  you're
[196:36] more  on  Twitter  so  you  learn  how  to  like 
 grow  on  Twitter  more  you  learn  about  how 
 to  um write  in  a  more  persuasive  way  you
[196:42] see  that  there's  so  much  that  you  can  do 
 for  what  you've  got  right  now  before  you
[196:47] should  ever  consider  doing  something  new 
 so  if  you've  got  to  this  point  if  I 
 could  force  you  to  do  something  which
[196:52] hopefully  that  you're  going  to  take  that 
 seriously  if  I'm  telling  you  okay  then 
 please  just  do  this  forget  anything  new
[196:58] the  next  time  you  click  on  a  random 
 video  and  Andrew  Tate's  there  talking 
 about  yeah  this  business  model  is  really
[197:03] good  then  you  click  on  the  next  one  and 
 this  one  and  this  one  you're  not  going 
 to  make  any  progress  doing  that  right
[197:08] now  forget  about  the  concept  of  anything 
 new  stay  dedicated  committed  to  this  one 
 path  that  that  you've  got  and  just  do
[197:14] more  of  it  and  do  it  better  I  think 
 there  isn't  a  better  time  for  me  to  now
[197:19] finally  like  officially  plug  Adonis 
 school  to  you  this  is  what  I've  wanted 
 with  the  Donna  school  it's  it's  a  place
[197:25] for  young  men  to  come  in  and  gain  an 
 education  for  like  essentially  for  the
[197:30] real  world  instead  of  the  way  that  the 
 education  system  set  us  up  with  and  you 
 learn  things  about  entrepreneurship
[197:35] money  investing  Fitness  relationships 
 all  these  things  but  I  think  the  most 
 valuable  part  is  that  it's  a  community
[197:40] of  guys  who  are  doing  this  together  and 
 so  I  keep  seeing  every  day  that  there's 
 a  new  guy  who's  who's  been  doing  like
[197:45] weekly  calls  with  another  guy  they've 
 been  holding  each  other  accountable  and 
 I  think  that's  like  some  of  the  best
[197:50] parts  not  only  that 
 I  give  like  a  lot  of  lessons  there  so
[197:55] this  video  here  that  you're  watching  has 
 been  a  Adonis  School  lecture  over  about 
 two  weeks  every  day  I've  been  in  there
[198:01] we  have  about  a  10  hour  lecture  on  money 
 we  have  a  five  or  six  hour  lecture  on
[198:07] Willpower  plus  every  course  that  I've 
 made  plus  live  calls  from  teachers  that 
 I've  hired  it's  it's  a  place  that's  like
[198:13] going  to  the  top  it's  a  very  good  place 
 so  this  is  just  me  Shilling  it  for  the 
 first  time  and  like  official  time  in
[198:18] this  video  go  click  the  top  Link  in  the 
 description  if  you're  interested  in 
 getting  this  community  at  on  a  school 
 making  money  online  step  12  spending
[198:25] money  when  you  follow  this  part  of  the 
 guide  the  benefit  you're  going  to  get  is 
 that  soon  when  you  go  to  the  store  you
[198:30] won't  ever  need  to  look  at  the  price  for 
 pretty  much  anything  again  and  that's  a 
 really  calming  experience
[198:37] you'll  also  be  able  to  buy  some  things 
 that  other  people  will  look  at  and 
 you'll  get  some  sense  of  status  with 
 that  if  that's  the  thing  that  you  care
[198:42] about  but  more  importantly  you  will  get 
 the  freedom  that  you've  desired  all  this
[198:47] time  you'll  be  able  to  invest  in  your 
 growth  by  buying  the  right  things  at  the 
 right  time  which  many  other  people  don't
[198:53] do  you  see  the  average  guy  but  it  gets  a 
 little  bit  of  money  but  then  he  wastes 
 it  on  low  quality  status  symbols  he  gets
[198:58] a  car  on  finance  he  he  goes  and  eats 
 like  take  away  or  something  and  he  has 
 nothing  to  really  show  for  it  whereas
[199:04] for  us 
 we're  going  to  go  down  a  different  path 
 we're  going  to  use  money  to  put  our
[199:09] trajectory  on  even  more  of  a  fast  track 
 so  there  are  five  levels  to  spending
[199:14] money  five  things  that  you  can  spend 
 your  money  on  this  is  in  my  opinion  and 
 I'm  sure  everyone  else  will  disagree  but
[199:20] I  will  just  tell  you  about  the  things 
 that  have  served  me  and  if  you're 
 anything  like  me  then  your  experiences 
 will  probably  be  similar  level  zero
[199:26] material  objects  for  status  this  is  the 
 car  the  watch  the  fancy  Apartments  the
[199:35] fancy  branded  clothing  this  can  be  fine 
 and  you  will  get  like  status  by  buying
[199:40] this  so  for  example  if  you've  been 
 leveling  up  your  business  and  you  go  and 
 buy  like  the  Rolex  that  you've  really
[199:45] wanted  or  you  know  you're  going  upgrade 
 your  wardrobe  you  will  get  noticed  more 
 you  will  get  more  validation  and
[199:51] acceptance  from  more  people  that's  100 
 the  case  the  reason  why  I'd  argue  that
[199:56] that  isn't  so  great  is  that  in  general 
 only  unintelligent  people  validate  you
[200:01] when  you  buy  some  kind  of  status  object 
 the  kind  of  person  who's  actually  on 
 your  level  when  you  think  about  the  kind
[200:07] of  thinking  that  you  do  the  values  that 
 you  have  the  amount  of  character  that 
 you've  become  the  truth  is  that  only
[200:13] people  who  are  far  below  you  in  terms  of 
 intelligence  and  values  will  actually 
 look  up  at  you  when  you've  got  like  the
[200:19] Branded  T-shirts  they  it  absolutely  will 
 happen  more  like  like  degenerate  women
[200:24] will  want  to  have  sex  with  you  but  when 
 you  take  a  step  back 
 and  you  think  to  yourself  okay  I'm  not
[200:29] gonna  just  indulge  in  my  monkey  like 
 little  monkey  impulse  here  is  it
[200:34] actually  a  good  thing  is  it  a  good  thing 
 that  more 
 common  people  like  you  now
[200:41] it  can  be  nice  to  feel  socially  involved 
 I'm  not  saying  you've  got  to  you  know 
 hate  everyone  or  anything  but
[200:46] it's  usually  it's  just  unintelligent 
 people  who  will  like  you  more  because
[200:51] you've  bought  something  that  they  think 
 is  expensive  which  elevates  your  status 
 in  their  eyes  what  I  have  found  which  is
[200:57] very  interesting  which  the  people  who 
 buy  these  objects  don't  speak  about  the 
 most  intelligent  people  that  I  know
[201:03] never  validated  me  with  every  single 
 material  purchase  I  ever  had  when  I  got
[201:09] like  the  fancy  apartment  in  Dubai  which 
 was  ten  thousand  dollars  a  month  when 
 I've  had  like  the  fancy  clothing  the  400
[201:15] shirt  whatever  like  obviously  there's 
 levels  to  this  and  some  some  rich  guy 
 might  be  watching  this  they  get  off  400 
 sure  that's  not  even  that  expensive  but
[201:21] you  know  this  it's  all  relevant  right 
 the  intelligent  people  that  I  know  never
[201:26] validated  me  for  it  and  yet  when  I 
 downscaled  my  life 
 when  I  was  making  twenty  thousand
[201:32] dollars  a  month  and  I  moved  back  in  with 
 my  parents  so  that  I  could  focus  on  my 
 business  every  intelligent  person  that  I
[201:38] knew  on  WhatsApp  they  actually  validated 
 me  for  it  it's  so  interesting  because 
 what  I  found  is  truly  like  smart  people
[201:45] know  exactly  the  issues  with  spending  on 
 like  material  objects  that  we  know  that
[201:51] it's  like  this  it's  almost  like  this 
 low-level  desire  that  you're  really 
 hoping  that  someone  else  like  looks  at
[201:56] you  now  you  can  certainly  do  it  and 
 there's  always  going  to  be  a  Coke  that  a 
 lot  of  people  will  have  thinking  no  no 
 Hamza  I  really  like  the  watch  but  I
[202:03] really  want  that  car  absolutely  if 
 there's  something  that  you've  got  of 
 this  massive  interest  in  and  you  really
[202:08] are  like  super  super  interested  in  this 
 certain  car  then  like  who  am  I  to  tell
[202:14] you  to  go  otherwise  if  that's  what  you 
 truly  truly  desire  I  would  just  ask  you
[202:19] to  take  a  step  back  and  really  just  be 
 honest  to  yourself  is  it  for  yourself  is
[202:25] it  actually  because  you  genuinely  want 
 that  or  is  it  as  pathetic  as  like  you 
 literally  just  want  to  see  someone's
[202:30] head  turned  towards  you  and  that's  what 
 will  make  it  all  worthwhile  because  most
[202:35] of  the  guys  who  are  really  obsessed  with 
 a  certain  material  object  like  the  watch
[202:40] or  the  car  or  the  apartment  or  whatever 
 for  most  of  them  it  isn't  about  the 
 utility  of  the  thing  it  isn't  about  the
[202:46] real  value  of  the  thing  it's  kind  of 
 like  a  Band-Aid  over  the  childhood 
 trauma  of  like  a  lack  of  condition  like
[202:52] unconditional  love  it's  so  sad  to  say 
 that  but  it  is  the  case  and  I  don't  mean 
 to  like  psychoanalyze  anyone  but  it  is
[202:58] the  case  that's  why  we  Chase  these 
 material  objects  because  we  just  want  to 
 feel  welcomed  in  our  society  which  is
[203:03] really  sad  because  you  probably  spent 
 like  a  month  of  your  life  just  trying  to 
 get  that  watch  and  now  you've  got  some
[203:08] dumb  girl  who's  more  into  when  the 
 actual  girl  who's  on  your  level  who's  an 
 intelligent  woman  who's  well  educated
[203:14] she's  gonna  think  that  you're  kind  of 
 like  insecure  and  lame  for  having  that
[203:19] would  you  want  the  female  equivalent  of 
 you  would  you  want  the  woman  who  gets  a
[203:24] breast  job  because  more  guys  will  turn 
 towards  her  then  why  would  you  be  the 
 guy  with  the  car  it's  the  same  thing  the
[203:29] truth  is  that  the  spiritual  people  are 
 absolutely  right  when  you  see  this  like
[203:34] two  kinds  of  people  in  society  there's 
 the  material  people  just  the  normal 
 person  average  guy  who  goes  into  the
[203:39] nine-to-five  job  but  also  the 
 entrepreneurs  the  rich  guys  the  athletes 
 the  people  who  are  like  here  in  this
[203:44] real  world  trying  to  make  money  and 
 success  and  then  there's  those  spiritual 
 people  who've  got  a  lot  of  faith  a  lot
[203:49] of  belief  who  have  got  a  lot  of 
 alignment  to  their  values  and  for 
 example  it's  like  who  you  could  imagine
[203:54] if  you've  seen  Wim  Hof  or  David  dadiff 
 the  author  of  the  way  the  superior  man 
 or  any  deeply  religious  people  like
[203:59] imams  for  example  these  people  are 
 absolutely  right  when  they  tell  you  that 
 these  material  desires  won't  amount  to
[204:04] anything  other  than  actual  pain  and  and 
 frustration  in  life  that  the  true  path
[204:09] to  happiness  and  Enlightenment  and  like 
 sort  of  a  positive  life  experience
[204:14] doesn't  come  from  random  objects  that 
 you  can  buy  from  someone  else  but  it 
 comes  through  like  your  alignments  or
[204:19] something  that  that  feels  important  to 
 you  maybe  God  maybe  love  maybe  liked 
 there's  a  lot  of  spiritual  people  say
[204:24] like  we  are  all  beings  of  light  and 
 that's  what  we  should  pursue  so  if  you 
 are  absolutely  certain  there  is  some
[204:29] material  object  that  close  the  car 
 whatever  that  is  at  you  you  are  like 
 yeah  100  of  buying  that  what  I  would  say
[204:34] is  just  limit  it  to  about  five  to  ten 
 percent  of  your  profits  so  if  you 
 genuinely  profit  not  just  get  money  in
[204:40] but  profit  from  your  business  like  minus 
 your  expenses  of  business  if  your  profit 
 is  like  10  000  a  month  you  could  maybe
[204:47] get  like  a  thousand  dollar  like  purchase 
 which  is  about  status  maybe  which  means 
 that  you  can't  even  get  the  fancy
[204:52] apartment  which  is  you  know  5K  7K 
 whatever  in  my  most  stressful  unhealthy
[204:57] or  unhappy  time  when  I  moved  to  Dubai  my 
 business's  profit  was  barely  like  10K
[205:02] and  I  was  using  that  on  the  apartments 
 and  the  clothing  and  everything  my  cash 
 was  quite  high  it  was  you  know  it's  like
[205:07] 40K  but  we  were  reinvesting  that  back 
 into  the  business  and  it  just  makes  you 
 a  weak  entrepreneur  when  you  have  this
[205:12] like  materialistic  lifestyle  now  I  know 
 you're  probably  thinking  of  the 
 entrepreneurs  out  there  like  our  name
[205:17] like  Iman  and  Tate  who  are  quite 
 materialistic  they've  got  the  fancy 
 objects  but  they  are  quite  they're
[205:23] amazing  at  business  at  the  same  time 
 what  I  will  say  from  what  I  can  see  is 
 like  these  men  are  the  outliers  that
[205:30] they  absolutely  are  they  are  like  the 
 outliers  what  you're  not  seeing  is 
 through  the  survivorship  bias  is  the
[205:36] amount  of  people  who  have  the  same 
 materialistic  tastes  as  these  men  but 
 who  didn't  make  it  so  this  is  more
[205:42] credit  to  these  men  to  show  how  amazing 
 they  are  but  also  like  less  credit  to 
 like  the  average  folk  who  also  for
[205:48] example  wants  the  same  like  cars  and  you 
 know  you've  seen  the  entrepreneur  you're 
 thinking  yeah  take  so  cool  with  this  car 
 and  everything  and  this  and  the  watch
[205:53] Iman  with  his  watches  chances  are  if 
 we're  just  being  honest  most  of  the
[205:59] people  who  have  the  same  desires  end  up 
 in  absolute  ruin 
 just  because  you  see  this  one  guy  who's
[206:05] been  able  to  manage  it  doesn't  actually 
 mean  that  you  will  now  of  course  we  want 
 to  have  like  powerful  beliefs  about 
 ourselves  but  we  also  need  to  be
[206:10] rational  to  think  that  the  disease  of 
 materialism  has  claimed  the  lives  of  of 
 a  lot  of  disciplined  hard-working  people
[206:17] these  aren't  average  people  that  you're 
 competing  against  when  you  think  of  like 
 the  top  level  athletes  who  literally 
 became  too  materialistic  and  they  lost
[206:23] it  all  and  became  bankrupt  they  were 
 more  disciplined  than  you  could  ever 
 hope  to  be  so  don't  believe  that  oh  yeah
[206:28] it  won't  happen  to  me  I  won't  waste  all 
 my  money  in  my  business  or  my  my 
 athletic  career  just  goes  to  [ __ ]
[206:34] because  of  the  the  headache  caused  by  my 
 incessant  desire  of  status  objects  if 
 you're  really  interested  in  this  there's
[206:40] a  video  on  my  channel  which  is  called 
 don't  make  this  mistake  when  you  get 
 rich  and  I've  explained  it  in  about  a
[206:45] two-hour  Loom  presentation  like  a  screen 
 recording  of  me  just  talking  and  showing 
 you  pictures  of  the  stuff  I  bought  the
[206:51] people  I  met  and  the  experience  I  had  in 
 Dubai  and  like  how  materialistic  that 
 side  of  like  that  part  of  the  world  is
[206:56] and  every  step  that  I've  taken  towards 
 this  materialistic  object  has  just  been
[207:01] a  wasted  step  it's  been  a  waste  of  time 
 and  often  I've  noticed  that  it's 
 actually  reduced  my  health  at  the  same
[207:06] time  which  is  just  it's  unacceptable 
 every  step  that  I've  taken  towards  the 
 spiritual  path  has  improved  my  health  my
[207:12] happiness  my  love  has  improved  even  my 
 productivity  my  contributions  to  others
[207:17] so  that's  just  the  lesson  I'd  give  you 
 there  is  I  would  say  this  is  a  level 
 zero  purchase  buy  if  you  must  if  you've
[207:23] got  some  addiction  to  this  this  thing 
 but  I  would  I  would  love  to  like  see  you 
 almost  psychoanalyze  yourself  and  think
[207:29] you  know  what  actually  if  I'm  being 
 honest  the  reason  why  I  want  to  buy  this 
 thing  is  because  I  just  keep  thinking
[207:34] about  this  girl  from  high  school  that  if 
 I  ended  up  driving  the  car  past  my  city 
 she  might  look  at  me  and  how  [ __ ]  sad
[207:40] that  is  that  I'd  go  and  spend  the  next 
 year  of  my  life  with  this  desire  just 
 hopefully  that  like  some  girl  from  high
[207:45] school  might  pay  more  attention  to  me  a 
 lot  of  it  comes  down  to  that  the  second 
 level  of  things  you  can  buy  is  with
[207:50] travel 
 experiences  are  shown  statistically  to
[207:55] give  you  like  a  a  better  feeling  of 
 Happiness  then  objects  are  so  what  this
[208:00] means  is  getting  the  holiday  like  the 
 the  travel  experience  to  a  different 
 country  will  actually  serve  your  life
[208:07] more  than  buying  an  item  so  I  would 
 actually  support  you  in  this  decision  of 
 like  if  you've  saved  up  a  few  thousand
[208:13] and  you  want  to  go  to  like  I  don't  know 
 Europe  or  this  other  country  or  this 
 country  you  want  to  book  this  Airbnb 
 actually  serve  you  mostly  because  of  the
[208:20] learning  lessons  that  arise  when  you  go 
 traveling  when  you  leave  your  home  the 
 environment  that  you're  used  to  and  you
[208:25] go  somewhere  else  especially  if  it's  for 
 quite  a  long  period  of  time  and  you're 
 especially  if  you're  quite  social  when 
 you  go  there  you'll  get  a  bunch  of
[208:31] learning  lessons  and  realizations  that 
 you  might  not  have  gotten  if  you  stayed 
 at  home  one  realization  like  that  could
[208:38] be  worth  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars 
 like  it  could  be  like  you  know  something 
 that  you  implement  through  your  business 
 that  could  be  worth  thousands  it  could
[208:43] be  something  that  you  realize  about  your 
 purpose  about  your  direction  in  life 
 that  could  be  worth  like  it  could  be
[208:48] Priceless  so  basically  every  trip  that 
 I've  been  on  I've  had  quite  a  good 
 realization  that  has  been  extremely
[208:55] valuable  but 
 I'm  gonna  sound  a  bit  odd  here  but  I 
 actually  have  quite  unique  views  towards
[209:01] traveling  I  believe  that  the  travel 
 industry  by  the  way the  travel  industry 
 is  like  a  700  billion  or  even  a  trillion
[209:06] dollar  industry  like  you  know  the  planes 
 the  flights  the  hotels  everything  right 
 I  believe  that  they  have  brainwashed  us
[209:13] to  believe  that  the  height  of  life  is  to 
 go  on  a  holiday  when  you  think  about  the 
 average  person's  beliefs  the  average  guy
[209:19] you  know  he  works  in  a  shitty  career 
 then  50  weeks  of  the  year  and  he's 
 allowed  to  take  two  weeks  off  when  his
[209:25] boss  his  daddy  tells  them  that  you  can 
 go  and  like  have  fun  in  a  different 
 country  and  the  thing  that  he  does  in 
 those  two  weeks  he  books  a  holiday  but
[209:31] what  I  would  say  is  like  if  I'm  speaking 
 to  younger  Hamza 
 he  had  in  his  mind  for  about  three  years
[209:37] this  dream  of  of  being  a  digital  Nomad 
 and  I  would  just  ask  him  and  say  like
[209:42] why  do  you  have  that  like  what  do  you 
 think  life  is  going  to  be  when  you're 
 there  I  was  in  a  work  mode  I  wanted  to
[209:48] work  super  hard  and  get  results  in  my 
 business  and  I  would  go  to  a  kind  of  the 
 kind  of  place  where  that  doesn't  happen
[209:53] when  you  are  in  like  this  focused  work 
 mode 
 flying  around  and  like  going  to  these
[209:59] nice  like  little  places  bro  I'm  gonna 
 say  this  again  no  one's  doing  deep  work 
 in  Thailand  it's  just  the  way  it  is  no
[210:05] one's  doing  deep  work  there  in  your  own 
 little  home  here  when  you're  focused  in 
 like  an  apartment  in  in  your  own  home
[210:10] country  you  can  grind  away  if  this  is 
 the  priority  of  your  life  right  now  go
[210:15] to  those  places  when  you  actually  want 
 to  kind  of  like  rest  off  when  you 
 specifically  don't  even  care  about
[210:20] business  you  don't  mind  if  the  results 
 go  down  a  little  bit  that's  fine  but 
 don't  think  to  yourself  like  as  I  did
[210:25] yeah  I'll  go  to  Thailand  and  you  know 
 I'll  stay  there  for  months  and  months 
 and  months  and  you  know  all  my  business 
 it's  like  the  environment  isn't  set  up
[210:32] for  you  to  be  able  to  get  more  results 
 there  it's  just  something  which  is  it's 
 just  the  truth  I  don't  know  now  you  can 
 see  I'm  quite  like  negative  towards
[210:38] traveling  but  I  will  say  that  my  advice 
 for  this  is  there  is  a  certain  kind  of
[210:43] trouble  that  I  think  is  worth  it  for  me 
 and  so  chances  are  if  you  actually 
 really  enjoy  traveling  you  disagree  with
[210:49] what  I  say  what  I'm  about  to  say  will 
 actually  make  your  traveling  still 
 better  anyway  so  if  I  will  travel  for
[210:54] this  then  it  means  that  you  know  like  if 
 you  already  enjoy  traveling  this  will  be 
 supplement  to  it  I  believe  that
[210:59] traveling  for  the  sake  of  just  like  hey 
 I'm  in  a  different  country  it's  just 
 weird  and  pathetic  I  just  don't  see  the
[211:04] point  of  that  but  I  think  that  traveling 
 for  your  purpose  traveling  to  go  and 
 learn  something  is  worth  it  so  for
[211:10] example  my  purpose  right  now  is  not 
 actually  my  work  I've  kind  of  completed 
 that  layer  I  feel  like  financially  free
[211:16] it's  fine  now  my  purpose  right  now  is  to 
 free  my  body  I've  realized  that  like  the
[211:21] next  level  of  Freedom  that  I  want  to  get 
 to  is  like  my  own  body  Freedom  my 
 physical  Freedom  it's  like  my  joints  are
[211:26] stiff  I  [ __ ]  hate  like  how  I  feel  in 
 my  body  it's  nothing  particularly  bad  I 
 don't  have  any  juice  or  anything  but
[211:31] it's  only  like  now  that  I've  got  the 
 space  away  from  work  and  money  that  I'm 
 actually  realizing  like  my  knees  click
[211:36] when  I  when  I  squat  down  I've  got  like 
 you  know  sort  of  like  a  stiffness  here 
 so  I  want  to  get  all  into  yoga  but  I
[211:42] also  want  to  get  all  into  cold  exposure 
 the  Wim  Hof  method  and  the  Wim  Hof 
 method  is  like  you'll  go  with
[211:47] instructors  and  climb  up  like  mountains 
 and  stuff  and  you'll  like  go  shirtless
[211:52] and  you'll  do  this  breathing  thing  which 
 will  help  you  like  release  trauma  and 
 cold  you  know  it  sounds  awesome  right  so 
 I'm  gonna  go  and  do  an  event  with  that
[211:58] so  it's  like  I'm  gonna  travel  I'm  gonna 
 get  the  flight  and  everything  but 
 there's  a  specific  like  learning  event
[212:04] that  I'm  going  for  I  think  traveling 
 just  for  the  sake  of  traveling  and  this 
 idea  of  being  a  digital  Nomad  I  don't
[212:10] think  it's  great  every  every  digital 
 Nomad  I  speak  to  or  that  I  see  their
[212:15] results  just  Pluto  you  just  don't  get 
 good  results  in  business  when  you're 
 being  a  digital  Nomad  you  just  don't
[212:20] it's  just  a  fact  as  it  is  but  don't  be  a 
 digital  Nomad  instead  work  super  hard  at
[212:26] home  in  your  environment  where  you  can 
 do  that  and  then  if  you  want  to  go  take 
 a  holiday  where  you  don't  even  look  at
[212:31] work  for  like  a  week  or  two  weeks  or 
 even  a  month  that's  fine  don't  think  to 
 yourself  again  I'll  just  take  my  laptop 
 and  I'll  stay  there  all  the  time  because
[212:36] then  it's  like  you're  in  this  place 
 which  should  be  enjoyed  but  hey  you  are 
 trying  to  cultivate  like  a  deep  work
[212:41] routine  when  there's  like  you  know 
 you're  there  hot  and  humid  in  this 
 exotic  country  it's  not  at  all  that  it's
[212:47] cracked  up  to  be  go  over  to  these 
 countries  for  a  specific  reason  so  for 
 example  if  I  really  wanted  to  I  don't
[212:53] think  that  you  know  it's  not  my  purpose 
 or  anything  but  if  my  purpose  became 
 like  oh  I  really  want  to  learn  about  the
[212:58] Thai  culture  and  I  want  to  learn  Muay 
 Thai  and  get  into  a  Muay  Thai  fight  then 
 go  into  Thailand  would  be  an  amazing
[213:03] reason  for  that  but  I  would  ask  you  not 
 to  cope  and  just  to  choose  some  random 
 desire  just  because  it  sounded  cool  and
[213:09] you  know  you  really  want  to  go  to 
 Thailand  with  Bali  or  whatever  and 
 rather  I  just  say  just  follow  your
[213:15] purpose  if  your  purpose  right  now  is 
 pure  just  work  and  business  and  money 
 just  stay  where  you  can  work  the  hardest
[213:22] don't  consider  going  somewhere  else 
 where  you're  not  going  to  work  as  hard 
 and  you're  not  going  to  have  as  great  of 
 a  routine  if  your  purpose  changes  and  it
[213:29] becomes  to  like  learn  this  a  particular 
 skill  then  go  where  that  skill  is
[213:34] learned  best 
 so  part  of  my  new  purpose  will  be  yoga
[213:39] because  I  want  to  be  able  to  get  like 
 really  flexible  and  also  to  be  able  to 
 actually  like  cultivate  my  breath
[213:44] through  my  entire  body  so  soon  I'm  gonna 
 go  move  right  next  like  a  yoga  studio  so
[213:49] I  can  go  and  train  for  hours  a  day  and 
 if  that  involves  traveling  to  a 
 different  country  then  for  like  some
[213:54] kind  of  intensive  yoga  Workshop  then  I 
 think  that's  an  awesome  reason  to  travel 
 I  think  traveling  just  for  like  no
[214:00] reason  other  than  like  haha  like  let's 
 go  to  Thailand  let's  go  to  Europe  guys 
 it's  I  just  think  it's  just  what  I've
[214:07] found  I'm  just  gonna  like  I  know  I'm 
 gonna  get  loads  of  hate  for  this  this 
 part  of  the  video  because  people  will 
 just  disagree  but  I  found  that  a  lot  of
[214:12] people's  pursuit  of  traveling  actually 
 comes  because  of  their  addiction  of
[214:17] dopamine  they  just  need  more  novelty 
 they  need  something  new  it's  like  oh 
 let's  go  to  this  place  and  let's  go  do
[214:23] something  like  let's  go  drinking  and  eat 
 stuff  there  and  like  let's  have  sex  with 
 the  girl  that  I'm  going  with  it's  it's
[214:28] just  dopamine  after  dopamine  after 
 dopamine  if  you  just  sit  still  and  just 
 ask  yourself  why  am  I  considering  going
[214:34] to  these  countries  if  there's  a  great 
 reason  that  arises  fine  but  like  I
[214:39] haven't  really  ever  met  anyone  who's 
 actually  had  such  a  great  reason 
 sometimes  there  is  you  know  for  example 
 this  someone  who  wants  to  study  the
[214:46] course  of  like  some  University  in  a 
 particular  place  okay  fine  you  want  to 
 move  over  maybe  for  taxes  or  something
[214:51] okay  fine  you  want  to  like  you  know  move 
 to  to  try  and  see  if  this  is  the  country 
 that  you  want  to  raise  your  children
[214:56] sounds  awesome  there's  a  particular 
 event  or  learning  or  skill  that  you  want 
 to  learn  awesome  digital  normally  like
[215:02] oh  I  want  to  move  and  just  like  you  know 
 work  on  my  laptop  it  it's  terrible  it's 
 so  terrible  out  the  reason  why  I'm
[215:08] saying  this  even  though  I  know  so  many 
 people  won't  understand  and  that  their 
 their  ears  will  just  be  closed  off  I
[215:13] wish  that  someone  spoke  to  younger  Hamza 
 like  this  because  I've  wasted  about 
 about  nine  months  of  my  life  traveling
[215:19] just  in  the  last  few  years  I've  wasted 
 nine  months  in  different  countries  when 
 I  was  in  a  work  mode  anyway  if  you're  in
[215:25] a  work  mode  just  stay  where  you  work 
 best  remember  the  travel  industry  is 
 huge  and  so  their  brainwashing  is  deep
[215:32] inside  of  your  mind  to  a  level  that  you 
 don't  even  understand  it  is  totally  like 
 a  normal  belief  for  you  that  once  you
[215:38] make  money  you  go  to  a  different  country 
 that  might  not  even  be  your  own 
 authentic  belief  you  should  question  it
[215:43] just  because  it's  what  you  see  other 
 people  doing  doesn't  mean  that  it's 
 actually  for  you  I'm  not  saying  don't 
 travel  at  all  don't  go  to  a  different
[215:48] country  but  I'm  just  saying  to  have  a 
 great  reason  the  next  level  of  spending 
 is  to  free  your  loved  ones  honestly  it
[215:54] takes  about  one  or  two  thousand  dollars 
 to  take  most  of  the  stress  away  from
[216:00] your  family  like  if  I'm  imagining  that 
 you're  somewhat  of  like  in  the  middle 
 you  know  your  family  aren't  rich  but
[216:05] your  family  aren't  like  fully  like 
 ghetto  broke  poor  but  somewhere  around 
 here  working  class  if  you  were  able  to
[216:11] give  your  parents  one  or  two  thousand 
 dollars  a  month 
 their  cortisol  would  probably  half  you
[216:17] know  koth  is  always  like  the  stress 
 hormone  if  we  like  got  a  blood  test 
 would  be  able  to  see  a  number  for  our
[216:22] cortisol  for  all  parents  it  would 
 probably  be  like  above  high  if  they're 
 waking  up  sleep  deprived  if  they're
[216:27] working  some  [ __ ]  job  they've  been  sleep 
 deprived  for  about  10  years 
 imagine  that  you  could  see  a  number  in
[216:33] their  blood  that  shows  their  stress  if 
 you  gave  them  one  or  two  thousand  a 
 month  it  gave  them  space  to  breathe  and
[216:39] not  need  to  like  feel  so  scared  of  like 
 you  know  rushing  and  trying  to  save 
 money  one  pound  here  one  dollar  here
[216:44] you'd  actually  see  that  causes  all 
 numbered  drop  by  like  half  with  1K  a
[216:49] month 
 it's  very  powerful  it's  like  a  very  like 
 low-hanging  fruit  that  you  could  use 
 that  still  have  to  work  the  current  you
[216:56] know  the  job  if  you  gave  them  like  1K  a 
 month  or  your  parents  probably  wouldn't 
 just  stop  working  they'd  still  work  the 
 same  job  but  it  gave  them  the  space  to
[217:01] breed  then  if  you  give  them  about  three 
 or  four  or  five  k  a  month  they  could
[217:06] actually  leave  this  job  that  they  don't 
 like  and  that  would  free  up  their  time 
 to  actually  find  like  what  kind  of
[217:11] person  they  are  and  this  is  a  very 
 interesting  experience  especially  for 
 our  parents  like  for  us  we've  kind  of
[217:18] come  into  adulthood  with  another 
 understanding  of  money  than  our  parents 
 have  haven't  we  we  kind  of  understand  a 
 lot  more  about  entrepreneurship  we
[217:24] understand  that  a  little  girl  on  Tick 
 Tock  can  make  more  money  than  a  doctor 
 our  parents  don't  know  that  and  so  our 
 parents  have  lived  this  life  where
[217:29] they've  worked  like  40  50  60  hour  weeks 
 for  the  last  few  decades
[217:34] they've  got  to  have  points  where  they 
 don't  even  know  themselves  they  don't 
 even  know  what  they  desire  your  dad 
 doesn't  even  know  his  purpose  he's  even
[217:40] for  like  he  hasn't  felt  his  purpose  in 
 decades
[217:46] so  it's  very  easy  to  improve  their  life 
 and  to  give  them  not  even  improve  their 
 life  but  to  give  them  life
[217:52] their  life 
 has  been  kind  of  like  a  mule  like  a 
 donkey  just  like  a  slave  a  slave  to  you
[217:59] when  you  really  see  like  how  your  father 
 and  your  mother  have  lived  from  most 
 young  men  it's  kind  of  like  they've 
 worked  as  slaves  for  you
[218:05] and  when  you're  able  to  free  them 
 they're  able  to  become  like  human  beings
[218:10] again 
 and  suddenly  when  you  do  get  to  this 
 point  when  you're  able  to  give  them  a
[218:15] few  thousand  a  month  you'll  see  that 
 they  had  interests  and  hobbies  that 
 they've  wanted  to  do  for  decades  that
[218:20] they  weren't  able  to  do  because  they 
 needed  to  prioritize  working  to  support 
 for  you
[218:25] and  so  it  was  at  this  point  when 
 I  basically  retired  everyone 
 that  my  dad  went  all  in  on  Cricket  and
[218:33] he  became  the  cricket  team  captain  and 
 he  practices  every  day  and  he  really 
 like  enjoys  it  I  assume  it's  like  the
[218:38] most  important  part  of  his  life  now  it's 
 like  I  feel  like  it's  his  purpose  he 
 mentioned  once  that  he  wants  to  become
[218:43] like  the  Umpire  like  kind  of  like  the  um 
 kind  of  like  the  the  referee  in  cricket
[218:48] and  that  like  it  just  makes  total  sense 
 it's  like  yeah  of  course  you  would 
 you've  liked  Cricket  all  your  life  and
[218:53] for  years  you  he  didn't  play  because  he 
 had  to  work  16  hours  a  day
[218:58] so  he  gets  to  go  and  pursue  something  he 
 actually  loves 
 and  when  you  do  that  it's  like  it's  it's
[219:04] like  this  sad  Bliss  feeling  like  kind  of 
 like  how  you  feel  when  you  think  about 
 Minecraft  it's  like  it's  it's  loving  but
[219:10] it's  also  sad  at  the  same  time  because 
 you  think  damn  like 
 you  really  like  lived  your  life  for  me
[219:15] didn't  you  [ __ ] 
 it's  a  very  sweet  experience  when  you 
 can  just  give  enough  to  your  parents
[219:20] that  they  don't  even  need  to  work  some 
 [ __ ]  job  that  they  don't  care  about  it's 
 crazy  to  think  that  their  entire  lives
[219:26] have  been  structured 
 to  just  make  money  for  you
[219:31] they've  been  on  this  this  purpose  layer 
 like  this  grind  of  making  money  and 
 they've  not  even  like  fulfilled  it
[219:38] they  were  just  able  to  maintain  for  the 
 last  few  while  and  with  the  money  that
[219:43] you  make  and  gives  to  the  family  you're 
 able  to  put  them  into  the  positive  which 
 is  really  nice  you  feel  awesome  you
[219:49] instantly  get  respect  from  everyone  in 
 your  family  you'll  notice  that  at  this 
 point
[219:55] the  family  arguments  cut  down  by  about 
 90  especially  with  you  like  no  one  ever
[220:00] really  argues  with  you  and  you're  the 
 one  like  essentially  paying  for 
 everything  paying  for  every  family 
 member  with
[220:06] no  one  argues  with  you  anymore  no  one 
 this  isn't  to  say  you  become  an  [ __ ] 
 but  rather  like  your  family  like  lose  a
[220:12] lot  of  the  tension  and  you  realize  that 
 the  a  lot  of  like  the  arguments  and 
 hostility  you  may  have  had  as  a  family 
 we're  actually  just  down  to  like
[220:18] financial  reasons  and  that  stops  which 
 is  just  so  awesome  to  to  see  the  next 
 level  of  spending  so  the  better  level  of
[220:24] spending  level  three  is  learning  skills 
 I've  actually  put  learning  skills  above
[220:29] freeing  your  family  so  it's  in  learning 
 skills  there's  higher  Roi  the  reason  why 
 is  because  you  are  the  money  maker  and
[220:35] anything  we  can  do  to  improve  your 
 ability  to  make  money  means  that  you've 
 got  more  to  give  to  other  people  so  this
[220:42] is  kind  of  like  the  saying  of  like 
 you've  got  to  fill  your  cup  before 
 filling  the  cups  of  others  if  the
[220:47] plane's  crashing  you  have  to  put  on  the 
 oxygen  mask  on  you  first  instead  of 
 others  even  though  we'd  like  to  be  that
[220:52] sort  of  heroic  guy  who  saves  the  other 
 person  you  can't  save  the  other  person 
 if  you  pass  out  so  it's  like  you  can't
[220:58] keep  providing  for  your  family  if  you 
 don't  continuously  level  up  your  skills 
 otherwise  you  know  the  nature  of
[221:03] business  is  like  everyone's  getting 
 better  everyone's  because  of  the  how 
 lethal  entrepreneurs  are  becoming  if  you
[221:09] don't  invest  in  your  skills  someone  else 
 will  overtake  you  in  the  money  you  can 
 give  to  your  family  goes  down  so  the
[221:14] priority  isn't  actually  to  give  money  to 
 your  family  the  priorities  to  use  money 
 to  actually  help  you  develop  more  it
[221:19] doesn't  sound  as  cool 
 but  it  is  actually  more  of  a  long-term 
 play  there's  a  really  interesting
[221:24] concept  I  want  to  walk  you  through  the 
 first  10  to  20  hours  of  learning  a  skill 
 you  will  literally  get  to  the  point
[221:30] where  you've  about  80  percent  mastered 
 it  so  a  master  is  someone  who's  done  10
[221:36] 000  hours  20  000  hours 
 in  20  hours  you  get  about  80  of  the  way
[221:41] there  so  if  we  take  three  guys  and  put 
 them  onto  a  basketball  court  one  guy  has
[221:46] never  learned  anything  about  basketball 
 he's  a  complete  beginner  this  is  his 
 first  session  the  other  guy  has  had  20
[221:51] hours  of  a  coach  giving  him  instructions 
 on  like  how  to  throw  the  ball  and  the 
 other  guy  is  a  professional  NBA  10  000
[221:58] hours  whatever  right  he's  been  playing 
 since  he  was  four  years  old  right  and  we 
 asked  him  okay  take  this  ball  throw  it
[222:03] into  the  hoop  a  hundred  times 
 the  professional  will  get  it  in  what 
 what  do  you  think  maybe  about
[222:09] 99.98  94  something  like  that  right  High 
 90s  right  the  complete  beginner  who's
[222:15] never  had  any  practice  would  probably 
 get  it  in  maybe  about  like  20  times 
 but  you  know  the  guy  who's  had  20  hours
[222:21] of  practice 
 he  would  get  it  in  about  80  85  times
[222:27] he  got  like  not  that  far  like  about  10 
 15  less  than  the  actual  Master  who's
[222:34] played  for  literally  a  hundred  times  or 
 a  thousand  times  more  hours
[222:39] you  can  imagine  the  difference  like 
 that's  [ __ ]  huge  right  you  can 
 literally  get  to  like  80  out  of  100  of
[222:45] like  this  free  throw  in  only  20  hours 
 you  get  most  of  the  gains  in  20  hours
[222:51] because  you  learn  so  much  in  those  first 
 few  hours  but  only  only  if  there's  one
[222:57] condition  which  is  met 
 there's  one  vital  condition  to  learning 
 and  this  is  why  it's  something  we  need
[223:03] to  spend  money  on  you  specifically  need 
 a  teacher  you  specifically  need  a  coach
[223:09] you  need  someone  who's  more  advanced 
 than  you  who's  giving  you  feedback  as
[223:14] you  do  the  thing  you  see  learning  by 
 reading  books  and  watching  videos  like 
 this  is  awesome  but  the  way  that  you
[223:19] learn  like  super  fast  you  know  that  20 
 hours  where  you  get  like  80  as  good  as  a 
 pro
[223:24] is  where  you  have  a  one-to-one  teacher 
 who's  literally  watching  you  whilst  you
[223:29] do  the  thing  so  imagine  your  trajectory 
 of  business  now  you've  watched  this  guy 
 you're  using  the  principles  right  and
[223:34] you're  gonna  make  some  progress  right 
 imagine  if  I  was  there  in  the  room  with
[223:39] you  for  20  hours  watching  you  implement 
 these  actionable  steps  and  watching  you 
 create  your  package  watching  you  create
[223:45] the  YouTube  video  imagine  if  I  was  sat 
 next  to  you  whilst  you  were  like 
 creating  a  YouTube  video  and  I  could
[223:50] constantly  keep  like  shouting  out  and 
 saying  no no  say  it  like  this  do  it  like 
 this  do  it  like  this  these  little  bits
[223:55] of  feedback  every  single  one  would  just 
 kind  of  bump  up  you're  learning  way  more 
 than  the  guy  who  might  watch  a  YouTube
[224:01] video  but  isn't  actually  getting  the 
 feedback  from  an  expert  this  is  how  you 
 put  your  learning  on  The  Fast  Track  and
[224:07] it's  learning  these  skills  that 
 increases  the  ceiling  to  how  much  money 
 you  make  but  also  just  how  much  progress
[224:12] you're  making  like  all  skills  even 
 business  or  non-business  related  the 
 most  powerful  thing  you  can  do  for
[224:17] learning  is  to  go  and  find  a  one-to-one 
 teacher  or  a  coach  and  pay  them  for
[224:22] about  10  to  20  hours  of  their  time  this 
 is  such  a  high  Roi  it's  insane  the  way
[224:28] that  you're  going  to  find  the  teacher  or 
 coach  the  way  that  I  do  it  is  I  will 
 read  books  on  a  certain  topic  so  for
[224:34] example  like  storytelling  I  tell  stories 
 at  the  start  of  every  one  of  my  videos 
 don't  I  I'll  go  and  find  a  good
[224:39] storytelling  book  find  one  that  is 
 actually  helping  me  that  I  like  I  like 
 you  know  the  author  is  writing  in  a  way
[224:45] that  resonates  for  me  I  use  the  advice 
 and  it  works  and  then  I  literally  just 
 go  and  contact  the  authors  like  you  can
[224:51] contact  authors  that  you  know  like 
 people  who  write  books  you  can  literally 
 just  search  their  name  on  Google  and 
 most  of  them  actually  do  coaching  so
[224:57] that's  how  I've  found  coaches  myself  I 
 find  an  awesome  book  and  I  literally 
 just  Google  the  author's  name  and  find
[225:02] their  website  and  I  just  send  them  an 
 email  saying  like  I  want  to  do  some 
 one-to-one  coaching  I  do  offer  that  and
[225:07] most  of  them  already  do  because  someone 
 else  has  already  mentioned  them  so  I 
 have  two  coaches  just  for  YouTube  I  have
[225:12] a  storytelling  coach  and  a  speech  coach 
 like  someone  who  helps  me  speak  better 
 and  I  literally  just  message  them  and
[225:17] just  got  their  hourly  rate  okay  then  I 
 said  can  we  do  10  pack  10  hours  can  we 
 do  20  hours  and  they  agreed  and  we  just
[225:23] hop  on  video  calls  once  a  week  or  twice 
 a  week  and  I  literally  like  share  my  my 
 uh  YouTube  script  like  the  video  script
[225:29] live  and  live  they'll  like  watch  me  type 
 in  what  I'm  about  to  say  for  like  you
[225:34] know  the  points  I'm  using  and  they'll 
 give  me  feedback  back  on  that  so  I  have 
 a  new  mindset  when  it  comes  to  learning
[225:39] skills  I  don't  even  like  learn  unless  I 
 can  go  and  get  a  one-to-one  teacher  so
[225:44] if  for  example  there's  something  I  want 
 to  do  like  right  now  I  want  to  do  yoga 
 it  feels  like  my  purpose  to  you  know 
 free  my  body  and  stuff  I'm  not  gonna  do
[225:50] it  just  yet  I'm  waiting  for  the  next  few 
 days  because  I'm  gonna  soon  go  and  like 
 move  close  to  the  yoga  place  I'm  not
[225:56] even  gonna  go  and  practice  it  by  myself 
 just  yet  this  is  like  a  very  like 
 privileged  little  stubborn  place  to  be
[226:01] but  in  my  perception  it's  like  it's 
 almost  a  waste  of  time  to  learn  a  new 
 skill  if  you  can  afford  to  just  go  and
[226:07] get  a  teacher  so  there's  like  three 
 levels  one  would  be  for  example  you  read 
 or  you  watch  a  YouTube  video  let's  say
[226:13] on  yoga  right  so  you're  watching  the 
 stretch  routine  and  you  practice  it 
 yourself  the  next  thing  would  be  when
[226:18] you  go  physically  to  like  a  class  or  you 
 go  to  a  yoga  class  and  there's  you  and 
 like  five  or  ten  students  in  the  yoga
[226:24] teacher  and  for  the  entire  lesson  maybe 
 it  comes  up  to  you  once  and  tells  you 
 like  one  bit  of  feedback  okay  do  this  do
[226:30] this  thing  then  the  ultimate  lesson  is 
 when  you  just  do  a  one-to-one  and  it's  a 
 little  you  and  the  teacher  and  he  he
[226:36] tells  you  in  that  hour  like  20  50 
 different  things  that  you  can  do  to 
 improve  it's  those  bits  of  feedback  that
[226:44] is  actually  how  you  learn  just  doing  the 
 thing  gives  you  some  progress  but  it's 
 the  feedback  that  actually  puts  your
[226:50] learning  on  steroids  and  you  can  mix 
 this  with  traveling  so  you  can  go  and 
 see  if  there's  like  intensive  workshops
[226:55] events  that  you  can  go  and  attend  maybe 
 there's  some  for  business  maybe  there's 
 some  for  like  even  weight  lifting  or
[227:01] something  you  go  to  these  events  and 
 it's  usually  like  an  intensive  Training 
 Day  where  they'll  have  a  teacher  who 
 will  give  you  a  bunch  of  advice  so  the
[227:07] Wim  Hof  method  has  like  these  um  travel 
 with  instructors  or  these  Advanced 
 workshops  that  you  can  go  travel  to  and
[227:13] you'll  have  someone  who's  like  a  pro  who 
 will  watch  you  get  into  like  an  ice  bath 
 and  tell  you  the  way  to  breathe  Alex
[227:18] hamosi  talks  about  this  a  lot  that 
 spending  money  on  leveling  up  your 
 skills  is  one  of  the  like  the  highest
[227:24] rois  you  can  get  so  go  ahead  and  don't 
 be  scared  of  buying  like  the  one-to-one 
 coaching  personal  training  courses
[227:31] workshops  events  mentorship 
 um  communities  all  these  like  random
[227:37] things  courses  and  everything  don't  be 
 scared  of  investing  in  your  education 
 and  in  your  skills  because  these  these
[227:42] often  have  the  highest  rois  and  again 
 this  is  exactly  what  we  have  in  Adonis 
 school  just  let  me  just  sell  you  done  a
[227:48] school  just  quick  you  can  skip  30 
 seconds  if  you  want  but  I  think  this  is 
 really  interesting  the  way  that  Adonis 
 School  works  is  that  everyone  joins  they
[227:53] pay  the  joining  fee  then  they  pay  99  a 
 month  after  that  and  you  only  pay  99  a 
 month  like  recurring  right  but  the  more
[227:59] students  that  we  get  the  more  money  that 
 I'm  making  the  more  that  I'm  putting  it 
 back  inside  of  Adonis  school  so  before
[228:04] we  know  it  we've  got  five  teachers  we've 
 got  six  teachers  like  these  live  coaches 
 teachers  who  are  experts  in  their  field
[228:09] so  our  students  are  only  paying  99  a 
 month  but  they're  getting  access  to  like 
 five  different  teachers  and  my  goal  is
[228:14] to  get  that  to  more  like  10  teachers  so 
 that  with  your  same  99  a  month 
 membership  you've  got  access  to  so  many
[228:20] different  teachers  that  you're  in  like 
 three  calls  a  day  which  usually  you'd  be 
 paying  like  hundreds  per  call  and
[228:26] because  of  the  way  the  business  model 
 works  you  can  if  you  can  wrap  your  mind 
 around  that  the  business  model  is  really
[228:31] positive  because  all  the  money  that 
 these  students  are  paying  goes  to  me  I'm
[228:37] able  to  hire  these  teachers  for  a  few 
 grand  a  month  to  give  you  know  one  or 
 two  calls  a  week  for  example  but  the
[228:43] students  are  only  paying  99  a  month 
 for  me  for  my  coaches  it's  like  250
[228:49] dollars  per  hour  that  I  pay  and  yet  the 
 students  are  getting  access  to  like  five
[228:55] teachers  for  99  a  month  so  it's  a  very 
 positive  feedback  loop  if  you're 
 interested  in  that  and  that  we've  got
[229:01] teachers  for  business  for  sleeping  for 
 masculinity  for  finding  your  purpose 
 spirituality  at  other  school  is  the  top
[229:07] Link  in  the  description  the  next  level 
 of  spending  money  is  spending  to  improve 
 your  health  you've  heard  so  much  and
[229:13] you've  probably  said  it  yourself  that 
 health  is  the  priority  maybe  your  big 
 Focus  right  now  is  your  work  money
[229:18] Fitness  whatever  it  is  with  your  health 
 you  do  everything  better
[229:24] and  I  can't  help  but  think  about  the 
 time  with  my  health  drastically  got
[229:29] worse  you  don't  often  hear  of  like  a 
 young  guy  tell  you  this  do  you  but 
 there's  been  like  two  moments  of  my  life
[229:34] where 
 I'll  tell  you  about  both  of  them  okay  in
[229:39] 2020  early  2020  January  February 
 I  had  been  living  like  a  degenerate  for
[229:46] the  last  like  nine  months  I'd  been 
 smoking  weed  every  single  day  I  had  been
[229:51] like  in  this  relationship  with  this  girl 
 that  I  was  living  with  who  I  didn't  even 
 trust  or  like  or  you  know  want  to  be
[229:57] with  but  I  was  so  afraid  of  breaking  up 
 with  them  we  lived  together  I  was  eating 
 junk  food  every  single  day  and  then  when
[230:03] covid  started  and  a  lockdown  happened 
 then  I  stopped  exercising  completely  and 
 literally  all  I  was  doing  was  just
[230:08] indulging  watching  content  watching 
 movies  smoking  weed  playing  video  games
[230:13] and  everything 
 and  I  remember  my  mental  health  getting 
 like  really  really  bad
[230:19] really  bad  that  I  couldn't  help  but  get 
 negative  thoughts  all  the  time  I  could
[230:24] wake  up 
 and 
 I  you  know  I'd  smoke  first  thing  in  the 
 morning
[230:30] I'd  be  fapping 
 I'd  go  and  like  sit  on  the  toilet  and
[230:35] literally  just  like  scroll  and  look  at 
 like  Instagram  girls  and  fap  like 
 literally  within  the  first  hour  like
[230:41] it's  part  of  my  morning  routine
[230:46] playing  video  games  for  hours  like  my 
 girlfriend  at  the  this  girl  I  was  living
[230:51] with  she  was  like  a  gamer  girl  like 
 alongside  me  so  we  both  used  to  play 
 and  um  it  was  just  so  depressing  like
[230:58] there  was  nothing  that  was  happening 
 there  was  no  growth  no  progress  no 
 nothing  productive  that  we  were  doing
[231:04] and  I  remember  just  my  mental  health  was 
 so  bad  then  my  girlfriend  got  a  message
[231:11] from  my  father 
 he  wanted  to  message  me  but  I  had  him
[231:16] and  the  rest  of  my  family  blocked  for 
 the  last  year 
 it's  one  whole  year  like  my  family
[231:22] weren't  able  to  contact  me 
 because  we  had  like  a  massive  argument 
 and  I  realized  like  you  know  I  hated
[231:27] them  and  everything  and  so  I  blocked 
 them  all  kept  on  deleting  their  numbers 
 kept  you  know  they'd  message  me  with 
 like  a  new  number  I  kept  on  blocking  it
[231:33] blocking  it  blocking  it 
 and  eventually  she  receives  a  message 
 from  my  father  saying  that  they're  just
[231:38] worried  about  me  and  that  they  wanted  to 
 let  me  know  that  my  brother  was  getting
[231:43] married 
 and  honestly  it  hit  me  like  a  ton  of 
 bricks  here  I  was  with  pure  anxiety  and
[231:49] depression  for  the  last  like  year 
 but  life  moves  on
[231:55] I  felt  so  horrible  and  I  was  I  was  like 
 stressed  and  anxious  and  so  sad  and
[232:00] depressed  and  not  to  mention  that  then 
 when  a  covert  did  happen  it  was  like  the
[232:05] most  stressful  period  of  my  life  because 
 I  was  working  in  a  homeless 
 accommodation  shelter  and  I  was  like
[232:10] helping  one  of  the  guys  there  to  like 
 not  be  like  on  the  Street  Homeless  and 
 that  was  like  super  stressful  for  me  I
[232:15] remember  I  would  literally  like  wake  up 
 in  the  middle  of  the  night  drenched  like
[232:20] wet  in  sweat  like  literally  imagine 
 you've  got  a  water  bottle  imported  there
[232:25] was  fully  like  it  was  the  bed  would  be 
 soaked  because  of  how  stressed  I  was  I 
 would  sleepless  nights  and  I  don't  blame
[232:31] her  for  this  but  like  she  used  to  get 
 pissed  off  at  me  because  I'd  be  so  like 
 wet  and  uncomfortable  at  night  time  and
[232:36] everything  and  so  she'd  be  like  pushing 
 me  away  and  it  was  a  very  like  lonely 
 time  and  I  never  contemplated  suicide
[232:43] but  I  don't  think  I  would  have  been  like 
 that  far  from  the  point  of  like  where 
 those  thoughts  would  have  come  into  my
[232:49] mind 
 and  self-improvement  really  saved  me 
 there 
 and  the  next  time  where  my  health  was
[232:55] really  bad  it  was  in  uh  late  2022  this
[233:00] year  just  gone 
 I  had  moved  from  like  the  countryside  of
[233:05] the  UK  and  we  moved  directly  to  London 
 and  it  was  like  a  really  overwhelming
[233:11] for  me  I've  never  lived  in  like  the  big 
 big  city  before  I'm  always  I'm  quite 
 like  a  natural  simple  guy  so  I  live  in
[233:17] like  a  town  next  to  families  and  schools 
 and  everything 
 but  I  thought  you  know  I'll  be  a
[233:22] business  is  booming  I'm  making  you  know 
 a  lot  of  money  and  stuff  let's  go  get  an 
 apartment  in  London  because  that's  what 
 you're  supposed  to  do  when  you  move  out
[233:27] and  stuff  and  it  was  just  instantly  like 
 just  very  overwhelming  like  dizzying
[233:32] it's  not  for  me  and  then  from  that  point 
 I  decided  to  move  to  Dubai  and  that's 
 when  things  got  so  much  worse  before  I
[233:38] know  it  I  was  waking  up  every  single  day 
 with  a  headache  every  single  day  with 
 like  nosebleeds  I  track  my  uh  my  health
[233:45] I'm  not  wearing  it  right  now  but  I 
 usually  have  like  a  whoop  strap  on  or  an 
 aura  ring  and  you  literally  saw  all  my
[233:51] health  stats  just  go  like  that  in  those 
 months  that  I  I  moved  over  to  Dubai
[233:56] super  stressful  time  business  isn't 
 doing  so  well  relationship  with  my 
 girlfriend's  falling  apart  it  was  like  a
[234:01] horrible  time 
 foreign
[234:10] you  can't  even 
 do  anything  else  even  if  work  is  your 
 priority  with  poor  health  it  takes  you
[234:17] away  from  work 
 when  you  have  a  woman  that  you  love  with 
 poor  health  you  turn  into  an  [ __ ]
[234:24] towards  her 
 you  can't  be  productive  you  can't  be
[234:29] focused  your  brain  doesn't  work  as  well 
 and  so  any  money  that  you  can  spend  to 
 improve  your  health  is  really  high  Roi
[234:35] so  I  want  to  tell  you  specifically  some 
 products  I'm  not  going  to  like  link 
 affiliate  links  or  anything  I'm  just 
 going  to  mention  them  to  you  products
[234:41] that  have  really  helped  me 
 the  eighth  sleep  is  a  very  expensive
[234:46] product  it's  like  two  thousand  dollars 
 it's  like  a  mattress  topper  that 
 regulates  your  temperature  and  it  just
[234:51] means  that  like  you'll  sleep  better 
 because  your  mattress  normally  will  be 
 like  too  warm  with  this  it's  like  an  AI
[234:57] system  that  I  can  track  your  body  heat 
 and  then  perfectly  aligns  your 
 temperature  to  it  it's  two  thousand
[235:02] dollars  so  it's  unaffordable  for  most 
 people  but  as  you  begin  to  make  more 
 money  if  you  want  to  invest  in  your 
 sleep  this  will  improve  your  sleep  by
[235:07] like  10  20  every  night  that  you  sleep  on 
 it  maybe  a  higher  quality  mattress  like
[235:12] the  eight  sleep  is  like  a  mattress 
 topper  but  an  actual  higher  quality 
 mattress  I  went  to  one  of  those  local
[235:17] like  the  the  big  stores  dream  or 
 whatever  it  was  I  went  there  and  they 
 like  literally  like  you  just  go  into
[235:23] like  I'm  looking  for  a  new  mattress  this 
 is  the  size  that  I  want  and  with  a  lot 
 of  these  like  big  mattress  companies
[235:28] they'll  make  you  go  into  like  some 
 scanner  thing  where  you  just  like 
 pretend  to  sleep  and  they'll  find  out 
 which  one's  perfect  for  you  and  a  lady
[235:34] showed  me  around  like  a  bunch  of  beds 
 let  me  try  them  on  and  there  was  one 
 that  fit  just  perfectly  and  my  sleep  has
[235:39] improved  since  then  and  even  pillows 
 like  be  honest  with  you  sleeping  on  the 
 same  shitty  pillow  from  the  last  like
[235:44] years  and  years  and  you  know  that  it's 
 not  even  that  like  not  nice  but  you're 
 just  like  you  just  keep  procrastinating
[235:49] getting  a  different  one  trying  one  out 
 spending  a  day  to  end  up  maybe  a  hundred 
 dollars  or  something  to  go  try  out  like
[235:55] a  bunch  of  pillows  to  the  one  that  you 
 find  that  is  absolutely  perfect 
 your  sleep  is  going  to  improve  by  like
[236:00] five  percent  straight  after  that  and 
 then  I  have  a  bunch  of  supplements  I 
 have  this  uh  subscription  supplement
[236:06] which  is  called  bionic  bio  Nick 
 and  they  they  um do  a  blood  test  and
[236:12] then  they  find  out  which  like  nutrients 
 you  need  and  then  they  just  send  it  to 
 you  every  month  so  I've  got  like  a  bunch 
 of  bottles  over  there  I've  got  some
[236:18] premium  uh  fish  oil  as  well  probiotics 
 also  higher  quality  food  I  get  all  of  my
[236:23] food  delivered  I  don't  like  go  to  the 
 grocery  store  or  anything  I  don't  even 
 buy  from  grocery  stores  because  that's
[236:28] like  no  offense  it's  like  it's  it's  like 
 normal  mediocre  people  food  when  you  go
[236:33] to  like  a  normal  grocery  store  so  I  buy 
 my  stuff  directly  from  the  Farms  I  only 
 eat  like  single  ingredients  and  so  from
[236:40] the  Farms  who  have  like  the  pasta  fed 
 cows  I  buy  their  beef  it  gets  delivered
[236:46] to  my  house  you  can  do  this  in  the  UK 
 you  can  just  search  like  farms  near  me 
 and  usually  they've  got  websites  where
[236:51] they're  literally  come  and  like  deliver 
 you  meat  fresh  directly  from  them  and
[236:56] cutting  out  the  middleman  of  the 
 supermarket  where  they  put  in  all  the 
 extra  like  processing  packaging 
 everything  you  can  even  find  the  Farms
[237:02] who  won't  even 
 um  make  their  meat  touch  Plastics  or 
 anything  like  that  so  there's  less
[237:07] estrogens  the  Farms  that  you  know 
 promise  no  home  hormones  everything  like 
 that  so  it  isn't  that  much  more
[237:12] expensive  like  my  steak  cost  me  like 
 eight  pounds  you  go  to  like  a  cheap 
 grocery  store  it's  probably  like  five
[237:17] dollars  or  six  pounds  or  something  it's 
 not  that  much  more  expensive  my  health 
 has  improved  significantly  because  of
[237:22] that  also  talking  about  estrogenics  I've 
 mentioned  a  few  times  on  my  videos  what 
 they  are  estrogenics  are  like  these
[237:27] Plastics  and  chemicals  in  the 
 environment  which  mimic  estrogen  and 
 essentially  like  [ __ ]  up  your  health  as
[237:33] a  man  it's  estrogen  so  you  get  [ __ ] 
 titties  and  everything  it  lowers  your 
 testosterone  your  fertility  and  it's  all
[237:39] around  you  it's  all  in  like  it's  in  your 
 drinking  water  it's  in  the  Plastics  that
[237:45] you  touch 
 and  so  with  money  you  can  afford  to  buy 
 like  estrogen  free  products  like  for
[237:50] example  I  don't  use  like  any  kind  of 
 normal  skin  care  products  or  or  tooth
[237:55] paste  or  anything  like  that  shower  stuff 
 all  of  my  stuff  is  like  estrogenic  free 
 I  also  have  a  reverse  osmosis  water
[238:01] filter  installed  into  my  house  it's  not 
 as  complicated  as  it  seems  but  if  you  go 
 onto  Amazon  and  search  for  r  o  reverse
[238:08] osmosis  water  filter  you'll  see  that 
 they're  like  a  few  hundred  dollars  and 
 you  might  need  to  like  pay  someone  some
[238:13] I  don't  know  I  think  my  dad  did  it  for 
 me  but  like  you  might  need  to  like  pay 
 someone  like  fifty  dollars  to  come
[238:18] around  that  again  is  like  that's  gonna 
 filter  out  the  water  so  you're  not 
 drinking  water  that's  got  estrogenics  in
[238:24] so  like  a  testosterone  is  not  being 
 affected  because  tap  water  is  not  even 
 like  safe  to  drink  how  [ __ ]  is  that
[238:29] people  don't  even  know  this  and  for  500 
 you  can  save  yourself 
 when  you  live  with  your  woman
[238:35] and  you  want  to  get  pregnant  and  have  a 
 child  with  her 
 you  know  she's  drinking  like  poisoned
[238:41] birth  control  water 
 think  about  how  mad  this  is  there's 
 literally  like  birth  control  hormones
[238:47] you  know  the  pill  that  women  take  a  lot 
 of  women  take  every  day  that's  not 
 filtered  out  from  the  water  system  and
[238:52] so  when  you  drink  tap  water  that's 
 literally  like  it's  not  filtered  out  so 
 you're  drinking  [ __ ]  birth  control 
 which  is  [ __ ]  up  your  your  health
[238:58] when  your  woman  drinks  it  when  she's 
 pregnant  with  your  child  she's  drinking 
 birth  control  while  she's  pregnant  your
[239:05] child  is  in  her  stomach  and  she's 
 drinking  the 
 like  the  diluted  version  of  the  pill
[239:10] that  women  take  to  to  not  be  able  to 
 have  children
[239:17] five  hundred  dollars  to  potentially  save 
 a  [ __ ]  miscarriage
[239:22] that's  a  high  Roi
[239:30] you  can  see  why  I  think  this  is  one  of 
 the  best  ways  to  spend  money  is  make 
 sure  your  health  is  top  tier  health
[239:37] coaches  as  well  you  can  go  find  like 
 online  pts  and  everything  kind  of  relate 
 it's  like  the  skill  section  but  you  can
[239:42] go  find  some  teachers  and  some  coaches 
 who  will  literally  look  after  your  sleep 
 they'll  track  if  like  you  know  they'll 
 get  all  the  data  from  like  you  wearing
[239:48] the  ring  and  they'll  tell  you  okay  yeah 
 try  this  try  drinking  this  tea  let's  see 
 the  stats  and  everything  that  can  be
[239:53] powerful  and  even  private  healthcare  in 
 the  UK  we  have  the  NHS  but  it's  not  very
[239:59] good  and  so  I  only  go  private  I  had  a 
 surgery  recently  for  varica  like  I  had 
 this  thing  which  you  might  even  have
[240:05] which  is  like  the  veins  in  your 
 testicles  are  like  too  big  and  it  causes 
 like  too  much  heat  which  lowers
[240:10] testosterone  and  fertility  and  to  get  an 
 appointment  with  the  NHS  would  have 
 taken  like  six  months
[240:16] you  pay  private  pay  four  thousand  pounds 
 the  surgeries  next  week
[240:23] very  powerful  and  level  5  the  best  use 
 of  money  possible  in  my  opinion  Saving
[240:31] Time  spending  money  to  save  your  time  is 
 the  highest  Roi  thing  because  with  your
[240:36] time  then  you  can  do  everything  else  so 
 all  of  the  other  levels  here  are 
 unlocked  when  you've  got  the  free  time
[240:42] to  pursue  them  so  this  is  literally  the 
 priority  any  money  you  can  spend  to  save 
 your  time  is  very  powerful  and  I
[240:48] realized  this  as  I  was  becoming  an 
 entrepreneur  in  2019  when  I  was  playing 
 with  this  idea  of  becoming  an
[240:53] entrepreneur  I  realized  what  I  was  going 
 to  do  I  was  going  to  save  up  some  money
[240:58] and  invest  that  but  not  in  real  estate 
 not  in  like  you  know  the  the  stocks  or
[241:03] crypto  or  any  [ __ ]  like  that  but 
 rather  just  keep  it  in  my  bank  account 
 and  essentially  view  it  as  an  investment
[241:10] for  the  next  like  three  months  of  Runway 
 so  I  didn't  need  to  work  a  job
[241:16] mark  my  words  when  I  say  this  this  is 
 going  to  sound  weird  but  because  no  one 
 else  has  said  this  before  but  mark  my
[241:21] words  the  greatest  investment  that  you 
 could  possibly  make  is  saving  up  a
[241:27] couple  of  months  of  expenses  and  then 
 being  able  to  quit  your  job  and  give 
 yourself  some  Runway  so  that  you  can  go
[241:32] and  start  a  business 
 the  greatest  investment  is  one  in  your
[241:37] time  this  doesn't  sound  as  cool  of  like 
 an  investment  as  real  estate  but  if  you 
 save  up  like  2  000  pounds  and  you  don't
[241:44] need  to  work  for  the  next  like  six 
 months  because  you  live  at  home  with 
 family  so  you've  got  like  no  expenses
[241:49] you've  just  given  yourself  six  months  of 
 life
[241:54] can  you  comprehend  that  you've  just 
 given  yourself  six  months  of  Life  of 
 like  40  hours  or  50  hours  a  week
[242:00] including  commutes  just  gone  you  don't 
 need  to  work  that  anymore  for  any  guys 
 out  there  who  are  working  full-time  at  a
[242:06] job  that  they  hate  this  is  the  greatest 
 move  they  could  pull  this  save  up  a  few 
 thousand  pounds  just  move  back  to  your
[242:11] parents  if  you  need  to  save  up  like  six 
 months  worth  of  your  bills  and  literally 
 just  go  all  in  on  your  business  don't
[242:17] work  a  normal  shitty  job  just  go  all  in 
 on  your  business  for  like  six  months  to 
 save  your  time  you  can  also  get  services
[242:22] like  meal  prep  so  I  had  one  where  they 
 would  deliver  it  to  me  like  every  week
[242:28] and  they'd  be  like  20  meals  I'd  have 
 like  three  a  day  or  something  and  that 
 means  that  you  don't  need  to  go  shopping 
 for  groceries  because  it  gets  delivered
[242:34] to  you  and  you  just  you  know  choose  the 
 one  that  you  want  on  the  website  it 
 means  that  you  don't  even  need  to  cook 
 because  you  just  put  it  in  the  oven  for
[242:39] like  15  minutes  instead  of  you  needing 
 to  like  chop  things  or  prepare  things 
 it's  literally  just  ready  to  go  in  the 
 oven  and  it  even  means  you  don't  even
[242:45] need  to  clean  up  because  the  little  car 
 body  like  thing  that  like  the  bowl  of  it 
 you  just  throw  it  away  afterwards
[242:51] there's  no  cleaning  up  with  the  washing 
 up  liquid  or  anything  like  that  it  will 
 literally  save  you  about  500  hours  a
[242:57] year 
 that's  [ __ ]  huge  hiring  people  to  do
[243:02] things  so  that  you  don't  need  to  do  them 
 will  also  save  you  time  the  best  hire 
 that  I  can  think  of  for  you  it's  gonna
[243:08] sound  super  odd 
 it's  to  hire  a  sibling  specifically  a
[243:13] sibling  or  a  family  member  who  lives  in 
 your  home  because  if  you  like  the 
 conventional  advice  people  will  say  is
[243:18] like  oh  yeah  hire  a  personal  assistant 
 but  there's  a  lot  of  friction  so  that 
 you  you  don't  even  know  how  it  works 
 it's  a  bit  complicated  do  you  want  to
[243:24] give  them  your  card  details  but  if  you 
 hire  your  sibling  and  you  literally  say 
 to  your  sibling  like  save  me  time  and
[243:30] I'll  give  you  a  few  hundred  pounds  a 
 month  they  probably  do  it  or  maybe  your 
 father  would  probably  do  it  right  and  it
[243:36] means  that  they  could  do  all  your  chores 
 for  you  it  means  that  they  can  even  like 
 you  know  look  at  your  emails  and  make
[243:41] sure  if  there's  anything  important  they 
 send  it  to  you  if  it's  not  important  you 
 don't  even  ever  look  at  your  emails  like 
 I  haven't  been  on  my  emails  in  about  two
[243:47] years  now  my  sister  for  example  she  even 
 does  like  some  of  the  YouTube  stuff  so 
 when  my  videos  are  done  she'll  schedule
[243:52] it  for  me  so  it  saves  me  a  few  minutes 
 there  my  water  bottles  she'll  literally 
 just  walk  into  my  room  take  my  water
[243:57] bottles  go  and  fill  them  up  and  bring 
 them  back  up  again  minutes  here  minutes 
 here  minutes  here  she  checks  my  emails 
 or  even  my  post  she'll  open  it  as  well
[244:03] and  like  if  it's  something  important 
 she'll  come  give  it  to  me  if  it's  not  I 
 don't  need  to  see  it  it  sounds  odd  but
[244:08] it's  like  paying  your  siblings  or  one  of 
 your  family  members  maybe  even  your 
 mother  or  something  and  just  telling
[244:14] them  like  I  just  want  to  focus  on  my 
 business  as  much  as  possible  if  you  can 
 save  me  10  20  30  minutes  a  few  different
[244:20] times  in  the  day  if  you  can  just  make 
 the  food  and  literally  bring  it  up  to  me 
 if  when  I  want  like  a  cup  of  tea  or
[244:25] coffee  you  would  just  make  it  and  it 
 wouldn't  feel  kind  of  weird  between  us 
 for  you  being  servants  or  anything  but 
 you  would  be  like  happy  to  do  it  to  kind
[244:31] of  support  me  just  do  that  I  think 
 specifically  hiring  like  a  family  member 
 is  valuable  because  they're  already  in
[244:37] the  house  they're  all  ready  they  get 
 this  intimate  level  where  like  you  know 
 a  personal  assistant  online  can  do  some
[244:42] emails  and  stuff  but  a  sibling  in  your 
 house  can  literally  like 
 Hoover  your  room  and  can  get  your
[244:48] clothes  ready  and  can  fill  up  your  water 
 bottles  and  save  you  five  minutes  here 
 10  minutes  here  five  minutes  here  that
[244:53] sounds  like  small  amounts  this  is  how 
 you  get  to  the  next  level  you  prioritize 
 your  time  you  put  your  time  into  your
[244:58] business  to  do  those  deep  work  tasks  you 
 can  also  invest  in  a  home  gym  you  don't 
 need  a  full-on  setup  all  you  actually
[245:04] really  need  is  two  kettlebells  so  I  just 
 went  on  Amazon  I  searched  for 
 kettlebells  I  got  20  kg  and  I  literally
[245:09] just  did  like  an  eight  minute  workout 
 every  day  instead  of  doing  my  normal 
 like  one  and  a  half hour  of  routine  and
[245:15] you  know  you  need  to  get  ready  and  go  to 
 the  gym  and  everything  the  most  progress 
 I've  ever  made  in  business  was  earlier
[245:20] this  year  when  I  stopped  going  to  the 
 gym  and  all  I  was  doing  was  like  those 
 home  workouts  quick  five  ten  minutes  a
[245:25] day  and  then  back  to  work  again  and  you 
 might  be  wondering  about  the  actual 
 Investments  so  people  talk  about  crypto
[245:31] and  real  estate  and  stocks  I've  always 
 had  a  very  different  opinion  about  that 
 and  I'll  just  give  you  mine  you  might
[245:37] want  to  take  someone  else's  advice  but 
 this  is  what  served  me  well  I  don't 
 think  it's  worth  looking  into  investing
[245:42] money  like  real  estate  because  when  you 
 become  a  businessman  the  truth  is  that 
 the  highest  just  Roi  you're  going  to  get
[245:48] is  first  of  all  on  yourself  like  on 
 these  levels  you  know  Saving  Time  health 
 and  everything  right  and  your  skills  but
[245:54] after  that  it's  like  just  spend  more 
 money  on  your  business  the  highest  Roi 
 you're  going  to  get  is  if  you  just  hire
[246:00] more  people  spend  more  money  on  your 
 business  pay  for  like  advertisements 
 learn  those  things  it's  such  a  higher
[246:07] Roi  than  just  buying  it  you  know  like 
 what  your  parents  would  suggest  or  what 
 some  YouTuber  tells  you  like  yeah  our
[246:12] real  estate's  so  awesome  and  this  is 
 awesome  you  know  why  because  the  best 
 investment  advice  that  I  have  seen
[246:17] online  so  far  is  to  invest  in  the  things 
 that  you  actually  know  too  many  young
[246:23] people  are  being  told  they  get  invest  in 
 stocks  invest  in  real  estate  be  honest 
 bro  do  you  really  understand  real  estate
[246:29] do  you  really  understand  like  the 
 infrastructure  of  a  house  what  materials 
 it's  made  if  it's  triple  glazed  or
[246:35] quadruple  glazed  windows  and  how  much 
 that  will  change  its  ability  to  sell  10 
 years  from  now  do  you  really  understand
[246:40] like  the  market  of  like  a  city  if  you  do 
 fair  enough  but  for  most  guys  it's  like 
 you  probably  don't  and  you're  probably
[246:46] just  thinking  like  oh  but  I  thought  you 
 know  I  could  just  rent  it  out  and  you 
 know  every  year  the  price  goes  up  right 
 I  don't  think  that's  a  good  idea  because
[246:51] do  you  really  want  to  be  powerless  in 
 your  Investments  you  buy  a  house  if  your 
 whole  country's  Market  goes  down  like
[246:56] you  didn't  get  any  control  of  that  you 
 buy  a  stock  or  index  funds  and  other
[247:01] people  are  controlling  the  the  price  of 
 it  crypto  it's  like  nobody  [ __ ]  knows 
 like  what  the  hell  is  happening  with  the
[247:07] price  of  crypto  but  with  your  own 
 business  you  reinvested  in  that  you  look 
 for  ways  that  you  could  spend  money  in 
 your  own  business  and  you  can  forcefully
[247:14] make  your  business  worth  more 
 so  to  date  even  though  I  make  like  a
[247:19] fair  amount  of  money  I'm  not  even 
 considering  any  kind  of  normal 
 investments  just  putting  it  back  into
[247:25] the  business  why  invest  in  real  estate 
 when  you've  got  a  business  and  you've 
 got  all  that  extra  [ __ ]  to  think  about 
 like  where's  the  house  and  you  know  it's
[247:30] kind  of  new  dopamine  where  it's  like  oh 
 yeah  I'm  gonna  make  so  much  money  you 
 know  house  prices  always  go  up  but  then
[247:35] you  have  to  go  and  find  the  house  then 
 you've  got  to  go  and  find  like  the  way 
 to  rent  it  out  and  you've  got  like  these 
 people  coming  in  into  the  house  and
[247:41] they've  made  some  damages  and  this  and 
 this  and  here  you  are  literally  like 
 you've  got  this  business  and  you're 
 spending  more  time  literally  fighting
[247:47] over  the  house  which  you're  getting  like 
 700  a  month  in  rent  oh  but  it  goes  up  by
[247:52] like  30  000  a  year  that's  3K  a  month  bro 
 by  this  point  when  you  can  afford  the
[247:58] house  your  business  is  probably  doing  10 
 15  20K  a  month  why  would  you  wanna  like 
 like  deviate  your  attention  away  I've
[248:04] seen  I've  never  understood  it  so  I'm  not 
 going  to  advise  you  to  to  get  into 
 normal  Investments  like  everyone  else 
 would  my  advice  to  you  is  literally  just
[248:10] keep  investing  back  into  your  business 
 step  14  and  now  you  realize  the  truth
[248:15] props  it  might  take  you  a  few  years  to 
 get  to  this  point  I  hope  that  it  doesn't 
 take  you  much  longer  than  that  but  you
[248:20] will  realize  at  a  certain  point  if  you 
 allow  yourself  to  if  you  take  a  step
[248:25] back  from  your  work  and  sometimes  you  go 
 out  into  the  mountains  and  you  you 
 broaden  your  horizon  like  your  visual
[248:31] spatial  field 
 you'll  start  to  get  the  thoughts  that 
 like  working  so  hard  and  making  more
[248:37] money  isn't  actually  as  productive  as 
 you  think  it  is  what  I'm  saying  right 
 now  will  scare  you  and  cause  fear  inside
[248:43] of  you  maybe  some  kind  of  sadness  or 
 agitation  I  don't  expect  you  to  listen 
 to  this  right  now  but  if  you  just  Heed
[248:49] These  words  hopefully  this  will  come 
 back  up  again  for  you  in  a  few  years 
 most  men  waste  their  lives  working  for
[248:58] money 
 you  absolutely  need  money  and  you  should
[249:03] make  an  awesome  amount  of  it 
 but  to  waste  your  life  doing  it  is  a
[249:08] mistake  to  prioritize  making  money  over 
 prioritizing  your  purpose  your  masculine
[249:14] purpose  is  a  mistake 
 I  believe  that  money  should  be  used  for
[249:19] your  purpose  I  don't  think  that  the 
 pursuit  of  money  like  you  know  overly 
 working  should  be  used  as  a
[249:24] procrastination  from  your  purpose  and 
 I'm  guilty  of  this  all  the  time  it's  so 
 comforting  and  so  nice  to  work  it's
[249:29] almost  like  a  game  where  you  want  to  see 
 the  score  go  up 
 but  if  you're  pushing  off  your  purpose
[249:34] for  that  it's  actually  procrastination 
 you  call  it  a  game  well  it's  it's  very
[249:39] much  like  a  video  game  it's  just  it 
 becomes  a  bad  habit 
 you  should  absolutely  have  work  that  you
[249:44] love  that  feels  like  positive 
 contribution  to  the  world 
 making  a  bunch  of  money  at  the  same  time
[249:50] is  really  awesome  you  get  to  enjoy  like 
 you  know  some  of  the  finer  things  in 
 life  that  are  a  little  bit  pricey  but
[249:55] try  not  to  sacrifice  your  purpose  for  it 
 for  many  men  their  purpose  isn't
[250:00] actually  to  make  money  for  most  men 
 honestly  I  don't  believe  that  there's  a 
 man  out  there  whose  purpose  is  genuinely
[250:06] just  just  make  money  I  don't  like  you 
 know  your  purpose  is  like  your  souls 
 your  your  body's  reason  for  existing
[250:12] your  body  and  your  soul  was  not  put  here 
 to  just  make  money 
 perhaps  to  create  an  impact  or  to
[250:17] contribute  to  the  people  that  you  care 
 about  perhaps  maybe  it  was  for 
 fatherhood  who  knows  what  what  it  is
[250:23] but  just  be  careful  not  to  spend  all 
 your  your  life  all  your  hours  grinding 
 away  before  you  realize
[250:29] that  you've  just  wasted  a  lot  of  it  that 
 the  extra  numbers  in  your  bank  account 
 didn't  actually  make  a  difference  and
[250:35] that  if  you  spent  those  years  pursuing 
 your  purpose  that  would  have  actually 
 changed  your  life  and  improved  your  life 
 even  further  whether  you  make  two
[250:41] thousand  dollars  a  month  or  two  hundred 
 thousand  a  month 
 the  real  quality  of  life  comes  from  the
[250:48] spiritual  path  it  comes  from  those 
 immeasurable  things  like  mindfulness
[250:53] gratitude  love  community 
 again  this  isn't  me  saying  yeah  don't
[250:58] make  money  and  money  is  so  evil  no  no  no 
 money's  fun  to  make  it's  awesome  to  work 
 and  to  contribute  and  to  provide  value
[251:04] to  others  business  is  awesome 
 but  do  so
[251:09] whilst  you  prioritize  your  purpose 
 if  your  calendar  doesn't  reflect  this  if
[251:15] every  day  you  grind  at  your  work  whilst 
 calling  yourself  a  purposeful  man  but 
 realizing  that  your  purpose  is  maybe
[251:20] fatherhood  and  you're  spending  almost  no 
 time  developing  that  in  your  all  your 
 time  in  front  of  your  computer  screen
[251:26] it's  procrastination  this  is  just  a 
 message  to  my  younger  self  that  this  is 
 how  I've  lived  for  the  past  couple  of
[251:31] months  when  I  should  have  been  pursuing 
 my  purpose  more 
 I  hope  that  you're  able  to  free  yourself
[251:39] from  the  the  need  the  disease  of  like 
 needing  as  much  money  as  possible
[251:44] because  too  many  men  waste  their  lives 
 like  that  when  there's  bigger  more 
 ambitious  things  that  we  can  aim  for
[251:53] hope  that  this  guide  serves  you  well 
 and  helps  you  complete  this  layer  of 
 your  obsession  of  your  desire
[251:59] much  faster  than 
 most  other  people  do  when  you're 
 speaking  to  someone  who  would  need  this
[252:04] advice  whether  it's  in  person  or  online

 making  money  if  you  write  that  in  some
