[00:00] jeffrey's  been  struggling  for  years  and 
 he  doesn't  understand  why  he  wants  to  be 
 motivated  and  disciplined  to  do  his  work
[00:05] to  go  to  the  gym  and  eat  clean  but  he 
 keeps  making  the  wrong  decisions  he 
 keeps  choosing  to  eat  the  junk  food  even
[00:10] though  he  wants  to  lose  weight  he  keeps 
 procrastinating  even  though  he  wants  to 
 be  productive  it's  like  he's  fighting  an
[00:15] uphill  battle  he's  swimming  upstream  if

 reason  why  he  was  struggling
[00:23] adonis

 tribe  adonis  faltered  he  slipped  he
[00:34] fumbled  he  was  lazy  but  slowly  and

 to  tell  you  my  story  related  to  mental
[05:29] health  and  you  can  skip  this  section  if 
 you  want  to  if  you  just  want  to  go 
 straight  into  the  guide  although  i  do 
 think  there  is  going  to  be  some  kind  of
[05:34] value  if  you  sit  through  and  just  listen 
 to  my  story  because  you'll  find  that 
 you'll  be  able  to  relate  to  me  and  the
[05:39] more  you  can  relate  to  me  the  more  that 
 you'll  kind  of  take  my  advice  seriously 
 i  didn't  realize  that  mental  health  was
[05:44] a  thing  up  until  just  a  few  years  ago 
 but  when  i  look  back  especially  at  times 
 in  high  school  when  i  was  14  15  16  years
[05:51] old  i  was  definitely  experiencing  the 
 symptoms  then  without  realizing  it  i  was 
 having  quite  negative  thoughts  i  was
[05:56] quite  anxious  always  like  worrying  about 
 you  know  if  the  teachers  would  call  my 
 parents  and  tell  them  that  i  was
[06:01] misbehaving  i  struggled  a  lot  being  able 
 to  concentrate  in  school  so  imagine 
 you're  in  the  classroom  and  the  teacher
[06:07] you  know  is  at  the  front  of  the  room  and 
 she's  trying  to  teach  you  something 
 she's  writing  down  on  the  board  she's 
 talking  to  the  class  and  i  would  want  to
[06:12] concentrate  i  would  want  to  get  high 
 grades  in  school  i  just  couldn't 
 concentrate  on  what  she  was  saying  she'd
[06:17] be  talking  to  us  and  my  mind  would  just 
 be  thinking  about  other  things  that  were 
 totally  irrelevant  to  my  studies  i  was
[06:23] very  consumed  in  video  games  and  this  is 
 a  psychological  term  called  escapism
[06:28] which  is  kind  of  like  escaping  reality 
 and  instead  going  into  this  virtual 
 reality  where  we  can  be  and  do  whatever
[06:34] we  want  because  in  real  life  i  was 
 a  sad  anxious  lonely  abused  little  kid
[06:41] with  not  a  lot  of  confidence  not  a  lot 
 of  friends  no  attraction  from  girls  but
[06:46] in  the  virtual  world  in  the  video  games 
 that  i  would  play  i  was  a  warrior  i  was 
 a  chef  i  was  a  knight  i  was  a  magician  i
[06:52] got  to  try  all  of  these  different  lives 
 and  so  it  was  so  nice  to  be  able  to  play 
 video  games  and  really  just  obsess  over
[06:57] them  in  my  mind  i  had  other  symptoms  as 
 well  i  was  binge  eating  so  imagine  a  14 
 year  old  and  i  just  had  this
[07:02] uncontrollable  urge  to  just  eat  as  much 
 junk  food  as  possible  why  was  this 
 happening  why  did  i  have  poor  mental
[07:08] health  at  this  age  i  was  traumatized  and 
 i  was  getting  more  and  more  trauma  every
[07:14] single  day  i  was  being  abused  at  home 
 abused  by  my  family  i  was  being  abused 
 in  school  honestly  like  school  was
[07:20] traumatizing  by  itself  and  a  teacher  is 
 unhappy  with  you  and  you  can't 
 concentrate  or  maybe  you  know  i  was
[07:25] talking  in  class  and  the  teacher  like  a 
 grown  adult  would  get  close  to  my  face 
 and  scream  and  threaten  me  some  of  the
[07:31] teachers  knew  what  was  happening  at  home 
 i  was  getting  abused  i  was  getting  like 
 physically  emotionally  hurt  by  my
[07:36] parents  by  my  brother  and  some  teachers 
 knew  what  was  happening  and  they  would 
 threaten  me  they'd  look  me  in  the  eyes
[07:41] with  a  certain  look  on  her  face  and  just 
 say  something  like  i'll  call  your  father
[07:46] and  we'll  see  what  he'll  do  to  you  we'll 
 see  what  he  has  to  say  about  that  when 
 you're  i  was  going  to  say  when  you're
[07:51] young  honestly  at  any  age  if  you  feel 
 compulsively  unsafe  and  you  kind  of  have
[07:56] to  stay  in  that  situation  you  can't  you 
 know  fortunately  be  able  to  like  leave 
 your  home  or  get  out  of  like  a  dangerous
[08:02] situation  when  you're  stuck  there  like 
 you're  stuck  with  your  family  you're 
 stuck  in  school  your  body  and  your 
 nervous  system  and  your  mind  deteriorate
[08:09] very  quickly  and  suddenly  you're  put 
 into  this  everlasting  fight-or-flight 
 feeling  and  you  can  probably  relate  to
[08:14] this  if  you  can  relate  to  the 
 experiences  that  i've  just  spoke  about 
 and  you've  experienced  things  like
[08:19] trauma  and  parental  abuse  and  you  could 
 probably  relate  to  this  feeling  of  your 
 fight-or-flight  system  just  always  being
[08:25] activated  so  there's  like  two  systems 
 inside  of  our  body  one  is  the  fight  or 
 flight  and  the  other  one  is  rest  and
[08:30] digest  so  the  rest  in  digest  is  what 
 should  happen  99  of  the  time  your  heart 
 rate  should  be  low  your  entire  body  and
[08:36] your  all  your  organs  and  all  that 
 sciency  stuff  is  just  working  exactly 
 how  it's  supposed  to  and  maybe  one
[08:41] percent  of  the  time  every  now  and  then 
 in  a  moment  of  extreme  stress  and  danger
[08:46] we  should  kick  into  fight  or  flight  and 
 you  know  really  kicking  like  this  is 
 actually  a  good  system  to  have  we 
 shouldn't  hate  on  the  fight  or  flight
[08:51] system  inside  of  us  it's  just  that 
 sometimes  especially  in  the  nature  of 
 child  abuse  when  you're  stuck  in  that 
 environment  like  i  was  when  i  was  a
[08:57] child  realistically  like  if  i  give  you  a 
 very  specific  example  i  don't  want  to 
 create  pictures  in  your  mind  that  can
[09:03] trigger  you  or  anything  so  you  should  be 
 warned  that  like  this  entire  video  is 
 going  to  be  discussing  mental  health
[09:08] abuse  trauma  everything  anxiety  fight  or 
 flight  everything  stress  so  just  be 
 warned  that  you  will  feel  yourself
[09:15] getting  triggered  in  a  trigger  like  i 
 don't  like  that  word  because  it's  too 
 many  like  soft  people  have  used  it  but
[09:20] you  will  find  your  emotions  if  you're 
 really  aware  of  them  as  you  watch  parts 
 of  this  guide  will  be  spiked  and  that's
[09:25] okay  just  be  aware  of  it  as  i  tell  you 
 the  story  or  you  can  skip  forward  so  a 
 realistic  example  of  something  that's
[09:31] practically  happened  in  my  life  let  me 
 give  you  one  example  so  you  can 
 so  you  can  know  in  high  school  we  had
[09:36] these  planners  that's  what  we  would  call 
 them  planners  which  is  like  a  a  booklet 
 which  has  like  the  days  of  the  week  and
[09:41] you  put  in  your  homework  there  and 
 there's  like  comments  from  teachers  so 
 if  you  got  a  comment  from  a  teacher  it 
 was  usually  like  a  bad  thing  you  know
[09:47] the  teacher  would  like  say  okay  give  me 
 your  planner  and  she'd  write  a  letter  to 
 your  parents  right  there  and  you  have  to 
 show  it  to  them  and  stuff  and  so  my  dad
[09:53] would  check  my  planner  every  couple  of 
 days  every  week  or  so  to  see  what 
 homework  i  had  had  and  there  was  this
[09:58] one  particular  time  where  he  asked  me  to 
 see  her  and  he  saw  that  there  was  a 
 homework  that  you  know  had  been  set  and
[10:04] then  he  noticed  that  that  homework  was 
 due  tomorrow  like  the  day  after  we  were 
 reading  it  and  within  an  instant  he
[10:10] slapped  me  hard  and  he  got  angry  and 
 he's  like  why  have  you  left  it  for  the 
 last  day  it  was  just  a  small  like  little
[10:16] small  i  forgot  what  it  was  but 
 essentially  like  the  teacher  set  it  on 
 that  day  so  she  set  it  on  that  day  and
[10:21] she  said  oh  yeah  just  like  quickly  do  it 
 for  tomorrow  and  just  like  that  like  i 
 still  remember  it's  till  this  day  and 
 i've  made  a  lot  of  progress  that  i  don't
[10:27] really  feel  activated  as  i  tell  you  the 
 story  which  is  a  very  very  good  sign  i 
 can't  explain  to  you  like  how  much  like
[10:32] i  will  tell  you  more  of  my  story  but  i 
 can't  explain  to  you  like  i've  put  in  a 
 lot  of  work  into  this  but  that  was  just
[10:37] one  experience  and  so  that  one 
 experience  of  your  caregiver  suddenly 
 attacking  you  you  know  it  jolts  that
[10:43] fight  or  flight  system  inside  of  you  and 
 suddenly  as  a  little  kid  like  you  feel 
 defenseless  and  you  know  like  i'm  always
[10:48] i'm  like  a  freezer  every  time  i  would 
 get  hit  by  my  parents  i  just  kind  of 
 freeze  there  and  just  stop  or  the  kids
[10:53] maybe  they'd  run  away  or  the  kids  they'd 
 like  fight  back  or  anything  i  was  always 
 a  freeze  and  so  when  this  would  happen  i
[10:58] just  you  know  i'd  freeze  my  dad 
 screaming  in  my  face  being  violent  being 
 aggressive  then  my  mum  would  come  in  and
[11:03] it's  like  you  know  just  chaotic  in  the 
 family  just  one  experience  like  that  can 
 be  traumatizing  and  so  trauma  is  when
[11:09] we'll  go  into  this  more  often  but  like 
 as  i  tell  you  these  words  i  don't 
 particularly  feel  activated  but  i  can
[11:15] tell  by  the  way  that  i'm  talking  my  mind 
 keeps  like  going  blank  for  a  split 
 second  i  keep  stopping  my  sentences  you
[11:20] can  see  that  it  still  affects  me  and  i'm 
 so  just  one  instant  like  the  story  i've 
 just  told  you  that  can  be  traumatizing
[11:26] of  itself  your  caregiver  attacking  you 
 and  you  being  really  scared  and  so  you 
 can  literally  get  form  of  ptsd  from  just
[11:33] one  instant  like  that  but  if  you've 
 experienced  childhood  abuse  you  know  by 
 your  parents  and  it's  consistent  and
[11:39] it's  over  the  long  term  hundreds  of 
 incidents  like  that  that's  when  this 
 like  mental  health  issue  really  started
[11:44] to  get  a  lot  more  serious  and  so  when 
 i'm  about  15  16  17  years  old  this  is
[11:50] when  i  first  started  to  notice  violence 
 aggressive  thoughts  in  my  mind  and  i've 
 never  really  been  a  violent  person
[11:56] there's  only  been  a  very  few  select 
 times  that  i've  physically  hurt  another 
 man  i've  never  heard  like  woman
[12:02] physically  before  there's  been  a  few 
 times  where  i've  like  fully  hurt  a  man 
 but  i've  had  a  lot  of  violent  thoughts
[12:08] and  they  started  around  age  15  16  and  it 
 didn't  feel  abnormal  you  know  sometimes 
 you  don't  really  question  the  kind  of
[12:14] thoughts  that  you  get  because  you're 
 just  so  used  to  them  when  i  look  back 
 now  and  i  don't  really  get  these  kind  of 
 thoughts  anymore  there  was  a  lot  and  it
[12:20] was  very  worrying  because  you  might 
 maybe  you're  experiencing  this  like 
 you've  got  to  understand  i  feel  like
[12:25] this  part  of  the  video  is  all  over  the 
 place  because  i'm  like  recounting 
 experiences  i  don't  know  if  there's 
 going to  be  value  in  the  words  i'm 
 saying  right  now  but  i  will  sort  of
[12:31] um  reframe  myself  soon  and  take  a  big 
 deep  breath  after  we're  done  with  my 
 story  and  then  hopefully  i'll  be  able  to
[12:37] instruct  you  for  the  rest  of  the  course 
 age  15  16  onwards  a  lot  of  violent
[12:42] thoughts  in  my  mind  aggressive  thoughts 
 and  to  be  you  know  totally  authentic  i'm 
 going  to  walk  you  through  one  of  the 
 random  thoughts  i  would  get  usually
[12:48] there  would  be  when  i  was  in  the  gym  my 
 brother  built  like  a  home  gym  in  our 
 garage  very  simple  like  bench  press
[12:53] squat  rack  whatever  so  i've  been  uh 
 listening  to  like  music  and  stuff  and  my 
 mind  very  very  frequently  very
[12:59] frequently  would  imagine  someone  being 
 hurtful  towards  me  maybe  my  family
[13:04] member  maybe  a  stranger  someone  being 
 racist  someone's  saying  something 
 someone  bullying  me  someone  like  picking 
 on  me  they  would  imagine  that  and  i
[13:10] would  get  a  sense  of  satisfaction  and 
 confidence  when  i  would  vividly  see 
 myself  very  vividly  hurting  them  and  i
[13:17] would  somewhat  be  acting  this  out  in 
 real  life  one  of  them  would  be  like 
 there's  some  guys  walking  past  me  and
[13:22] for  some  reason  he  just  calls  me  a  pack 
 he's  you  know  he's  been  racist  i  start 
 fighting  him  we  fall  to  the  floor  i've
[13:27] gotten  the  strength  advantage  like  the 
 upper  hand  and  then  my  mind  generates 
 these  very  vivid  thoughts  of  me  gouging
[13:33] his  eyes  out  crushing  his  face  and 
 imagine  having  thoughts  like  this 
 very  frequently  at  this  point  from  what
[13:40] i  can  remember  let's  say  i'm  16  years 
 old  17  18  years  old  it  would  happen  10 
 times  a  day  i'd  be  in  school  i'd  be  in
[13:45] you  know  college  or  whatever  trying  to 
 focus  on  what  the  teacher's  saying  and 
 suddenly  i  just  have  one  of  these  like
[13:50] emotional  outbursts  in  my  mind  then 
 things  got  a  lot  worse  and  so  that  was
[13:55] already  a  pretty  bad  existence  but 
 things  got  worse  i  eventually  left  my 
 family  home  and  i  moved  to  university  so
[14:01] i  started  having  the  time  of  my  life 
 i've  left  my  family  you  know  i can  be 
 like  the  kind  of  man  i  want  to  i  started
[14:06] getting  girls  i  started  like  hooking  up 
 and  going  to  parties  and  clubs  and 
 making  new  friends  and  being  loud  and
[14:11] drinking  and  taking  drugs  and  that 
 spiraled  very  very  quickly  my  biggest 
 aim  when  i  went  to  university  was  not  to
[14:16] study  or  to  be  a  good  student  or 
 anything  it  was  literally  just  make 
 friends  and  just  sleep  with  women  and
[14:21] that's  entirely  what  i  focused  on  and 
 you  know  it's  very  fun  making  progress 
 to  your  goals  especially  as  a  young  man
[14:27] and  you  know  you're  kind  of  carefree 
 you're  like  an  idiot  so  you're  like  oh 
 yeah  you  know  i  slept  with  three  girls 
 last  week  it's  so  amazing  and  the
[14:32] culture  that  this  put  me  into  that  i  put 
 myself  into  this  sort  of  drinking  drugs
[14:37] partying  nightclub  environments  it's 
 very  anxiety-inducing  you  go  to  like  one
[14:42] of  these  clubs  let's  say  in  the  uk  and 
 you  know  it's  a bunch  of  students  there 
 people  don't  really  realize  this  about  a
[14:47] club  or  a  party  because  a  lot  of  people 
 like  kind  of  lie  to  themselves  and  and 
 say  like  you  know  they  go  to  the  clubs
[14:52] or  the  auto  parties  just  to  have  fun  and 
 dance  with  their  friends  and  stuff  but  a 
 lot  of  people  don't  really  see  the 
 evolutionary  psychology  that's  going  on
[14:58] here  it's  a  very  very  primal  environment 
 because  the  underlying  reason  why  men
[15:03] are  going  to  this  kind  of  environment 
 are  parties  and  clubs  is  because  they 
 want  to  hook  up  with  the  girls  there  and
[15:08] the  underlying  reason  why  the  girls 
 there  go  and  spend  hours  getting  ready 
 you  know  makeup  and  stuff  and  a  lot  of 
 girls  lie  and  say  like  oh  no  it's  just
[15:14] for  myself  i'm  just  you  know  they  say 
 the  but  the  underlying  subconscious 
 reason  why  girls  go  there  is  because 
 they  want  to  get  the  attention  of  the
[15:20] guys  who  are  there  and  a  bunch  of  girls 
 also  do  want  to  hook  up  too  so  it's  a 
 very  very  primal  environment  it's  full
[15:25] with  a  bunch  of  like  guys  at  the  peak  of 
 their  testosterone  levels  drinking  in 
 groups  of  them  a  bunch  of  girls
[15:31] stressing  in  very  like  quite  provocative 
 ways  very  sexualized  environments 
 alcohol's  flowing  and  so  it  can  be  a
[15:36] very  anxious  environment  and  i  got  like 
 good  in  this  environment  and  something 
 if  you've  never  really  been  to  clubs  or
[15:41] parties  something  you'll  maybe  find  out 
 all  i  can  tell  you  is  that  every  couple 
 of  nights  there  is  some  kind  of  like
[15:46] incidents  there  is  a  fight  there  is  you 
 know  some  arguments  and  it's  not  even 
 that  significant  after  a  while  just
[15:52] you're  used  to  it  we'd  go  out  me  and  my 
 friends  and  we'd  always  kind  of  know 
 like  oh  yeah  like  you  know  we'd  probably 
 end  up  hitting  someone  today  we'd
[15:57] probably  end  up  like  getting  into  like  a 
 tussle  or  arguments  or  shouting  because 
 this  guy  said  this  so  this  guy's  bumped
[16:02] into  him  and  so  whilst  i  was  over 
 indulging  in  this  environment  and  i  was 
 getting  good  at  it  i  didn't  realize  how
[16:08] much  anxiety  it  was  really  causing  that 
 you  know  that  those  same  violent 
 thoughts  of  like  self-protection  and  you
[16:13] know  to  hurt  another  man  they  started 
 compounding  in  my  mind  exponentially  the 
 origin  for  those  violent  thoughts  for  me
[16:19] would  have  been  my  family  and  it  would 
 have  been  you  know  the  sense  of  like 
 injustice  from  being  abused  by  my
[16:24] caregiver  but  eventually  it  was  very 
 much  compounded  by  this  environment  that 
 i  was  getting  into  and  then  things  got
[16:29] even  more  traumatizing  i  was  the  victim 
 of  a  racist  incident  so  in  manchester
[16:34] there  was  a  bombing  like  a  terrorist 
 attack  in  2018  it  was  in  the  ariane
[16:39] grande  stadium  it  was  like  a  big  musical 
 concert  and  there  was  a  terrorist  attack 
 there  and  a  few  days  after  that  i
[16:45] finished  work  i  go  to  the  train  station 
 to  go  home  and  there's  just  so  much 
 commotion  this  yelling  and  what  was
[16:51] happening  was  that  there  was  two  guys 
 who  were  drunk  who  was  screaming  and
[16:56] being  racist  at  a  muslim  woman  wearing 
 like  a  hijab  and  her  little  girl  that 
 she  had  like  you  know  holding  her
[17:01] clothes  they're  screaming  in  her  face 
 saying  that  she  you  bombed  us  like 
 they're  blaming  her  on  the  attack
[17:06] they're  just  you  know  they're  crazy 
 these  guys  are  crazy  and  everything  but 
 i  remember  getting  there  seeing  this  and
[17:11] something  just  came  inside  of  me  for  the 
 first  time  like  this  was  before  i  could 
 fight  this  was  before  i  was  strong  i
[17:16] just  started  yelling  at  these  guys 
 swearing  at  them  it  enraged  me  and  i 
 think  what  what  enraged  me  more  was  not
[17:23] so  much  just  the  racist  guys  but  the 
 fact  that  there  was  lots  of  other  people 
 on  the  train  station  just  kind  of  like 
 buried  into  their  phones  you  know  trying
[17:29] not  to  pay  attention  to  what's  going  on 
 all  the  commotion  and  even  the  staff  who 
 work  there  but  i  get  it's  like  a  verbal
[17:34] commotion  with  these  guys  and  you  know 
 it  gets  kind  of  scary  there's  two 
 grown-ass  drunk  men  in  front  of  me 
 screaming  at  me  calling  me  like  the
[17:40] and  everything  i  get  onto  my  train 
 eventually 
 i'm  calming  down  a  little  bit  and  just  i
[17:45] don't  know  where  they  walk  past  me  and 
 sit  close  to  me  and  for  like  a  20  minute 
 train  ride  they're  just  swearing  loud
[17:51] racist  everything  everyone's  silent  on 
 the  train  and  we  get  off  well  i  get  off
[17:56] first  i  look  back  and  they  stand  up  and 
 they  see  me  stand  up  and  they're  like 
 following  me  off  the  train  you  know  i 
 have  to  text  my  dad  come  in  come  like
[18:02] help  this  racist  i  literally  still 
 remember  texting  my  dad  this  because  he 
 was  waiting  outside  to  pick  me  up  and  i 
 text  him  this  message  saying  racist  on
[18:08] the  train  come  inside  quick  and  he 
 starts  calling  me  but  i  tell  him  i  can't 
 pick  up  i  don't  know  why  i  didn't  just 
 pick  up  go on  the  phone  call  but  i  tell
[18:13] him  like  come  inside  and  i  walk 
 downstairs  in  the  train  station  he  walks 
 past  me  he's  like  what's  going  on  what's
[18:18] going  on  then  they  walk  down  and  then 
 there's  like  a  big  like  tussle  and 
 everything  big  fighting  and  this  one  guy 
 he  just  keeps  doing  some  creepy  one
[18:24] of  the  drunk  guys  he  just  keeps  like 
 smiling  in  the  really  weird  way  and
[18:29] saying  like  okay  come  here  like  he's 
 he's  kind  of  got  one  hand  behind  his 
 back  and  he's  like  come  here  just  shake 
 my  hand  just  shake  my  hand  and  he  just
[18:34] does  this  so  much  he  does  it  to  me  he 
 does  it  to  my  father  a  bunch  of  times  he 
 just  keeps  like  trying  to  get  close  to 
 us  with  his  hand  behind  his  back  he  was
[18:40] later  on  arrested  and  he  had  an  11-inch 
 knife  on  him  this  was  all  on  the  news  he 
 was  jailed  for  one  and  a half  years  he
[18:46] it  would  have  been  a  lot  longer  but  he 
 didn't  pull  the  knife  out  at  any  point 
 or  he  was  trying  to  wait  for  like  the 
 perfect  opportunity  the  the  police
[18:52] officer  told  me  this  like  if  you 
 actually  pulled  a  knife  out  then  it's 
 way  higher  but  if  you  just  have  it  like 
 on  your  person  then  it's  only  classed  as
[18:57] like  possession  of  a  bladed  article  so 
 we've  got  one  and  a half  years  for  this 
 and  my  anxiety  that  same  thing  that  i've
[19:03] told  you  about  those  violent  thoughts 
 man  that 
 they  increased  heavily  and  so  all  those
[19:08] symptoms  that  i  had  before  like  binge 
 eating  and  violent  thoughts  they 
 compounded  so  much  more  if  i  couldn't
[19:13] focus  in  school  or  university  before 
 this  now  it  was  just  totally  it  felt
[19:18] impossible  and  the  only  thing  that  i 
 really  spent  my  time  doing  at  this  point 
 was  just  waking  up  smoking  weed  and  just 
 binge  eating  food  wanting  to  stay
[19:24] comfortable  in  my  own  little  bubble  and 
 not  even  realizing  that  this  was  a 
 mental  health  issue  after  this  i 
 struggled  heavily  for  around  one  to  two
[19:31] years  and  it's  strange  that  i  can  kind 
 of  conclude  those  two  years  in  just  a 
 single  sentence  so  yeah  i  struggled
[19:36] heavily  but  when  i  think  back  to  those 
 hundreds  of  days  where  i  woke  up  feeling
[19:41] depressed  and  so  anxious  where  every 
 single  day  i  was  seeing  the  physique 
 that  you  know  meant  so  much  to  me  like
[19:47] fitness  means  a  lot  to  me  and  i  was 
 seeing  my  physique  and  my  strength  and 
 my  skill  my  endurance  all  just  go  down
[19:52] every  single  day  because  i  was  choosing 
 comfort  over  discipline  i  was  just 
 somewhat  like  scared  to  leave  the  house
[19:57] i  never  wanted  to  admit  it  but  i  just 
 you  know  i  it  felt  so  much  more 
 comfortable  to  think  to  myself  yeah  i'll 
 stay  in  all  day  i  got  into  a
[20:02] relationship  that  was  pretty  toxic  and 
 not  very  loving  and  that  was  my 
 responsibility  that  was  my  that  was  my
[20:08] fault  i'll  take  full  responsibility  for 
 that  and  it's  sad  man  i  literally  i 
 experienced  somewhat  of  the  height  of  my
[20:13] life  at  the  start  of  university  with 
 like  friends  and  and  partying  and  girls
[20:18] and  everything  and  my  life  just  went 
 straight  down  all  because  of  mental 
 health  but  what's  interesting  is  that
[20:23] through  all  this  i  didn't  even  know  that 
 mental  health  was  the  problem  it  became 
 more  apparent  to  me  after  i  finished
[20:28] university  and  i  started  looking  for 
 jobs  and  i  got  into  that  young  person's 
 existential  crisis  which  you  don't  know
[20:34] what  to  do  with  your  life  the  jobs 
 you're  working  aren't  really  that  good  i 
 started  working  a  customer  service  job
[20:39] in  a  complaints  department  which 
 literally  would  make  me  cry  but  and  this 
 is  when  i  started  to  look  into 
 entrepreneurship  and  online  businesses
[20:44] but  i  literally  always  struggled  to 
 actually  being  productive  especially  by 
 myself  in  school  we  have  like  a  teacher
[20:50] an  authority  figure  maybe  if  you're  a 
 young  man  you  have  like  your  parents  who 
 are  looking  at  you  and  saying  okay  do
[20:55] this  work  right  now  when  you  leave  the 
 education  system  you're  not  really 
 prepared  for  that  so  you  become  your  own
[21:00] boss  and  that  became  extra  stressful 
 because  i  just  wasn't  doing  any  work 
 that  i  would  set  by  myself  i  would  say
[21:05] to  myself  okay  i  want  to  make  this 
 website  you  know  i  want  to  do  like  this 
 business  task  today  what  do  you  think  i
[21:10] did  i'd  wake  up  and  i  just  started 
 smoking  weed  and  then  i  didn't  do  the 
 work  and  it  was  at  this  time  age  21
[21:16] where  i  luckily  just  stumbled  upon 
 people  talking  about  improving  their 
 mental  health  on  reddit  there's  like  an 
 online  discussion  of  like  mental  health
[21:22] resources  it  was  the  start  of  the 
 coveted  lockdown  this  period  of  my  life 
 changed  everything  i  started  researching
[21:28] mental  health  learning  things  about 
 depression  anxiety  gratitude  mindfulness
[21:33] all  the  practical  no  bs  things  that  we 
 can  implement  for  free  that  will  improve 
 our  mental  health  and  that's  what  you're
[21:38] gonna  learn  in  this  guide  i've  said  many 
 times  that  there  are  no  overnight 
 successes  i've  said  many  many  times
[21:44] there's  no  shortcut  to  success  you  have 
 to  work  hard  for  a  long  time  you  have  to 
 be  consistent  you  have  to  be  disciplined
[21:50] but  if  there  is  one  shortcut  to  success 
 it's  improving  your  mental  health  i
[21:55] discovered  mental  health  and  i  started 
 to  actively  improve  it  and  i  promise  you 
 that  this  is  the  case  within  two  weeks
[22:00] my  life  changed  forever  within  two  weeks 
 i  left  that  relationship  that  was  kind 
 of  toxic  i've  not  really  gave  many
[22:06] details  about  it  because  i  spoke  about 
 it  extensively  in  previous  videos  plus  i 
 just  don't  want  to  really  speak  about  it
[22:11] too  much  but  i  left  that  relationship  i 
 was  living  with  her  so  we  lived  together 
 in  an  apartment  and  moved  out  finally
[22:17] moved  out  i  quit  smoking  weed  i  quit 
 eating  junk  food  i  moved  back  home  to  my 
 parents  house  in  the  middle  of  covid  and
[22:23] i  literally  got  into  the  best  shape  of 
 my  life  so  far  i  got  ultra  league  my 
 diet  was  fantastic  i  started  meditating
[22:28] for  20  minutes  then  40  minutes  and  60 
 minutes  a  day  i  was  journaling  i  was 
 working  on  businesses  i  had  the  quickest
[22:33] turnaround  of  my  entire  life  and  that 
 really  just  snowballed  into  the  success 
 that  i  have  today  which  i  feel  is
[22:39] massive  i  want  the  same  thing  for  you  so 
 in  this  guide  we're  going  to  focus  on
[22:44] the  two  most  common  mental  illnesses 
 which  are  depression  and  anxiety  when 
 you  talk  that  online  mood  assessment
[22:50] that  i  linked  at  the  top  of  the 
 description  you  would  have  gotten  a 
 depression  and  anxiety  score  the  goal  of
[22:55] this  guide  is  to  half  those  scores 
 within  just  two  weeks  so  if  you  took
[23:00] that  test  and  you  scored  14  for 
 depression  and  16  for  anxiety  in  just 
 two  weeks  of  following  this  guide  we
[23:05] want  to  get  you  to  seven  on  depression 
 and  eight  on  anxiety  are  massive
[23:10] improvements  let's  talk  about  depression 
 i  believe  depression  is  actually  the 
 most  common  illness  slash  disability  in
[23:17] western  developed  countries  what  is 
 depression  a  lot  of  people  mistakenly 
 think  that  depression  is  like  a  feeling
[23:23] of  sadness  and  like  you  know  like  oh  i 
 feel  depressed  not  necessarily 
 depression  isn't  sadness  it's  more
[23:30] emptiness  nihilism  like  there's  no 
 meaning  or  purpose  to  your  life  why  do
[23:35] we  get  depressed  and  why  is  it  so  common 
 in  the  modern  day  it's  because  we're 
 living  without  purpose  you  and  i  we're
[23:40] young  men  100  years  ago  we  would  have 
 had  a  wife  and  children  at  this  age  we
[23:45] had  a  rock  solid  purpose  we  had  our 
 family  and  there  was  wars  that  we  would 
 be  drafted  off  to  so  our  lives  would
[23:51] have  had  our  mission  we  would  have  been 
 focused  on  something  we  don't  really 
 have  that  anymore  we  don't  have  a 
 mission  we  don't  have  a  clear  purpose
[23:56] for  our  lives  and  so  we  lack  meaning 
 there's  also  another  major  issue  which
[24:01] causes  the  symptoms  of  depression  which 
 is  over  indulging  in  instant 
 gratification  so  i'm  going  to  give  you
[24:06] the  bro  science  explanation  for  why  i 
 think  depression  is  so  common  especially 
 amongst  like  young  unproductive  people
[24:13] you  need  to  learn  two  terms  instant 
 gratification  and  delayed  gratification
[24:18] instant  gratification  comes  from  the 
 activities  that  we  do  that  feel  good 
 right  now  but  they  kind  of  make  our  life
[24:24] worse  in  the  long  run  so  this  is  things 
 like  porn  video  games  watching  tv  eating
[24:29] junk  food  all  of  those  things  feel  good 
 right  now  they  feel  pleasurable  we  want 
 to  do  them  right  now  we're  really
[24:34] motivated  to  do  them  right  now  but  we 
 kind  of  know  that  it  makes  our  life 
 worse  every  time  that  we  over  indulge  in
[24:39] those  things  and  you  know  we  play  video 
 games  like  six  hours  we  kind  of  realize 
 that  oh  yeah  like  you  know  i  just  wasted 
 a  bunch  of  time  which  i  should  have  been
[24:45] doing  my  work  in  or  we  eat  the  junk  food 
 and  it  tastes  really  nice  on  our  lips 
 for  a  few  seconds  but  then  we  just  think
[24:50] oh  why  did  i  eat  that  i've  just  gained 
 so  many  calories  so  instant 
 gratification  activities  feel  good  right 
 now  but  make  your  life  worse  in  the  long
[24:57] run  when  we  over  indulge  in  instant 
 gratification  activities  like  porn  video 
 games  junk  food  like  the  majority  of  us
[25:03] are  doing  our  baseline  happiness 
 enjoyment  and  fulfillment  of  life  goes
[25:08] down  and  down  and  down  we  get  like  a 
 momentary  high  from  these  pleasurable 
 activities  but  the  baseline  that  we  come
[25:14] down  to  goes  down  every  single  time  we 
 overindulge  and  so  the  majority  of  us 
 are  over  indulging  in  porn  and  video
[25:20] games  and  so  our  baseline  happiness  like 
 our  normal  level  of  happiness  and
[25:25] fulfillment  is  very  very  low  to  the 
 point  that  we  just  feel  empty  that  we  we 
 don't  feel  anything  this  is  usually
[25:32] where  the  argument  comes  in  where  people 
 ask  is  depression  curable  is  it  not  just 
 genetics  and  a  lot  of  people  who  have
[25:38] depression  really  really  asserted  that 
 it's  genetics  and  you  know  they  can't 
 change  it's  just  like
[25:43] i've  got  depression  that's  how  i've  got 
 to  live  for  the  rest  of  my  life  and  in 
 my  opinion  that's  a  very 
 self-destructive  belief  i'm  a  big
[25:49] believer  that  you  should  believe  the 
 things  that  benefit  you  and  believing 
 that  oh  well  i  can't  change  anything
[25:54] about  this  doesn't  serve  you  in  any 
 beneficial  way  is  there  progress  that
[25:59] you  could  make  to  improve  your  mental 
 health  yes  so  it's  actually  beneficial 
 for  you  to  make  sure  that  you  haven't
[26:04] convinced  yourself  that  depression  and 
 any  other  mental  illness  is  something 
 that  you  can't  change  because  you  can
[26:10] always  make  some  kind  of  progress  and 
 just  for  an  anecdotal  experience  i've 
 helped  multiple  people  who  were  certain
[26:17] that  their  depression  was  totally 
 genetic  unchangeable  you  know  it's  not 
 it's  not  because  they  play  video  games
[26:22] all  day  they  were  so  certain  that  they 
 were  depressed  for  like  genetic  reasons 
 that  they  were  on  antidepressants  and
[26:27] with  just  two  weeks  of  following  this 
 plan  their  lives  changed  and  they  set  in 
 motion  to  significantly  improve  their
[26:32] mental  health  my  best  friend  sam  he's 
 the  youtuber  named  harbinator  he  was  the 
 first  video  editor  that  i  got  for  my
[26:37] channel  he  was  certain  that  he  had 
 clinical  depression  he  was  on 
 antidepressants  he's  not  anymore  he's
[26:42] the  happiest  most  healthy  most 
 productive  he's  ever  been  in  his  life 
 because  we  have  to  change  his  beliefs 
 and  tell  him  like  why  are  you  belittling
[26:48] your  own  self  and  why  don't  you  just  see 
 what  would  happen  if  you  just  start  to 
 believe  that  you  can  make  some  progress
[26:54] here  and  that's  exactly  what  happened 
 it's  hard  to  convince  someone  who's  so 
 stuck  in  their  ways  thinking  like  nope  i
[27:00] can't  change  it  because  you  know  the 
 doctor  said  it's  genetic  but  whilst 
 we're  talking  about  all  this  depression 
 seems  like  the  enemy  that  we  want  to
[27:06] fight  against  you  know  it's  a  bad  thing 
 that's  happening  to  us  i  don't  think  so 
 i  think  it  would  actually  serve  us  to  be
[27:11] grateful  for  our  depression  we  can  view 
 depression  actually  as  our  ally
[27:16] depression  is  these  emotions  which  is 
 kind  of  like  a  thermostat  telling  us
[27:21] that  something  is  wrong  with  our  lives 
 that  we're  living  without  meaning  that 
 we're  over  indulging  in  bad  habits
[27:26] that's  actually  very  beneficial  when  you 
 think  about  it  your  body  is  literally 
 giving  you  like  an  unpleasant  feeling  of
[27:31] like  emptiness  and  purposelessness 
 you're  getting  that  feeling  on  purpose 
 to  hopefully  direct  you  into  the  right
[27:37] course  of  action  we  should  be  grateful 
 for  depression  because  if  we  didn't  have 
 this  feeling  that  was  showing  us  that  we
[27:42] were  on  the  wrong  track  of  life  you 
 wouldn't  be  watching  this  video  today 
 you  wouldn't  have  ever  really  cared 
 about  improving  your  mental  health  and
[27:48] so  how  do  you  cure  depression  first  off 
 you  need  to  stop  doing  the  things  that 
 are  causing  you  to  feel  that  way  which
[27:53] is  those  instant  gratification 
 activities  and  this  is  like  a  hard 
 swallow  pill  for  a lot  of  people  because
[27:58] they  really  don't  want  to  admit  they're 
 so  certain  that  you  know  video  games  and 
 lack  of  sunlight  and  lack  of  water  and
[28:03] lack  of  proper  nutrition  are  causing 
 them  to  feel  negative  and  empty  and 
 nihilistic  but  it  probably  is  the  case
[28:09] we  need  to  stop  doing  those  bad  habits 
 i'm  going  to  start  doing  the  good  mental 
 health  practices  that  you're  going  to 
 learn  in  this  guide  now  there's  a  very
[28:15] interesting  concept  of  depression  that 
 we  can  talk  about  here  which  is  that 
 having  depression  actually  makes  it  hard
[28:21] if  not  impossible  to  do  the  things  that 
 would  ease  depression  so  when  you  have
[28:26] depression  it  almost  feels  like  you  have 
 an  inability  to  be  productive  and  to  do 
 the  right  things  that  would  ease
[28:31] depression  it's  almost  like  a  catch  22 
 it's  like  a  very  deadly  cycle  and  so  i 
 want  to  reframe  your  mind  here  to
[28:36] empower  you  to  be  able  to  make  some 
 changes  in  your  life  don't  think  about 
 it  as  depression  stopping  you  from  being
[28:41] able  to  do  like  the  good  habits  and  you 
 know  forcing  you  to  stay  on  the  bad 
 habits  and  simply  just  look  at  all  this
[28:46] as  it  is  habits  if  we  can  nail  just  the 
 habits  without  this  extra  belief  like  oh
[28:51] yeah  well  you  know  i'm  handicapped 
 because  i  have  this  issue  and  we  simply 
 just  say  okay  you're  struggling  with  the
[28:56] habit  of  exercise  well  there's  100 
 things  i  can  teach  you  about  that  you're 
 struggling  with  the  habit  of  diet  well
[29:01] there's  a  hundred  things  i  could  teach 
 you  about  that  if  we  simply  change  your 
 habits  you  will  feel  better  and  your 
 score  and  that  mental  health  assessment
[29:07] will  go  down  and  so  now  let's  talk  about 
 anxiety  how  does  it  feel  to  be  anxious
[29:12] it  feels  like  you're  hyper  vigilant 
 you're  like  really  really  aware  you're 
 overthinking  about  bad  things  that  could
[29:18] happen  what's  interesting  is  that 
 anxiety  is  quite  individual  and  unique 
 in  each  person  like  what  their  form  of
[29:24] anxiety  is  so  my  form  of  anxiety  is 
 about  physical  danger  my  anxious
[29:29] thoughts  have  always  been  about  like 
 other  people  like  is  this  guy  gonna 
 attack  me  it's  always  about  like 
 physical  fight  violence  whereas  another
[29:35] person's  anxiety  can  be  social 
 anxiousness  they  could  be  like 
 obsessively  like  anxiously  thinking
[29:40] about  the  social  dynamics  in  this  like 
 group  of  friends  that  they're  in  and 
 they  feel  activated  and  even  though  that
[29:45] seems  like  wait  why  would  you  be  anxious 
 about  you  know  a  group  of  friends  that's 
 still  quite  a  primal  thing  when  you
[29:50] think  about  being  accepted  into  the 
 tribe  that's  a  very  important  part  of 
 animal  and  human  nature  anxiety  can  lead
[29:56] to  panicking  fear  aggressiveness  and  it 
 even  has  very  negative  effects  on  your
[30:01] physical  health  when  you're  anxious  and 
 hyper  vigilant  what's  actually  happening 
 on  a  physiological  level  is  that  you're
[30:07] entering  the  fight  or  flight  mode  so 
 that's  like  the  survival  mode  inside  of 
 us  which  is  kicking  in  and  really
[30:12] telling  us  okay  do  we  fight  this  person 
 or  do  we  run  away  and  when  that  happens 
 when  the  survival  mode  kicks  in  a  lot  of
[30:18] our  normal  bodies  processes  are  stopped 
 so  that  we  can  allocate  resources  to
[30:23] like  the  real  survival  mechanisms  inside 
 of  us  now  again  i'm  going  to  give  you 
 like  a  bro  science  explanation  you  can
[30:28] go  find  like  the  specific  scientific 
 details  if  you  want  but  when  you're 
 anxious  it's  like  your  brain  and  your 
 body's  telling  things  like  for  example
[30:34] your  muscles  to  like  get  ready  for 
 fighting  or  for  running  away  but  by 
 allocating  resources  into  these
[30:39] short-term  survival  things  like  you  know 
 faster  thinking  and  like  stronger  more 
 agile  muscles  resources  get  taken  away
[30:46] from  more  of  our  long-term  health  organs 
 so  for  example  a  lot  of  people  with
[30:51] anxiety  also  suffer  from  like  gut 
 problems  digestive  problems  because 
 that's  like  a  long-term  health  thing
[30:56] which  experiences  like  negativity 
 because  all  of  our  resources  are  being 
 allocated  otherwise  i  know  this  sounds
[31:02] like  maybe  too  much  information  but  like 
 if  i  have  some  kind  of  you  know  intense
[31:07] anxiety  and  moments  a  few  hours  after 
 that  i'm  probably  gonna  have  diarrhea  it 
 doesn't  happen  anywhere  near  as  much  as
[31:13] it  used  to  be  i  know  this  is  like  too 
 much  information  but  you  do  need  to  know 
 these  things  like  i  lived  for  years  and
[31:18] years  and  years  four  or  five 
 six  times  a  day  and  never  once  was  a
[31:24] cylinder  bro  it was  always  like  liquidy 
 pieces  and  i  know  that's  so  much  like 
 information  but  like  i  think  it's  so 
 important  that  you  know  the  the  real
[31:30] unfiltered  truths  of  a  mental  illness 
 like  this  like  it's  not  nice  so  why  do 
 we  get  anxious  why  does  our  body  go  into
[31:35] this  hyper  vigilance  state  now  first  of 
 all  we  have  to  understand  just  like  with 
 depression  like  this  is  something  that
[31:40] we  should  feel  grateful  for  anxiety  is 
 just  our  body's  survival  mechanism 
 trying  to  protect  us  it's  just  that
[31:46] sometimes  when  that  survival  mechanism 
 kicks  in  it  kind  of  gets  glitched  it 
 kind  of  gets  messed  up  and  it  kind  of
[31:52] stays  on  far  longer  than  it  actually 
 should  so  what  may  have  happened  is  that
[31:57] at  a  young  age  there  was  something  quite 
 traumatizing  and  scary  that  happened  to
[32:02] us  most  likely  it  was  something  to  do 
 with  our  parents  just  you  know  being 
 violent  or  whatever  and  so  there's  a
[32:07] chance  that  any  of  these  traumatic 
 incidents  that  our  body  gets  stuck  in 
 this  anxious  state  and  it  just  kicks
[32:12] into  overdrive  trying  to  save  us  and  so 
 then  even  when  we  leave  this  dangerous
[32:17] situation  our  body  and  mind  is  just  on 
 overdrive  just  hypervigilance  just 
 making  sure  we  don't  go  back  to  that
[32:22] same  dangerous  situation  again  it's  of 
 utmost  importance  that  you  reframe  the 
 anxious  thoughts  and  the  feeling  of
[32:28] hyper  vigilance  reframe  your  mind  with 
 this  because  for  so  long  we've  lived 
 thinking  that  these  things  are  bad  if
[32:33] they're  the  enemy  i  don't  want  to  be 
 anxious  i  don't  want  to  be  depressed  we 
 have  to  be  grateful  and  actually  to  see
[32:39] okay  interestingly  this  is  actually  my 
 brain  and  my  body  doing  a  good  thing  for 
 me  anxiety  isn't  the  enemy  it's  trying
[32:46] to  protect  you  because  there  was  a 
 moment  in  your  life  where  you  couldn't 
 protect  yourself  there  was  a  point  when
[32:51] you  you  got  scared  so  heavily  that  now 
 your  body's  just  really  vigilant  it's
[32:56] like  your  body's  just  sending  signals 
 all  around  you're  saying  like  come  on 
 like  we've  got  to  protect  him  that 
 brings  like  a  tear  to  my  eye  because  for
[33:02] so  long  i  hated  this  part  of  me  and  i 
 realized  that  so  much  progress  comes 
 when  you  realize  the  utility  the  value
[33:09] of  depression  and  anxiety  how  do  you 
 cure  anxiety  i  believe  the  single 
 greatest  tool  that  the  practice  that  you
[33:15] can  implement  is  mindfulness  and  you're 
 going  to  learn  about  that  in  this  guide
[33:20] now  let's  go  over  the  actual  practical 
 things  that  you  can  do  to  improve  your 
 mental  health  and  if  there's  just  one
[33:25] tool  that  you  take  from  this  entire 
 guide  that  you  implement  into  your 
 normal  life  let  it  be  gratitude  now
[33:31] gratitude  is  more  like  a  trait  a  skill 
 it's  the  skill  of  counting  your  blessing
[33:36] so  you  know  in  religions  like 
 christianity  and  islam  before  they  eat 
 food  they  say  a  small  prayer  they  say
[33:41] grace  that  they're  grateful  for 
 something  gratitude  is  like  the 
 scientific  version  of  happiness  because
[33:46] happiness  as  you  may  know  it  it's  kind 
 of  a  wishy-washy  emotion  you  don't 
 really  know  when  you'd  get  happy
[33:51] sometimes  you're  happy  for  no  reason 
 sometimes  you  can't  be  happy  even  in  a 
 situation  where  you  should  be  happy
[33:57] gratitude  the  scientific  version  of  that 
 which  you  can  induce  with  total  control 
 and  if  you  follow  the  technique  which
[34:02] i'm  about  to  walk  you  through  your  life 
 will  change  forever  gratitude  is  when 
 you  stop  and  you  force  your  brain  to
[34:07] think  positive  thoughts  about  of  things 
 that  you  appreciate  and  there's  an 
 important  word  which  i  just  said  and
[34:12] that  word  is  false  for  a  lot  of  people 
 thoughts  of  gratitude  aren't  normal  and
[34:17] so  you  almost  have  to  manually  implant 
 them  forcibly  implant  those  thoughts  of 
 gratitude  into  your  mind  try  this
[34:23] actionable  step  right  now  pick  one 
 person  in  your  contact  list  one  person 
 whose  number  you  have  choose  one  person
[34:28] and  send  them  a  text  message  of 
 gratitude  send  them  a  couple  of 
 sentences  maybe  a  paragraph  maybe  two 
 paragraphs  of  you  saying  i'm  grateful
[34:34] for  you  because  of  this  and  just  make  it 
 as  entirely  as  positive  and  as  loving  as
[34:39] you  can  so  just  before  you  send  them 
 this  message  really  just  think  yourself 
 okay  pick  the  person  in  your  mind  who 
 you're  gonna  send  it  to  and  think  of
[34:44] some  happy  memories  that  you  have 
 together  think  of  some  positive  things 
 that  they've  done  for  you  and  things
[34:49] that  you've  done  together  if  you  really 
 just  did  what  i  said  and  really 
 visualize  the  happy  times  you've  had
[34:54] with  someone  and  how  you're  grateful  for 
 that  you  can't  help  but  smile  you  can't 
 help  but  feel  happy  about  this  and  it's
[34:59] so  interesting  that  within  just  a  few 
 seconds  you've  just  put  a  smile  onto 
 your  face  you've  literally  just  induced
[35:05] happiness  onto  yourself  that's  extremely 
 powerful  and  now  you  can  induce  that 
 same  feeling  of  happiness  and  gratitude
[35:11] onto  a  friend  or  a  family  member  so  this 
 is  the  actionable  step  to  take  right  now 
 if  you  really  want  this  guy  to  help  you
[35:16] pause  the  video  right  now  and  go  on  to 
 your  contact  list  on  whatsapp  text 
 message  whatever  pick  one  person  and
[35:21] send  them  like  a  couple  of  sentences 
 maybe  a  paragraph  just  of  you  saying 
 that  you're  grateful  for  them  that's
[35:26] such  a  simple  act  what  you've  just  done 
 you've  literally  just  sent  a  text 
 message  and  yet  you've  become  happier 
 because  of  it  you  can  see  that  the  power
[35:32] of  gratitude  is  massive  and  we  don't 
 utilize  it  enough  and  so  we  want  some 
 kind  of  gratitude  practice  to  become  a
[35:37] habit  for  you  to  maximize  the  benefits 
 of  gratitude  we  want  you  to  do  a 
 practice  like  sending  that  text  message
[35:43] of  gratitude 
 every  day  and  if  you  can  do  that  at  the 
 same  time  so  consistently  that  would
[35:48] transform  your  mental  health  to  such  a 
 level  that  you  might  not  even  be  able  to 
 realize  right  now  imagine  if  every
[35:53] single  day  at  the  same  time  you  sent 
 like  a  nice  loving  message  to  one  person 
 one  friend  one  family  member  for  weeks
[35:59] for  months  and  of  course  after  a  little 
 while  you'd  run  out  of  friends  and 
 family  to  message  and  at  that  point  you
[36:04] could  start  maybe  reaching  out  to  people 
 who  aren't  really  totally  your  friends 
 maybe  you  could  go  on  like  discord
[36:09] servers  like  we  have  a  discord  server 
 for  this  channel  and  there's  a  bunch  of 
 young  guys  on  self-improvement  the 
 discord  link  is  in  the  description  of
[36:15] this  video  if  you  want  to  join  in  it's 
 like  60  70  000  young  men  who  are 
 discussing  self-improvement  no  fat
[36:21] imagine  if  you  end  up  you  know  just 
 speaking  to  someone  there  you  have  a 
 nice  conversation  and  then  you  send  them 
 a  message  of  gratitude  you  could
[36:27] reasonably  find  one  person  every  single 
 day  maybe  it'd  take  you  5-10  minutes  and 
 to  spend  that  time  to  not  only  feel
[36:33] grateful  but  then  to  also  express  it  to 
 someone  it's  such  a  beautiful  habit  that 
 you  can  get  into  there's  all  the
[36:38] gratitude  practices  you  can  try  and  the 
 one  that  i've  personally  done  the  most 
 it's  just  simple  gratitude  journaling
[36:43] and  that's  where  you  literally  just 
 write  down  what  you're  grateful  for  on  a 
 piece  of  paper  on  your  phone  you  just 
 write  i'm  grateful  for
[36:49] this  fireplace  it's  very  very  confident 
 i'm  not  gonna  lie  i  kind  of  panicked
[36:54] when  i  first  set  it  on  fire's  a  bit  you 
 know  sometimes  can  be  a  bit 
 uncontrollable  but  it's  like  i'm  very
[36:59] grateful  for  it  this  is  the  first  time 
 i've  used  like  a  wooden  log  burner  like 
 i  said  i'm  in  scotland  right  now  amongst
[37:04] nature  it's  very  peaceful  place  so  i'm 
 grateful  for  the  airbnb  i'm  staying  in
[37:09] i'm  grateful  for  the  woman  who's  hosting 
 us  here  the  nature  the  animals  the
[37:14] donkeys  and  the  horses  outside  this  is 
 what  i  would  write  down  every  single  day 
 just  three  points  five  points  of  things
[37:20] that  you're  grateful  for  and  you'll  find 
 that  as  you  write  these  thoughts  of 
 gratitude  will  start  to  become  automatic
[37:26] into  your  mind  just  take  a  second  to 
 think  how  nice  that  would  be  that 
 throughout  your  normal  day-to-day  your
[37:31] mind  would  automatically  just  give  you  a 
 thought  of  gratitude  that  would  feel 
 amazing  i  could  literally  just  get  a
[37:36] sudden  boost  of  like  happiness  and 
 appreciation  and  that's  what  we  really 
 want  and  so  we  put  in  a  little  bit  of
[37:41] discipline  and  consistency  in  practices 
 like  a  daily  message  of  gratitude  or 
 gratitude  journaling  same  time  every
[37:47] single  day  we  just  do  it  for  five 
 minutes  ten  minutes  and  the  return  on 
 investment  for  this  is  so  incredible
[37:53] like  i  said  if  there's  one  thing  that 
 you  do  for  your  mental  health  make  it 
 gratitude  let's  talk  about  mindfulness
[37:58] and  you  might  have  heard  of  this  already 
 so  mindfulness  is  often  joined  together 
 with  meditation  and  you  were  expecting
[38:04] meditation  to  come  into  this  mental 
 health  guide  there's  a  reason  why  when 
 you  clicked  on  this  guide  instantly  you 
 knew  that  i'd  be  talking  about
[38:09] meditation  you  inherently  know  and 
 understand  and  believe  that  meditation
[38:14] will  be  good  for  your  mental  health  so  i 
 don't  even  need  to  explain  that  to  you 
 it's  like  very  common  knowledge
[38:19] meditation  is  good  for  your  mental 
 health  it's  better  if  we  spend  our  time 
 practically  speaking  about  how  you  can
[38:24] implement  meditation  into  your  life  if 
 you  haven't  been  able  to  already  i  want 
 to  give  you  advice  that  you've  never
[38:29] heard  anywhere  else  before  first  we  need 
 to  discuss  why  we're  all  so  mindless  so 
 mindfulness  is  what  we  want  mindfulness
[38:36] is  like  present  it's  the  ability  to  be 
 focused  of  what's  happening  here  right 
 now  instead  of  having  just  random
[38:42] thoughts  as  i  speak  these  words  to  you 
 there's  quite  literally  zero  thoughts  in 
 my  mind  every  time  i  sit  down  to  record
[38:47] a  video  or  if  i  live  stream  i  get  into  a 
 total  flow  state  i'm  totally  mindful  and
[38:52] present  that  means  that  as  i  speak  these 
 words  to  you  there's  no  thoughts  of 
 negativity  no  hateful  thoughts  no
[38:57] negative  feelings  inside  of  my  mind  i'm 
 just  existing  and  i'm  just  performing 
 it's  a  blissful  state  being  mindful  and
[39:03] present  and  it  is  a  core  component  of 
 mental  health  and  happiness  but  then  we
[39:08] have  to  ask  each  other  why  are  we  all  so 
 mindless  for  most  of  the  time  what  i've 
 just  said  is  somewhat  of  a  rare
[39:13] occurrence  okay  i'm  satya  i  have  no 
 thoughts  in  my  mind  i'm  totally  present 
 but  for  the  majority  of  people  probably
[39:19] including  yourself  you're  probably 
 mindless  for  a  large  part  of  the  day  and 
 i  am  too  so  there's  certain  moments 
 where  i'm  totally  present  like  i  am  here
[39:25] but  for  a  large  part  of  the  day  i'm 
 still  mindless  and  we  have  to  ask 
 ourselves  why  now  of  course 
 evolutionarily  there's  gonna  be  some
[39:31] benefit  for  us  to  be  able  to  think 
 throughout  the  day  and  stuff  fair  enough 
 you  know  to  get  some  ideas  and  to 
 survive  fine  but  it's  obvious  to  us  that
[39:37] as  a  generation  our  levels  of 
 mindfulness  and  presence  are  so  low  why
[39:42] i  think  if  there's  one  explanation  it's 
 our  smartphones  the  apps  that  we  have  on 
 our  phones  social  media  tick  tock
[39:48] instagram  twitter  what  happens  is  that 
 we  go  onto  these  platforms  and  you  know 
 you  might  have  taken  a  big  step  back
[39:53] from  social  media  i  have  to  i've  deleted 
 all  social  media  but  we  spent  years  on 
 those  platforms  right  now  what  you're
[39:58] doing  is  very  good  you're  watching  like 
 one  full  length  long  video  and  you're 
 giving  it  your  full  attention  you  are
[40:03] giving  it  your  full  ascent  you're  not 
 like  scrolling  down  looking  at  the 
 comments  right  now  are  you  but  when  you 
 sit  down  and  you  give  something  your
[40:08] full  attention  like  this  you're  actually 
 training  your  brain  to  focus  better  the 
 issue  then  is  with  apps  like  tick  tock
[40:14] and  instagram  and  twitter  you're  seeing 
 like  new  data  you  know  new  posts  every 
 what  one  second  half  a  second  you  know
[40:21] you're  just  scrolling  scrolling  scroll 
 it  you're  training  your  brain  to  be  able 
 to  focus  for  half  a  second  and  then 
 quickly  switch  up  and  to  start  thinking
[40:26] about  a  different  piece  of  content  like 
 a  different  topic  our  attention  spans 
 are  not
[40:32] not  ideal  and  i  really  really  fear  for 
 the  young  generation  perhaps  you're  a 
 young  man  watching  this  but  i  fear  for
[40:37] the  young  generation  who  have  been 
 raised  on  ipads  and  iphones  if  you're  my 
 age  i'm  25  so  we  got  these  things  at
[40:43] like  age  15  and  you  know  that's  bad 
 enough  we've  had  technology  like  this 
 like  smartphones  for  like  10  years  but
[40:48] there's  kids  who  have  been  raised  on 
 technology  like  smartphones  and  ipads
[40:53] since  age  four  five  less  i  didn't  mean 
 to  get  into  a  rant  here  man  but  almost 
 every  day  i  go  to  like  cafes  and
[40:59] restaurants  and  i  always  always  see  like 
 a  family  and  the  parents  are  just 
 talking  and  the  little  kids  just  got  an
[41:04] iphone  what's  that  doing  to  their  brain 
 it's  training  them  to  be  able  to  only 
 hold  their  attention  for  a  few  seconds
[41:10] up  until  they  click  on  like  the  next 
 thing  obviously  little  babies  are  on 
 like  youtube  watching  like  cartoons  or
[41:15] something  your  phone  can  be  and  is  for 
 some  people  their  biggest  allies  you  can 
 run  an  entire  business  off  your  phone
[41:21] but  you  can  also  ruin  your  life  from  it 
 right  here  right  now  i  want  you  to  just 
 have  the  humility  and  ask  yourself  which
[41:27] category  are  you  in  are  you  in  truly  the 
 person  who's  using  their  phone  and 
 social  media  truly  don't  lie  to  yourself
[41:33] are  you  truly  doing  that  in  a  productive 
 beneficial  way  totally  beneficial  it's
[41:38] making  you  rich  it's  giving  you  status 
 it's  giving  you  the  things  that  you  want 
 or  are  you  in  the  99.99  of  group  people
[41:44] who  it's  probably  more  of  a  detriment 
 for  up  until  just  a  few  weeks  ago  i  was 
 100  here  but  i've  made  some  really  good
[41:49] steps  and  i  want  to  walk  you  through 
 them  because  i  can  tell  you  how  to 
 increase  your  mindfulness  through  things
[41:54] like  meditation  which  we  will  do  but 
 it's  very  important  for  us  to  spend  some 
 time  to  make  sure  you're  not  decreasing
[41:59] it  significantly  because  even  though 
 meditation  and  other  mindfulness 
 activities  are  really  powerful  i  don't
[42:04] think  they  can  counteract  the  damage 
 that's  done  through  smartphones  and  i 
 think  that's  the  biggest  number  one
[42:09] thing  that  we  need  to  focus  on  to  stop 
 decreasing  our  mindfulness  we  need  to 
 simply  just  decrease  how  we  use  our
[42:14] phones  what  social  media  do  you  still 
 use  you  can  potentially  consider  youtube 
 one  especially  if  you  don't  really  watch
[42:20] long  videos  like  this  and  you  generally 
 watch  like  youtube  shorts  or  shorter 
 five  minute  clickbait  videos  the  first
[42:26] major  step  that  you  can  take  today  to 
 stop  reducing  your  mindfulness  is  to 
 take  a  big  step  back  from  the  worst
[42:33] social  medias  and  i  would  say  they  are 
 tick  tock  100  tick  tock  is  the  worst  for
[42:38] many  reasons  but  it's  particularly  the 
 worst  for  mindfulness  it's  just  too  too
[42:43] quick  and  it's  the  same  with  instagram 
 and  perhaps  even  twitter  there's  just 
 too  much  data  information  new  content
[42:49] that  you're  seeing  every  0.5  seconds  you 
 have  to  take  a  big  step  back  from  this
[42:54] entertaining  kind  of  content  and  at  the 
 very  least  switch  over  to  more 
 educational  if  you  are  going  to  be
[42:59] frying  your  brain  and  lowering  your 
 mindfulness  at  least  don't  do  it  for 
 entertainment  at  least  don't  do  it  just
[43:05] like  waste  time  and  just  pretend  oh  well 
 you  know  i'm  just  unwinding  what  i  did 
 personally  was  that  i  just  stopped  using
[43:10] instagram  and  i  just  started  watching 
 more  educational  videos  on  youtube  i 
 started  watching  more  long  form  podcasts
[43:17] unedited  longer  video  was  kind  of  like 
 this  one  that  simple  change  from 
 reducing  how  much  you  watch  these  like
[43:22] short  form  random  videos  to  the  long 
 form  educational  content  it's  absolutely
[43:28] huge  this  is  what  transformed  my  life 
 and  it  really  helps  me  to  learn  and  to 
 become  more  successful  that  one  change
[43:34] will  truly  alter  the  trajectory  of  where 
 your  levels  of  mindfulness  are  going 
 because  right  now  for  the  majority  of
[43:39] people  it's  going  way  down  but  if  you 
 just  simply  take  a  step  back  from  like 
 these  content  aggravation  sites  tick
[43:45] tock  instagram  twitter  is  there  any 
 others  youtube  shorts  as  well  you'll  be 
 going  into  the  right  direction  now  we
[43:50] can  focus  on  the  primary  things  that 
 increase  your  mindfulness  and  the  number 
 one  best  way  possible  is  meditation  but
[43:56] there  are  also  things  that  improve  your 
 levels  of  mindfulness  that  are  usually 
 not  really  speaking  about  things  that
[44:01] require  presence  and  concentration  and 
 so  the  next  part  of  this  guide  is  going 
 to  be  on  a  topic  that  you  might  have  not
[44:07] really  realized  is  a  linked  with  mental 
 health  and  no  one  has  ever  really  linked 
 the  two  together  we'll  discuss  that
[44:12] shortly  but  first  let's  just  go  through 
 the  benefits  that  you'll  feel  if  you 
 increase  your  mindfulness  and  then  i'll
[44:17] tell  you  exactly  how  to  increase  it  the 
 benefits  you'll  feel  you'll  be  able  to 
 be  present  and  actually  enjoy  what's 
 happening  you  know  there's  a  very  sad
[44:23] reality  of  the  human  experience  is  that 
 we  can  be  in  a  happy  situation  and  not
[44:29] be  happy  it's  very  interesting  isn't  it 
 there's  been  times  when  you  should  have 
 been  happy  you  should  have  been  positive
[44:34] something  good  happened  and  you  didn't 
 really  feel  that  good  interestingly  for 
 the  stoics  amongst  us  or  maybe  you  have
[44:40] a  level  of  emotional  regulation  which  is 
 really  good  there's  been  times  when  you 
 probably  should  have  felt  bad  but  you
[44:45] didn't  you  felt  kind  of  good  more 
 mindful  you  are  the  better  you'll  be 
 able  to  regulate  your  emotions  you'll  be
[44:50] able  to  truly  enjoy  experiences  instead 
 of  just  being  in  an  environment  which 
 should  be  pleasant  and  just  finding
[44:56] yourself  just  over  thinking  about 
 something  irrelevance  you'll  find  it  way 
 easier  with  more  mindfulness  to  make
[45:01] friends  and  to  maintain  really  good 
 relationships  so  much  better  because 
 imagine  if  you  and  i  are  gonna  have  an
[45:07] initial  chat  we're  gonna  have  a 
 conversation  i  see  you  in  my  gym  and 
 you're  like  oh  my  god
[45:12] and  we  come  up  and  i  speak  to  you  right 
 if  i  can  subconsciously  you  know  i  won't 
 really  think  in  my  mind  but  if  i  could
[45:18] subconsciously  tell  you're  not  present 
 for  our  conversation  if  it's  just  kind 
 of  obvious  that  you're  like  thinking
[45:23] about  something  else  if  i'm  speaking  to 
 you  and  it's  obvious  that  you're  not 
 really  listening  we're  not  really  going 
 to  get  along  are  we  and  now  imagine  for
[45:29] deeper  relationships  like  your  family  or 
 a  girl  that  you're  in  love  with  to  be 
 able  to  be  present  with  them  there  and
[45:34] then  just  truly  with  them  focus  on  them 
 that's  a  a  wonderful  gift  that  you  can 
 give  to  them  on  the  other  hand  imagine
[45:40] your  mum  is  talking  to  you  and  you've 
 just  got  thoughts  going  on  in  your  mind
[45:45] and  you're  not  truly  even  listening  to 
 her  people  pick  up  on  these  things  one 
 of  the  most  practical  benefits  of  more
[45:50] mindfulness  is  that  you'll  just  be  able 
 to  focus  and  concentrate  on  work  and 
 study  so  much  better  you  can  probably
[45:55] relate  to  this  for  a  lot  of  people  can't 
 even  read  like  a  lot  of  people  literally 
 struggle  to  read  these  days  if  you
[46:00] grabbed  a  book  right  now  and  the  book 
 was  like  a  little  bit  boring  would  you 
 be  honest  would  you  experience  this
[46:05] maybe  after  reading  a  paragraph  you 
 don't  really  remember  what  you've  just 
 read  because  if  you're  really  aware  of
[46:10] it  you'll  realize  that  you're  almost 
 like  pretending  to  read  whilst  you're 
 thinking  about  something  else  to  be  able
[46:15] to  read  and  study  effectively  you  need 
 to  be  mindful  in  fact  to  be  able  to  do 
 almost  anything  effectively  in  life  you
[46:22] need  to  be  mindful  so  how  do  you  become 
 more  mindful  through  meditation  how  do 
 you  actually  meditate  because  it  seems
[46:27] like  such  a  weird  topic  we're  going  to 
 do  a  very  very  short  meditation  session 
 together  and  it's  going  to  be  on  like  a 
 lot  of  the  sessions  you  may  have  tried
[46:33] previously  because  i'm  going  to  walk  you 
 through  a  very  practical  no  bs  framework 
 for  improving  your  mindfulness  with
[46:39] meditation  it's  a  four-step  framework 
 we're  gonna  start  at  step  one  and  that's 
 to  be  mindful  of  something  that's
[46:44] happening  in  the  present  moment  and  so 
 the  breath  is  commonly  used  in 
 meditation  so  essentially  just  just  be
[46:49] mindful  and  present  and  aware  of  your 
 breath  just  put  all  your  focus  onto  your 
 breath  right  now
[47:00] keep  your  focus  there  just  keep 
 breathing  just  keep  your  focus  onto  your 
 breath
[47:06] now  without  really  realizing  if  we  did 
 this  for  another  5-10  seconds  you  may 
 not  be  consciously  aware  but  step  two  of
[47:13] the  way  to  improve  your  mindfulness  is 
 that  you  actually  lose  your  focus  on  the 
 thing  that  you  are  focusing  on  so  step
[47:18] one  is  to  be  focused  and  present  on  our 
 breath  step  two  is  actually  when  you 
 lose  focus  on  a  thing  but  you  haven't
[47:24] realized  it  just  yet  because  there's  a 
 gap  i  hope  you  can  understand  this  when 
 we  first  lose  awareness  and  we  become
[47:29] mindless  we  don't  actually  realize  we're 
 not  aware  that  we  are  currently  mindless 
 for  at  least  some  time  up  until  there's
[47:35] almost  like  an  aha  moment  and  we're  like 
 oh  i'm  mindless  so  step  one  is  focus  on 
 our  breath
[47:40] step  two  after  a  few  seconds  we've  lost 
 awareness  but  we're  not  even  aware  that 
 we've  lost  awareness  step  three  is  that
[47:47] now  we  are  aware  that  we  lost  our  focus 
 on  the  breath  so  step  three  is  that 
 moment  where  you  think  oh  i  was  supposed
[47:52] to  be  meditating  and  i  was  just  deep  in 
 thought  about  something  else  and  finally 
 step  four  is  to  just  come  back  to  the 
 thing  that  you  were  focused  on
[47:57] originally  so  step  one  focus  on  your 
 breathing
[48:02] step  two  subconsciously  lose  awareness 
 of  the  thing  we  were  focusing  on  but  you 
 don't  even  realize  it  just  yet
[48:08] i'm  thinking  about  high  school  and  then 
 step  three  is  you  realize  you  were 
 thinking  about  something  else  oh  oh  i
[48:14] was  thinking  about  high  school  when  i 
 should  be  focusing  on  my  breath  okay 
 i'll  go  back  to  the  breath  step  four
[48:21] you  complete  all  four  steps  and  that's 
 like  one  rep  one  squat  one  bicep  curl
[48:26] for  the  brain  interestingly  this  is 
 where  a  lot  of  people  get  upset  when 
 they  try  to  meditate  they  try  to 
 meditate  and  then  they  lose  their  focus
[48:32] and  they  say  they  can't  do  it  but  what 
 you  need  to  understand  is  that  if  we  go 
 through  all  four  steps  it's  like  one
[48:37] bicep  curl  for  the  brain  our  brain's 
 just  gotten  stronger  we've  just  gained 
 10  mindfulness  experience  and  so  we
[48:43] actually  want  to  go  through  these  four 
 steps  as  fast  and  as  often  as  possible
[48:48] what  that  means  is  that  when  you  try  to 
 meditate  and  you  lose  focus  it's
[48:53] actually  a  good  thing  this  is  why  so 
 many  people  struggle  with  meditation 
 they  try  it  and  then  they  don't  enjoy  it
[48:58] because  it's  not  working  for  them 
 they're  not  able  to  clear  their  mind  of 
 thoughts  what  they  don't  realize  is  that 
 every  time  you  lose  your  focus  that's
[49:03] actually  an  opportunity  to  simply  just 
 bring  your  focus  back  to  the  present 
 moment  and  to  gain  that  like  experience
[49:08] in  video  games  you  have  like  xp 
 experience  for  like  the  skill  every  time 
 you  come  back  to  the  present  moment  you
[49:13] come  back  to  your  breath  that's  like  10 
 experience  in  your  mindfulness  skill  you 
 need  to  lose  your  awareness  and  to  think
[49:19] about  something  else  to  be  able  to 
 actually  gain  more  mindfulness  i'm 
 recording  a  full  meditation  video  that
[49:25] you  can  follow  along  to  every  day  and 
 i'll  have  a  card  pop  up  on  screen  as 
 soon  as  it's  released  so  click  on  that
[49:30] card  right  now  you  can  just  load  it  up 
 save  it  to  your  watch  later  and  start 
 listening  to  it  maybe  every  morning  or 
 every  night  time  the  next  tool  to
[49:36] improve  your  mental  health  is 
 challenging  yourself  and  you  might  not 
 have  ever  considered  challenges  to  be  a
[49:41] tool  for  your  mental  health  but  when  we 
 set  challenges  for  ourselves  we  enter 
 what's  called  a  flow  state  a  flow  state
[49:48] is  kind  of  like  an  extreme  state  of 
 presence  and  mindfulness  so  in  the 
 previous  part  of  this  guys  we  just  spoke
[49:54] about  presence  and  mindfulness  and  we 
 said  that's  when  you're  able  to  focus  on 
 what's  going  on  at  the  task  at  hand 
 you'll  have  no  thoughts  but  a  flow  state
[49:59] is  when  you're  so  focused  that  you  lose 
 track  of  the  time  suddenly  two  hours 
 have  gone  by  and  you're  like  what  it
[50:04] felt  like  20  minutes  and  i  did  so  much 
 and  i'm  so  productive  at  least  you  just 
 did  more  work  or  i  did  better  than  i've
[50:09] done  in  the  last  week  it's  only  when  we 
 enter  a  flow  state  that  we  really  tap 
 into  our  ultimate  potential  a  flow  state
[50:15] is  what  athletes  call  being  in  the  zone 
 you  might  have  heard  that  saying  an 
 athlete  will  say  oh  well  you  know  i  just
[50:20] entered  the  zone  that's  a  flow  state 
 that's  extreme  mindfulness  and  presence 
 and  that  comes  from  challenge  you  can
[50:26] only  enter  a  flow  state  being  in  the 
 zone  if  you've  got  some  kind  of 
 challenge  and  there's  so  many  more
[50:31] benefits  to  this  not  just  your  mental 
 health  but  increases  in  testosterone 
 when  you  challenge  yourself  and  when
[50:36] there's  some  kind  of  competition  your 
 testosterone  rises  setting  yourself  some 
 kind  of  challenges  where  you're  so
[50:41] focused  will  lead  to  more  success  and 
 accomplishments  and  it'll  make  you  feel 
 just  happier  and  more  proud  for  yourself
[50:46] so  this  might  seem  like  a  weird  part  of 
 this  guide  we're  talking  about  mental 
 health  why  am  i  talking  about  challenges 
 but  you  see  when  you  set  challenges  it
[50:52] just  kicks  your  brain  into  overdrive  and 
 lets  you  just  totally  focus  on  something 
 rather  than  like  ruminating  on  negative
[50:58] thoughts  so  the  way  that  you  can  improve 
 your  mental  health  and  also  the  rest  of 
 your  life  how  masculine  you  are  how
[51:03] successful  you  are  how  happy  and 
 accomplished  you  are  is  through  setting 
 yourself  some  kind  of  challenges  that
[51:08] you  can  obsess  over  for  example  you 
 could  be  reading  a  book  and  say  to 
 yourself  you  know  what  i'm  going  to 
 finish  this  book  by  the  end  of  the  week
[51:13] or  you  can  say  that  you  want  to  go  on 
 three  runs  this  week  you  want  to  run  for 
 a  total  of  10  kilometers  this  week  and
[51:18] you're  writing  it  down  you're  tracking 
 the  data  and  it's  exciting  because 
 you're  thinking  wait  it's  saturday  and  i 
 still  got  two  kilometers  i  don't  want  to
[51:24] go  right  now  you  know  what  okay  i'm 
 gonna  go  on  a  run  right  now  that  kind  of 
 aggressive  energy  makes  you  feel  good
[51:29] working  hard  on  a  meaningful  goal 
 naturally  makes  us  feel  good  about 
 ourselves  especially  if
[51:34] you  are  the  one  who  has  set  that  goal 
 that  challenge  you  know  it's  an 
 interesting  thing  that  you  go  a  large
[51:40] part  of  your  life  without  ever  setting 
 yourself  to  do  any  kind  of  work  or 
 challenge  because  the  teacher  in  school
[51:46] does  it  for  you  we've  been  conditioned  i 
 don't  mean  to  go  on  a  run  here  but  we've 
 been  conditioned  to  wait  for  an
[51:51] authority  figure  to  tell  us  what  to  do 
 to  set  us  challenges  and  work  we  need  to 
 become  that  authority  figure  for
[51:56] ourselves  it's  like  stand  up  straight 
 with  your  shoulders  back  and  safety  so 
 okay  i  am  going  to  do  this  thing  by  this
[52:01] date  we  can't  always  rely  on  the  teacher 
 or  the  boss  to  tell  us  what  to  do  we
[52:06] need  to  start  setting  challenges  for 
 ourselves  so  here's  the  actionable  step 
 just  take  a  minute  right  now  to  think
[52:12] and  maybe  write  down  one  or  two 
 challenges  goals  that  you  can  set  for 
 yourself  by  the  end  of  this  week  and  if
[52:17] it's  saturday  or  sunday  right  now  then 
 do  it  for  next  sunday  what  is  a 
 challenge  that  you  can  set  for  next
[52:22] sunday  perhaps  it's  to  finish  reading 
 this  book  to  work  out  five  times  to  go 
 on  three  runs  maybe  you  want  to  do  a
[52:28] longer  term  challenge  like  hit  one 
 million  subscribers  before  november 
 that's  mine  if  you're  watching  this 
 video  in  november  have  a  look  at  our
[52:34] channel  subscriber  counts  it's  going  to 
 be  over  1  million  save  yourself  one  or 
 two  challenges  right  now  and  they  could
[52:39] be  short  term  or  long  term  whatever  it 
 is  it's  just  some  kind  of  challenge  that 
 will  make  you  take  like  some  kind  of
[52:44] work  productive  thing  more  seriously  set 
 that  challenge  and  start  to  obsess  over 
 it  when  you  start  to  work  on  that
[52:50] challenge  you  will  naturally  just  feel 
 good  to  improve  your  mental  health  we 
 absolutely  have  to  talk  about  your
[52:55] physical  health  and  your  physical  health 
 may  actually  be  the  single  most 
 important  influence  on  your  mental
[53:01] health  it's  a  sad  state  for  the  majority 
 of  young  men  who  are  just  so  physically
[53:06] unhealthy  you  don't  realize  how  far  we 
 are  away  from  living  like  our  ancestors
[53:11] was  the  majority  of  us  sit  down  for  10 
 hours  a  day  school  makes  you  wake  up 
 when  you're  still  sleep  deprived  we
[53:16] don't  get  much  sunlight  anymore  we  don't 
 have  like  high  levels  of  testosterone 
 with  competition  and  challenge  with  our 
 brothers  we  eat  food  that's  been
[53:21] genetically  modified  with  pesticides  and 
 pumped  full  of  refined  sugars  there's  a
[53:26] lot  of  things  that  are  very  negatively 
 affecting  our  physical  health  and  you'll 
 find  that  if  you  improve  some  things  of
[53:32] your  physical  health  which  we'll  discuss 
 here  your  mental  health  will  improve  as 
 an  indirect  result  of  that  this  section
[53:38] of  the  guide  is  probably  going  to  give 
 you  the  biggest  improvements  in  your 
 mental  health  but  the  reason  why  i've 
 put  this  section  on  physical  health
[53:44] after  the  few  sections  we've  already 
 spoke  about  which  is  gratitude 
 mindfulness  and  challenge  is  that  you
[53:49] actually  need  to  do  these  things  first 
 to  be  able  to  make  progress  in  your 
 physical  health  just  like  everyone  else
[53:55] you've  probably  tried  to  improve  your 
 physical  health  you've  probably  tried  to 
 like  lose  weight  or  go  to  the  gym  or 
 improve  your  sleep  or  eat  cleaner  it's
[54:01] probably  always  felt  like  a  bit  of  a 
 struggle  like  you're  swimming  upstream 
 if  right  now  you're  struggling  with 
 things  like  to  be  able  to  go  to  the  gym
[54:07] consistently  to  be  able  to  eat  clean  you 
 know  there's  that  decision  to  be  made 
 should  you  eat  the  junk  food  and  you
[54:13] know  rationally  you  know  that  you 
 shouldn't  but  if  right  now  you're  still 
 at  the  level  where  you  just  keep 
 choosing  the  wrong  thing  if  you  struggle
[54:19] to  improve  your  sleep  if  you  struggle  to 
 improve  so  many  different  parts  of  your 
 physical  health  if  that  is  relatable  to 
 you  right  now  please  trust  me  when  i  say
[54:25] that  any  effort  you  make  to  try  to 
 improve  your  physical  health  will  be  a 
 waste  of  time  i  know  this  sounds  so
[54:30] weird  if  you  struggle  to  try  to  improve 
 your  physical  health  it's  a  waste  of 
 time  to  try  to  improve  it  directly  if
[54:36] you're  struggling  to  try  to  for  example 
 get  onto  a  good  clean  diet  and  you  know 
 you  keep  saying  i'm  gonna  go  on  a  diet
[54:41] but  then  you  keep  cheating  on  your  diet 
 if  you're  struggling  to  consistently 
 work  out  focusing  on  those  things  will
[54:46] just  constantly  just  keep  you  in  this 
 loop  where  you'll  never  achieve  anything 
 what  you  need  to  do  if  you're  currently
[54:51] struggling  with  things  like  diet  or 
 working  out  or  whatever  you  need  to 
 focus  on  the  previous  three  parts  of
[54:56] this  guide  gratitude  meditation  and 
 challenge  if  you  focus  on  them  instead 
 you'll  find  that  you'll  naturally  be
[55:01] able  to  actually  do  more  of  the  physical 
 health  habits  i  wasn't  able  to  improve 
 my  diet  for  literally  years  for  years  i
[55:07] tried  to  literally  for  years  i  tried  to 
 follow  all  these  fitness  youtubers  who 
 are  telling  me  this  diet's  better  than
[55:12] this  one  and  if  it  fits  your  macros  or 
 calories  income  you  know  they're  telling 
 me  all  these  things  and  i  simply  just 
 couldn't  stop  overeating  i  simply  just
[55:18] couldn't  say  no  to  the  junk  food  and  no 
 one  had  ever  spoke  about  this  before  i 
 realized  after  my  own  experimentation
[55:24] the  one  key  secret  to  be  able  to  improve 
 your  diet  isn't  all  of  these  fancy  diets
[55:29] it's  meditation  you  need  to  have  levels 
 of  mindfulness  gratitude  and  some  kind 
 of  challenge  to  be  able  to  improve  your
[55:34] physical  health  first  so  focus  on  those 
 sections  now  if  you're  going  to  continue 
 watching  this  part  of  the  guide  you're
[55:39] making  this  promise  right  now  that  you 
 already  have  started  to  meditate  and  do 
 some  kind  of  gratitude  practice  and
[55:44] you've  set  yourself  some  kind  of 
 challenge  like  okay  a  reasonable 
 challenge  okay  i  want  to  work  out  twice 
 this  week  you  should  have  all  those
[55:50] things  in  place  first  before  we  really 
 dive  deep  into  these  there's  three  parts 
 of  our  physical  health  that  greatly
[55:55] influence  our  mental  health  and  they  are 
 diet  exercise  and  sleep  your  diet  plays
[56:00] a  huge  role  in  how  you  feel  mentally  and 
 it  would  take  me  a  full  length  video  to 
 be  able  to  explain  it  in  detail  if  you
[56:06] want  my  very  very  detailed  explanation 
 of  diet  and  nutrition  in  a  way  that's
[56:11] explained  in  my  way  which  is  like  no  bs 
 no  fancy  words  just  you  know  just  talk 
 to  me  like  i'm  a  five-year-old  so  i  can
[56:16] really  understand  it  instead  of  all 
 these  like  scientists  telling  me  i 
 made  like  a  45-minute  diet  educational
[56:22] video  that  went  viral  and  i  have  it  up 
 as  a  card  on  screen  so  you  can  click  on 
 that  card  right  now  and  just  pause  that 
 video  and  just  maybe  save  it  to  go  watch
[56:28] later  and  you  can  watch  that  when  you're 
 totally  thinking  about  diets  it  would 
 take  me  far  too  long  to  explain 
 everything  in  terms  of  diet  here  but
[56:34] just  in  short  what  you  know  about  diet 
 and  nutrition  and  your  food  choices  is
[56:39] so  so  limited  and  the  issue  is  the 
 people  who  seem  like  they're  educating 
 you  right  now  you  know  these  fitness
[56:44] influencers  fitness  youtubers  especially 
 they're  all  selling  you  this  lie  which 
 is  based  on  like  you  can  eat  whatever
[56:49] you  want  and  you  can  still  lose  weight 
 and  the  thing  is  that  might  be  true  you 
 know  calories  in  calories  out  if  it  fits
[56:54] your  macros  those  things  might  be  true 
 but  those 
 eating  certain  foods  will  reduce  your
[56:59] health  that  should  not  be  a  big 
 statement  for  all  of  modern  times  we
[57:04] would  follow  this  one  golden  phrase 
 which  is  that  you  are  what  you  eat  and 
 in  the  last  10  years  the  fitness
[57:09] influencers  have  ruined  it  you  know 
 these  fitness  youtubers  they're  very 
 famous  and  they  make  videos  of  them 
 doing  like  10  000  calorie  challenges  and
[57:15] they've  got  abs  and  they're  like  look  at 
 me  i'm  eating  a  donut  you  can  actually 
 eat  a  donut  if  you  eat  the  right 
 calories  and  okay  you  can  be  lean  and
[57:20] eat  whatever  you  want  fine  but  when 
 we're  talking  about  health  the  issue  is 
 that  if  you  eat  something  like  a  donut
[57:25] which  is  full  of  refined  sugars  it  will 
 mess  up  your  gut  microbiome  mess  up 
 almost  like  what's  called  the  second
[57:31] brain  of  your  body  which  is  your  gut  it 
 will  mess  that  up  and  it  will  literally 
 influence  and  deteriorate  your  genes
[57:37] what  we  eat  has  a  huge  way  bigger  impact 
 on  how  we  feel  and  how  our  brain  works
[57:44] than  what  we  think  you  know  there  was  a 
 study  that  showed  that  if  you  give 
 natives  a  western  diet  so  these  guys
[57:49] they're  not  used  to  like  western  foods 
 junk  food  or  whatever  and  if  you  give 
 them  this  diet  their  intelligence
[57:54] literally  drops  the  food  that  we  eat  in 
 the  west  literally  makes  you  dumber  to
[57:59] think  that  your  diet  doesn't  really  play 
 more  of  a  role  than  just  calories  in 
 calories  out  is  so  so  simplified  that  it
[58:06] may  as  well  be  wrong  i  could  go  into  a 
 full-length  rant  here  about  diet  but 
 that  40-minute  guide  that's  popped  up  is
[58:12] like  a  card  on  your  video  screen  right 
 now  that  explains  it  all  and  so  you  can 
 go  and  have  a  look  at  that  now  if  you 
 want  some  simple  no  diet  advice
[58:18] to  follow  right  now  but  i  would  suggest 
 i've  done  so  much  like  research  on  this 
 and  the  sad  thing  is  that  it's  that
[58:23] totally  unsexy  answer  eat  a  variety  of 
 vegetables  fruits  meats  nuts  whole
[58:29] grains  eat  healthy  it's  like  literally 
 that  simple  and  and  the  other  term 
 healthy  is  kind  of  messed  up  now  from
[58:35] these  modern  companies  that  are 
 marketing  themselves  to  be  healthy  but 
 then  they're  actually  full  of  garbage
[58:40] they're  full  of  like  processed 
 ingredients  and  refined  sugars  which  are 
 classified  in  a  different  term  and
[58:45] everything  so  the  only  true  way  that  you 
 can  make  sure  that  you're  eating  as 
 healthy  as  possible  it's  a  cook  up  and
[58:50] eat  single  ingredient  meals  what  that 
 means  is  that  your  meal  is  comprised  of
[58:55] things  which  are  just  single  ingredients 
 for  example  a  potato  like  literally  just 
 a  potato  is  a  single  ingredient  the
[59:01] ingredient  inside  of  potato  is  potato  in 
 fact  potatoes  don't  even  have  an 
 ingredient  list  on  the  back  because  it's
[59:07] literally  just  potato  the  same  with 
 broccoli  the  same  with  salmon  that's 
 what  we  want  we  want  literally  just 
 single  ingredients  meals  and  of  course
[59:14] that's  very  different  from  what  we're 
 used  to  eating  we're  used  to  going  out 
 to  get  fast  food  where  you  start  getting 
 meal  deals  and  crisps  and  sandwiches  and
[59:20] processed  from  like  supermarkets 
 we're  used  to  all  that  so  of  course  it's 
 gonna  take  some  time  to  take  a  step  back
[59:25] from  this  where  i  would  recommend  for 
 you  to  do  this  is  to  choose  just  one 
 meal  of  your  day  and  make  that  a  one
[59:31] ingredient  meal  so  that  doesn't  mean  you 
 like  one  meal  is  literally  just  gonna  be 
 potatoes  just  potatoes  it  means  that
[59:36] everything  on  the  plate  is  a  single 
 ingredient  by  itself  so  potatoes  salmon
[59:42] broccoli  boom  that's  a  meal  right  there 
 that's  a  lot  better  than  for  example 
 having  a  fish  burger  which  has  been
[59:48] processed  and  it's  got  so  much  worse 
 things  and  you  might  be  thinking  but 
 wait  what's  the  difference  because  you
[59:53] know  if  the  macros  are  the  same  but  it's 
 not  about  the  macros  it's  not  about  the 
 calories  that's  such  a  simple  view  you
[59:59] would  have  to  watch  the  full  length 
 it'll  take  me  so  long  to  explain  it 
 again  the  food  you  eat  has  probably  the
[60:05] biggest  impact  on  your  hormones  and  all 
 those  processes  inside  your  body  and
[60:10] you've  got  to  think  what  will  be 
 happening  to  your  mind  and  body  if  you 
 eat  like  the  majority  of  people  you're
[60:16] not  like  them  honestly  like  you're 
 watching  a  video  a  40-minute  one-hour 
 two-hour  long  guide  on  mental  health
[60:23] perhaps  you  haven't  realized  this  just 
 yet  but  like  you  are  literally  so 
 different  maybe  you're  not  at  that  point
[60:28] when  you  know  you  go  do  your  own  grocery 
 shopping  but  if  you  do  and  it  when  you 
 go  on  to  you'll  notice  by  following
[60:34] videos  like  this  education  you're 
 probably  gonna  go  watch  the  diet  guide 
 and  you're  interested  in  like  nutrition 
 and  mental  health  but  when  you  go  out  to
[60:40] like  a  supermarket  you're  you  know 
 pushing  your  trolley  around  it's  got 
 food  you  know  the  groceries  that  you're 
 buying  and  you  kind  of  compared  your
[60:45] trolley  to  the  trolley  of  the  average 
 person  next  to  you  it  will  look  very 
 different  the  trolley  of  like  a  real
[60:51] athlete  not  a  fitness  youtuber  but  a 
 real  athlete  a  warrior  it's  just  a  bunch 
 of  vegetables  meat  single  ingredients
[60:58] some  seasoning  that's  it  nuts  you  know 
 healthy  stuff  like  that  which  is  a 
 single  ingredient  all  natural  and  the
[61:04] trolley  of  like  more  of  a  average  person 
 is  a  bunch  of  processed  sugary 
 cereal  cookies  biscuits  cakes  ready-made
[61:11] meals  these  small  choices  that  you  make 
 truly  have  a  huge  impact  in  how  you  feel
[61:17] mentally  and  if  you  are  a  young  man  and 
 you  don't  have  control  over  your  diets 
 because  your  parents  just  make  your  food
[61:22] what  advice  do  i  have  for  you  that 
 situation  does  kind  of  suck  and  more  and 
 more  i'm  hearing  of  like  young  guys
[61:27] whose  parents  are  quite  unhealthy  and  so 
 they  just  kind  of  assume  this  young 
 man's  going  to  eat  their  own  healthy
[61:32] food  too  if  i  was  you  in  your  position  i 
 would  hope  to  have  the  confidence  to 
 kind  of  like  speak  to  them  and  just  kind 
 of  say  like  oh  like  i  want  to  eat
[61:38] healthier  i  don't  really  want  to  eat 
 mcdonald's  anymore  or  something  and  just 
 see  how  that  goes  and  of  course  some 
 parents  won't  be  okay  with  that  if  it's
[61:44] not  something  you  can  totally  control 
 what  i  would  do  is  just  simply  ask  your 
 parents  for  more  single  ingredient  foods
[61:51] in  your  meal  so  if  your  mom's  gonna  cook 
 something  and  it's  somewhat  unhealthy 
 but  you  could  probably  tell  oh  can  i 
 have  like  more  potatoes  can  i  have  more
[61:57] chicken  and  if  your  parents  are  gonna 
 get  you  something  which  is  unhealthy  and 
 you  just  need  to  eat  it  because 
 otherwise  they'll  like  shout  at  you  or
[62:02] something  and  you  know  they're  gonna  get 
 you  mcdonald's  what  i  would  do  is  still 
 eat  it  and  somewhat  enjoy  it  but  leave  a 
 little  bit  of  it  just  eat  less  of  it
[62:08] just  kind  of  tell  them  like  oh  yeah  i'm 
 not  really  that  hungry  i  really  want 
 something  healthy  i  really  want  potatoes
[62:13] just  normal  potatoes  i  really  want  just 
 normal  chicken  without  you  know  being  in 
 a  burger  or  something  the  second  thing
[62:18] we  said  that  you  can  do  for  your 
 physical  health  that  will  improve  your 
 mental  health  is  exercise  and  this  one's 
 just  really  simple  you  don't  need  me  to
[62:23] explain  the  benefits  of  exercise 
 exercise  at  least  three  times  a  week 
 preferably  five  to  six  maybe  even  seven
[62:29] one  thing  that  a  lot  of  guys  on 
 self-improvement  mess  up  with  is  that 
 they  consider  their  resistance  training
[62:35] you  know  weightlifting  calisthenics  they 
 consider  that  as  the  only  kind  of 
 exercise  that  they  do  and  so  when  you're
[62:41] on  a  weightlifting  program  or  a 
 calisthenics  program  you  have  rest  days 
 and  you  have  training  days  and  maybe  you 
 train  three  times  a  week  or  four  or  five
[62:47] or  six  days  and  you  kind  of  just  want  to 
 rest  and  not  really  think  about  exercise 
 for  the  days  that  you're  off  but  in  fact
[62:53] on  the  rest  days  from  weightlifting  and 
 calisthenics  you're  still  supposed  to 
 move  your  body  our  ancestors  moved  their
[62:59] bodies  every  single  day  they  did  some 
 form  of  cardio  to  maximize  the  mental 
 health  benefits  you  should  work  out  for
[63:04] at  least  20  minutes  maybe  every  single 
 day  and  just  every  now  and  then  take  a 
 full  day  off  but  even  then  on  that  day
[63:10] you  still  don't  want  to  like  lounge 
 around  and  just  be  sat  on  the  couch  and 
 stuff  and  be  sat  on  the  computer  chair 
 for  10  hours  of  the  day  you  still  want
[63:16] to  take  time  to  walk  a  few  kilometers 
 every  single  day  to  maybe  go  on  a  quick 
 run  to  do  some  random  like  shadow  boxing
[63:22] just  something  that  gets  you  a little 
 bit  sweaty  and  pumped  up  and  the  third 
 and  very  important  thing  with  your 
 physical  health  that  impacts  your  mental
[63:28] health  is  sleep  and  sleep  is  so  like  i 
 know  i  speak  about  it  sometimes  but  it 
 is  so
[63:33] overlooked  in  the  majority  of  people  i 
 can  say  for  100  certainty  that  your
[63:38] sleep  is  not  good  enough  it  takes  a  lot 
 of  intention  to  really  improve  your 
 sleep  and  the  majority  of  people  have
[63:44] just  accepted  a  lack  of  sleep  because 
 we're  conditioned  to  through  the
[63:49] education  system  like  you  know  as 
 teenagers  we  need  a  lot  more  sleep  like 
 teenagers  need  more  sleep  than  adults  do
[63:55] and  to  make  a  teenager  wake  up  for  7  00 
 a.m  is  actually  inhumane  if  you  want  to
[64:00] really  learn  about  the  consequences  of 
 not  getting  enough  sleep  and  you  really 
 want  to  feel  a  little  bit  anxious  about
[64:05] this  the  book  why  we  sleep  by  matthew 
 walker  is  a  good  resource  it  kind  of 
 scares  you  and  gives  you  anxiety  in  the
[64:10] sense  that  he'll  literally  just  grill 
 all  the  problems  that  will  happen  when 
 you  have  a  lack  of  sleep  and  maybe  that
[64:16] isn't  really  beneficial  because 
 sometimes  then  that  can  make  you  anxious 
 when  you're  trying  to  sleep  but  it  can 
 be  helpful  to  just  keep  those  things  in
[64:21] mind  so  you  realize  how  important  sleep 
 actually  is  since  i  read  that  book  i
[64:26] talk  sleep  so  much  more  seriously  i  have 
 a  sleep  ring  here  which  i  wear  all  the 
 time  it's  300  and  it  tracks  my  sleep  and
[64:32] gives  me  lots  of  data  and  i'm  also  on  a 
 2 
 500
[64:37] program  with  these  experts  on  sleep  and 
 they're  literally  speaking  to  me  every 
 day  looking  at  the  data  telling  me  like
[64:43] so  many  random  things  that  i  can  do  okay 
 listen  to  this  youtube  videos  like  you 
 know  particular  sounds  listen  to  this
[64:48] when  you  go  to  sleep  and  tell  us  okay 
 we'll  look  at  your  data  and  we'll  see 
 how  you  feel  okay  report  your  sleep  log 
 every  single  day  your  sleep  efficiency
[64:54] your  rem  sleep 
 just  everything  these  guys  are  experts 
 and  i've  been  working  with  them  for  six
[64:59] weeks  and  we  have  a  couple  more  weeks 
 left  and  of  all  the  things  that  i've 
 worked  with  with  this  coach  i've  paid  a 
 lot  of  money  for  i  think  there's  three
[65:05] main  benefits  there's  three  main 
 learning  lessons  that  you  can  take  and 
 you've  essentially  just  gotten  them  for
[65:10] free  so  it's  like  i'm  sharing  the 
 learning  lessons  that  i  got  from  this 
 program  with  you  the  number  one  main 
 thing  that  these  coaches  have  put  on  to
[65:17] me  that  i've  also  heard  from  a  bunch  of 
 like  experts  scientists  and  there's  one 
 who's  really  famous  on  youtube  andrew
[65:23] huberman  all  these  guys  are  saying  that 
 morning  sunlight  is  incredibly  important 
 it's  one  of  like  the  very  few
[65:28] non-negotiables  that  i  have  with  like 
 the  sleep  performance  coach  that  i'm 
 with  that  every  single  morning  as  soon
[65:33] as  the  sun  comes  out  you're  outside  just 
 kind  of  getting  it  into  your  eyeballs 
 andrew  huberman  explains  this  really
[65:39] well  in  a  bunch  of  podcasts  that  he's 
 done  so  you  can  literally  just  search  on 
 youtube  andrew  huberman  morning  sunlight
[65:44] when  you  do  this  and  you  get  sunlight 
 into  your  eyes  first  thing  as  soon  as 
 you  know  the  sun  comes  out  which  in  the
[65:49] uk  right  now  it's  about  6  a.m  when  you 
 do  this  you  get  it  for  5  minutes  10 
 minutes  20  minutes  you'll  find  that
[65:54] you'll  naturally  wake  up  way  earlier  and 
 it's  actually  one  of  the  things  that 
 just  improves  your  health  and  your
[65:59] dopamine  levels  and  you  know  all  the 
 sciencey  stuff  to  such  a  great  level  i 
 think  about  why  that  is  just  think  about
[66:04] what  our  ancestors  did  like  they  would 
 wake  up  to  the  sunlight  and  just  be  out
[66:09] all  day  whereas  we  wake  up  and  we  just 
 stay  inside  the  only  light  that  we  see 
 is  like  the  light  from  our  phones  and
[66:14] laptops  and  one  of  the  very  important 
 points  that  andrew  huberman  makes  about 
 this  is  that  you  must  go  outside  this
[66:19] you  cannot  stay  inside  and  get  the 
 sunlight  from  like  glass  or  anything  or 
 you  know  inside  of  a  car  you  literally
[66:25] just  have  to  be  standing  outside  so 
 there's  a  level  of  discomfort  involved 
 in  that  but  it  the  roi  is  massive  the
[66:31] second  major  thing  that  you  can  do  to 
 improve  your  sleep  which  will  improve 
 your  mental  health  is  to  go  to  sleep  and
[66:36] wake  up  at  the  exact  same  time  every 
 single  day  even  on  weekends  and  so  this 
 means  that  your  wake  up  and  your  bedtime
[66:42] need  to  be  reasonable  and  sustainable  so 
 for  example  if  you're  in  school  or  work
[66:47] your  wake  up  time  could  be  6  a.m  and 
 your  bedtime  could  be  9  p.m  and  that 
 gives  you  a  nine  hour  window  to  sleep
[66:53] the  majority  of  people  mess  this  up 
 because  when  they're  forced  to  wake  up 
 for  something  like  school  or  work  they
[66:59] do  it  but  then  on  the  weekends  when 
 they're  not  they  end  up  having  a  huge 
 lion  which  then  has  like  this  weirdly
[67:05] cascading  effect  even  though  it  feels 
 healthy  to  think  okay  well  you  know  i 
 like  tomorrow  i  may  as  well  sleep  more
[67:10] and  sure  you  might  do  it  that  might  be  a 
 benefit  but  then  when  you  do  sleep  more 
 that  cascading  effect  how  it  kind  of
[67:15] messes  up  the  rest  of  your  day  and  then 
 you  end  up  going  to  sleep  later  just 
 gives  you  this  lack  of  stability  this  is
[67:20] where  the  majority  of  people  mess  up 
 that  even  on  weekends  any  day  you  should 
 be  waking  up  and  going  to  sleep  at
[67:26] pretty  much  the  same  time  and  the  third 
 final  thing  that  you  can  do  to  improve 
 your  sleep  which  you've  heard  before  but
[67:31] no  one  has  really  explained  this  well  is 
 winding  down  before  bed  so  this  is 
 usually  when  someone's  explaining  oh
[67:36] yeah  how  to  improve  your  sleep  and 
 they'll  say  in  such  a  short  way  they'll 
 be  okay  so  wind  down  before  bed  and  you 
 know  just  don't  use  technology  for  two
[67:42] hours  before  bed  i  would  hear  that 
 advice  never  really  take  it  seriously 
 and  you  probably  haven't  either  just  be 
 honest  when  you've  hurt  you've  heard
[67:47] this  before  oh  you  know  wind  down  before 
 bed  but  you've  never  really  taken  the 
 advice  and  i  understand  now  why  because 
 no  one  has  ever  explained  why  that's
[67:53] important  what  actually  happens 
 specifically  what  we  need  to  do  it's  not 
 just  gonna  wind  down  that's  not
[67:58] scientific  what  we  need  to  do  is  lower 
 our  heart  rate  before  bed  so  that  by  the
[68:03] time  we  go  to  sleep  our  heart  rate  is 
 already  at  its  lowest  point  so  when  you 
 have  a  tracker  like  this  or  an  apple
[68:09] watch  and  you  can  see  data  on  your  heart 
 rate  what  we  want  is  to  spend  at  least 
 20  minutes  if  not  about  an  hour  doing
[68:15] the  things  that  drastically  lower  our 
 heart  rate  so  that  when  we  get  into  bed
[68:20] our  heart  rate  is  already  lowered 
 instead  of  our  heart  rate  being  higher 
 and  needing  to  lower  when  we're  trying
[68:25] to  sleep  so  this  ring  is  very  important 
 this  ring  is  called  an  aura  ring  it's 
 like  300  i'm  not  sponsored  by  them  but  i
[68:31] think  it's  a  very  good  investment  and  it 
 gives  you  i'm  gonna  show  you  some  of  my 
 data  to  show  you  right  this  right  now  is
[68:37] data  from  a  night  where  i  wind  it  down 
 properly  before  bedtime  i  spent  like  an 
 hour  literally  i'm  gonna  teach  you  the
[68:43] secret  technique  which  no  one  has  ever 
 spoke  about  in  terms  of  winding  down 
 before  bedtime  but  i  did  this  i  did  the
[68:48] technique  i  fully  wind  it  down  and  you 
 can  see  that  my  heart  rate  was  already 
 low  as  soon  as  i  fell  asleep  which  is
[68:53] fantastic  so  i  had  a  good  night's  sleep 
 here  but  then  this  second  graph  is  from 
 a  night  where  i  didn't  do  this  full  wind
[68:58] down  procedure  you  can  see  that  it  takes 
 me  hours  to  wind  down  and  get  my  lowest 
 heart  rate  the  most  effective  way  to
[69:04] wind  down  before  bedtime  i  have  found 
 this  is  weirdly  really  specific  is  to
[69:09] literally  lie  down  on  the  floor  for  some 
 reason  the  floor  works  so  much  better
[69:14] than  your  bed  lie  down  on  the  floor  face 
 up  no  pillow  literally  just  like 
 starfish  on  the  floor  like  you  would  at
[69:19] the  end  of  a  yoga  session  and  then 
 follow  like  a  very  long  meditation  guide 
 so  again  i'll  have  a  follow-along
[69:24] meditation  youtube  video  uploaded  and  it 
 will  show  us  a  card  on  screen  so  click 
 on  that  right  now  before  bedtime  lie
[69:30] down  on  the  floor  for  like  20  minutes 
 maybe  40  minutes  maybe  an  hour  and 
 literally  just  follow  some  kind  of  like
[69:35] deep  breathing  exercise  it's  just  so 
 interesting  meditating  lying  down  feels
[69:40] a  hundred  times  better  than  trying  to  do 
 it  whilst  like  sat  up  awkwardly  and  your 
 back  kind  of  hurts  and  everything  lying
[69:46] down  on  the  floor  just  feels  so  nice  for 
 some  reason  i  don't  know  if  i'm  just 
 weird  about  this  but  if  you  try  this 
 tonight  half  an  hour  before  you're
[69:52] supposed  to  go  to  bed  lie  down  on  the 
 floor  and  literally  just  focus  on 
 breathing  eyes  closed  no  phone  no 
 nothing  no  pillow  literally  just
[69:58] starfish  on  the  floor  and  then  do  your 
 nighttime  routine  get  into  bed  and 
 you'll  find  that  you're  already  rested 
 and  so  when  you  do  fall  asleep  it's  like
[70:04] your  heart  rate  was  already  relaxed 
 instead  of  needing  to  spend  hours  to 
 relax
[70:09] social  connection  kind  of  means  like 
 having  friends  and  family  and  people 
 that  you  have  some  kind  of  emotional
[70:14] attachment  to  around  you  people  who  you 
 spend  time  with  this  a  book  on  a
[70:19] japanese  concept  and  it  says  that  the 
 single  greatest  aspect  of  longevity  is
[70:25] social  connection  longevity  means  living 
 longer  the  single  greatest  way  to  live 
 longer  is  to  have  friends  if  we  flip
[70:31] that  around  and  we  have  to  discuss  the 
 lack  of  friends 
 loneliness  chances  are  you've
[70:36] experienced  bouts  of  loneliness  those 
 periods  where  you  don't  physically  spend
[70:41] time  to  anyone  that  you  really  really 
 care  about  you  don't  really  have  like  a 
 bunch  of  close  male  friends  who  you  feel
[70:46] like  you  can  trust  you  perhaps  don't 
 have  like  a  girlfriend  love  or  intimacy 
 or  affection  your  family  aren't  around
[70:51] or  maybe  if  your  family  are  around  you 
 don't  have  like  a  great  relationship  you 
 don't  even  hug  each  other  you  don't  even 
 tell  each  other  that  you  you  love  each
[70:56] other  all  of  these  things  greatly  will 
 influence  your  mental  health  i'd  say 
 loneliness  is  kind  of  like  sleep
[71:02] deprivation  in  that  it  makes  100  of  your 
 life  worse  so  for  this  part  of  the  guide 
 we  do  have  to  discuss  the  ability  to
[71:08] make  and  maintain  friends  which  is 
 easier  said  than  done  but  there  is  a 
 mindset  in  regards  to  making  friends
[71:14] that  might  help  you  significantly  and 
 that's  to  realize  that  making  friends 
 and  maintaining  friends  comes  down  to
[71:21] your  social  skills  and  your  social 
 skills  is  kind  of  like  a  skill  in  a 
 video  game  so  remember  when  we  used  to
[71:26] play  video  games  and  you  have  like 
 skills  that  you  could  level  up  and  so 
 you  start  at  level  one  or  level  zero  and
[71:32] then  you  have  to keep  doing  like  certain 
 activities  or  tasks  and  you  gain 
 experience  remember  in  games  experience
[71:37] is  shortened  to  xp  so  you  gain  xp  in 
 this  skill  and  then  you  level  it  up  over 
 time  and  then  as  you  get  a  higher  level
[71:42] you  get  more  of  the  rewards  of  that 
 skill  well  social  skills  are  just  that  a 
 skill  you'll  do  very  well  if  you  start
[71:49] seeing  life  as  a  video  game  and  one  of 
 the  very  very  important  skills  which  the 
 majority  of  us  have  spent  zero  time
[71:55] leveling  up  is  our  social  skills  we 
 understand  how  nice  it  is  to  have 
 friends  but  the  majority  of  us  have
[72:00] never  even  put  in  an  hour  into  leveling 
 up  our  social  skills  and  just  like  in  a 
 video  game  there's  a  two-step  process  to
[72:06] level  up  so  we  pick  the  skill  that  we 
 want  to  level  up  in  this  case  it's 
 social  skills  or  in  a  video  game  like
[72:11] runescape  it's  magic  and  the  first  thing 
 that  we  need  to  do  before  we  can  really 
 even  level  it  up  is  that  we  have  to
[72:17] actually  just  simply  learn  what  actually 
 gets  you  experience  in  this  skill  so
[72:22] when  you  first  start  a  video  game  it's 
 like  you  have  to  click  on  like  the 
 informational  card  you  know  you  click  on 
 like  the  magic  skill  and  it  says  oh  well
[72:28] you  can  gain  magic  experience  by  using 
 this  spell  or  doing  this  or  this  that's 
 the  same  thing  we  have  to  do  with  social
[72:33] skills  we  have  to  actually  learn  what 
 improves  our  social  skills  and  we  can 
 categorize  certain  activities  that  will
[72:38] gain  our  social  skills  experience  so 
 that  this  becomes  very  much  like  a  game 
 for  example  i'd  say  holding  eye  contact
[72:44] and  smiling  at  a  stranger  it  gives  you 
 20  social  skills  experience  stopping  to
[72:49] have  a  chat  with  them  if  you  initiated 
 the  chat  gives  you  a  hundred  social 
 skills  experience  conducting  yourself
[72:54] well  in  that  conversation  with  this 
 stranger  gives  you  200  social  skills 
 experience  you  get  like  a  whole  level  up
[73:00] if  you  do  that  getting  rejected  but 
 maintaining  a  good  positive  mindset 
 gives  you  500  social  skills  experience
[73:07] all  we  need  to  do  is  get  out  into  a 
 social  environment  and  practice  things 
 like  eye  contact  smiling  speaking  to
[73:12] strangers  having  like  a  slightly  longer 
 conversation  with  the  cashier  at  a  shop 
 and  then  we  can  level  it  up  we  can
[73:17] purposely  go  and  try  and  get  rejected  by 
 people  we  can  just  go  and  ask  people 
 almost  like  silly  questions  just  for  the
[73:23] sake  of  experiencing  some  level  of 
 discomfort  you  could  go  into  a  store  and 
 ask  them  can  i  have  that  tv  for  free  and
[73:28] of  course  they're  gonna  say  no  but  you 
 weren't  really  trying  to  get  the  tv  you 
 just  wanted  to  experience  the  discomfort 
 of  just  being  in  a  social  situation  and
[73:34] getting  rejected  by  someone 
 congratulations  just  by  doing  that  weird 
 activity  your  social  skills  just  went  up
[73:39] an  entire  level  the  higher  level  that 
 you  have  in  your  social  skills  the  way
[73:44] more  easier  you'll  find  it  to  meet  new 
 friends  and  also  to  maintain  those 
 friendships  in  a  way  more  valuable
[73:49] relationship  than  you've  ever  had  before 
 you  need  some  humility  right  here  right 
 now  and  i  know  this  is  gonna  hurt  if
[73:54] you're  watching  a  video  like  this 
 your  social  skills  are  trash 
 i'm  never  going  to  sugarcoat  anything
[74:00] for  you  when  you  click  onto  my  channel  i 
 will  always  tell  you  the  total  truth  i'd 
 say  95  of  people  social  skills  are
[74:07] absolutely  trash  i  would  say  mine  are 
 decent  now  and  i've  been  actively
[74:12] working  on  improving  them  for  a  little 
 while  answer  this  question  honestly  have 
 you  read  books  on  social  skills  have  you
[74:17] taken  courses  on  social  skills  have  you 
 went  out  have  you  literally  left  your 
 house  with  the  intention  okay  i'm  gonna
[74:22] gain  some  experience  in  my  social  skills 
 because  the  majority  of  people  have 
 never  done  that  now  interestingly 
 there's  a  group  of  popular  social  people
[74:28] who  have  never  necessarily  improved 
 their  social  skills  they've  never  you 
 know  left  their  house  thinking  about
[74:33] social  skills  they've  never  read  a 
 social  skills  book  and  so  you  might  be 
 wondering  wait  they  have  not  had  to 
 level  theirs  but  they're  really  popular
[74:39] so  what  gives  well  some  people  are  quite 
 fortunate  enough  to  start  with  a 
 positive  feedback  loop  when  they're
[74:44] young  you  know  like  they  were  just 
 raised  right  and  they  just  had  like  a 
 cute  baby  face  or  something  when  they're
[74:49] five  years  old  in  primary  school  and  so 
 everyone  was  kind  of  nice  to  them  they 
 were  nice  to  everyone  else  and  it's  a
[74:54] positive  feedback  loop  and  you  know  they 
 go  through  school  kind  of  feeling  kind 
 of  popular  because  they're  just  a  nice 
 bright  kid  to  spend  time  with  chances
[74:59] are  if  you're  watching  this  video  you're 
 not  that  person  so  we  have  to  put  in 
 some  more  intention  into  leveling  up 
 this  very  valuable  skill  i've  made
[75:05] videos  on  social  skills  and  i've  even 
 done  a  full  skillshare  class  on  social 
 skills  like  a  one  hour  in  something
[75:10] master  class  on  social  skills  which  i'll 
 have  pop  up  as  a  card  so  click  that 
 right  now  if  you  want  to  gain  more
[75:15] knowledge  on  leveling  up  your  social 
 skills  at  this  point  a  lot  of  your  men 
 ask  the  same  question  and  it  might  even
[75:20] be  in  your  mind  right  now  where  do  i  go 
 to  meet  friends  this  question  has  been 
 asked  to  me  so  many  times  and  so  many
[75:25] young  men  are  always  wondering  you  know 
 where  do  i  go  and  your  answers  are 
 always  cliche  and  stereotypical  oh  go  to
[75:30] the  gym  or  try  in  school  or  go  to  go  for 
 a  walk  and  stuff  this  question  and 
 therefore  the  answers  are  fundamentally
[75:36] not  valuable  the  question  is  the  wrong 
 thing  to  ask  you  should  never  be  asking 
 where  do  i  go  to  meet  friends  you  should
[75:42] instead  change  the  question  to  who  do  i 
 become  to  meet  friends  i  don't  want  to
[75:47] go  into  a  full  rant  but  in  the  modern 
 day  we  are  very  very  weak  we're  very 
 weak  and  we  seek  comfort  and  quick
[75:53] results  and  instant  gratification  so  a 
 lot  of  people  and  probably  you  and 
 probably  me  for  the  longest  time  of  my
[75:59] life  we  wanted  to  know  simply  just  okay 
 where  can  we  go  to  make  it  easy  where 
 can  we  go  there's  like  there's  just  an
[76:04] abundance  of  friends  just  wait  waiting 
 for  us  to  meet  them  that's  not  how  it 
 works  you  can't  just  search  for  the
[76:09] quick  shortcut  and  ask  people  where  can 
 i  go  where  it's  easy  to  make  friends  and 
 then  someone  says  oh  go  to  a  martial 
 arts  club  oh  go  to  the  gym  is  that  this
[76:15] never  works  this  advice  never  ever  works 
 for  people  you  know  why 
 someone  will  recommend  to  you  go  to  a
[76:21] martial  arts  club  to  make  friends 
 because  that's  where  they've  made 
 friends  right  you  go  you've  got  a  low 
 level  in  social  skills  and  then  you
[76:27] become  that  kind  of  awkward  guy  in  the 
 martial  arts  club  who  kind  of  comes  in 
 at  the  right  time  you  know  gets  changed
[76:32] does  the  session  gets  changed  and then 
 goes  off  you  won't  become  that  social 
 butterfly  guy  in  there  just  simply
[76:37] because  you've  shown  up  to  the 
 environment  it's  not  about  where  you  go 
 it's  about  who  you  are  so  you  need  some
[76:42] humility  right  now  and  really  honestly 
 answer  this  question  have  you  made  good 
 new  friends  over  the  last  few  months  do
[76:48] you  often  get  into  really  nice  deep 
 loving  spontaneous  conversations  with 
 strangers  because  if  you  don't  that
[76:53] symbolizes  that  you  have  quite  a  low 
 level  in  your  social  skills  and  that  is 
 the  thing  to  focus  on  not  just  simply
[76:58] like  oh  wait  where  should  i  go  to  make 
 friends  it's  who  you  should  become  so 
 let's  ask  that  question  who  should  you 
 become  to  make  more  friends  if  you  want
[77:05] the  mental  health  benefit  of  being 
 surrounded  by  like  a  group  of  guys  who 
 actually  really  care  about  you  who  want
[77:10] to  grow  with  you  because  that's  so 
 incredibly  important  you  know  i  told  you 
 my  journey  at  the  start  of  this  video
[77:15] when  i  left  the  city  that  i  spent  a 
 bunch  of  time  with  when  you  know  i 
 turned  into  like  a  boy  a  party  boy
[77:21] and  i  was  taking  drugs  and  i  moved  back 
 home  to  my  family's  house 
 i  moved  home  and  i  didn't  speak  to
[77:27] anyone  i  wasn't  using  social  media  i 
 didn't  even  tell  any  of  my  old  friends 
 that  i  moved  back  home 
 i  was  just  back  home
[77:34] and  i  was 
 just  by  myself 
 for  months  and  months  and  months
[77:40] i  didn't  even  speak  i  didn't  even  have 
 literally  a  single  friend  i  was  reading
[77:45] the  book  how  to  win  friends  and 
 influence  people  by  dale  carnegie 
 and  as  soon  as  i  would  learn  something
[77:50] from  it  i  would  set  the  book  down  so  you 
 know  i  learned  like  okay  if  you  smile 
 people  will  like  you  more  if  you  ask
[77:56] someone  a  question  based  on  what  they're 
 interested  in  instead  of  you  they'll 
 like  you  more
[78:02] i  would  learn  something  small  like  this 
 i  would  set  the  book  down  and  i  would 
 literally  walk  out  of  my  house  and  go
[78:07] and  use  whatever  i  just  learned  on  a 
 stranger  nearby  i  went  from  having  just 
 really  weird  trash  social  skills  because
[78:13] i  spent  like  two  years  smoking  weed  all 
 day  every  day  so  my  social  skills  were 
 just  trash  you  know  my  brain  would  just 
 kind  of  like  go  blank  when  i'd  be
[78:19] speaking  to  people  and  i  just  slowly 
 started  to  level  it  up  and  gain  social 
 skills  experience  and  you  know  i  was
[78:25] very  busy  and  determined  at  the  time  so 
 i  didn't  necessarily  feel 
 that  bad
[78:30] but  i've  literally  got  private  videos  of 
 myself  that  i  would  record  on  my  phone 
 you  know  like  videos  that  i've  never
[78:35] released  to  youtube  and  it's  literally 
 just  me  speaking  to  like  me  and  i'm  just 
 kind  of  saying  like  oh  your  life's  going
[78:41] really  good  i've  stopped  smoking  weed  my 
 diet's  really  improved  but  there's  one 
 major  problem  like  i'm  just  lonely
[78:47] i  wish  i  had  like  some  boys  like  a 
 brother  to  train  with  in  the  gym 
 i  wish  i  had  people  to  talk  to  after  the
[78:53] youtube  channel  started  to  grow  and  i 
 hired  my  first  employee  after  a  little 
 while  we  would  hop  on  like  video  calls
[78:58] and  you  know  just  start  laughing  about 
 stuff  and  like  we  ended  up  becoming  very 
 very  good  friends  and  he's  my  best
[79:03] friend  to  this  day  his  name's  sam  i  wish 
 for  you  to  have  what  i  have  with  him  a 
 close 
 male  best  friend
[79:09] who  you  can  consider  kind  of  like  a 
 brother  who  has  your  back  who  you  know 
 for  a  fact  would  literally  fight  for  you
[79:14] that's  incredibly  valuable  a  guy  that 
 you  can  be  totally  authentic  with 
 a  guy  that  you  can  message  to  say  like
[79:20] oh  bro  i  feel  like  it's  so  valuable 
 but  you  need  a  certain  level  of  social 
 skills  to  be  able  to  attract  that  kind
[79:25] of  person  because  the  person  that  you 
 want  to  be  friends  with  has  to  want  to 
 be  friends  with  you  so  if  you  take  a
[79:31] minute  right  now  to  think  about  what 
 kind  of  guy  you  want  to  be  friends  with 
 just  like  almost  visualize  him  he's
[79:36] funny  he  he  talks  like  this  he  has  these 
 values  this  is  how  you  spend  time  with 
 him  you  hop  on  like  discord  calls  or
[79:41] maybe  you  meet  in  person  you  go  to  the 
 gym  imagine  the  friend  that  you  want  to 
 make  and  then  imagine  from  his  point  of
[79:46] view  who  he  wants  to  be  friends  with  i 
 know  this  sounds  horrible  but  that  guy 
 probably  doesn't  want  to  be  friends  with
[79:51] like  a  depressed  sad  anxious  young  man 
 he  doesn't  want  to  be  friends  with  like 
 a  really  lazy
[79:56] guy  who's  negative  who  complains  all  the 
 time  he  wants  to  be  friends  with  a  guy 
 who's  quite  upbeat  and  encouraging  who
[80:01] thinks  about  him  who  like  talks  to  him 
 in  a  supportive  way  he  wants  to  be 
 friends  with  a  guy  who's  funny  he  wants
[80:06] to  be  friends  with  a  guy  who's  got  a 
 level  of  like  carefreeness  who's  not 
 overthinking  all  the  time  he  wants  to  be 
 friends  with  a  guy  who  seems  happy  who
[80:12] smiles  who  takes  an  interest  in  him  who 
 invites  him  to  do  some  fun  things  could 
 that  be  you  because  a  lot  of  us  we  have
[80:19] this  like  this  kind  of  personality  where 
 we  can't  see  our  weaknesses 
 and  we  don't  realize  this  a  lot  of  us
[80:24] don't  really  bring  that  much  to  the 
 table  in  terms  of  friendship  i  can  admit 
 for  a  very  long  time  i  was  one  of  these
[80:30] people  it  takes  a  certain  level  of 
 confidence  and  humility  for  you  but  you 
 would  get  my  respect  for  this  if  you
[80:35] held  your  hand  up  and  you  just  said  you 
 know  what 
 i  probably  don't  bring  that  much
[80:40] value  to  a  friendship  right  now  i'm 
 probably  not  that  like  fun  to  be  around 
 i  should  improve  on  that  because  a  lot
[80:46] of  young  guys  have  this  kind  of  really 
 sad  depressed  outlook  on  friendship  and 
 they're  like  oh  you  know  it's  so  hard  to 
 make  friends  and  i  don't  trust  anyone
[80:52] anyway  i'm  a  lone  wolf  but  they  never 
 have  the  humility  to  just  think  yeah 
 like  if  i  was  a  better  person  people
[80:57] would  want  to  be  friends  with  me  so  i 
 know  that  this  is  a  very  hard  to  swallow 
 pill  and  it's  not  very  positive  you  know
[81:02] i'm  kind  of  making  you  say  yeah  i'm  a 
 piece  of  and  that's  why  no  one 
 wants  to  be  friends  with  me  but
[81:07] sometimes  you  have  to  admit  to  yourself 
 yeah  like  i  have  a  little  bit  of  a  peace 
 issue  i'm  always  quite  self-interested  i
[81:12] don't  really  ask  good  questions  to  the 
 other  people  i  don't  take  an  interest  in 
 them  i  don't  really  smile  i  find  that
[81:17] awkward  i'm  not  funny  i'm  not  even  that 
 much  of  a  nice  person  i'm  not  very 
 supportive  i  always  forget  things  about 
 my  friends  because  if  you  can  admit
[81:23] these  things  then  you  can  make  progress 
 on  them  you  should  right  now  have  a  new 
 goal  or  intention  in  mind  which  is  to
[81:28] level  up  your  social  skills  your  social 
 skills  are  literally  the  skill  of 
 meeting  and  making  friends  if  you  want
[81:34] my  help  with  that  again  i'll  have  like 
 my  social  skills  videos  and  master  class 
 come  up  on  the  screen  somewhere  also  if
[81:39] you  want  to  make  friends  online  you  can 
 join  our  discord  server  that  will  be 
 linked  in  the  description  i  think  we
[81:44] have  around  80  000  young  men  who  have 
 joined  this  server  we're  all  on  self
[81:49] improvement  we're  all  talking  about 
 social  skills  and  mental  health  and 
 discipline  and  no  fapping  there's  a
[81:54] bunch  of  guys  from  age  12  to  like  25  30 
 you'll  probably  find  some  people  to
[81:59] speak  to  in  there  one  of  my  mods  in  this 
 server  has  also  created  his  own  platform 
 where  people  can  come  together  and
[82:04] actually  do  in  real  life  meetups  so 
 information  about  that  will  also  be  in 
 the  discord  server  so  if  you're
[82:10] interested  in  that  you'll  join  the 
 discord  server  and  then  there's  like  a 
 separate  platform  to  literally  say  okay 
 which  city  are  you  in  and  there's  a
[82:15] bunch  of  other  people  in  the  same  city 
 as  you  and  they're  literally  saying  like 
 oh  boy  he's  like  let's  all  get  a  day 
 pass  at  this  gym  over  there  and  we  can
[82:20] all  join  together  that's  like  one  of the 
 most  beautiful  things  i've  seen  someone 
 do  and  like  someone  create  on
[82:25] self-improvement  so  shout  out  this  mod's 
 name  on  his  discord  name  is  agro7  so 
 shout  out  to  him  for  making  this  so
[82:31] let's  talk  about  your  environment  and 
 particularly  nature  and  sunlight  and 
 having  a  sense  of  adventure  i  think
[82:36] these  are  very  interesting  environmental 
 factors  to  talk  about  and  they'll 
 significantly  improve  your  mental  health
[82:41] if  you  utilize  them  correctly  as  always 
 i  want  to  give  you  the  bro  science 
 explanation  for  why  things  like  nature
[82:46] sunlight  and  adventure  make  us  feel 
 mentally  healthy  if  you  imagine  how  our
[82:51] ancestors  lived 
 thousands  of  years  ago  they  spent  all  of 
 their  time  out  in  nature  they  would  wake
[82:57] up  at  sunrise  and  literally  be  in  the 
 sun  totally  naked 
 all  day  up  until  the  sun  went  down
[83:03] there's  so  many  like  new  health  benefits 
 that  are  arising  from  people  saying  like 
 oh  yeah  like  you  know  we  should  get
[83:08] sunlight  on  our  poles  and  our 
 and  stuff  like  people  like  there's  real 
 scientific  studies  which  are  showing
[83:13] like  your  testosterone  goes  through  the 
 roof  if  you  get  sunlight  on  your 
 testicles  with  no  clothes  on  our
[83:18] ancestors  were  living  like  that  just  24 
 7.  and  they  were  exploring  when  i  hear 
 like  the  great  tales  of  how  humanity
[83:24] started  and  i  believe  it  started  like 
 somewhere  in  africa  and  you  know  there 
 was  tribes  eventually  a  small  group  from
[83:30] this  tribe  led  by  a  strong  man 
 decided  to  just  adventure  outward  and 
 that's  the  story  of
[83:36] every  community  every  tribe  of  humanity 
 it's  adventure 
 it's  travel  and  we  don't  really  do  that
[83:42] these  days 
 we  travel  to  work  or  to  the  gym  but  that 
 doesn't  really  count  that's  that's  not 
 even  traveling  or  adventure  that's
[83:47] commuting  when  was  the  last  time  you 
 went  on  an  adventure  like  a  real  real 
 adventure  when  was  the  last  time  you
[83:52] left  your  house  and  didn't  know  where 
 you  were  gonna  end  up  be  honest  i  like 
 to  think  of  the  world  like  the  map
[83:58] around  us  kind  of  like  the  map  from 
 grand  theft  auto  you  remember  those 
 games  gta  5  or  gta  3  or  gta  san  andreas
[84:05] and  you  click  on  the  map  on  this  game 
 and  wherever  you  had  previously  been  to 
 would  be  sort  of  visible  on  this  map  and
[84:12] anywhere  that  you  hadn't  discovered 
 would  be  blacked  out  gray  so  the  idea  is 
 okay  the  map  pretty  much  starts  off  as
[84:17] just  blacked  out  and  as  you  explore  more 
 and  more  and  more  the  map  kind  of  gets 
 like  opened  up  and  you  can  see  where
[84:22] you've  been  if  you  imagine  the  map  of 
 your  area  around  your  home  your  city  you 
 feel  like  you  probably  discovered  you
[84:27] know  quite  a  lot  but  if  you  just  imagine 
 that  map  just  like  a  gta  san  andreas  map
[84:33] there's  a  bunch  of  blacked  out  streets 
 like  there  is  a  street  two  minutes  away
[84:38] from  you  right  now  that  you  have  never 
 even  seen  before  there  is  a  house 
 there's  a  building  that  your  eyes  have
[84:44] never  witnessed  before 
 literally  within  a  one  to  two  minute 
 walk  how  crazy  that  you  may  have  lived
[84:49] at  your  address  at  your  home  for  five 
 years  ten  years  twenty  years  two  years 
 and  there's  something  that  you  haven't
[84:54] even  seen  thirty  seconds  away  do  you 
 feel  some  level  of  excitement  when  you 
 think  about  this  i  almost  get  like  an
[84:59] urge  to  quickly  like  slip  my  trainers  on 
 and  just  go  see  that  random  building 
 that  i've  not  seen  this  is  what  we're
[85:04] supposed  to  do  as  humans  we're  supposed 
 to  be  in  awe  of  like  the  natural  beauty
[85:09] around  us  we're  supposed  to  go  for  a 
 long  walk  in  nature  and  not  just  be 
 glued  to  our  phones  or  to  be
[85:15] overthinking  but  to  literally  look  and 
 appreciate  that  one  particular  tree  that 
 like  just  for  some  reason  your  brain
[85:21] your  body  your  soul  really  likes  amongst 
 all  the  other  trees  you're  supposed  to 
 go  out  like  a  child  and  like  pick  your
[85:27] favorite  leaf  off  from  a  tree  or  from 
 the  floor  unless  you  just  look  at  it  and 
 examine  it  and  just  think  how  beautiful
[85:32] it  is  when  was  the  last  time  you  really 
 like  picked  a  leaf  and  actually  really 
 really  looked  at  it  perhaps  one  of  the
[85:37] reasons  why  we  feel  so  mentally 
 unhealthy  we're  just  walking  around  and 
 just  navigating  life  in  a  haze  just  deep
[85:43] in  our  own  thoughts  instead  of 
 appreciating  the  beauty  around  us 
 something  about  being  in  nature
[85:48] especially  amongst  big  vast  open  spaces 
 like  i'm  in  right  now  i'm  in  scotland
[85:53] i'm  staying  on  a  farm  i'm  in  like  a 
 mountainous  area  like  you  can't  see  it 
 right  now  but  there's  a  bunch  of
[85:58] mountains  where  there's  something  about 
 being  in  this  open  space  where  there's 
 mountains  around  it  does  something
[86:03] amazing  to  my  mind  on  the  way  here  my 
 mind  is  thinking  about  youtube  it's 
 thinking  about  drama  it's  thinking  about
[86:09] you  know  small  tactics  and  tasks  that  i 
 can  do  we  can  implement  oh  i've  got  to 
 send  a  message  to  this  guy  or  i've  got
[86:14] to  write  this  thing  down 
 small  things  as  soon  as  i  get  out  into 
 the  vastness  of  nature  my  mind  broadens
[86:20] up  and  i  can't  help  but  think  about 
 the  grand  scale  of  things  i  get  out  into 
 the  mountains  and  my  brain  just  starts
[86:26] automatically  thinking  about  fatherhood 
 it  starts  thinking  about  long-term  plans 
 where  would  i  live  five  years  from  now
[86:31] where  would  i  raise  children  what's  the 
 next  generation  gonna  be  like  what  are 
 the  boys  five  years  old  today  what  are
[86:38] they  struggling  with  do  they  have  mental 
 health  problems  were  they  throwing  an 
 ipad  when  they  were  three  years  old  what
[86:43] will  the  generation  of  those  boys  become 
 20  years  from  now  i'm  thinking  about 
 these  grand  things  when  i'm  out  in  the
[86:49] grandness  of  the  vast  open  space  of 
 nature  and  yet  we  spend  most  of  our  days 
 indoors  tiny  little  rooms  just  staring
[86:55] into  like  a  tiny  little  phone  screen  or 
 computer  screen  like  you're  doing  right 
 now  and  we  wonder  why  our  mental  health
[87:01] is  so  bad  and  like  our  thinking  is  so 
 consumed  by  like  small  things  and  this 
 part  of  the  guide  in  terms  of  nature
[87:07] sunlight  and  adventure  it's  very  very 
 close  to  my  heart  because  again  that 
 story  that  i've  told  you  about  that  i
[87:12] was  living  in  a  city  and  i  was  just 
 waking  up  and  smoking  weed  and  i  was 
 just  staying  in  the  apartment  all  day 
 because  there  was  the  covered  lockdown
[87:18] if  you  could  almost  like  imagine  how  i 
 was  living  you  know  i'm  living  in  this 
 like  small  apartment  with  a  girl  that  i
[87:23] didn't  really  even  like  i'm  waking  up 
 and  just  smoking  weed  straight  away  i'm 
 jacking  off  i'm  fapping  just  in  the
[87:29] other  room  even  though  i've  got  like  a 
 girlfriend  there  i'm  literally  that's 
 how  my  mental  health  was  just 
 addicted  to  porn  just  staying  in  like
[87:36] the  computer  room  all  day  and  then  think 
 about  the  difference  from  that  and  then 
 i  moved  home  and  suddenly  like  this  idea
[87:41] of  adventure  just  popped  into  my  mind 
 and  i'm  i'm  going  out  and  actually 
 looking  at  like  these  vast  open
[87:46] spaces 
 with  like  a  sense  of  a  childish  awe  and 
 i  started  to  go  on  like  small  adventures
[87:52] i  bought  outdoor  gym  equipment  like  i 
 bought  like  equipment  that  i  could  train 
 you  know  my  muscles  with  and  i  would  put
[87:58] it  into  a  backpack  and  i  would  literally 
 just  go  for  like  a  long  walk  or  a  jog 
 just  trying  to  find  somewhere  to  train
[88:03] and  i  would  always  try  to  choose  a  new 
 place  to  train  and  i'd  end  up  like 
 walking  into  like  little  forests  and
[88:08] there's  you  know  like  a  stream  of  water 
 and  i  challenge  myself  to  like  jump 
 across  it  when  you  imagine  that  new  life
[88:14] that  i  was  you  know  jumping  across  these 
 puddles  and  you're  challenging  myself  oh 
 that  looks  kind  of  far  i  don't  know  if  i 
 can  make  it 
 compared  to  just  waking  up  in  a  small
[88:20] little  room  and  just  smoking  weed  every 
 day 
 is  it  any 
 wonder  that  the  majority  of  people  who
[88:27] just  stay  in  these  small  like  houses 
 small  rooms  who  just  stare  at  their
[88:32] computer  screens  and  don't  go  outside 
 don't  get  sunlight  is  it  any  wonder  why 
 the  majority  of  these  kinds  of  people 
 are  depressed  as  a  simple  rule  that  you
[88:37] can  follow  go  and  do  the  things  that  you 
 did  as  a  child  you'd  go  play  out  with 
 your  friends  you  just  go  kick  a  ball
[88:42] around  you'll  jump  over  puddles  you'd 
 climb  a  tree  when  was  the  last  time  that 
 you  climbed  a  tree  i  know  you  sound
[88:47] silly  but  like  you  feel  kind  of 
 depressed  right  now  imagine  if  you  go 
 climb  a  tree  i  don't  think  you  can  be 
 depressed  when  you're  literally  climbing
[88:52] a  tree  i  think  that's  the  instant  cure 
 that  you  needed  i  think  this  section  of 
 the  guide  sounds  really  exciting  and
[88:57] awesome  okay  like  you  know  nature 
 sunlight  adventure  fine  but  you  need  a 
 practical  way  to  implement  this
[89:02] otherwise  you're  just  gonna  feel  kind  of 
 motivated  and  hype  watching  this  video 
 and  then  your  life  isn't  gonna  change 
 you  need  a  practical  way  that  you  can
[89:08] implement  getting  more  nature  sunlight 
 and  adventure  and  the  way  that  i  did  it 
 which  will  probably  work  for  you  is  to
[89:13] start  getting  into  long  distance  cardio 
 now  chances  are  if  you're  watching  my 
 videos  you  might  already  be  into  going
[89:19] to  the  gym  and  doing  weight  lifting  or 
 calisthenics  or  you  might  not  be  but 
 either  way  you  should  really  consider
[89:25] like  the  benefits  of  doing  long  distance 
 cardio  i'm  not  talking  about  sprints  and 
 i'm  not  talking  about  like  you  know 
 going  to  the  gym  and  just  putting  in  the
[89:30] work  on  the  treadmill  like 
 that  that  always  just  is  really  weird 
 for  me  like  people  just  go  to  the  gym
[89:35] unless  you  just  go  jog  on  the  treadmill 
 for  like  30  minutes  why 
 chug  outside
[89:41] but  long  distance  cardio  and  so 
 essentially  go  on  a  very  long  run  and 
 start  tracking  how  far  you  run  so
[89:46] there's  apps  that  you  can  get  on  your 
 phone  literally  just  search  like  running 
 app  there's  like  a  nike  app  and  pretty 
 much  all  those  big  brands  like  everlast
[89:52] whatever  they've  all  got  one  which  is 
 just  for  like  running  and  under  armour 
 has  a  good  one  that  i  use  um  under
[89:57] armour  running  app  if  you  search  that 
 onto  app  store  i'm  pretty  sure  it'd  come 
 up  and  it  you  just  press  start  and  it
[90:02] starts  tracking  like  your  map  and  sees 
 how  far  you've  run  get  into  long 
 distance  running  and  start  like
[90:07] challenging  yourself  to  get  to  like  5k 
 10k  you  could  probably  do  that  in  six
[90:12] months  from  now  but  one  very  important 
 part  to  get  not  only  the  benefits  of  the 
 long  distance  cardio  but  specifically
[90:17] the  benefits  of  this  part  of  the  guide 
 of  nature  sunlight  and  adventure  it's
[90:22] the  focus  more  on  the  adventure  rather 
 than  the  actual  cardio  so  go  out  for  a
[90:27] run  go  out  for  a  long  walk  go  out  for  a 
 bike  ride  but  don't  think  to  yourself 
 okay  you  know  i'm  only  doing  this  just 
 to  get  like  calories  or  whatever  think
[90:32] to  yourself  okay  i'm  actually  going  out 
 for  the  purpose  of  adventure  and  my 
 vehicle  for  that  is  running  or  cycling
[90:39] so  that  means  that  it's  okay  for  example 
 you're  running  you  know  you're  jogging 
 just  looking  around  being  adventurous
[90:44] there's  a  street  that  you've  never  went 
 down  but  you're  pretty  sure  it's  like 
 it's  closed  off  so  you'd  have  to  just 
 literally  run  there  run  back  and  so  it's
[90:49] not  necessarily  efficient  for  like 
 cardio  or  burning  calories  because  you'd 
 rather  just  run  straight  forward  in  a
[90:54] straight  line  but  you're  like  nah 
 it  come  on  like  i  just  want  like  a  sense 
 of  adventure  and  excitement  you  go  there 
 look  around  oh  wow  like  i've  never  seen
[91:00] that  building  before  and  then  run 
 backwards  so  technically  the  amount  of 
 calories  you  burn  doing  this  will  be  a
[91:05] little  bit  less  than  if  you  just  focus 
 on  like  just  running  on  the  treadmill  or 
 something  but  the  mental  health  benefit
[91:10] of  just  exploring  and  being  in  the 
 outdoors  and  seeing  things  that  you've 
 never  seen  before  is  massive  and  one 
 final  extra  benefit  of  exploring  with
[91:17] adventure  and  being  outdoors  it  puts  you 
 into  a  flow  state  so  remember  previously 
 in  the  sky  we  spoke  about  the  flow  state
[91:23] being  a  moment  of 
 intense  presence  a  lack  of  like  thought 
 in  your  mind  you  just  focus  on  what's
[91:29] happening  right  now 
 but  when  you're  experiencing  some  kind 
 of  adventure  and  you're  looking  around
[91:34] at  a  building  that  you've  never  seen  it 
 like  a  park  or  a  tree  that  you've  never 
 seen 
 your  mind's  probably  going  to  be
[91:39] relatively  quiet  which  again  will 
 greatly  improve  your  mental  health 
 kindness  is  another  tool  that  you  can
[91:44] use  to  improve  your  mental  health  and  i 
 learned  this  from  this  free  online 
 course  named  the  science  of  well-being
[91:51] this  instructor  like  this  professor  has 
 made  this  course  online  talking  about 
 mental  health  and  she  brought  in  this
[91:56] study  which  showed  that  people  are 
 actually  happier  if  they  spend  money  on
[92:01] others  rather  than  themselves  so  in  this 
 study  a  participants  are  given  like  five 
 dollars  and  they're  instructed  okay  go
[92:06] spend  it  on  yourself  go  buy  like  a  latte 
 from  starbucks  or  something  or  another 
 group  of  participants  are  given  five
[92:11] dollars  and  they're  instructed  okay  go 
 buy  a  gift  for  a  friend  go  buy  a  latte
[92:16] from  starbucks  for  their  friend  and  they 
 found  a  way  bigger  happiness  increase 
 for  the  people  who  spent  money  on  their
[92:21] friends  and  we  know  this  too  being  kind 
 and  generous  makes  us  feel  good  about 
 ourselves  there's  a  very  interesting
[92:27] conclusion  that  we  can  come  to 
 there's  literally  a  higher  roi 
 return  on  investment  to  being  generous
[92:34] with  your  money  your  time 
 your  compliments 
 than  it  is  to  be  reserved  like  the  money
[92:40] that  you  could  spend  on  someone  and  of 
 course  you  know  it's  all  relative  so  if 
 you're  in  a  different  country  you  don't 
 have  to  spend  the  equivalent  of  five
[92:45] dollars  it  was  all  relative  to  the 
 country  that  you're  in  so  essentially  if 
 you  spent  the  equivalent  of  around
[92:51] 20  minutes  of  the  minimum  wage  of  your 
 country  on  a  friend  that  would  probably
[92:56] be  able  to  get  you  like  a  coffee  a  drink 
 a  bottle  of  water  or  something  like  that 
 if  you've  got  that  for  a  friend  oh  i've
[93:02] got  this  for  you  you'd  feel  happier 
 about  that  than  if  you  got  it  for 
 yourself  and  you  can  scale  this  up
[93:07] massively  so  that  study  just  spoke  about 
 you  know  a  small  gift  of  like  five 
 dollars  buying  a  drink  from  starbucks
[93:12] for  someone  but  you  can  be  a  very 
 purposeful 
 work  driven  young  man
[93:17] and  be  quite  charitable  or  do  some  kind 
 of  work  that  helps  others  i  personally
[93:23] have  found  one  of  the  greatest  mental 
 health  benefits  for  my  own  self  from  the 
 work  that  i  do  for  this  youtube  channel
[93:28] i  spend  quite  a  while  and  of  course  you 
 know  it's  quite  profitable  for  me  you 
 know  to  increase  my  status  i  feel  good
[93:33] about  the  success  that  i've  built  the 
 income  that  i've  got  but  the  work  that  i 
 do  here  is  very  purposeful
[93:39] and  when  i  receive  comments  and  messages 
 and  emails  and  voice  notes  and  when  i
[93:44] had  instagram  i  don't  have  instagram 
 anymore  but  like  when  i  did  have 
 instagram  i  would  receive  obviously
[93:49] 20  messages  a  day  direct  messages  of 
 people  just  saying  like  you've  saved  my 
 life  you  changed  my  life  thank  you  so
[93:55] much  for  your  videos  never  stop 
 uploading  that  made  me  feel  amazing 
 about  myself  kindness  and  generosity
[94:01] is  linked  to  this  feeling  of  being 
 needed  and  that's  so  utterly  important
[94:06] and  we  don't  really  have  that  like  we 
 live  in  very  weird 
 individualistic  times  what  i  mean  by
[94:11] individualistic  is  that  we're  all  kind 
 of  like  separate  people  and  we  no  longer 
 see  ourselves  as  being  part  of  like  a
[94:17] tribe  even  in  your  country  or  community 
 you  don't  really  think  like  oh  yeah  well 
 this  is  this  is  my  my  man  you  know  he's
[94:22] in  the  same  country  as  me  that  means 
 we're  on  the  same  team  you  don't  really 
 think  that  we  don't  have  tribes  anymore
[94:27] we're  not  really  close  knit  anymore  and 
 religion  was  an  amazing 
 way  of  life  for  this  because
[94:32] we  felt  like  we  were  in  the  same  tribe 
 as  everyone  that  we  went  to  church  with 
 and  we  don't  have  that  the  majority  of 
 people  aren't  very  religious  these  days
[94:38] we  don't  really  have  like  a  sense  of 
 community  that  makes  us  feel  important 
 and  so  for  the  majority  of  young  men
[94:45] perhaps  a  reason  why  you  don't  feel  so 
 great  is  because  you  kind  of  know  you 
 kind  of  feel  that  if  you  disappeared
[94:51] nothing  would  really  happen  of  course 
 like  you  know  your  parents  your  family 
 would  be  upset  your  friend  would  be 
 upset  but  like  in  terms  of  the  greater
[94:56] community  the  majority  of  people 
 wouldn't  even  realize  if  you  just 
 disappeared  and  i  know  that  seems  really
[95:02] scary  it  seems  really  dark  to  talk  about 
 but  that's  something  that  remember  we 
 have  to  like  kind  of  talk  and  sort  of 
 admit  these  things  out  loud  and  then  aim
[95:09] to  change  them  if  we  bottle  them  up  and 
 if  we  don't  express  these  thoughts  of
[95:14] humility  to  ourselves  where  we  discuss 
 our  weaknesses  our  weak  points  then 
 we'll  never  make  progress  we  need  to 
 hold  our  hands  up  as  young  men  and  say
[95:20] you  know  what  i'm  not  even  involved  in 
 my  community  that  if  i  just  left  today
[95:25] no  one  would  even  realize 
 that  i'm  not  even  doing  any  purposeful 
 work  that's  changing  the  world  in  any
[95:30] positive  way  i'm  just  working  some 
 minimum  wage  job  in  like  some  place  that 
 i  don't  even  care  about  i'm  not  even
[95:35] helping  anyone  it's  one  of  my  friends 
 who  really  need  me  it's  so  important 
 that  you  become  the  kind  of  man  who  is
[95:41] needed  you  become  the  kind  of  man  who  is 
 doing  such  good  work  for  other  people
[95:46] that  people  need  you 
 because  when  you're  needed  you  can't 
 help  but  feel  this  level  of  like
[95:51] security  abundance  happiness 
 fulfillments  freedom  for  yourself  when 
 you're  not  needed  when  you're  just
[95:56] another  like  average  guy  who's  working 
 like  you  know  some  job  that  doesn't 
 really  matter  and  you  just  spend  your
[96:01] free  time  on  online  you're  not  really 
 doing  anything  it  feels  like  life  is  a 
 bit 
 meaningless  and  pointless  and  this  is
[96:07] where  symptoms  of  depression  arise  and 
 so  consider  being  kind  consider  being 
 purposeful  consider  being  generous
[96:13] consider  doing  things  for  other  people 
 for  helping  them  to  such  a  good  level 
 that  you  will  feel  that  you  are  needed
[96:19] that  you  will  feel  that  other  people  are 
 relying  on  you  and  even  though  that's  a 
 level  of  pressure  and  responsibility
[96:24] it's  a  good  thing  men  are  built  from 
 responsibility  men  are  built  from 
 pressure  so  many  young  guys  are  just
[96:29] living  life  without  responsibility  they 
 just  wake  up  go  to  school  go  to  work  and 
 then  just  come  home  and  just  spend  all
[96:34] day  online  and  then  they  complain  why 
 they're  depressed  you  need  to  take 
 responsibility  for  someone  else  to 
 become  a  man
[96:40] if  you  are  not  responsible  for  someone 
 else  right  now 
 i  hate  to  say  it  but  you  are  not  a  man
[96:45] you're  a  guy  or  a  boy 
 you  turn  into  a  man  when  you  take  the 
 responsibility  of  other  people  and
[96:50] interesting  like  masculine  things  will 
 happen  to  you  when  you  take 
 responsibility  of  other  people  i 
 couldn't  grow  a  beard  for  most  of  my
[96:55] life  all  the  men  in  my  family  could  grow 
 a  full  beard  at  age  16  or  18.  i'm  age  21 
 still  can't  grow  one  but  then  i  started
[97:00] this  youtube  channel  i  started  working 
 for  the  other  guys  that  i  care  about  i 
 started  being  purposeful  i  started
[97:05] leading  a  mission  of  young  men  improving 
 themselves  and  suddenly  i  can  grow  a 
 glorious  beard
[97:10] you  will  become  more  masculine  you  will 
 feel  more  like  a  man  you  will  feel 
 purposeful  when  you  start  helping  others
[97:15] the  reason  why  i'm  speaking  with  so  much 
 emotion  and  conviction  right  now  is 
 because  i  wish  i  could  speak  to  younger 
 hamsa  i  wish  i  could  tell  him  he  doesn't
[97:22] even  realize  this  but  i  wish  i  could 
 tell  him  that  he's  quite  selfish  and  i 
 don't  say  that  as  an  insult  it's  just 
 an  objective  fact  he  only  cared  about
[97:28] himself  true  progress  comes  when  you 
 start  thinking  about  other  people  what's 
 interesting  when  you  think  about  helping
[97:33] someone  else  you  actually  help  yourself 
 to  a  such  a  greater  level  it's  so  easy 
 to  think  oh  i  don't  have  the  capacity  to
[97:38] help  someone  else  i  don't  have  enough 
 money  to  help  someone  else  what's 
 interesting  is  that  if  you  help  someone 
 else  with  their  fitness  with  their  diet
[97:43] your  diet  will  automatically  improve  if 
 you  start  helping  your  fat  friend  lose 
 weight  i  guarantee  your  diet  will
[97:49] improve  more  than  you've  ever  seen  it 
 before  because  now  you're  a  leader  and 
 now  you've  got  responsibility  to  be  a 
 role  model  we  as  men  need  some  kind  of
[97:55] self-transcending  purpose  transcending 
 means  bigger  than  us  we  need  a  purpose  a
[98:01] mission  some  work  some  goals  that  is 
 bigger  than  us  that  involves  helping
[98:06] other  people  for  the  last  two  years  i've 
 dedicated  my  life  to  what  you  see  here  i 
 make  this  joke  quite  often  to  my  friends
[98:11] i  left  the  nine  to  five  you  know  the 
 nine  to  five  rat  race  i  left  the  nine  to 
 five
[98:16] now  i  work  five  to  nine 
 i  wake  up  at  five  a.m  and  i  literally 
 just  work  up  until  around  nine  pm  i
[98:22] can't  stop  i  don't  want  to  stop  it's 
 like  my  brain  is  so  focused  on  this 
 because  i  honestly  feel  like  i'm
[98:27] changing  the  world  with  this  work  that  i 
 do  i  feel  like  i'm  saving  hundreds  of
[98:32] men  thousands  of  men  that  makes  me  feel 
 mentally  happy  it  makes  me  feel  so 
 important  and  we  need  that  kind  of
[98:38] feeling  and  you  shouldn't  belittle 
 yourself  right  now  and  think  oh  well 
 hamsa  can  do  it  because  he's  got  a 
 youtube  channel  but  i  don't  have  one  i
[98:43] started  with  nothing  as  well  so  ask 
 yourself  right  now  in  what  ways  can  you 
 be  kind  and  generous  to  others  it  can  be
[98:48] as  simple  as  buying  like  a  bottle  of 
 water  for  your  friend  it  can  be  as 
 simple  as  tipping  a  waitress  or  it  could
[98:53] be  bigger  you  could  ask  yourself  okay 
 what  purposeful  work  could  i  dedicate  my 
 life  to  that  would  help  other  people  if
[99:00] you  really  want  this  guide  to  help  you 
 perhaps  just  pause  the  video  and  really 
 ask  yourself  that  question  what 
 purposeful  work  could  i  dedicate  my  life
[99:06] to  which  would  help  other  people  pause 
 the  video  and  really  ask  yourself  that 
 question  journal  it  write  it  down  what
[99:12] are  ways  that  you  can  help  your 
 community  your  tribe  because  when  you 
 help  your  tribe  and  you  feel  important
[99:17] it's  like  you're  aligned  to  like  this 
 natural  animalistic  social  hierarchy
[99:22] aspect  of  ourselves 
 when  you  move  up  the  social  hierarchy  of 
 men
[99:27] you  know  your  status  increases  you  just 
 begin  to  feel  so  much  better  and  you  do 
 that  through  a  self-transcending  purpose
[99:33] and  being  kind  for  the  final  part  of 
 this  guide  i  want  to  discuss  trauma  and
[99:38] ptsd  so  i  said  before  that  the  majority 
 of  people  the  mental  health  problems
[99:44] that  they  have  usually  just  come  down  to 
 like  depression  and  anxiety  depressive 
 symptoms  and  anxious  symptoms  and  that
[99:50] usually  comes  way  more  from  literally 
 just  modern  day  habits  a  lot  of  people 
 don't  like  to  hear  this  a lot  of  people 
 like  to  think  that  they've  got  like  some
[99:55] biological  issue  or  anything  but  the 
 majority  of  people  who  are  depressed  or 
 anxious  are  like  that  simply  because  of
[100:00] their  habits  and  if  you  can  accept  that 
 and  think  to  yourself  yet  like  i 
 actually  don't  have  any  biological
[100:05] reason  to  be  depressed  or  anything  it's 
 just  simply  because  i've  been  indulging 
 in  instant  gratification  i've  been 
 watching  porn  for  for  six  hours  a  day  so
[100:11] of  course  i  feel  depressed  but  there  is 
 something  a  lot  more  severe  than  these 
 habitual  mental  illnesses  and  that  is
[100:18] trauma 
 trauma 
 is  a  very  significant
[100:23] dangerous  experience  which 
 changes  you  forever  so  this  is  not  just
[100:28] you  know  like  i  play  too  much  video 
 games  and  that's  why  i  feel  depressed  so 
 you  know  my  diet's  really  and
[100:33] that's  why  i  feel  really  anxious  because 
 you  know  me  and  fried  western  food  and 
 that's  up  my  gut  microbiome
[100:38] trauma  we  could  say 
 it  causes  ptsd  post-traumatic  stress 
 disorder  so  trauma  is  for  example
[100:45] you're  walking  through  the  street  one 
 night  alone 
 and  suddenly  out  of  nowhere  you  just  get
[100:50] punched 
 you  drop  to  the  floor  and  people  are 
 kicking  you  robbing  you  could  be  being
[100:55] in  a  car  crash 
 these  are  things  that  can  cause  trauma 
 in  people 
 and  the  research  on  trauma  and  the
[101:01] psychologists  who  have  written  books  on 
 them  the  wording  that  they  use  is  that 
 trauma  may  be
[101:07] maybe  curable  or  at  least  the  symptoms 
 of  trauma  can  be
[101:12] relieved  and  there's  good  treatment  now 
 for  trauma  things  like  emdr  it's  like  a 
 form  of  therapy  you  like  see  the
[101:18] therapist  and  they  do  stuff  like  this 
 and  it  just  helps  you  like  process  the 
 events
[101:23] and  uh  traditional  talking  therapy 
 sometimes  can  help  there's  more 
 complicated  versions  of  trauma  which  are
[101:29] no  longer  just  one  event  so  you  know 
 like  you  could  get  trauma  from  a  car 
 crash  that's  one  event  or  you  know
[101:35] you've  been  mugged  you've  been  attacked 
 that's  an  event 
 there's  such  a  thing  called  complex  ptsd
[101:41] complex  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
 and  complex  ptsd  cptsd  is  where  you  will
[101:47] go  through 
 lots  of  traumatic  incidents  and  it's 
 pretty  much  always
[101:53] down  to  childhood  abuse  so  when  you're  a 
 child  and  you're  totally  dependent  on 
 your  parents  but  your  parent  is  being
[101:58] abusive  your  parent  shouts  at  you 
 threatens  you  slaps  you  not  emotionally 
 neglects  you  sexually  abuses  you
[102:04] there's  no  escape  from  that 
 when  you're  a  child  generally  this  can 
 become  a  lot  more  severe  and  it's
[102:09] actually  estimated  that  i'm  not  sure  the 
 exact  figure  but  a  lot  of  people  have 
 experienced  childhood  abuse
[102:15] i  believe  it's  like 
 one  in  four  and  maybe  more  chances  are 
 if  you're  watching  this  video  and  you've
[102:20] gotten  a  bunch  of  the  symptoms  that  we 
 talk  about  you  very  clearly  know  your 
 mental  health  is  bad  if  you  think  back
[102:25] to  your  childhood  experience  with  your 
 parents 
 what  was  it  like  there's  very  clear
[102:30] signs  of  abuse  like  a  parent  screaming 
 at  you  slapping  you  threatening  you 
 hurting  you  and  there's  also  somewhat 
 invisible  signs  of  abuse  things  like
[102:37] emotional  neglect  essentially  believing 
 that  your  parents  just  didn't  really 
 love  you  and  a  lot  of  us  have
[102:42] experienced  that  and 
 the  reason  why  this  is  so  damaging 
 is  because  when  you're  a  child
[102:48] you  soak  up  everything  you  believe 
 everything  that  your  parents  says  and 
 does  so  what  goes  on  to  a  child's  mind
[102:54] when  the  child  is  being  beaten  or  hurt 
 or  screamed  or  threatened  or  ignored  by
[102:59] their  parents  it's  like  your  brain 
 convinces  you  that 
 you're  a  bad  person  you're  worthless
[103:04] you're  not  worthy  of  love  it's  very 
 tricky  for  me  to  give  you  real  good 
 advice  here  because  this  is  something
[103:09] that  i'm  on  my  own  journey  to 
 to 
 improve  on
[103:14] i  have  symptoms  and  like  the 
 understanding  that  i  have  cptsd  complex 
 ptsd  because  of  childhood  abuse
[103:21] and  um 
 the  more  i  look  into  it  the  more  i  work
[103:26] into  it  the  more  i  become  aware  of  just 
 how  many  symptoms 
 i  have  the  way  that  i  behave  in
[103:32] relationships 
 the 
 physical  symptoms  of  just  anxiety  and
[103:37] stress  and  hyper  vigilance  and 
 faster  heartbeats  and  you  know  i  track 
 my  heart  rate  on  this  my  heart  rate's
[103:43] way  higher  than  it  should  be  at  like 
 athlete's  performance  like  my  heart  rate
[103:48] should  be  about  45  it's  actually  about 
 60. 
 my  heart  rate  variability  hrv  is  very
[103:53] low  it  should  be  maybe  double  what  it  is 
 and 
 we  think  that  this  is  probably  caused
[103:58] from  things  like  trauma  so  if  you  feel 
 like  you  have  trauma  or  cptsd  here  i've
[104:04] done  a  fair  amount  of  research  on  this 
 and  it's  of  my  understanding  right  now 
 there's  kind  of  like  two  methods  that
[104:09] you  can  use  to  improve  symptoms  of 
 trauma  and  see  ptsd  and  these  are  called
[104:14] top  down  and  bottom  up  essentially  what 
 this  means  is  that  the  top  down  model  is
[104:19] that  we  start  and  we  focus  on  the  brain 
 and  if  we  do  things  that  improve  our 
 brain  it  will  help  the  rest  of  our  body
[104:26] and  then  likewise  the  other  approach  is 
 that  if  we  start  bottom  up  we  do  things
[104:31] that  improve  our  body  and  that  will  help 
 our  brain  so  this  is  where  trauma 
 treatments  like  self-help  treatments  can
[104:37] come  in  things  like  journaling  and 
 therapy  change  your  brain  especially 
 things  like  for  example  cbt  can  help  you
[104:43] with  these  like  cognitive  neurological 
 wiring  of  beliefs  and  you're  like  all 
 brain  sciency  stuff  when  you  change  your
[104:50] brain  your  body  can  respond  and  we've 
 discussed  a  lot  of  this  in  this  guide  so 
 for  example  in  the  physical  health
[104:55] section  of  this  guide  we've  essentially 
 explained  the  bottom  up  method  of
[105:00] relieving  cptsd  which  is  okay  we  focus 
 on  the  body  we  can  focus  on  things  like 
 sunlight  diet  exercise  and  these  are  all
[105:06] bodily  things  that  we  can  focus  on  which 
 then  improve  our  brain  and  then  likewise 
 we  can  switch  it  around  and  we  can  do
[105:12] things  that  improve  our  brain  things 
 like  journaling 
 things  like  being  in  love
[105:18] things  like 
 therapy 
 and  those  things  can  help  us
[105:23] ease  the  symptoms  that  we  get  in  our 
 body  to  be  honest  i'm  not  sure  if  i 
 really  have  good  advice  for  this  section
[105:28] of  the  guide  because  i'm  still  learning 
 as  i  go  along 
 and  this  is  a  very  very
[105:33] complicated  subject  you  know  mental 
 health  i  think  especially  mental  health 
 that's  come  from  poor  modern  habits
[105:39] is 
 something  that  i've 
 gained  a  good  level  of  experience  on  but 
 with
[105:44] complex  ptsd  and  trauma 
 it's  a  it's  a  whole  new  ball  game  what  i
[105:50] can't  say 
 is 
 if  you  do  relate  to  having
[105:55] cptsd  or  trauma
[106:00] be  grateful  for  it  i  wouldn't  be  here 
 where  i  am  today 
 if  it  wasn't  for  the  experiences  that  i
[106:05] had  in  childhood  because 
 i 
 have
[106:10] cpcsd  because  i  went  through  childhood 
 abuse  i  am  the  man  i  am  today  and  i  have
[106:15] such  a  focus  on  things  like  mental 
 health  and  self-improvements  but  then 
 i've  been  able  to  come  online  and  teach
[106:21] these  things  and  i'm  very  grateful  for 
 that  i'm  glad  how  my  life  has  turned  out 
 and  so  of  course  that  means  all  of  the
[106:26] bad  things  too  that's  the  one  thing  i 
 can  suggest  to  you  is  is  find  a  way  to 
 feel  grateful  and  to  almost  rewrite  the
[106:33] story  of  your  trauma  your  abuse  rewrite 
 it  and  take  control  of  it  instead  of 
 it's  you  know  something  unfortunate  that
[106:39] happened  to  you  rewrite  it  think  to 
 yourself  yeah  like  i'm  grateful  for  it 
 because  i  used  it  as  an  opportunity  to
[106:45] accelerate  and  slingshot  myself  into 
 make  more  progress  we're  just  gonna  go 
 through  some  questions  that  some  people
[106:51] have  asked  me  it  related  to  mental 
 health  we  have  a  question  from  night 
 king  hey  hamza  silly  question  but  how  do
[106:57] you  always  find  something  to  talk  about 
 with  people  you  meet  every  once  in  a 
 while  my  mind  goes  completely  blank  so  i
[107:03] struggle  with  starting  such  continuing 
 conversations 
 so  night  king  has  asked
[107:08] how  do  you  find  something  to  talk  about 
 with  everyone  that  you  see 
 and  i  would  actually  change  this
[107:13] question  because  a lot  of  young  men  ask 
 this  question  like  how  do  you  not  run 
 out  of  things  to  say  and  i  always  tell
[107:18] them  no  no  you're  asking  the  wrong 
 question  it's  not  that  you  should  be 
 asking  how  to  not  run  out  of  things  to
[107:23] say  it's  that  you  should  be  asking  how 
 to  be  comfortable  with  silence  in  a 
 conversation  whenever  i  speak  to  someone
[107:29] especially  a  young  guy  who's  feeling  a 
 little  bit  nervous  i  always  know  that  he 
 hasn't  really  leveled  up  with  social 
 skills  but  he  just  keeps  talking  and
[107:34] talking  talking  and  you  know  he's  just 
 talking  about  everything  he's  flipping 
 around  subject  it's  totally  fine  in  a
[107:39] conversation  to  just  stop  if  you  have 
 nothing  to  say  it's  authentic  for  you  to 
 say  nothing  ar  dorga
[107:46] what  would  you  say  to  someone  struggling 
 mentally  being  in  school  and  considering 
 dropping  out  and  what  are  your  views  on
[107:52] dropping  out  of  school  specifically  high 
 school 
 we'll  focus  on  his  question  about 
 someone  struggling  mentally  in  school
[107:59] school  is 
 i  have  a  very  negative  opinion  of  school 
 and  the  education  system  and  a  lot  of
[108:05] the  times  you  hear  like  youtubers  or 
 creators  talk  about  this  they  always 
 like  around  it  and  everything  i'm 
 very  very  serious  in  my  criticism  of  the
[108:12] education  system  especially  in  the  west 
 i  think  it's  it's  been 
 bastardized  and  i  don't  think  it's
[108:17] actually  helpful  for  students  i  don't 
 think  a  student  comes  out  at  age  18
[108:22] actually  educated  on  anything  worthwhile 
 they  don't  know  how  to  run  a  business 
 they  don't  know  how  to  do  their  taxes
[108:27] they  don't  know  how  to  get  into  a 
 relationship  they  don't  even  know  how  to 
 work  hard  or  be  productive  by  themselves 
 they  they  know  nothing  and  the  pressure
[108:33] that  goes  on  for  students  is  absolutely 
 abysmal  how  students 
 are  being  made  says  just  revise  for
[108:39] these  extremely  high  pressure  high 
 stress 
 exams  that  this  whole  will  determine  the
[108:44] rest  of  their  lives  bro  i  could  rant 
 about  this  stuff  for  a  while  i  really 
 think  the  education  system  needs  to  be 
 reformed  perhaps  i'll  be  the  one  to  do
[108:49] it  10  20  years  from  now  if  i  get  into 
 like  politics  or  something  what  would  i 
 say  to  someone  struggling  mentally  in
[108:54] school  you're  not  alone 
 that's  the  common  experience  of  all  the 
 students  around  you  another  thing  i
[109:00] would  say  is  that  you're  not  special 
 the  same  things  that  will  improve 
 everyone  else's  mental  health  will  do 
 yours  too
[109:05] a  lot  of  students  with  their  poor  mental 
 health  and  lack  of  judgment  incorrectly
[109:10] give  up  the  things  that  would  actually 
 keep  them  mentally  healthy  that  then
[109:15] would  improve  their  studies  and  their 
 results  so  for  example  if  you're  a 
 student  right  now  and  you've  been 
 struggling  you're  really  pressured  and
[109:20] your  mental  health  is  not  so  great  you 
 know  the  worst  thing  that  you  could  do 
 because  of  this  pressure  of  the  exams 
 coming  up  is  to  stop  the  mental  health
[109:25] practices  is  for  example  to  start 
 limiting  your  sleep  and  sleeping  five 
 hours  a  night  or  six  hours  or  seven
[109:30] hours  a  night  instead  of  getting  a  full 
 night  of  rest  maybe  you  stop  spending 
 time  with  your  friends  because  you 
 really  want  to  focus  it's  actually  the
[109:35] things  that  would  improve  your  mental 
 health  that  will  get  you  the  highest 
 grades  in  school  and  i  know  this  seems
[109:40] really  weird  but  i  recommend  all 
 students  to  not  study  for  more  than  like 
 six  hours  a  day  which  is  a  big  shock  to
[109:45] a lot  of  students  because  they're  like 
 wait  wait  the  culture  here  is  to  study 
 for  10  hours  no  no  no  the  culture  of  the
[109:50] average  to  slightly  higher  than  average 
 performers  is  to  study  12  hours  a  day 
 but  the  absolute  top  students  on  any
[109:56] country  are  always  studying  around  six 
 hours  and  then  they  spend  some  time  with 
 their  friends  and  their  family  and  they
[110:01] get  a  full  night  of  rest  they  eat  clean 
 nutritious  food  they  exercise  every  day 
 they  get  sunlight  adventure  keep  up  the
[110:07] things  that  improve  your  mental  health 
 fred's  plays  hey  hamsa  i've  recently 
 been  seeing  progress  in  the  gym  and  it
[110:13] feels  amazing  but  i  found  myself  more 
 and  more  comparing  my  progress  to  others 
 and  generally  feeling  less  satisfied
[110:18] with  my  progress  seeing  as  others  have 
 made  such  greater  any  advice  on  how  i 
 should  go  about  stopping  myself  from
[110:24] over  comparing  and  causing  myself  to 
 feel  self-conscious  a  lot  of  love  bro 
 this  is  a  very  interesting  question  and
[110:29] i  don't  think  a  lot  of  people  know  this 
 but  comparing  yourself  to  others  is  an
[110:34] absolutely  fundamentally  normal  part  of 
 the  human  existence  you've  probably  seen
[110:39] all  these  like  cliche  like  feel  good  you 
 know  these  influences  and  all  these 
 instagram  quotes  like  oh  don't  compare
[110:44] yourself  to  others  just  compare  yourself 
 to  who  you  were  yesterday  that's  that's 
 irrelevant  that's  not  how  humans  work  we
[110:49] will  always  compare  against  others  just 
 the  issue  is  that  now  we  have  too  many 
 people  to  compare  against  thousands  of
[110:55] years  ago  we  were  in  tribes  of  around 
 150  our  communities  was  150  people  and
[111:00] so  if  you  compared  yourself  to  the  men 
 in  that  tribe  there  was  probably  20  30 
 men  that  you  compared  yourself  to  and
[111:06] that  was  a  good  thing  that  helped  you 
 excel  but  now  we  have  too  many  people 
 that  we  can  compare  with  our  tribes  are
[111:11] still  technically  150  it  always  will  be 
 the  weird  number  for  human  connection  is
[111:16] about  150.  it  always  will  be  in  terms  of 
 our  physical  lives  but  then  online  we
[111:21] see  too  many  people  that  we  can  connect 
 with  so 
 friends  plays  into  anyone  else  watching 
 this  who  if  you  find  yourself  comparing
[111:27] against  others  it  isn't  that  you  know 
 this  concept  of  oh  i'm  comparing  myself 
 to  against  others  and  i've  got  to  stop
[111:32] no  no  comparing  yourself  against  others 
 is  very  normal  it's  just  that  you're 
 seeing  too  many  people  who  your  brain  is
[111:38] convincing  that  okay  they're  in  our 
 tribe  too  so  the  real  way  to  stop 
 comparing  yourself  to  others  is  actually
[111:43] to  stop  spending  so  much  time  on  the 
 internet  and  that  in  turn  especially  if 
 it  means  reduced  social  media  time  is
[111:49] going  to  be  one  of  the  greatest  things 
 that  you  do  for  your  mental  health  so 
 that  was  my  full  guide  to  improving  your 
 mental  health  and  if  you've  made  it  this
[111:54] far  of  the  video  if  you've  especially 
 done  the  practical  actionable  steps  that 
 i've  mentioned  then  good  on  you  you  have
[112:00] my  respect  for  getting  this  far 
 in  a  topic  that  is  so  deeply  important
[112:05] to  me  personally 
 improving  my  mental  health  has  changed 
 my  life  forever  and  it's  something  that
[112:10] i  will  always  always  maintain 
 the  life  that  i  get  to  live  now
[112:15] a  life  of  success  love  joy  i'll  never  go 
 back  i  hope  you'll  join  me  on  this
[112:20] lifelong  journey  of  maintaining  these 
 good  habits  that  will  keep  us  just 
 mentally  healthy  and  to  understand  that
[112:25] your  mental  health  is  the  greatest  asset 
 that  you  will  have  that's  not  something 
 to  overlook  any  time  that  you  spend
[112:32] learning  about  or  improving  your  mental 
 health 
 will  pay  off  tenfold  once  again  there
[112:37] was  a  bunch  of  things  that  i've  said 
 that  i've  linked  in  this  video  in  the 
 cards  and  stuff  so  you  can  have  a  look 
 at  all  that  if  you  haven't  taken  the
[112:43] mental  health  test  or  you  want  to  see 
 more  videos  from  me  i've  linked  them  all 
 below  if  you  feel  like  this  video  may
[112:48] have  changed  your  life  then  make  sure 
 you  save  it  somewhere  and  you  can 
 probably  recap  it  four  months  from  now
[112:53] six  months  from  now  you  might  have  like 
 forgotten  some  things  so  you  can  save  it 
 to  your  like  watch  later  i  think  it
[112:58] helps  the  youtube  algorithm  if  you 
 comment  and  if  you  leave  a  like  on  the 
 video  it's  always  cringe  saying  that  but
[113:03] if  you  do  want  to  like  help  this  video 
 perform  and  you  know  other  men  finding 
 it  then  you  can  do  like  you  can  spam  the
[113:08] comments  or  you  can  like  it  or  you  can 
 share  it  with  your  friends  you  can 
 subscribe  to  this  channel  if  you  want  to 
 see  more  videos  like  this  my  name  is
[113:14] hamza  ahmed  i'm  leading  a  movement  of 
 young  men  who  are  just  so  totally 
 focused  on  improving  their  lives  and  if
[113:20] you're  interested  in  that  you  can  have  a 
 look  at  some  of  the  videos  on  this 
 channel  do  the  hard  work  especially  when 
 you  don't  feel  like  it
