[00:00] jeffrey  says  that  money  doesn't  even 
 matter  he  lives  an  unambitious  ordinary 
 life  of  playing  video  games  and  eating
[00:06] cheap  junk  food  younger  hamster  didn't 
 like  school  or  learning  and  he  couldn't 
 think  of  what  degree  or  career  he'd  even
[00:12] want  but  his  parents  and  teachers  made 
 it  seem  like  the  only  choice  was  to  go 
 to  university  get  a  degree  and  a  normal
[00:19] job  adonis 
 adonis  laughed  at  the  puny  teachers  who 
 told  him  to  go  to  university  why  would
[00:24] he  he  was  already  making  more  money  than 
 his  teachers  with  all  of  the  businesses 
 that  he  ran  in  high  school
[00:34] you  want  to  make  more  money  than  your 
 teachers 
 i've  been  on  a  two-day  trip  to  portugal 
 and  i  made  about
[00:41] five  thousand  dollars  in  the  last  two 
 days 
 passively
[00:46] passively  bro  you're  gonna  learn  how  to 
 do  that  in  this  video 
 now  you're  probably  thinking  uh  he  he  he
[00:51] must  be  faking  it  he  didn't  really  make 
 five  thousand  dollars  over  the  weekend 
 here's  the  screenshot  here's  the  paypal
[00:56] payment  [ __ ]  here's  the  bank  statement 
 [ __ ] 
 i'm  gonna  walk  you  through  the  three
[01:01] best  passive  income  ideas  that  you  can 
 start  today  and  you  don't  even  need 
 money  to  start  them
[01:06] but  first 
 this  video  is  brought  to  you  by  no  one
[01:11] now  like  the  goddamn  video  you  [ __ ]  i 
 actually  want  to  know  if  what  happened 
 to  me  is  relatable  to  you  does  it  feel
[01:17] like  everyone's  pushing  you  down  this 
 ordinary  like  normal  person  path  of 
 getting  good  grades  in  school  getting  to
[01:23] a  good  university  getting  a  good  degree 
 and  then  a  good  job  does  it  feel  like 
 you  just  don't  believe  in  that  because
[01:28] when  i  was  thinking  about  this  it  just 
 seems  silly  to  put  in  all  that  work  into 
 like  a  good  career  when  little  girls  are
[01:34] making  more  money  than  doctors  on  tick 
 tock  and  i  was  never  a  good  student  this 
 is  what  always  bothered  me  i  was  never  a
[01:39] good  student  and  i  was  recommended  by 
 everyone  to  go  to  university  i  only 
 liked  school  just  for  the  social  aspect
[01:45] and  because  it  was  like  girls  to  just 
 stare  at  so  guess  how  i  spent  my  time  in 
 university
[01:50] [ __ ]  i  spent  my  time  in  university 
 [ __ ]  bro  and  it  was  sick  i  spent  my 
 time  taking  bugs  going  out  and  sleeping
[01:55] with  degenerate  women  so  even  whilst  i 
 was  in  university  i  knew  that  i  was 
 never  gonna  go  for  the  normal  job  after
[02:00] my  second  year  of  university  this  was 
 when  the  first  ideas  of  a  business 
 started  and  i  still  remember  the  exact
[02:06] night  and  the  exact  thing  that  i  sold  to 
 make  the  first  bit  of  money  on  a 
 business  and  you  can  like  literally
[02:11] replicate  this  today  i'll  give  you  the 
 steps  for  it  and  my  idea  was  to  go  onto 
 ebay  and  to  sell  a  bunch  of  clothes  that
[02:17] i  currently  had  get  that  money  and  then 
 use  that  money  to  buy  more  things  from 
 ebay  or  you  know  from  my  thrift  shops  to
[02:22] buy  like  clothes  and  resell  them  for  a 
 profit  so  i  remember  it  was  literally 
 night  time  and  i  listed  i  might  i  might
[02:28] actually  have  the  exact  picture  like  if 
 you  see  a  picture  right  now  i'm  gonna  be 
 impressed  if  i  can  find  this  i  listed 
 this  gym  shark  hoodie  which  i  didn't
[02:34] really  wear  for  like  25  pounds  went  to 
 sleep  woke  up  and  it  literally  sold  it 
 like  through  the  night
[02:41] and  that  was  and  that  was  hype  that  i 
 literally  i  need  to  made  money  whilst  i 
 was  sleeping  and  so  that  became  my  first
[02:46] business  reselling  slash  like  flipping 
 on  ebay  and  i  actually  got  the  idea  from
[02:51] runescape  which  is  like  a  video  game 
 because  i  used  to  i  used  to  literally 
 flip  i  used  to  do  the  exact  same  thing
[02:56] on  this  game  to  make  money  and  i  started 
 doing  it  in  real  life 
 so  just  as  like  a  little  bonus  to  this
[03:02] video  let  me  teach  you  very very  quickly 
 on  exactly  how  to  flip  on  ebay  now  this 
 isn't  one  of  the  passive  income  ideas
[03:08] that  i'm  about  to  teach  you  because  it's 
 quite  active  this  is  more  kind  of  like  a 
 job  but  it's  like  a  business  but  this
[03:14] one  is  way  more  applicable  to  most 
 people  if  you're  a  teenager  because  with 
 ebay  you  can  make  money  today  this  is
[03:19] the  exact  process  i'm  gonna  quickly  walk 
 you  through  it  as  just  a  little  bonus 
 okay  so  you  go  into  the  ebay  app  and
[03:24] you're  gonna  search  for  something  to  buy 
 and  so  what  i  would  search  for  and  my 
 advice  by  the  way  is  to  literally  copy
[03:29] exactly  what  i  do  copy  exactly  what  i  do 
 is  to  search  for  the  adidas  jumper  set
[03:34] this  sword  setting  to  ending  soonest  and 
 filter  it  with  price  for  about  seven 
 pounds  and  we're  just  going  to  put  this
[03:40] into  men's  as  well  so  these  are  all  the 
 ones  that  are  ending  in  you  know  a 
 couple  of  hours  and  look  how  cheap  you
[03:45] can  all  find  them  and  so  this  one  like 
 what  i'll  do  i  need  to  sign  in  hang  on 
 what  even  is  my  account
[03:50] okay  and  so  what  i  would  do  is  i  very 
 very  quickly  go  through  all  of  these  and 
 add  them  to  my  watch  list  like  you  can
[03:55] see  like  this  little  heart  in  the  corner 
 i'm  not  signed  in  right  now  but  i  would 
 add  literally  like  50  of  them  and  when  i
[04:00] had  a  watch  like  this  one  here  this  one 
 will  literally  sell  for  like  25  pounds 
 like  if  anyone  knows  like  adidas
[04:05] clothing  you'll  know  which  ones  sell 
 straight  away  this  one  will  sell  you 
 kind  of  just  get  an  eye  for  it  but  when
[04:10] you're  first  starting  off  my 
 recommendation  is  literally  just  follow 
 as  many  as  possible  set  up  timers  so  i 
 used  to  literally  just  see  like  you'd
[04:16] see  it  in  your  watch  list  that  it's 
 ending  in  like  three  hours  and  21 
 minutes  so  i'd  literally  say  like  hey 
 siri  set  on  a  timer  for  three  hours  and
[04:22] 20  minutes  and  oh  he's  gonna  do  it  now 
 three  hours  and  20  minutes  starting  now
[04:27] hey  siri  cancel  that  timer  please  it's 
 cancelled 
 thank  you  so  you  go  on  to  ebay  and  you 
 bid  for  these  ones  at  the  last  possible
[04:33] second  and  you  end  up  buying  them  for 
 literally  like  five  pounds  where  the 
 jumper  is  worth  like  25  it  gets 
 delivered  to  your  house  you  re-list  it
[04:39] straight  away  for  like  five  times  the 
 price  for  25  and  you  just  kind  of  like 
 keep  us  stuck  with  it  and  i  found  that
[04:44] when  you  have  about  100  pieces  of 
 clothing  like  i've  literally  i  still 
 have  loads  like  underneath  my  bed  and
[04:49] everything  when  you  have  like  100  pieces 
 of  clothing  you  start  selling  like  one 
 every  single  day  two  every  day  and  you
[04:54] start  making  like  literally  20  pounds  30 
 pounds  whilst  you  were  just  sleeping 
 which  it's  not  passive  income  because
[04:59] you  have  to  list  the  stuff  and  you  you 
 know  you  have  to  go  to  the  post  office 
 and  everything  but  the  reason  why  i'm 
 telling  you  is  because  this  really  was
[05:05] the  start  of  my  business  life  and  it 
 really  does  mean  a  lot  to  me  like 
 flipping  on  ebay  started  where  i  am
[05:11] today  so  let's  go  through  the  three  best 
 methods  to  make  passive  income  and  the 
 first  one  obviously  we're  gonna  go
[05:17] through  is  youtube  adsense  and  this  is 
 specifically  the  money  that  you  make 
 directly  from  youtube  so  we're  gonna  go
[05:22] into  my  computer  and  i'm  gonna  show  you 
 exactly  how  much  i've  been  making  so 
 this  is  my  youtube  adsense  page  for
[05:27] january  2021  of  this  year  now  to  get 
 monetized  you  need  to  join  the  youtube
[05:32] partner  program  and  the  requirements  are 
 4  000  hours  of  watch  time  and  1  000 
 subscribers  now  1  000  subscribers  took
[05:39] me  about  seven  months  and  the  4  000 
 watch  hours  took  me  about  eight  months 
 the  4  000  watch  hours  is  probably  a  bit
[05:45] harder  because  really  think  about  what 
 that  means  people  have  to  watch  your 
 videos  for  about  4  000  hours  and  i'm
[05:50] gonna  give  you  like  a  quick  tip  i  made 
 longer  videos  and  i  started  sharing  them 
 to  pages  on  reddit  and  that's  how  i
[05:55] started  building  up  the  initial  audience 
 that  really  started  snowballing  the 
 watch  hours  so  i  first  started  making 
 money  on  the  monday  the  18th  of  january
[06:01] and  i  was  making  about  a  pound  per  day  i 
 think  that's  about  two  dollars  per  day 
 and  i'm  not  gonna  lie  i  was  hype  like
[06:06] when  i  saw  this  and  i was  like  what  the 
 [ __ ]  a  pound  put  that  i  literally 
 remember  telling  like  i  told  a  girl  from
[06:11] tinder  and  i  was  like  getting  so  i  was 
 like  bro  that's  like  that's  like  a 
 takeaway  that's  like  a  meal  per  month  oh
[06:16] my  god  i  was  so  hyper  i  was  so  grateful 
 may  was  74  pounds  and  june  was  1600
[06:22] and  that's  the  difference  which  your 
 videos  blowing  up  really  makes  so  i'm 
 still  making  on  average  like  two  pound 
 three  pound  per  day  and  it  starts  going
[06:28] up  because  this  video  right  here  how  to 
 build  an  aesthetic  body  that  one  really 
 started  to  do  well  i  remember  this  point
[06:33] that  i  started  actually  like  gaining 
 like  a  little  bit  of  traction  and  i  was 
 actually  going  crazy  i  was  gaining  like 
 a  good  amount  of  subs  as  well  like  20  40
[06:39] 50  per  day  and  literally  within  just  a 
 week  i  go  from  making  like  four  pounds
[06:44] per  day  to  like  230  per  day  that's 
 [ __ ]  mad  that's  still  the  most  i've 
 ever  made  now  every  video  that  you
[06:50] upload  onto  youtube  is  like  an  asset  and 
 that's  such  an  important  word  that  you 
 need  to  know  right  there  assets  you've
[06:56] probably  heard  the  phrase  that  rich 
 people  get  assets  and  poor  people  get 
 liabilities  assets  are  things  that  make
[07:01] you  money  and  most  people  when  they 
 think  of  an  asset  they  think  of  like 
 rental  properties  and  like  dividends  and
[07:06] you  know  like  weird  stuff  that  as  like  a 
 young  person  you're  probably  not  like 
 even  thinking  that  you  could  get  that 
 whereas  a  youtube  video  that  you  can
[07:12] make  today  is  literally  an  asset  that 
 you  own  now  all  of  that  is  nice  but  the 
 best  part  of  youtube  is  that  you  gain  an
[07:18] audience  from  it  and  when  you  have  an 
 audience  of  people  who  like  you  you 
 start  to  just  make  so  much  more  money  i
[07:23] want  you  to  remember  this  phrase  that 
 i'm  about  to  say  right  now  the  money  is 
 made  with  the  audience  so  now  we're
[07:28] going  to  move  on  to  the  second  passive 
 income  idea  which  we're  going  to  use  the 
 audience  that  we've  just  built  to  create
[07:33] and  sell  a  course  now  online  courses 
 have  like  this  negative  view  that  a  lot 
 of people  say  like  their  scams  and  stuff
[07:38] like  you  know  what  i  don't  give  a [ __ ] 
 there  is  no  better  way  to  make  money 
 than  selling  a  course  which  you're  going 
 to  learn  just  in  a  second  so  course  is
[07:44] kind  of  like  a  series  of  youtube  videos 
 like  a  load  of  videos  that  you've  put 
 together  and  you've  thrown  in  like  extra
[07:50] stuff  like  bonuses  inside  of  it  so  it's 
 all  packaged  together  and  the  point  of  a 
 course  is  that  you  help  people  get  to
[07:55] like  a  very  particular  goal  so  the  point 
 of  my  course  is  to  help  people  to  build 
 like  their  10  out  of  10  dream  body  so
[08:00] here's  my  course  you  can  see  it's  like  a 
 bunch  of  different  videos  there's  extra 
 like  downloads  for  them  teaching  them
[08:05] exactly  like  what  exercises  to  do  and 
 how  to  do  them  safely  me  showing  them 
 like  what  meals  to  cook  and  everything
[08:10] and  so  you  make  the  course  by  you  know 
 recording  all  the  content  for  it  making 
 all  like  the  books  or  whatever  you  want 
 to  do  and  then  you  put  it  onto  a  course
[08:16] hosting  website  so  the  website  that  i 
 use  is  called  kajabi  and  usually  you'll 
 pay  like  monthly  for  these  and  usually
[08:22] you'll  pay  like  monthly  for  these 
 websites  and  so  then  what  you  do  once 
 the  course  is  uploaded  and  you  know  it's 
 ready  to  sell  you  make  a  sales  page  that
[08:29] actually  sells  the  course  and  so  what 
 i've  done  is  i've  linked  the  sales  page 
 for  this  course  below  in  the  description
[08:34] you  can  click  on  that  and  just  have  a 
 look  at  exactly  like  the  format  of  the 
 page  where  i  sell  this  course  and  then
[08:39] all  you  need  to  do  is  just  tell  your 
 audience  to  go  there  so  in  a  subtle  way 
 i've  just  told  my  audience  to  go  there 
 now  of  course  you  know  i  told  you  to  go
[08:45] there  in  terms  of  like  researching  it 
 but  just  because  i've  told  you  to  click 
 on  that  link  and  thousands  of  people 
 will  click  on  that  link  a  couple  of
[08:51] people  will  buy  my  course  so  just  in  a 
 subtle  way  i've  probably  just  made  600 
 over  the  last  10  seconds  how  much  did
[08:56] you  make  and  so  this  aesthetic  body 
 transformation  course  took  me  about  a 
 month  to  make  and  let's  see  how  much
[09:01] money  i  made  from  it  so  the  aesthetic 
 body  course  i  sold  137  of  them  so  far
[09:06] which  has  made  a  grand  total  of  twenty 
 one  thousand  nine  hundred  and  thirty 
 eight  dollars  so  about  twenty  two
[09:12] thousand  dollars  but  i  also  sell  like  a 
 different  version  of  the  course  right 
 here  for  ninety  seven  dollars  that  one
[09:19] has  sold  four  thousand  four  hundred  so 
 in  total  i've  made  about  twenty  six 
 thousand  dollars  from  this  course  and  i
[09:24] started  selling  it  in  july  so  it's  been 
 two  months  and  i  made  26k  [ __ ] 
 massive  bro  there  is  also  another  way
[09:30] that  you  can  make  money  from  courses  and 
 that  is  with  skillshare  now  skillshare 
 is  an  online  you  know  everyone's  like
[09:35] doing  the  adwords  for  it  i'm  not 
 sponsored  by  them  but  i've  got  a  couple 
 of  classes  on  skillshare  you  can  see 
 i've  got  one  for  deep  work  dopamine
[09:41] detoxing 
 goal  setting  social  skills  and 
 mindfulness  and  i've  linked  all  these
[09:46] below  as  well  so  you  can  go  have  a  look 
 at  them  and  skillshare  pays  you  based  on 
 the  minutes  that  people  have  watched
[09:51] your  course  so  it's  like  kind  of  like 
 youtube  live  so  you  know  as  people  watch 
 it  and  you  get  views  you  get  money  but
[09:56] also  skillshare  pay  you  10 
 for  every  person  that  you  refer  to  a
[10:01] free  trial  which  is  huge  by  the  way  so 
 i've  linked  it  below  you'll  get  a  link 
 which  is  like  you  know  hamza's  invited
[10:06] you  have  a  free  trial  if  you  sign  up  to 
 that  which  i'm  hoping  you  do  i'll 
 instantly  get  ten  dollars  then  if  you
[10:11] watch  my  courses  i'll  get  like  probably 
 a  couple  more  dollars  per  like  couple  of 
 minutes  that  you  watch  so  you  can  see  in
[10:17] total  i've  made  over  the  last  fair 
 amount  of  months  i've  made  seven 
 thousand  six  hundred  dollars  from 
 skillshare  and  here  is  like  the  exact
[10:23] numbers  here  you  can  see  about  the  time 
 that  i  hit  1  000  subscribers  i  started 
 making  more  than  100  and  like  50  from
[10:30] skillshare  by  the  time  i  got  monetized 
 on  youtube  i  started  making  152  so
[10:35] skillshare  was  actually  making  me  more 
 money  than  so  skillshare  was  actually 
 making  me  more  money  than  youtube  was
[10:40] then  it  keeps  going  up  and  then  boom  i 
 have  like  a  pretty  good  ass  month  36 
 people  got  referred  in  this  month
[10:46] because  i  linked  my  classes  just  more 
 often  and  i'm  pretty  sure  like  two  of  my 
 videos  did  pretty  well  and  those  were
[10:52] two  videos  where  in  the  video  i  actually 
 said  okay  go  to  the  link  in  the 
 description  and  sign  up  to  my  skillshare 
 free  trial  and  so  i  made  476  dollars
[10:58] that  month  like  that  was  so  much  more 
 than  what  i  was  making  on  youtube  that 
 was  the  original  screenshot  i  got  paid
[11:03] that  whilst  i  was  in  portugal  4  87 
 passively  like  i  have  not  put  any  work
[11:09] into  skillshare  for  literally  months  i 
 haven't  even  like  said  that  much  anyway 
 it's  just  because  my  old  videos  have
[11:15] said  that  and  people  are  just  finding 
 them  and  clicking  the  link  building  an 
 audience  of  people  who  like  you  and 
 selling  them  a  course  is  literally  the
[11:21] best  way  to  make  money  today  you  could 
 think  of  any  other  business  idea  of  like 
 coding  an  app  or  a  website  or  making
[11:27] like  a  real  life  product  and  making  a 
 course  is  better  it's  lower  effort  and 
 it'll  make  more  money  and  finally  the
[11:32] third  passive  income  idea  is  right  in 
 books  look  how  much  i  made  from  writing 
 an  ebook  like  almost  five  thousand
[11:37] dollars  and  there's  a  secret  why  i  made 
 so  much  money  from  this  ebook  whilst 
 most  people  who  write  ebooks  pretty  much
[11:42] make  no  money  like  they  get  no  sales  on 
 amazon  there's  a  reason  why  this  one  did 
 so  so  well  and  i'm  going to  teach  you
[11:47] that  in  just  a  second  and  writing  ebooks 
 is  literally  as  simple  as  just  opening 
 up  a  word  document  on  your  computer
[11:52] writing  out  what  like  you  know  the  story 
 of  the  book  is  and  then  using  amazon's 
 like  software  to  just  like  format  it 
 like  you  could  literally  do  that  in  like
[11:57] five  minutes  and  then  just  upload  it  to 
 sell  and  write  in  ebooks  was  actually 
 the  first  passive  income  like  online
[12:02] income  method  that  i  tried  and  i  wrote  a 
 couple  of  books  which  i'm  gonna  just 
 link  in  the  description  they're  not  like 
 for  sale  you  can  literally  just  go  and
[12:07] like  read  them  just  so  you  can  kind  of 
 like  see  what  they  were  like  and  there's 
 two  very  big  different  things  that  i  did
[12:12] to  make  four  thousand  six  hundred 
 dollars  for  this  ebook  here  the  first 
 was  that  instead  of  just  writing  the 
 book  i  thought  okay  what  are  like  extra
[12:18] stuff  that  i  can  put  into  this  so  that 
 it's  like  it's  so  much  more  worth  it  i 
 spent  like  a  couple  of  hours  sitting
[12:23] down  and  i  made  40  workout  routines  like 
 that  takes  [ __ ]  asia  and  i  included 
 them  into  this  training  program  book
[12:29] people  can  just  read  this  ebook  click  on 
 the  workout  routine  link  the  workout 
 routine  literally  just  opens  up  on  their
[12:34] phone  and  so  i  included  all  those 
 workout  routines  for  free  in  this  ebook 
 now  the  second  thing  i  did  which  is 
 pretty  important  i  didn't  sell  it  on
[12:39] amazon  now  amazon  make  it  so  easy  for 
 you  to  start  selling  your  book  but  the 
 issue  is  that  it  just  never  really
[12:45] worked  for  me  so  the  thing  that  worked 
 for  me  was  that  i  sold  this  ebook  on  my 
 own  website  but  in  a  really  smart  way
[12:51] because  you  might  have  seen  in  my 
 previous  videos  and  we  go  to  the 
 description  and  there's  get  the  best 
 seven  workout  routines  sent  to  your
[12:57] phone  you  click  on  this  link  and  you're 
 sent  here  so  you'll  get  seven  free 
 workout  routines  if  you  put  in  your 
 details  and  as  soon  as  you  put  in  your
[13:03] details  look  what  happens  you  get  sent 
 to  a  page  to  buy  this  program  like  yes  i 
 want  to  buy  the  program  and  then  i  and
[13:09] this  is  [ __ ]  sick  right  when  you're 
 on  this  page  to  buy  this  program  i've 
 also  put  on  the  upsell  to  the  course  so
[13:15] someone  came  here  just  to  get  the  free 
 workout  routines  but  they  were  sentient 
 they  were  showed  like  wait  you  can  get 
 this  whole  thing  for  only  27  it's  like
[13:21] yeah  you  know  27  i  might  buy  it  and  then 
 they  come  onto  this  page  ready  to  spend 
 27  and  they're  like  wait  you  can  also
[13:26] get  this  course  for  only  97  and  they're 
 like  oh  yeah  why  not  and  boom  it  works
[13:31] so  192  people  bought  the  ebook  just  from 
 that  redirect  and  49  people  also  bought
[13:37] the  upsell  to  the  course  on  that  same 
 page  so  this  is  how  not  only  did  i  sell 
 the  course  for  22  000  but  i  actually
[13:43] sold  another  9  000  worth  just  by  kind  of 
 like  splitting  it  up  and  selling  it
[13:48] separately  in  like  a  really  smart  way  so 
 that  means  like  all  of  my  products  that 
 i  sell  are  connected  and  that  has  truly
[13:53] blown  up  my  income  so  now  let's  very 
 quickly  add  up  everything  so  you  can  see 
 how  much  i've  made  since  june  okay  so
[13:59] let's  see  on  youtube  since  june  i  made 
 9747  pounds  so  kajabi  is  the  page  where
[14:06] i  sell  my  course  in  the  e-book  since 
 june  i've  made  39  000 
 so  since  june  it's  been  three  months
[14:13] i've  made  62  000  click  on  this  video  if
