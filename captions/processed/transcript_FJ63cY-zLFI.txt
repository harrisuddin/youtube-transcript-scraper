[00:00] Jeffrey  does  not 
 do  a  front  double  bicep  when  hamza's
[00:05] video  comes  on 
 I've  not  uploaded  onto  this  channel  for
[00:11] four  or  five  days  and  trust  me  I've 
 tried  to  record  this  very  video
[00:16] six  times  now 
 yesterday  I  had  a  version  of  this  video 
 premiered  and  then  I  went  onto  the
[00:22] YouTube  Studio  editor  and  trimmed  out  a 
 little  bit  then  I  went  to  sleep  and  then 
 I  woke  up  in  the  middle  of  the  night  and
[00:27] thought  wait  let  me  change  it  and  then  I 
 delete  the  video  then  I  made  a  message 
 saying  okay  sorry  you  know  it  was 
 premiered  but  like  I'm  gonna  change  it
[00:33] and  I  record  it  three  times  today  and  I 
 don't  even  know  like  what  truly  to  say 
 this  is  gonna  be  the  last  version
[00:40] I  think  we've  been 
 quite  successful  at  what  our  purpose  and
[00:46] Mission  was  here  to  spread  the  message 
 of  self-improvements
[00:52] and  of  course  not  everyone  in  the  entire 
 world  is  on  self-improvement  of  course
[00:57] not 
 we've  gone  a  really  good  number  of  men 
 delaying  gratification  understanding
[01:02] things  like  prioritizing  their  mental 
 health  and  getting  into  fitness  and 
 building  an  aesthetic  body  and
[01:07] meditating  and  I  think  we've  done  really 
 good  work  here 
 you  know  I've  been  on  this  journey  for
[01:13] over  two  years  and  I've  dedicated  myself 
 fully  to  this 
 every  single  day  I've  woke  up  and
[01:19] thought  about  spreading  this  message  of 
 self-improvements  every  shower  that  I've 
 taken  as  I  clean  my  body  I  think  about
[01:25] spreading  the  message  of 
 self-improvement  every  meal  that  I've 
 ate  I've  thought  about  spreading  the
[01:30] message  of  self-improvement  this  has 
 been  my  purpose  for  over  two  years 
 and  a  little  while  ago
[01:38] it  had 
 dissolved 
 I  completed  this  layer  of  my  purpose  and
[01:45] I'm  on  to  the  next  layer  I  continued 
 things 
 running  the  channel  making  the  videos  I
[01:50] continued  things  for  a  while  because  you 
 know  there's  still  a  game  to  doing  this
[01:55] thing  you  know  we're  not  completely  done 
 yet  there's  more  Mensa  help  there's  a 
 bigger  channel  that  we  could  you  know
[02:00] create  so  we  could  get  to  5  million  subs 
 and  even  more  we  could  make  more  money 
 in  all  this  but  the  truth  is
[02:05] I  genuinely  feel  like  I've  completed 
 this  layer  of  my  purpose  which  was
[02:10] totally  fixated  on  growing  the  channel 
 and  spreading  the  message  of 
 self-improvement  to  the  men  out  there
[02:21] I've  made  the  hard  decision  now  after 
 weighing  this  up  so  many  times  after 
 speaking  to  my  close  friend  who  helps  me
[02:27] make  these  decisions  Sam 
 I've  made  the  hard  decision  now
[02:32] to  stop  this  content  production  machine 
 that  we  had  here  this  huge  team  that  we
[02:38] had  of  seven  video  editors  and  Tick  Tock 
 guys  and  sales  guys  and  Twitter  guys  and
[02:46] we  had  over  a  dozen  employees 
 who  I  was  personally  paying  for  and  I
[02:51] pay  my  staff  very  well 
 and 
 I  let  every  single  one  go
[02:58] including  some  carbonates  and  my  best 
 friend  who's  worked  for  me  for  over  two
[03:03] years 
 I've  kept  my  personal  assistant  but 
 that's  a  kind  of  different  I  guess  but  I
[03:09] have  an  assistant  and  that's  it  I  don't 
 have  any  video  editors  or  anything  else 
 now 
 I  will  not  be  posting
[03:15] daily  videos  to  the  YouTube  channel 
 hamster's  daily  you  know  vids  anything
[03:20] like  that 
 my  new  layer  of  my  purpose  to  for  me  to
[03:28] focus  on 
 is  my  own  development  as  a  man
[03:34] I  no  longer  care  about  being  a  YouTuber 
 or  an  influencer  or  a  celebrity  or  a  man
[03:41] with  fame  or  anything  like  this  you  know 
 a  guy  with  a  million  subscribers
[03:46] genuine  I'm  not  saying  this  to  be  humble 
 or  anything  genuinely  I  just  don't  care 
 about  it  it's  like  this  is  what  happens
[03:52] when  you  really  focus  in  on  your  purpose 
 everything  else  just  seems  silly  and
[03:57] pointless  and  for  so  long  this  was  the 
 purpose  right  you  know  the  YouTube 
 channel  grow  the  channel  get  get  one
[04:02] million  subscribers  five  million 
 subscribers  grow  the  channel  more  views 
 more  what  time  more  subscribers  amazing
[04:07] yes  keep  growing  the  channel 
 now  it's  like  I  just  don't  even  think 
 about  it  at  all 
 what  my  purpose  is  now  is  my  own
[04:13] development  to  become  even  more  of  a  man 
 and  the  angle  that  it's  currently
[04:19] fixated  on 
 my  mind 
 my  heart  and  my  soul
[04:27] is  fighting  competition  martial  arts 
 that's  what  I'm  throwing  myself  into
[04:32] fully 
 I'm  trying  to  align  what  100  of  my  life
[04:37] into  that  endeavor  of  of  martial  arts 
 and  I  know  this  seems  like  a  really  big
[04:43] change  it's  like  wait  you  were  just  a 
 YouTuber  and  I  say  in  martial  arts  but 
 this  is  kind  of  like  how  a  masculine
[04:49] purpose  works 
 soon  I  will  have  some  kind  of  guide 
 explaining  this  and  first  I  should  tell
[04:55] you  that  what's  going  to  happen  to  this 
 channel  what's  gonna  happen  to  like  the 
 YouTube  is  that  I  don't  really  care
[05:00] about  the  YouTube  channel  I  certainly 
 don't  care  about  metrics  vanity
[05:05] followers  I  don't  care  at  all  likes 
 views  anything
[05:11] what  I  do  still  have  some  positive 
 feeling  about  is
[05:17] the  beauty  of  passing  knowledge  to  each 
 other
[05:22] I  no  longer  want  to  see  this  as  a 
 YouTube  channel  that  I'm  trying  to  grow 
 I  want  to  see  this  as  me  genuinely  just
[05:28] sitting  down  turning  the  camera  on  when 
 I  have  some  actually  like  really 
 valuable  knowledge  to  give  to  you  some
[05:34] really  valuable  some  purposeful  advice 
 to  give  you 
 and  then  I  disappear  again
[05:41] I'm  no  longer  going  to  be  posting  on  a 
 schedule  you  know  like  we  posted  every 
 single  day  at  the  same  time  I'm  not
[05:46] going  to  do  that  anymore  they  might  be 
 some  times  where  I  post  like  you  know 
 four  times  in  four  days  but  then  I  will
[05:53] probably  disappear  for  some  while  if  you 
 look  at  my  second  Channel  that's  kind  of 
 like  how  I  expect  things  to  be  I'm  not
[05:58] going  to  stick  to  a  schedule  I'm  not 
 going  to  see  myself  as  like  a  YouTuber 
 who  you  know  all  this  stuff  like  I  don't
[06:04] bro  like 
 I'm  not  a  YouTuber
[06:10] I'm  just 
 a  man  with  a  camera 
 I'm  a  man  who  is  going  out  there  into
[06:16] the  real  world  to  develop  himself  in  the 
 areas  that  a  man  should  and  when  it
[06:21] comes  up  when  it  is  important  to  do  so 
 I  will  try  and  pass  on  hopefully  some
[06:26] really  really  valuable  advice  and 
 knowledge  to  you 
 I  care  absolutely
[06:34] not  not  at  all 
 about  gaining  more  subscribers  and
[06:39] growing  the  the  community  growing  the 
 channel  at  all  I  don't  care  about  new 
 Subs  new  subscribers  new  followers  I
[06:46] don't  care 
 what  I  care  about 
 is  the  current  men
[06:51] for  so  long  I  spent  every  single  day 
 thinking  about  how  to  grow  the  channel
[06:57] the  movement  how  to  get  more  subscribers 
 I  don't  care  all  I  care  about  now  is
[07:02] actually  helping  you  the  current  man 
 more 
 and  I  think  to  do  that  I  actually  have
[07:09] to  prioritize  my  own  Journey  because 
 otherwise  I'll  just  be  repeating  the 
 same  messages  over  and  over  and  you  know
[07:14] I'd  just  be  like  rinsing  out  the  same 
 learning  lessons  that  I  had  from  a  year 
 ago  I  need  to  go  out  there  into  the  real
[07:19] world  and  experience  some  true  hardship 
 true  love
[07:25] true  discipline 
 I  need  to  get  these  experiences  myself
[07:30] formulate  them  into  a  real  valuable 
 message  through  contemplation  and
[07:35] Solitude  and  journaling  and  then  come 
 when  I  have  prepared  more  like  a 
 presentation  more  like  a  classroom
[07:41] speech  to  you 
 I  will  no  longer  be  feeding  into  the  the
[07:48] daily  content  machine  yep  you  know  just 
 make  another  video  because  your  YouTube
[07:53] channel  will  grow  more  if  you  do  and 
 yeah  make  them  really  edited  because 
 your  YouTube  channel  will  grow  more  if 
 you  do  and  then  yeah  do  this  thing  do
[07:59] this  thing  get  into  this  drama  do  this 
 YouTube  drama  I'm  not  gonna  do  any  of 
 that 
 all  I'm  focused  on  is  my  own
[08:06] developments  and  mostly  that's  coming 
 from  Combat  Sports  right  now  it's  coming 
 from  martial  arts  and  the  lessons  that
[08:12] come  from  that  and  every  now  and  then 
 when  it  is 
 required  important  necessary  valuable
[08:18] purposeful 
 I  will  sit  down  with  a 
 planned  message
[08:24] a  formal  planned  video 
 to  try  and  help  you
[08:30] I  know  that  this  seems  crazy 
 and  I  know  that  for  younger  hamzo  was 
 watching  this  Hamza  from  one  year  ago
[08:36] two  years  ago  he  would  have 
 been  shocked  he  would  have  said  to  me
[08:41] right  now  if  if  24  year  old  Hamza  23 
 year  old  Hamza  was  watching  me  and  you 
 know  he  had  been  putting  in  some  work
[08:46] into  YouTube  saw  that  we  were  on  one  and 
 a  half million  subscribers  and  then  saw 
 that  I  essentially  was  saying  that  I  was
[08:51] going  to  stop  to  like  do  something  more 
 fulfilling  he'd  think  that  I  was  crazy 
 why  not  just  keep  pushing  why  not  just
[08:56] get  to  5  million  subscribers  and  then 
 stop  if  you  want  to  but  like  why  you 
 just  get  five  minutes  you  know  just  keep 
 things  running  but  what  I  have  realized
[09:02] recently  is  that  if  you  want  to  become  a 
 truly  purposeful  man  if  you  truly  want
[09:07] to  become  masculine 
 you  need  to  align  as  much  of  your  life
[09:12] as  possible  to  this  layer  of  purpose 
 that  needs  to  be  peeled  back 
 there  are  so  many  things  that  I  could
[09:18] say  right  now  about  purpose 
 you  know  you've  heard  the  term  purpose 
 so  much  it  makes  me  like  I  can't  explain
[09:25] to  you  enough  like  it  makes  me  shiver 
 and  like  my  the  hair  stand  up  on  my  arms 
 of  my  understanding  of  purpose  like  my
[09:31] entire  life 
 is  changing  forever  because  of  this 
 understanding  that  I've  had  over
[09:37] literally  just  the  last  week  of  how  I 
 will  live  my  life  from  now  on  and  when  I 
 do  have  the  time  and  the  the  formulated
[09:44] message  to  do  that  which  will  be  a  video 
 soon 
 maybe  you'll  you'll  actually  understand 
 why  I'm  making  this  this  change
[09:52] to  a  lot  of  people  this  may  seem  like  a 
 huge  sacrifice  and  it  may  seem  as  as
[09:57] really  strange  you  add  a  big  YouTube 
 channel  some  level  of  Fame  and  clout  and
[10:03] you  know  you're  like  an  influencer 
 you're  like  an  internet  celebrity  wow 
 but  these  things
[10:09] that  you  know  a  lot  of  young  men  desire 
 these  things  can  be  really  nice 
 but  becoming  a  man  and  fulfilling  your
[10:16] mission  is  infinitely  more  fulfilling 
 infinitely  more
[10:22] freeing 
 a  fulfilled  and  peered  back  peeled  back
[10:28] this  layer  of  my  purpose  of  spreading 
 this  message  and  trying  to  get  over  a 
 million  men  on  on  self-improvement  a
[10:34] million  men  to  meditate 
 and  of  course  there's  there's  more  men
[10:39] out  there  who  still  need  this  help  but 
 it  no  longer  feels  like  that's  my  duty 
 anymore  to  spread  the  message  more  and
[10:45] more  and  more  and  more  it  feels  like  my 
 duty  now 
 is  my  own  developments
[10:52] is  me  as  a  man 
 I  must  disappear  without  this  this
[10:57] feeling  and  the  stress  and  this  pressure 
 of  you  know  oh  what  we've  got  to  blow 
 daily  so  you  can't  go  and  do  this  thing
[11:02] and  so  bro  no 
 no  daily  videos  no  pressure  from  from 
 like  YouTube  anymore
[11:09] sometimes  I  might  disappear  for  weeks 
 and  months  and  I  know  it  sounds  silly 
 but  like  sometimes  I  might  go  to  the
[11:14] mountains  and  stay  in  the  mountains  and 
 sometimes  I  might  go  stay  in  a  place 
 that  has  no  internet  in  the  wild  because
[11:20] these  are  the  things  that  I  feel  like  I 
 must  do  as  a  man 
 in  less  than  two  weeks
[11:25] I  move  and  I  will  go  and  stay  in  a 
 training  camp  a  fight  camp  where  I  will
[11:31] literally  stay  in  a  single  bed  in  the 
 gym  in  the  not  not  like  a  weightlifting
[11:36] gym  but  in  a  martial  arts  gym  where  I 
 will  train  for  hours  upon  hours  every 
 single  day  where  I  will  try  to  push
[11:43] myself  to  my  extreme  limits  push  past  my 
 limit  so  that  I  know  what  my  actual 
 limits  are  because  these  experiences  are
[11:51] deeply  important  for  men 
 and  I  will  not  hold  that  back  for  the
[11:57] the  gain  of  Internet  fame  or  anything 
 like  this
[12:03] sure  I  was  a  YouTuber  but 
 past  that
[12:10] I  am  a  man 
 and  becoming  more  masculine  as  a  man  is
[12:15] the  single  greatest  thing  that  you  can 
 do 
 it's  something  that  we  should  naturally 
 do  and  yet  in  this  modern  world  we  don't
[12:21] really  do  that 
 but  every  step  that  I  take  towards  a
[12:27] more  masculine  version  of  my  still  self 
 even  saying  that  sentence  every  step
[12:33] that  I  take  towards  a  more  masculine 
 version  of  myself  it's  like  I  feel  it
[12:38] inside  that  this  is  right  I'm  taking  a 
 step  away  from  like  internet  like  I'm
[12:44] not  a  celebrity  I'm  not  like  famous  for 
 anything  but  you  know  like  1.5  million 
 subscribers  is  pretty  good  I'm  taking  a
[12:50] step  away  from  that  and  a  step  literally 
 Into  the  Wild 
 and  I  can't  tell  you  like  how  right  that
[12:57] this  is  even  though  it  may  seem  crazy 
 because  if  younger  Amazon  was  watching 
 this  he  would  be  annoyed  he'd  be
[13:02] thinking  wait  what  like  just  get  to  five 
 million  Subs  get  to  10  million  Subs  okay 
 then  you  can  quit  if  you  want  but  no
[13:10] I've  let  everyone  go 
 all  of  my  team  members  everything
[13:15] all  my  video  editors  Sam  hibernate  I've 
 let  every  single  employee  go  apart  from
[13:21] my  my  personal  assistant 
 to  pursue  this  new  purpose  layer
[13:27] which  I  know  is  absolutely  like  crazy  to 
 think  but  this  this  is  somewhat  coming
[13:32] to  an  end 
 but
[13:37] I  don't  see  it  as  the  end 
 I  see  it  as  a  new  beginning
[13:47] so  from  your  perspective  what  you  will 
 see 
 is  that  you  will  no  longer  see  these
[13:52] daily  uploads  at  the  same  time  every 
 single  day  you  won't  see  that  you  won't 
 see  videos  with  animations  and  edits  and
[13:59] artistic  thumbnails  or  anything  like 
 that  you  will  just  see  plain  basic 
 occasional  sporadic  videos
[14:06] infrequent  videos  from  me  with  no 
 editing  literally  just  me  sitting  down
[14:12] for 
 half  an  hour  to  two  hours  explaining 
 some  kind  of  concept  that  I  think  would
[14:18] genuinely  change  your  life
[14:23] only  when  I  have  the  time  away  from  the 
 thing  that  is  actually  my  priority  which
[14:29] is  developing  myself  and  mostly  that's 
 coming  through  fighting  right  now
[14:37] we  have  done  absolutely  amazing  to 
 spread  this  message
[14:42] to  think  that  over  a  million  men  have 
 discovered  self-improvement  because  of
[14:47] this 
 and  you  should  feel  so  proud  of  yourself 
 for  being  part  of  that
[14:53] this  is  not  the  end 
 this  is  the  beginning
[15:00] I  didn't  realize  it  would 
 go  like  this  you  know  in  my  perception 
 of  things  it  just  seemed  clear  yeah  just
[15:06] keep  growing  the  channel  keep  growing 
 the  channel  keep  growing  the  channel 
 yeah  if  you  want  to  like  do  some 
 discipline  martial  arts  stuff  do  that
[15:11] one  hour  a  day  if  you  want  or  whatever 
 I  think  in  some  time  if  you  are
[15:18] uncertain  about  this  and  you're  thinking 
 wait  this  is  still  crazy  like  why  have 
 you  done  this  I  think  in  just  some  time
[15:25] you  may  begin  to  realize  maybe  you  click 
 on  a  random  video  I  make  two  weeks  from 
 now  and  you're  like  wait  this  actually
[15:32] may  have  been  one  of  the  best  things  he 
 could  do  for  himself  and  even  me  as  the
[15:37] viewer 
 I  just  want  to  help  you  as  much  as
[15:44] possible 
 I  no  longer  want  to  think  about  the 
 YouTube  views  and  retention  and  and
[15:50] average  view  duration  and  click-through 
 rate  and  all  these  like  YouTube  like 
 internet  social  media  terms  I  don't  want
[15:55] to  be  a  part  of  like  the  social  media 
 machine  I  am  simply  just  a  man  with  a
[16:00] camera 
 and  I  think  some  of  the  things  that  I
[16:05] have  to  say 
 are  going  to  be  extremely  educational
[16:10] the  next  video  that  will  be  posted  to 
 this  channel 
 will  be  the  last  video  of  the  old  kind
[16:17] the  animated  edited  Jeffrey  nadonna's 
 intro  the  seven  ways  to  make  girls  like 
 you  kind  of  thing  that  will  be  the  last
[16:23] video  I  would  happily  start  fresh  right 
 now  and  not  release  that  video  but  it 
 was  already  done  it  was  already  paid  for
[16:28] editor  it  has  done  the  work  the 
 thumbnail  guys  already  made  it  so  it's
[16:33] like  we  may  as  well  release  it  as  like  a 
 sort  of  celebration  for  the  final  video 
 that  we  can  all  come  out  come  together
[16:38] with  maybe  I'll  Premiere  it  we  can  all 
 come  together  and  say  okay  this  is  like 
 the  last  video  of  its  kind  on  the
[16:43] channel 
 and  then  after  that 
 you  will  not  see  consistent  uploads  from
[16:49] me 
 you  will  see 
 a  video  from  me  when  I  genuinely  think
[16:55] it  will  change  your  life  I  will 
 handshake  you  with  that  right  now  you 
 will  see  a  video  from  me  when  I
[17:00] genuinely  think  that  video  will  change 
 your  life  forever 
 and  the  one  that  I  do  have  a  plan  for
[17:06] which  maybe  you'll  see  within  a  week  or 
 two  weeks  is  a  guide  to  purpose
[17:12] I've  made  videos  on  purpose  before  but 
 my  understanding  of  it  has  increased
[17:17] dramatically  just  very  recently  and  so 
 it  will  be  like  a  full  one-hour  guide  no
[17:22] edits  no  Cuts  nothing  like  that  of  me 
 just  telling  you  from  my  current
[17:28] understanding  what  purpose  is  how  to 
 become  more  purposeful  as  a  man 
 and  like  I  can't
[17:34] right  now  I  don't  have  the  words  for  it 
 I  can't  explain  to  you  how  important
[17:40] purpose  is  I've  owned  like  you  know  you 
 always  like  I'll  save  this  for  the  video
[17:45] that  I'm  gonna  release  but  this  is  the 
 kind  of  content  that  I  will  now  want  to 
 create  when  the  time  is  right  the  kind
[17:51] of  thing  where  I'm  sat  here  thinking 
 come  on  how  do  I  word  this  in  the  right 
 way  so  that  it's  going  to  change  his 
 life  like  this  is  what  I  want  to  do  I
[17:58] want  to  focus  on  my  own  life  have  my  own 
 experiences  that  that  drops  my  jaw  that
[18:04] hurts  my  muscles  that  challenges  my  soul 
 and  my  mind
[18:09] and  then  when  the  time  is  right  and  the 
 message  is  formulated  so  well  multiple
[18:15] times  multiple  iterations  and  journals 
 and  plans  and  questions  then  I  will  come
[18:20] and  sit  down  to  the  camera  and  try  and 
 send  out  the  best  most  valuable  message
[18:25] that  I  can 
 one  last  time  I  will  handshake  you  and 
 say  that  I  will  produce  the  kind  of
[18:30] videos  which  I  genuinely  think  will 
 change  your  life  anytime  you  see  after 
 the  next  like  normal  the  oh  yeah  the
[18:36] seven  ways  uh  last  you  know  the  last 
 video  of  its  kind  after  that  the  videos 
 you  will  see  from  me  know  that  anytime
[18:43] you  see  that  on  your  YouTube  homepage 
 Hamza  has  genuinely  thought  to  himself 
 that  this  video  would  change  my  life
[18:48] let's  see  let's  see  Hamza  let's  see  if 
 it  actually  is 
 and  if  it's  not  and  if  it's  consistently
[18:54] not  I'm  telling  you  right  now  if  you 
 consistently  keep  seeing  videos  from  me 
 that  are  like  ah  whatever  I  don't  care
[19:00] totally  stop  watching  your  time  and  your 
 attention  is  so  incredibly  valuable
[19:06] what  I  want  for  the  future  of  any  kind 
 of  like  things  the  content  that  I
[19:11] produce  is  that  it  is  actually  a  fair 
 exchange  a  mutually  beneficial
[19:16] exchange  of  value  for  your  time  and 
 attention  in  exchange  for  the  education
[19:23] knowledge  and  advice 
 that  it's  actually  genuinely  a  fair
[19:28] trade 
 because  most  YouTube  videos  are  not  most 
 YouTube  videos  are  like  just  these  silly
[19:33] like  time  wasting  ones  that  you  eat 
 whilst  you  eat  your  you  watch  whilst  you 
 eat  your  dinner  like  oh  yeah
[19:38] you  know  all  these  silly  like  brain  like 
 brain  dead  videos  oh  yeah  I  guess  people
[19:43] guess  who  the  short  person  is  or  P  or 
 watch  this  dating  show  and  all  this
[19:48] silly  stuff  bro  your  time  and  attention 
 is  worth 
 a  lot  your  time  and  attention  as  a  man
[19:54] is  all  that  you  have  and  I  hope  that  any 
 single  time  that  you  see  a  video  from  me
[20:00] on  your  channel  which  what  on  your 
 homepage  which  will  not  be  off  then  it 
 will  not  be  daily  at  all  anytime  you  see
[20:05] this  random  video  from  me  you  will  think 
 to  yourself  you  know  what  Hamza  has 
 consistently  proven  to  himself  since 
 he's  made  this  change  that  he  will
[20:12] actually  give  me  something  that  is  worth 
 my  time  and  attention  when  I  sit  down 
 and  watch  his  new  videos  fully  and  so  I
[20:18] will  click  once  more  because  he  has 
 actually  built  up  this  reputation  for 
 this  and  that  means  if  you  hold  me  to
[20:24] the  standard  that  means  that  before  I 
 sit  down  and  press  record  I  will 
 genuinely  think  to  myself  okay  how  do  I
[20:29] change  this  person's  life  because  of 
 this  knowledge  is  it  actually 
 life-changing  or  is  it  just  because  I 
 want  to  upload  a  video  and  you  know  get
[20:35] some  like  YouTube  likes  because  I  don't 
 care  about  that  anymore
[20:45] this  is  not  the  end 
 this  is  the  beginning
[20:52] one  final  thing  I  will  say 
 all  of  the  the  staff  my  team  members
[20:58] that  I've  let  go 
 there  was  not  a  single  person  who  I  let 
 go  because  of  poor  performance  or
[21:04] anything  like  that  I  let  everyone  go 
 because  this  is  like  it's  something  I 
 had  to  do  for  this  new  start  I  didn't
[21:09] need  anyone  anymore  for  what  I  plan  to 
 do  I  wanted  this  specifically  to  be  like 
 this  unfiltered  unedited  videos  I  don't
[21:15] need  video  editors  I  don't  need  a 
 thumbnail  guy  a  script  guy  anything  like 
 that  so  I've  let  everyone  go  but  there's
[21:20] one  final  thing  just  quickly  I  will  say 
 that  if  you  are  a  YouTuber  or  someone 
 who  may  be  interested  in  hiring  my
[21:26] ex-team  members  please  keep  an  eye  out 
 on  my  YouTube  Community  post  I'm  gonna
[21:31] do  my  best  to  put  in  some  effort  to  try 
 and  help  my  my  recent  staff  find  new
[21:37] clients  and  stuff  so  I  gave  everyone 
 like  Severance  packages  and  everything  I 
 gave  everyone  essentially  like  free
[21:42] money  just  out  of  like  the  history  that 
 they've  had  working  for  me 
 but  I  also  want  to  help  every  video
[21:47] editor  I  have  the  thumbnail  guy  mapper 
 and  stuff  I  want  to  help  every  one  of 
 them  find  like  new  work  as  soon  as
[21:53] possible  so  that  they  can  transition 
 into  like  new  places  as  well  that's 
 something  that  I  think  is  is  um just
[21:58] important  to  do  it's  nice  to  do  for  the 
 guys  who've  helped  this  movement  so  much 
 so  if  you  are  like  maybe  a  YouTuber  or
[22:03] maybe  if  you  will  have  some  kind  of  use 
 for  a  video  editor  you  want  to  employ 
 one  of  my  guys  who  no  longer  work  for  me
[22:08] please  keep  an  eye  out  on  this  main 
 Channel's  YouTube  Community  post  where  I
[22:13] will  put  details  about  each  and  every 
 staff  member  that  I  let  go  their  email
[22:18] Instagram  their  portfolio  things  like 
 that  if  you  are  interested  in 
 potentially  hiring  them  and  just  see
[22:24] what  that  happens  with  that  I  really 
 want  to  help  them  just  like  kind  of  hit 
 the  ground  running  with  a  new 
 opportunity  because  every  guy  that  I've
[22:30] had  on  my  team  has  been  there  for  a 
 little  while  now  and  they've  been  very 
 very  good
[22:35] that's  all  I  have  to  say  for  today 
 do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah
