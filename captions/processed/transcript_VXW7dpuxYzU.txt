[00:00] if  you  know  my  story  which  will  pop  up 
 on  screen  you  know  that 
 i've  struggled  with  diet  a  lot  and  the
[00:06] one  thing  that  has  really  helped  me 
 significantly  changed  everything  which  i 
 hope  to  give  you  today
[00:11] is  education  quality  education  that 
 makes  it  click 
 for  that  reason  it's  very  important  for
[00:16] me  to  explain  some  things  that  may  seem 
 like  common  sense 
 but  i  urge  you  if  you  really  want  this
[00:21] to  be  important  to  watch  it  in  order  and 
 don't  skip  around 
 i  know  i  personally  skip  on  youtube
[00:26] videos  especially  when  they've  got  an 
 introduction  like  this  and  if  you've 
 watched  my  videos  before 
 you  know  that  i'm  not  the  introduction
[00:32] type  of  guy  i  usually  jump  straight  in 
 with  the  practical  advice 
 you  can't  do  that  with  diets  you  have  to
[00:37] learn  about  diets  from  the  ground  up 
 so  that's  why  this  introduction  is  quite 
 long  even  though  i  usually  skip  over
[00:42] them  completely  you're  gonna 
 have  to  reframe  your  mind  we're  gonna 
 have  to  take  out  everything  you  know
[00:47] about  diets  because 
 everything  you  know  about  diet  has  been 
 ingrained  into  you  by  a  society  that  is
[00:53] unhealthy  no  matter  which  country  you're 
 in  apart  from 
 like  two  or  three  countries  pretty  much
[00:58] everyone  in  your  country  is  overweight 
 70  of  people  in  western  countries  are
[01:03] overweight  or  obese  that  means  that 
 whatever  we're  all  doing  as  a  majority 
 as  a  society 
 is  not  working  we're  doing  the  opposite
[01:10] in  self-improvement  we  always  follow 
 one  of  those  quotes  that  says  to  do  the 
 opposite  of  the  majority
[01:15] if  you  follow  the  diet  of  the  majority 
 which  is  not  thinking  about  diets  not 
 watching 
 diet  educational  videos  you  will  get  the
[01:21] result  of  the  majority 
 so  congratulations  you're  already  one 
 step  ahead  of  everyone  else
[01:26] let's  begin  with  the  biggest  problem  in 
 the  world  right  now  the  pandemic  that's 
 been  going  around  for  a  while  i'm  not
[01:32] talking  about  covid  it's  that's  a  very 
 very  small  pandemic  compared  to 
 the  obesity  pandemic  learning  about  the
[01:38] obesity  pandemic  is 
 so  important  even  if  you  are  not  obese 
 because
[01:43] lose  your  ego  a  little  bit  chances  are 
 you  will  become  overweight  or  obese  in 
 your  life 
 if  you  don't  learn  this  stuff  we  have  to
[01:49] ask  ourselves  why  has  fat  gain  become  so 
 common  why  are  people 
 getting  not  just  overweight  but  obese
[01:55] now 
 the  simpletons  in  the  fitness  industry 
 will  say  oh  because  people  eat  more
[02:00] and  that's  true  but  leaving  the  argument 
 there  is  the  reason  why
[02:05] nothing  has  been  done  it's  the  reason 
 why  the  obesity  rates  keep  climbing  up 
 because  for  so  long  we  have  told  obese
[02:10] people 
 to  eat  less  and  move  more  but  that  it 
 isn't  working 
 it  is  not  working  we  have  to  like  look
[02:16] at  this  in  a  deeper  level  than  just  what 
 the  simpletons  in  the  fitness  industry 
 say 
 we  need  to  go  past  that  base  question  of
[02:23] why  they're  gaining  weight  because  we 
 know  it's  a  calorie  surplus 
 people  are  eating  too  many  calories  what
[02:28] we  have  to  ask  is  the  further  question 
 why  are  people  eating  too  many  calories
[02:33] this  question  has  not  been  asked  much 
 because  we've  all  just  left  the 
 conversation  there  that  okay
[02:38] people  are  eating  too  much  they  need  to 
 eat  less  it's  a  whole  whole  raving  thing 
 we'll  talk  about  the  fitness  industry
[02:44] but  it's  like  the  groundbreaking  thing 
 that  oh 
 to  lose  weight  all  you  have  to  do  is  eat 
 less  but  we  should  be  asking
[02:50] why  why  do  so  many  people  have  to  lose 
 weight  in  the  first  place  why  do  we  have 
 to  tell  people
[02:55] to  eat  less  that  why  are  people  eating 
 more  we  understand  fat  gain  obesity 
 is  from  people  eating  more  but  why  are
[03:02] they  eating  more 
 and  that  is  because  of  the  types  of  food 
 now  this  is  going  to  hurt  all  those
[03:07] minimalist  youtubers  matt  diabeta  and 
 all 
 the  fitness  people  who've  done  the 
 videos  like  oh  there's  no  such  thing  as
[03:12] bad  food  yes  there  is 
 there's  no  such  thing  as  bad  calories 
 yes  there  is  all  calories  are  the  same
[03:18] no  they're  not  that  is  such  a  simpleton 
 view  of 
 nutrition  saying  all  calories  is  the
[03:23] same  is  like  saying  all 
 money  all  currency  is  the  same  like
[03:28] no  maybe  if  you're  like  a  dumb  child  you 
 could  kind  of  believe  that  all  currency 
 is  the  same  but  once  you  get  a  little
[03:34] bit  older 
 and  your  iq  gets  into  double  digits  you 
 start  realizing  that  currency 
 is  different  it  has  different  values  it
[03:40] has  different  uses  just  like  different 
 calories  and  macronutrients 
 are  different  obesity  is  getting  more
[03:45] common  and  now  hopefully  you  understand 
 that  we  we  know 
 that  it's  because  people  are  eating  in  a 
 calorie  surplus  but  the  real  question  is
[03:52] why  is  a  calorie  surplus  why  are  people 
 eating  so  much  why  is  that  so  common
[03:57] around  the  world  and  that  is  because  of 
 the  types  of  food 
 humans  have  not  just  evolved  in  the  last
[04:03] 100  years  evolution  some  some  kind  of 
 changes  to  our  biological  process 
 takes  millions  of  years  so  we  have  to
[04:10] think  that  this  is  an 
 outside  influence  this  is  something  that 
 we  as  as  man  as
[04:15] as  humans  have  created  and  put  into  our 
 bodies  that  are  now  making  it  so  that  we 
 eat  more
[04:20] so  therefore  it  is  the  type  of  food  it 
 is  the  foods 
 that  we're  eating  that  are  causing  this
[04:26] obesity  pandemic  so  now  we  have  to  do  a 
 comparison  of  the  foods  that  we're 
 eating 
 compared  to  the  times  when  obesity  was
[04:33] uncommon  non-existent  just  over  100 
 years  ago  200  years  ago  you
[04:38] wouldn't  have  seen  obese  people 
 everywhere  maybe  there  would  have  been 
 that 
 one  random  guy  who's  200  pounds  and
[04:44] everyone  would  have  thought  he's  like  oh 
 my  god  he's  an  elephant 
 or  some  now  a  man  being  200  pounds
[04:49] is 
 average  seriously  a  man  being  200  pounds 
 is  average  the  average  woman  now  weighs
[04:54] what  men  used  to  weigh 
 for  a  long  time  i  had  a  negative  view 
 towards
[04:59] overweight  and  obese  people  and  i  want 
 to  i  want  to  drill  this  in  right  now  if 
 you're  watching  this  whether  you  are 
 overweight  obese  or  if  you're  kind  of
[05:05] like  me  like  a  fit  person  obese  people 
 are  not  our  enemies 
 for  some  reason  when  we  talk  about  this
[05:10] stuff  it's  like  people  have 
 a  very  negative  view  towards  fat  people
[05:15] as  if  it's  like  an  us  verse  them 
 situation  it's  not 
 they  are  not  our  enemies  we  are  on  the
[05:21] same  team  it's  me 
 plus  the  obese  guy  versus  the  problem 
 we're  all  trying  to  just  be  healthy  and
[05:27] happy  people 
 i  am  ashamed  to  say  for  a  long  time  that 
 i  i  had  such  a  negative  view  to  fat
[05:33] people  because  i  thought  oh  you  know 
 they're  fat  and  they're  lazy  and  they're 
 causing  problems  for  the  the  maybe  the
[05:38] health  care  is 
 is  getting  worse  because  they're  a  drain 
 on  the  health  care  but  we  have  to  think 
 that  most  people  if  not  all  of  them
[05:44] do  not  want  to  be  obese  we  have  to  treat 
 obesity  overweight  fat  gain
[05:49] like  an  addiction  and  we  as  a  generation 
 of  dumbasses  of 
 people  in  the  government  system  and  the
[05:54] healthcare  system  have  failed  people 
 with  addictions  whether  it's  drugs 
 whether  it's  social  media  internet  porn
[06:00] whether  it's  food 
 we  are  horrible  to  people  with 
 addictions  we  we  see  them  as  the  enemy 
 for  some  reason
[06:05] we  have  to  strip  that  mindset  away  and 
 start  treating  these  people  with  love 
 and  actually  start
[06:10] questioning  why  would  a  normal  person 
 be  like  this  what  can  we  do  to  change
[06:16] this  person's  life  so  that  he  doesn't 
 need  that  addiction  anymore  and  the 
 answer  in  my  opinion  is  to
[06:21] increase  the  high  quality  food  intake 
 the  natural  foods  we'll  go  on  to  that
[06:26] later  i'm  going  to  tell  you  everything  i 
 know  about  natural  foods  about 
 unprocessed  foods 
 the  obesity  pandemic  is  caused  because
[06:32] we  are  eating  a  lot 
 less  of  the  high  quality  food  the  good 
 food  you're  gonna  hear  me  say  this  a  lot
[06:38] and  it's  probably  gonna  trigger  some 
 people  but  there  is  good  and  bad  food 
 but  this  isn't  a  safe  space  so  if  you 
 get  triggered  if  you  find  this  offensive
[06:44] then 
 it  sucks  to  be  you  if  you're  so 
 sensitive  but  this  is  true  there's  so 
 many  youtubers  i  see  who've  made  videos
[06:50] like  the  myth  of 
 the  myth  of  bad  food  there's  no  such 
 thing  as  bad  food  yes  there  is 
 ice  cream  is  bad  for  you  sugar  is  bad
[06:57] for  you  alcohol  is  bad  for  you  junk  food 
 heavily  processed  food  mcdonald's  is  bad 
 for  you
[07:02] there  is  food  that  is  good  for  you  this 
 fact  that  i'm  telling  you  right  now  it's 
 not  an  opinion  this  is  a  fact  that  i'm 
 telling  you  there  is  bad  in  good  foods
[07:08] it's  quite  insensitive  i'm  not  taking 
 anyone's  feelings 
 into  consideration  when  i  say  this  and
[07:14] so  straight  away  if  i  start  saying  okay 
 mcdonald's  is  bad  for  you 
 someone  who's  just  ate  mcdonald's  would
[07:19] would  feel  offended  by  that  i'm  hoping 
 that  you  can 
 agree  with  me  that  there  is  bad  and  good 
 foods  and  you  now  it  should  become  clear
[07:25] that 
 the  reason  why  there's  an  obesity 
 pandemic  is  because  we're  choosing  the 
 bad  foods
[07:30] so  to  cure  the  bcc  pandemic  even  though 
 it's  not  this  simple  but  to  cure  it  we 
 just  need  to  eat
[07:35] more  good  foods  i'm  not  even  saying  to 
 eat  less  bad  foods 
 the  reason  why  we're  eating  bad  foods  is
[07:40] because  we're  eating 
 less  good  foods  a  successful  diet  is  all 
 about  adding  things  in  not  taking  things
[07:46] out  when  we  take  things  away  from  a 
 human  who's  addicted  to  them 
 it  makes  it  worse  it  makes  him  obsessed
[07:51] with  that  substance  that  we  took  away  so 
 to  cure  the  obesity  pandemic  we  need  to 
 feed  people
[07:56] good  quality  food  when  you  fill  up  on 
 good  quality  food  you  are  so 
 full  and  satiated  that  the  smallest
[08:02] amount  of  chocolate  is  actually  a 
 reasonable  treat  my 
 my  treat  right  now  is  a  piece  of  dark
[08:07] chocolate  i  was  a  chronic  binge  eater 
 my  treat  is  a  piece  of  dark  chocolate 
 and  that  satisfies  me  because
[08:13] i  am  quite  sickly  full  throughout  my  day 
 of 
 the  foods  that  i  eat  in  a  good  way  so
[08:18] now  this  new  section  is  going  to  seem 
 like  common  sense  up  until  it  doesn't  so 
 don't  click  away 
 if  i  was  watching  this  personally  i
[08:23] would  think  what  an  idiot  we  don't  need 
 to  be 
 asked  this  question  but  i'm  gonna  ask 
 you  the  question  hopefully  you  can
[08:28] answer  it 
 is  fat  unhealthy  now  i  would  have  said 
 yes  absolutely  100
[08:34] and  that  would  have  been  wrong  it  is  not 
 100 
 unhealthy  there's  two  types  of  body  fat
[08:40] and  one 
 is  actually  surprisingly  not  unhealthy 
 one  type  actually  does  not  lead  to
[08:46] metabolic  syndrome  and  this  is  like  we 
 have  to  we  have  to  reframe  your  mind 
 how  is  fat  unhealthy  let's  ask  that
[08:52] question  how  is 
 fat  unhealthy  we  understand  okay  obese 
 people  are  unhealthy
[08:57] they're  sick  but  how  exactly  what  what 
 happens  is  it  like 
 the  fat  in  your  body  does  something  what
[09:03] exactly  happens 
 there's  two  things  now  having  a  large 
 amount  of  weight 
 can  be  unhealthy  in  the  sense  that  it
[09:08] can  you  know  it  can  weigh  you  down  it 
 can  ruin  your  posture 
 lack  of  exercise  because  you're  heavier
[09:13] but  that  is  quite 
 minuscule  compared  to  the  metabolic
[09:18] syndrome  metabolic  syndrome 
 is  the  reason  why  fat  is  so  unhealthy 
 but  metabolic  syndrome
[09:24] is  not  exactly  caused  by  fat  hopefully 
 you  didn't  click  away  when  i  started 
 talking  about  good  and  bad  food  you're
[09:29] gonna  learn  how  bad 
 food  gives  you  metabolic  syndrome  i  want 
 you  to  reframe  your  mind  that  fat
[09:35] is  just  a  symptom  of  eating  in  a  calorie 
 surplus  but 
 fat  does  not  equal  sickness  it  does  not
[09:42] equal  metabolic  syndrome  it  does  not 
 equal  diabetes 
 and  cardiovascular  disease  although  it
[09:48] is  heavily  correlated  this  is  where  it 
 gets  a  bit  of  like  mind  boggling  so 
 essentially 
 since  it's  heavily  correlated  we  may  as
[09:53] well  say  that  you  know  it's  caused  but 
 it  is  not  cause  and  effect  is  very  very
[09:58] different  metabolic  syndrome  is  like 
 diabetes  heart  disease  stroke  blood 
 pressure  it's  like  the  things  we
[10:03] correlate  with 
 fat  gain  so  we  think  that  metabolic 
 syndrome  is  caused  by 
 fat  gain  this  is  where  it  gets
[10:09] interesting  hopefully  i've  explained  it 
 in  a  way  that  you  can  understand  because 
 this  is  where 
 if  we  start  getting  to  like  the
[10:14] conspiracy  theories  and  we  start 
 thinking  that  everything  we  know  about 
 fat 
 is  actually  kind  of  wrong  metabolic
[10:20] syndrome  is  not 
 caused  by  fat  gain  about  20  percent  of 
 obese  people  are  actually  relatively
[10:26] healthy 
 because  they  don't  have  metabolic 
 syndrome  and  then  we've  got  to  think 
 okay 
 so  maybe  fat  gain  fat  in  your  body  does
[10:34] not  cause  metabolic  syndrome 
 so  what  does  and  now  we  can  start  to 
 disassociate  and
[10:39] this  sounds  weird  this  is  really  crazy  i 
 never  thought  i'd  be  one  of  those  like 
 um  healthy  every  size  fat  positive
[10:45] people  but  after  doing  so  much  research 
 they  they  are  wrong  that  fat  positive 
 thing  they  are  all  wrong  but
[10:51] fat  is  actually  not  unhealthy  by  itself
[10:56] not  very  unhealthy  like  the  the  effect 
 it  has  you  know  on  your  spine  and  you 
 weigh
[11:01] more  so  you  exercise  less  it's  still 
 quite  significant  but  it's  not  that 
 bad  the  the  huge  problem  the  health
[11:06] problem  that  comes  which  we  thought 
 was  due  to  fat  gain  it  it  comes  from
[11:11] something  else  we've  got  to  ask 
 what  is  causing  metabolic  syndrome 
 because  for  so  long  we've  essentially
[11:16] thought  metabolic  syndrome 
 was  just  caused  by  fat  it  was  caused  by 
 obesity  but  now  we  can  see  that
[11:21] metabolic  syndrome  diabetes  heart 
 disease  stroke 
 is  just  one  symptom  obesity  is  another
[11:26] symptom 
 so  what  are  these  symptoms  of  now  we 
 could  say  calorie  surplus
[11:31] maybe  that's  true  but  then  why  are  some 
 people  who  have  ate  at  a  huge  calorie 
 surplus
[11:36] still  healthy  it's  the  type  of  food  and 
 i'm  gonna  sound  like  a  conspiracy
[11:41] theorist  but  it  is  sugar 
 look  at  these  two  pictures
[11:46] which  one  is  unhealthy  the  one  at  the 
 top  has  got  significantly  more  fat  so
[11:51] he  is  unhealthy  no  i'm  lying  the  one  at 
 the  bottom  is  the  one  who  is  sick
[11:56] the  one  at  the  top  could  actually  be  a 
 relatively  healthy  person  but  the  one  in 
 the  bottom 
 could  die  within  the  next  year  he's  got
[12:03] visceral  fat 
 see  how  his  fat  isn't  on  the  outside 
 it's  on  the  inside  of  his  body 
 that's  the  fat  that  goes  around  our
[12:09] organs  that's  the  dangerous  types  of  fat 
 and  so  now  we're  actually  getting  so 
 deep  where  there's  actually  different
[12:15] types  of  fats 
 and  so  really  this  all  boils  down  to 
 what  is  causing 
 visceral  fat  which  is  the  dangerous  fats
[12:22] and 
 the  the  all-round  general  body  fat 
 we've  actually  got  to  start  to  think
[12:27] that  that  might  not  be 
 unhealthy  for  us  it's  not  ideal  i'd  say 
 the  most  healthiest  thing  is  to  be  about
[12:33] 15 
 body  fat  relatively  strong  and  muscular 
 but 
 it's  not  too  bad  visceral  fat  belly  fat
[12:39] is  the  dangerous  part  i  really  hope  i've 
 explained  this  in  a  way 
 that  you  could  understand  the  question
[12:44] then  is  what  is  causing 
 visceral  fat  visceral  fat  is  the  problem 
 that  is
[12:49] what  we  should  be  concentrating  on  when 
 we  think  about  diet  that  is  what  we 
 should  be  just  thinking  about  in  general
[12:54] to  cure  the  obesity  pandemic  it's  not 
 just  to  eat  less 
 because  eat  less  would  help  the  top  guy
[13:00] it  would  help  the  guy 
 whose  fat  is  just  body  fat  but  we're 
 learning  that  about  20  of  people  are 
 that  top  picture  where  they've  just  got
[13:06] body  fat 
 but  the  types  of  food  they're  eating 
 aren't  giving  them  much 
 visceral  fat  so  they're  relatively
[13:11] healthy  so  honestly  we  don't  really  need 
 to  help  them 
 aesthetically  you  know  they  could  look
[13:16] nicer  they  could  look  more  muscular  and 
 that's  why  they  get  a  personal  trainer 
 but  in  terms  of  health  care  they  don't
[13:22] need  our  help 
 it's  the  bottom  picture  and  these  people 
 this  is  what's  really  surprising
[13:27] this  is  how  skinny  people  get  diabetes 
 we  have  never  seen  this  before
[13:32] i  hope  that  all  the  neurons  in  your 
 brain  are  starting  to  click  and  you're 
 slightly  thinking  wait 
 that's  true  there's  a  phenomenon  of
[13:37] skinny  people  getting  metabolic  syndrome 
 and  we've  thought  the  metabolic  syndrome
[13:42] was  caused  by  fat  gain 
 but  it's  not  it's  caused  by  the  types  of 
 food  we  eat  and  this  is  so  important
[13:47] because 
 now  i  am  adamant  to  say  that  this 
 sickness  that  comes  with  metabolic
[13:53] syndrome  is  not  caused  by  a  calorie 
 surplus  it's  not  caused 
 by  eating  too  much  the  biggest  strain  in
[13:59] our  healthcare  system  the  biggest  reason 
 why  the  obesity  pandemic 
 is  such  a  huge  problem  is  because  of
[14:05] the  type  of  food  that  we  eat  is  causing 
 visceral  fat 
 visceral  fat  is  the  problem  and
[14:11] skinny  people  can  get  this  it's  your 
 diet  it's  not  just  how  much  you  eat
[14:16] and  it's  not  just  the  size  of  you  the 
 weight  of  you  people  with  normal  weight 
 normal  sizes  are  getting  metabolic
[14:21] syndrome  visceral  fat 
 is  causing  metabolic  syndrome  not  just
[14:26] fat  gain  not  just  obesity  obesity  just 
 visually  looking  at  someone  who's  300
[14:32] pounds  is  barely  even  a  problem  let's 
 say  a  250  pound  guy 
 it's  just  harder  for  him  to  exercise  if
[14:38] he  got  to  that  weight  by 
 over  eating  relatively  healthy  foods  but 
 no  one  gets  to  that  weight  by
[14:44] eating  relatively  healthy  food  that's 
 why  such  a  small  number  of  people 
 are  overweight  and  healthy  but  also  most
[14:50] people  who  are  at  normal  weight  at 
 underweight 
 are  also  sick  with  metabolic  syndrome
[14:55] because  it's  the  types  of  food  that 
 we're  all  consuming 
 because  we  all  fell  for  the  biggest  scam
[15:00] this  dumb  little  triangle  this  is  gonna 
 start  to  sound  like  a  conspiracy  theory 
 hopefully  you're  still  following  along
[15:05] and  everything  i'm  saying  is  making 
 sense 
 i'm  not  gonna  explain  much  exactly  why 
 this  dumb  little  triangle  this  pyramid
[15:11] is  the  biggest  scam  humanity  fell  for 
 the  the  tldr 
 of  it  by  putting  carbs  is  our  biggest
[15:16] intake  and  reducing  fat 
 means  that  we  are  inherently  going  to  be 
 eating  more  sugar  even  though
[15:22] the  sugar  is  the  you  know  the  top  of  the 
 pyramid  the  smallest  thing  that  we 
 should  be  having  is  a  treat 
 that  is  impossible  if  fat  is  reduced
[15:30] anything  you've  ever  seen  in  the  shop 
 that  says  low  fat  reduced  fat 
 would  taste  like  absolute  garbage  it
[15:37] would  probably  make  you  throw  up 
 but  the  reason  why  it  doesn't  is  because 
 anything  that  says  low  fat  reduced  fat
[15:44] actually  means  increased  sugar  go  ahead 
 and  look  at  anything  you  can  go  and  find 
 go  and  look  at  any  cereal  any  cheese  any
[15:50] any 
 cream  any  yogurt  anything  you  want  go 
 and  look  at  it  if  it  says  reduce  fat  go
[15:55] and  check  how  much  sugar  it  has 
 and  you'll  be  disgusted  fat  is  taste 
 imagine  a  carb  that  has  no  fat  so  just
[16:01] plain  rice 
 plain  bread  no  butter  tastes  disgusting
[16:06] food  only  tastes  good  when  you  put  fat 
 onto  it  so  when  we  take  the  fat  out  of 
 this  stuff
[16:11] it  tastes  like  but  it's  now  got 
 reduced  calories  where  everyone's  so 
 happy  is  that  hey
[16:16] we're  eating  less  calories  we're  not 
 gonna  get  obese  but  now  it  tastes  like 
  so  what's  the
[16:21] cheapest  substance  that  they  can  add 
 into  it  to  one  make  it  taste  good  but 
 hopefully
[16:26] to  make  you  an  addict  and  make  you  buy 
 it  again 
 sugar  sugar  is  the  reason  why
[16:32] people  are  dying  sugar  is  the  cause  of 
 visceral  fat 
 sugar  in  our  alcohol  alcohol  is  actually
[16:38] a  massive  one  but  that's  got  so  many 
 health  problems  to  it  that  it's  not  just 
 limited  to  visceral  fat  i'm  going  to
[16:44] talk  about  hormones  and  this 
 in  case  i'm  watching  this  younger  me  18 
 year  old  me
[16:49] any  time  that  i'd  watch  videos  like  this 
 and  they  started  talking  about  insulin 
 and  ghrelin  and  leptin  and  all  these
[16:54] hormones  and  brain  signaling 
 it  would  fry  my  brain  and  i'd  just  click 
 off  and  i'd  just  be  thinking  okay  just
[16:59] just  tell  me 
 the  calories  tell  me  what  foods  i  should 
 be  eating  please  trust  me  that  i  wasted 
 years  of  my  life
[17:04] and  i  kept  on  binge  eating  for  so  long 
 up  until  i  understood  about  hormones  so
[17:09] i'll  try  to  explain  this  as  simple  as  i 
 can 
 this  is  the  most  important  part  even 
 with  sugar  we  need  to  understand
[17:15] why  we're  over  eating  it  and  it's  all 
 down  to  our  hormones  literally 
 everything  about  diet  is  down  to  our
[17:21] hormones  because  it's  our  hormones  that 
 makes  us  feel  hungry  it's  our  hormones 
 that  makes  us  want  to  eat  more
[17:26] it's  our  hormones  that  signals  that 
 we're  tired  and  we  can't  exercise 
 my  hormones  on  the  other  hand  signal  to
[17:31] me  that  i  can  exercise  for  three  hours 
 and  enjoy  it  my  hormones  make  me  crave 
 healthy  food
[17:36] i  can't  believe  i  get  to  say  that  my 
 hormones  genuinely  now 
 signal  to  me  to  crave  healthy  food  and
[17:42] signal  to  me  to  go  and  exercise  for  at 
 least  two  to  three  hours  a  day 
 sounds  crazy  i'm  hopefully  going  to  get
[17:48] you  there  i'm  just  saying  this  so  much 
 to  my  younger  self  that  18  20  year  old 
 me  who  would  have  heard  about  insulin 
 and  be  like
[17:53] oh  i  don't  need  to  know  any  of  this  just 
 just  tell  me  what  protein  to  eat 
 don't  be  like  me  listen  to  this  there's
[17:59] three  major  hormones  that  we  need  to 
 know  about  in  terms  of  diets 
 leptin  insulin  ghrelin  let's  start  with
[18:04] leptin  leptin 
 signals  to  our  brain  that  we're  full  and 
 it  actually  signals  to  our  brain  that
[18:09] we've  got  some  energy  to  expend  because 
 we've  just  ate 
 so  we  want  a  good  level  of  leptin  people
[18:14] who've  got  a  healthy  level  of  leptin 
 stop  eating  as  soon  as  they  feel  full 
 they  stop  eating
[18:20] how  crazy  is  that  even  maybe  before  they 
 feel  you  know  sickly  full 
 they  stop  eating  because  they've  gotten 
 that  signal  that  okay  i've  had  enough
[18:26] these  people  are  also  the  people 
 who  can  exercise  for  hours  so  hello  me
[18:31] insulin  is  what  spikes  after  we  eat 
 carbs  especially  sugar 
 insulin  stops  the  leptin  signal
[18:38] how  mad  is  that  insulin  when  we  have 
 carbs  especially  sugar 
 that  stops  that  either  reduces  or  stops
[18:45] the  signaling  from  leptin 
 so  when  our  insulin  goes  up  we  don't  get 
 the  signal  that  we  are  full  when  our
[18:51] insulin  goes  up  we  don't  get  the  signal 
 that  we  are 
 energized  and  we  have  enough  strength  to
[18:57] go  and  exercise 
 so  in  a  practical  sense  eating  carbs 
 especially  sugar 
 tells  our  brain  that  we  need  to  eat  more
[19:04] and  that  we  don't  have 
 energy  which  is  so  weird  because  carbs 
 are  supposed  to  give  us  energy  but
[19:09] that's  like 
 in  the  long  run  there's  a  reason  why  so 
 many  people  after  they  eat  any  kind  of 
 carb
[19:14] they  get  a  dip  in  energy  where  they  just 
 want  to  lay  down  for  a  certain  amount  of 
 time  and  then 
 a  few  hours  later  they  get  like  the
[19:20] boost  of  energy  that  dip  is  your  leptin 
 signal  not  being  heard  by  your  brain 
 because  insulin  is  stopping  it  so  really
[19:25] what  we  want  is  to  reduce  how  much 
 insulin  is  produced  in  our  body 
 insulin's  first  job  is  to  give  our  cells
[19:31] some  energy  so  this  is  why  carbs  give 
 energy  but 
 insulin's  second  job  is  to  store  fat
[19:38] once  we  don't  need  any  more  energy  what 
 else  is  it  going  to  go  into 
 insulin  then  produces  fat  this  we'll
[19:43] talk  about  this  more  later  but  this  is 
 why  the  fitness  industry  is  all  wrong 
 they're  all  just  simpletons
[19:48] who  have  just  not  looked  into  like  a 
 level 
 science  to  realize  this  stuff  that  what
[19:54] you  eat 
 truly  changes  like  if  we  just  talk  about 
 calories  macronutrients 
 we're  not  talking  about  insulin  and  now
[20:00] don't  you  see  that  the  insulin  is  what 
 causes  fat  gain 
 so  imagine  if  we  had  days  where  we
[20:05] didn't  have  much 
 insulin  at  all  we  didn't  have  much  carbs 
 at  all  would  we  still  gain  fat
[20:11] now  you  would  be  saying  okay  on  a 
 calorie  surplus  yes 
 but  it's  debatable  and  trust  me  i  have
[20:16] 100 
 been  in  this  situation  where  no  no  it's 
 a  calorie  surplus  that's  the  only  thing 
 that  matters
[20:21] but  now  i  am  unconvinced  and  i'm  pretty 
 sure 
 i'm  on  the  other  side  now  where  i  don't
[20:27] believe  you  can  actually  gain  fat 
 if  you  reduce  sugar  if  we  overeat  carbs
[20:32] and  if  we  overeat  sugar 
 insulin  starts  producing  fat  because 
 we've  got  an  excess  of  energy  now  we
[20:37] should  be  using  that  energy  to  go  and 
 exercise  but  insulin 
 reduces  the  leptin  signaling  for  some
[20:43] time  and  so  that  means  that  if  you 
 overeat  which  pretty  much  all  of  us 
 overeat  all  the  time  insulin  is  going  to
[20:48] start  producing  fat  which  means  that  we 
 are  producing  fats  pretty  much  every  day 
 because 
 kind  of  side  note  food  has  been  made  to
[20:55] be  over  eight 
 so  then  we  could  say  that  fat  gain  is 
 caused  by  insulin  which
[21:00] it  pretty  much  is  so  the  question  then 
 we  should  be  asking  is 
 what  actually  causes  the  highest  amount
[21:06] of  insulin  what  causes  a  small  amount 
 and  we  should  be  choosing  the 
 the  foods  that  has  the  small  amounts  of
[21:11] insulin  spike 
 this  is  what's  called  the  glycemic  load 
 it's  kind  of  like  complicated  so  i  won't 
 get  into  it  too  much  but  pretty  much  if
[21:17] you  can  just 
 trust  the  research  and  i'll  link  some 
 things  that  you  can  learn  from  as  well 
 low  quality  junk  food  has  a  high
[21:23] glycemic  load 
 and  high  glycemic  load  converts  into 
 high  insulin
[21:28] so  it's  what  you've  known  all  this  time 
 shitty  junk  food  even  stuff  that  isn't 
 high  in  sugar 
 still  has  a  high  glycemic  load  so  that
[21:35] converts  to  higher  insulin 
 so  again  there  is  bad  food  food  that 
 heavily  spikes  your  insulin
[21:41] is  bad  do  not  trust  the  youtubers  who 
 keep 
 the  cringy  videos  minor  there's  no  such
[21:46] thing  as  bad  food  it's  it's  just 
 marketable  just  so  now  hopefully  you've
[21:51] got  like  an  a  level  understanding  this 
 is  what  you  should  have  known  when  you 
 were  like  13  years  old  but  of  course
[21:56] school  didn't  teach  us  this  doctors 
 don't  even  know  this  the  the  fitness 
 industry  are  just  a  bunch  of
[22:01] photoshopping  steroid-taking 
  that  are  not  going  to  tell 
 you  the  truth 
 because  it's  not  marketable  so  hopefully
[22:07] now  you  know  that  all 
 calories  are  not  the  same  there  is  bad
[22:12] food 
 and  so  the  objective  of  any  diet  plan 
 should  be  one  that  gets  you  to 
 reduce  the  bad  food  but  heavily  focuses
[22:19] on  increasing  the  good  food 
 the  food  that's  got  a  low  glycemic  index 
 the  food  that  doesn't  heavily  spike  your
[22:25] insulin 
 the  food  that  doesn't  mess  up  your 
 leptin  signaling  which  means  that  when 
 you  eat  it
[22:30] you  start  to  feel  really  full  and 
 satiated  the  final  hormone  that  we  have 
 to  talk  about  is  guerrilla  and  put
[22:35] simply  ghrelin  is  just 
 your  hunger  hormone  when  you  feel  hungry 
 that's  because  ghrelin  has  been  released
[22:40] to  signal  that  you  should  eat 
 ghrelin  is  just  a  hormone  it's  just  a 
 feeling  you  don't 
 the  psychological  mindset  is  that  you
[22:46] don't  actually  have  to 
 listen  to  it  so  it's  interesting  to  know 
 that  our  hunger  feeling
[22:51] is  just  a  hormone  and  now  if  we  can 
 understand  what  ghrelin  is  like 
 we  can  understand  hunger  the  very
[22:57] important  part  of  obesity  or  fat  gain 
 is  why  are  people  who  are  fat  why  are 
 people  who  overeat
[23:02] still  hungry  that's  a  very  important 
 question  it's  because  of  ghrelin  brellin 
 doesn't  really  care  if  you've
[23:08] ate  much  ghrelin  increases  at  the  time 
 that  you  normally  eat 
 but  what's  really  surprising  which  most
[23:13] people  haven't  put  together 
 is  that  if  you  don't  eat  your  ghrelin 
 goes  down  think  about  that  time  that  you
[23:18] were  like  really  really  busy 
 that  one  time  you  didn't  eat  for like 
 you  know  eight  hours  were  you  literally
[23:23] starving  at  the  end  that  you 
 you  were  like  about  to  die  now  you  got 
 the  you  got  the  feeling
[23:28] of  gret  and  you  got  the  feeling  of 
 hunger  and  you  started  feeling  quite 
 hungry 
 but  after  about  an  hour  the  hunger  went
[23:33] down  this  graph 
 shows  exactly  what  ghrelin  is  like  it 
 just  spikes  when  you  normally  eat  food
[23:39] so  you  can  see  that  these  spikes  are  at 
 breakfast  lunch  and  dinner  but  the 
 amount  of  ghrelin  our  body  produces  just
[23:44] goes  down 
 after  the  time  that  we  stop  eating  so 
 ghrelin  just  kind  of  likes  consistency 
 it  just  wants  us  to  eat  at  the  same  time
[23:50] every  day  kind  of  gives  us 
 a  reminder  to  feel  hungry  at  the  same 
 time  to  just  signal  like  oh  yeah
[23:55] like  this  is  when  you  normally  eat  to  go 
 and  eat  but  we  don't  have  to  listen  to 
 it  and  you  can  see  that  ghrelin  goes
[24:00] down  so  that  explains  why  people  who 
 overeat  still  feel  hungry  because 
 ghrelin  just  kicks  in
[24:05] when  we  normally  eat  and  it  also 
 explains  why  people  who  do  fasting
[24:10] people  who  fast  for  days  at  a  time 
 actually  don't  feel  like 
 disgustingly  starving  by  the  end  of  it
[24:15] because  ghrelin  goes  up 
 and  it  goes  down  we  kind  of  believe  that 
 our  hunger  would  go
[24:21] up  in  a  linear  correlation  with  how  long 
 it's  been  since  we  ate  but  that's  not 
 true
[24:26] the  ghrelin  the  hunger  just  goes  up  and 
 down  in  waves  so  that  was  a  lot  to  take 
 in 
 you've  just  had  your  entire  knowledge
[24:33] of  diet  of  nutrition  completely  changed 
 hopefully 
 and  now  we're  going  to  talk  more  about
[24:40] on  a  societal 
 level  the  issues  with  diets  and  the 
 first  one  that  i've  got  a  bone  to  pick
[24:45] with  is  the  fitness  industry  because 
 these 
 contributed  to  my  binge  eating  disorder
[24:50] what  is  the  purpose  of  any  content 
 online  what  what  do  the  news  wants  when 
 they  when  they  post  really  scary  stuff
[24:56] about  like 
 the  deaths  of  kovid  and  you  know  like 
 click  bait  and 
 what  do  they  want  they  want  views  they
[25:01] want  attention  so  bigger  things 
 things  that  are  quite  unconventional  get 
 more  views  so  fitness  people  with  abs
[25:07] who  are  doing  10  000  calorie  challenges 
 and  who  are  saying  you  can  eat  anything 
 you  want  there's  no  such  thing  as  bad
[25:12] food 
 that's  marketable  that's  so  interesting 
 that  i'm  gonna  click  on  it  even  though  i 
 know  it's  not  true  you're  gonna  click  on
[25:17] it  you've  watched 
 at  least  a  hundred  videos  of  some 
 fitness  guy  with  abs 
 who  who  says  that  he  eats  cocoa  pops  and
[25:23] stuff  and  he  does 
 and  that's  the  skit  and  that's  the  this 
 is  the  mind-boggling  thing  that  we  have 
 to  wrap  our  heads  around
[25:29] i  have  been  in  a  fantastic  shape  whilst 
 binge  eating 
 multiple  days  in  a  row  like  multiple
[25:35] months  in  a  row 
 how  the  most  common  diet  in  the  fitness 
 industry  is  if  it  fits  your  macros  my
[25:41] fitness  palace  made  this  very  convenient 
 you  set  your  number  of  macros  and  then 
 you  aim  to  hit  that  goal  with  pretty
[25:47] much 
 anything  you  want  that  makes  it  so  cool 
 wait  so  if  i  go  to  the  gym 
 and  i  track  what  i  eat  i  can  eat
[25:54] anything  i  want  so  you're  telling  me 
 i've  got  80  grams  of  carbs  and  i  can  eat 
 a  donut
[25:59] and  they'll  be  like  yeah  and  you'll  eat 
 it  and  you  will  actually  lose  weight  and 
 you'll  be  like  oh  my  god
[26:04] that  is  mad  calories  don't  matter  all 
 calories  are  the  same 
 just  eat  less  and  idiots  like  me  have
[26:11] preached  this  for  so  long 
 without  having  the  basic  level  of 
 education  to  know  that
[26:16] it  is  not  healthy  i  can't  believe  that 
 it's  so  common  sense  that  it  took  me 
 years  to  realize  that
[26:21] eating  junk  food  is  not  healthy  even 
 though  the  junk  food  can  reduce
[26:26] that  body  fat  if  you  just  eat  less 
 remember  we  said  that  there's  two  types 
 of  fat  the  fitness  industry  only  care
[26:32] about  that 
 visible  body  fat  because  it's  full  of 
 narcissistic  vain  people  like  myself  who
[26:37] only  care  about 
 appearance  it  is  mad  it  is  crazy  that 
 the  fitness  industry 
 is  full  of  some  of  the  most  unhealthy
[26:43] people  do  not  trust  these  people  what's 
 happening  in  the  fitness  industry 
 since  they  only  care  about  appearance
[26:48] they  only  focus  on  reducing  the  first 
 level  of  fat 
 but  in  order  to  do  that  in  a  marketable
[26:53] way  which  is  hey  guys  you  can  eat 
 anything  you  want  just  track  your  macros 
 and  eat  less  calories
[26:58] it's  causing  the  visceral  fat  mark  my 
 words  in  20  years  time  most  of  these 
 people  that  you're  seeing  on  the  biggest
[27:03] fitness  pages 
 they're  all  going  to  have  diabetes  and  a 
 lot  of  them  are  gonna  die  from  stroke 
 and  heart  disease  i  know  it  sounds  like
[27:08] disgusting  for  me  to  say  that 
 i  don't  wish  it  on  anyone  but  i  believe 
 it's  true  i  believe  it's  gonna  be  a  very
[27:14] scary  moment  in  about  20  years  time  when 
 the  biggest  people  of  the  fitness 
 industry  start
[27:19] dropping  like  flies  because  of  the 
 visceral  fat  that  they're  gaining  from 
 this  if  it  fits  your  macros
[27:24] why  clean  eating  is  bad  for  you  lost 
 respect  for  geoff  nippardman  when  i 
 mentioned  diet  in  a  previous  video  one
[27:30] guy  commented  and  he  said 
 i  see  what  you  mean  it's  not  healthy  to 
 eat  this  stuff  but
[27:35] technically  if  you  only  care  about  what 
 you  look  like  you'd  look  the  same  you'd 
 have  the  same  body  composition  if  you
[27:40] ate  junk  food  compared  to 
 healthy  food  and  that  is  what  the 
 fitness  industry
[27:45] has  preached  that  we're  only  caring 
 about  appearance  so  if  you  eat  junk  food 
 you  get  to  enjoy  the  junk  food  and
[27:51] you  get  to  look  good  and  that  is  not 
 true  you  might  get  to  look 
 good  and  you  might  get  to  still  make
[27:56] progress  eating  the  junk  food  but  your 
 body  composition  what  you  look  like 
 if  we're  only  caring  about  appearance  by
[28:02] the  way  is  not  going  to  be  as  good 
 as  if  you  ate  clean  healthy  foods 
 because  the  way  that  i'll  have  the
[28:08] comment 
 of  me  in  this  guy  the  way  that  i 
 explained  it  to  him  was  that  when  you 
 eat  the  healthy  food  you're  just  better
[28:14] fueled  for  the  workout  and  when  you're 
 better 
 fueled  for  the  workout  you  just  have  a 
 better  body  composition  you're  going  to
[28:19] make  more  muscle 
 in  the  leg  session  in  which  you  had 
 chicken  or  rice  beforehand  compared  to 
 be  in
[28:24] cocoa  pops  and  that's  just  on  a  base 
 level  if  we're  just  talking  about  how  it 
 fuels  your  workout  the  leptin  is
[28:29] actually  very  important  in  this  because 
 the  low  quality  junk  food 
 since  it  blocks  the  leptin  signal  it 
 actually  means  one  you're  gonna  eat  more
[28:35] which  means  that  you're  more  prone  to 
 binge  eating  so 
 you  just  look  anyway  and  to  your
[28:40] brain  not  getting  the  leptin  signal 
 means  that  you're  gonna  feel  more  tired 
 and  exercise  less  with  less  intensity
[28:46] so  the  junk  food  is  going  to  lead  to 
 exercising  less 
 so  that  if  it  fits  your  macros  it's
[28:51] completely  it's  just  it  should  have 
 never  even  been  something  that  we  all 
 preach  then 
 idiots  like  me  which  i'm  so  ashamed  of
[28:58] preached  it  for  so  long 
 after  being  like  so  into  the  fitness 
 industry  i've  concluded  that
[29:03] it's  riddled  with  mental  health  problems 
 it's  riddled  with  binge  eating  disorders 
 it's  riddled  with  anxiety  with
[29:08] depression  with  low  self-esteem  just 
 don't  trust  them 
 there's  a  reason  why  each  and  every  one
[29:13] of  these  fitness  enthusiasts 
 are  doing  binge  eating  challenges 
 because  they've  got  an  eating  disorder
[29:18] and  they  think  oh  as  long  as  i  record  it 
 and  i  look  pretty  whilst  eating  i'll  get 
 some  views 
 don't  trust  them  so  let's  move  on  what
[29:24] is  a  healthy  diet  what  should  you  eat 
 now  again  even  though  i've  said  there's
[29:29] so  much  bad  food 
 my  advice  in  terms  of  the  diet  is  not  to 
 reduce  the  bad  food  because  if  that  is
[29:34] your  mindset 
 that  actually  gets  quite  depressing  you 
 wake  up  with  like  a  sense  of  anxiety
[29:39] like  you've  got  craving  for  mcdonald's 
 for  chocolate  for  crisps 
 and  you  think  oh  no  no  hamsa  the
[29:45] youtuber  said  not  to  eat  it  and  then 
 you've  got  to  think  like  oh  but 
 i  don't  want  any  damn  vegetables  it's
[29:51] not  a  good  way  to  live 
 instead  my  advice  has  always  been  to 
 have  the  positive  approach  to  eat
[29:56] more  good  food  to  eat  more  healthy  food 
 the  unprocessed  food  what  is
[30:01] unprocessed  food  i  used  to  watch  these 
 videos  years  ago 
 and  when  they  say  unprocessed  i  never
[30:06] really  put  two  and  two  together 
 so  the  way  that  i  like  to  think  about  it 
 now  which
[30:11] it  maybe  seems  a  little  bit  overboard 
 but  when  you  try  it 
 you'll  see  that  it's  like  a  fail-proof
[30:17] system  as  long  as  you 
 keep  using  the  system  before  you  eat 
 anything 
 look  at  the  ingredient  list  usually  in
[30:23] unprocessed  food 
 there  is  no  ingredient  list  because  the 
 food  is  the  ingredient
[30:28] the  ingredients  in  potato  is  potato  the 
 ingredients  in
[30:33] broccoli  is  broccoli  you  see  how  they 
 are  literally  like 
 one  base  ingredients  and  then  go  and
[30:39] look  at  something  that's  processed  here 
 is 
 a  picture  of  a  mcdonald's  wrap  so
[30:45] there's  a  lot  of  ingredients  right  so  my 
 so  my  little  system  that  i  do 
 which  i  try  to  stick  to  but  even  i  do
[30:51] you  know  fail  it  i  don't  follow  it 
 sometimes  is 
 always  look  at  the  ingredients  and  if 
 there  is  one  thing  on  the  ingredients
[30:57] list  that  you  don't  know 
 that  you  literally  cannot  like  identify 
 it  right  now  what  this  is  what  it  looks
[31:02] like  what  you  know  where  it  came  from 
 google  it  look  at  the  ingredients  list 
 and  just  google  the  things  that  you 
 don't  know
[31:07] and  you'll  find  that  how  long  it  takes 
 you  to  do  that  with  something  like 
 mcdonald's
[31:12] is  not  even  worth  it  and  so  this  is  how 
 you  pick  the  unprocessed  foods  it's  just 
 to  think  about  the  foods 
 that  are  like  the  base  natural
[31:19] ingredients  and  just  have  them 
 and  do  not  fall  for  the  the  american
[31:24] view  that  are  this  but  this  food  is  it's 
 hard  to  prepare  it's  not  quick  easy  and 
 cheap  and  it  doesn't  taste  nice
[31:30] one  nutrition  your  diet  should  not  be 
 quick  easy  and  cheap  i  can't  believe
[31:35] those  words 
 have  have  to  be  said  your  nutrition  is 
 something  to  invest  in 
 if  you  are  one  of  those  people  who  wants
[31:41] your  diet  to  be  quick  easy  and  cheap 
 that's  disgusting  your  nutrition  should 
 be  somewhat  of  a  slow  process  that  you
[31:48] put 
 a  lot  of  intention  into  it  should  be  not 
 expensive  but  it  should  be  not  expensive 
 it  should  be  kind  of  frugal  but  it
[31:54] should  be 
 high  quality  and  it  should  not  be  just 
 easy
[31:59] it  could  if  that's  like  a  positive  of 
 some  kind  of  healthy  food  yes 
 but  most  healthy  food  is  not  quick  easy
[32:05] and  cheap  and  that's  okay 
 this  is  something  to  invest  in  to  invest 
 some  time  some  effort  some  money  into
[32:10] better  nutrition  and  that  is 
 one  of  the  best  investments  you'll  ever 
 make  in  your  life  and  then  the  taste
[32:15] factor  we've  been  conditioned  from 
 childhood  to  think  that  vegetables 
 aren't  tasty 
 they  are  it's  just  that  your  parents
[32:20] aren't  really  good  at  cooking  them  learn 
 how  to  cook  them  you've  got  the  internet 
 at  your  hands  you've  hopefully  learned 
 so  much  in  this  video  and  you  hopefully
[32:26] understand  that  the  internet  can  be  used 
 to  go  and  learn  things  ask  yourself  this 
 question  how  many  hours  in  the  last
[32:31] month  have  you  spent 
 actively  searching  to  find  out  how  to 
 make  healthy  food  taste  nice
[32:36] zero  100  of  the  people  watching  this 
 have  spent  zero  hours 
 actively  searching  on  how  to  make
[32:41] healthy  food  taste  nice  i've  just  called 
 you  out  but  it's  true 
 when  was  the  last  time  you  literally
[32:46] googled  how  to  make  broccoli  taste 
 better 
 you've  never  done  that  in  your  life  i've 
 never  done  that  in  my  life  i'm
[32:52] just  being  biased  but  i  have  done  that 
 with  things  like  salmon  with  sweet 
 potatoes  so  here's  my  advice
[32:57] start  with  the  ingredients  let's  say 
 sweet  potatoes  they're  quite  nice 
 then  do  a  little  google  search  watch  a
[33:02] little  youtube  video  and  go  and  look  at 
 the  one  that  looks  quite  nice 
 how  to  make  sweet  potatoes  taste  better
[33:07] how  to  make  broccoli  taste  better  how  to 
 make 
 salmon  and  sweet  corn  and  oats  taste
[33:13] better 
 all  of  these  one  based  natural 
 ingredients  can  taste  delicious 
 it's  just  that  we've  never  really  put
[33:19] time  to  make  them  delicious  the 
 information  is  at  your  fingertips 
 it  sounds  kind  of  cliche  but  lots  of
[33:24] vegetables  high  fat  low  sugar 
 high  fiber  is  the  way  to  go  the 
 mentality  to  have  with  this  healthy  diet
[33:29] is  that  it's  not  just  going  to  click 
 like  this 
 most  for  some  reason  that's  the 
 mentality  we  all  have  with  everything
[33:35] that  we  do 
 we  get  so  motivated  by  a  video  like  this 
 and  then 
 don't  have  a  100  perfect  diet  the  next
[33:42] day 
 and  we're  like  oh  i  can't  even  do  it 
 like  no  bro 
 it  takes  a  while  you  dumbass  like  stay
[33:47] to  it  have  the  mentality  that  you  want 
 to  have  a  healthy  diet  and  nutritious 
 diets  which  doesn't  mess  up  your
[33:52] hormones 
 and  start  following  that  as  best  as  you 
 can  every  day  it's  not  we're  not  doing
[33:57] like  a  binary  thinking  of  zero  to  one 
 like  oh  if  you  ate  something  bad  today 
 that's  it  the  whole  day's  gone  off  and
[34:02] you  failed  no  no  it's  like  zero  to  one 
 hundred  and  most  days 
 you're  going  to  end  up  about  50  about
[34:07] 60.  hopefully  this  video  will  help  you 
 get  to  like  60  70. 
 that's  okay  don't  think  that  you  start
[34:12] at  100  and  the  moment  you  ate  something 
 bad  you're  at  zero 
 so  the  rest  of  the  day  you  may  as  well 
 binge  eat  don't  do  that  let's  talk  about
[34:18] binge  eating  there  is  two 
 cures  to  binge  eating  which  is 
 mindfulness  and
[34:23] the  foods  that  don't  mess  up  your 
 hormones  that's  the  two  things  you  need 
 to  know 
 no  one  else  is  telling  you  this  advice
[34:29] the  advice  that  i  see  on  the  big 
 youtubers  channels  like 
 just  wait  20  minutes  if  you  want  to
[34:34] binge  eat  you  can  just  wait 
 20  minutes  the  lack  of  the  lack  of 
 education  and  knowledge  in  videos  like
[34:40] that  just  makes  me  cr  it  makes  me  hate 
 the  person  that's  making  the  video 
 because  i  just  think  like 
 you're  not  even  helping  anyone  it's  just
[34:46] that  clickbait  it  looks  so  marketable  by 
 you 
 saying  oh  you  just  wait  20  minutes  i  was
[34:51] a  chronic  binge  eater  and  it's  been  over 
 six  months  since  i've  binge  it  exactly 
 how  did  i  do  it  through  the  healthy  diet
[34:57] change 
 remember  those  hormones  again  it  is  the 
 lack  of 
 leptin  signaling  to  your  brain  that
[35:03] causes  binge  eating  remember  that  leptin 
 signals  to  our  brain  that  we're  full  and 
 that  we  can  stop  eating  and  remember
[35:08] that 
 insulin  blocks  that  leptin  signal  so  if 
 you  want  to  feel  full  and  not  just  you
[35:13] know 
 the  feeling  of  full  but  actually  you  get 
 that  like  satisfying  thing  where 
 you  actually  don't  eat  anymore  what
[35:19] we've  got  to  do  is  make  sure  that  we're 
 getting  that  leptin  signal  and  we  get 
 that  left  in  signal 
 by  not  having  a  massive  spike  in  our
[35:25] insulin  so  secure  binge  eating 
 eat  food  with  low  glycemic  load  eat  food
[35:30] that  doesn't  heavily  spike  your  insulin 
 which  means  low  sugar  and  low  amounts  of
[35:35] processed  food 
 no  one  ever  in  the  history  of  mankind 
 has  ever  binge  ate  on  oats
[35:40] yeah  maybe  if  they  put  chocolate  in  the 
 oats  then  they've  been  shaped  on  it  but 
 no  one  has  ever  binged 
 on  healthy  vegetables  because  you  you
[35:47] get  sickly  full  from  it  in  in  such  a 
 satisfying  way  because  it  doesn't  spike 
 your  insulin  much  this  is  another
[35:52] problem  of  the  fitness  industry  which 
 has  caused  so  much  binge  eating  around 
 the  world  that  promoting  this  idea
[35:57] of  you  know  there's  no  there's  no  such 
 thing  as  bad  food  all  calories  are  the 
 same  just  if  it  fits  your  macros  eat  the
[36:02] right  calories 
 the  problem  with  that  is  that  when  you 
 tell  people  that  you  can  eat  some  junk
[36:07] food 
 that  is  how  binge  eating  starts  no  one 
 actually  starts  the  day
[36:12] eating  something  healthy  like  oats  and 
 eggs  or  something  and  says  straight 
 after  the  eggs
[36:17] they  think  you  know  what  i'm  gonna  binge 
 eat  on  these  eggs  mommy  make  me  20  more 
 eggs  no  one  does  that
[36:22] it's  you  started  the  day  pretty  nicely 
 and  then  you  had  the  first  sweet 
 thing  or  you  had  the  first  processed
[36:28] junk  food  and  then  you  binge  ate  so  the 
 cure  to  this  binge  eating 
 firstly  is  to  just  not  really  have  those
[36:34] foods  have  them 
 every  now  and  then  and  even  then  you'll 
 find  that  really 
 ever  having  food  that  is  low  quality
[36:40] ever  having  food  that's  high  in  sugar 
 will  have  a  risk  of  binge  eating  if  you 
 never  eat  that  food  which  i  know  sounds
[36:46] really  serious  but  if  you  pretty  much 
 never  eat  that  food 
 you  will  never  binge  eat  again  and 
 you'll  be  happier  healthier  and  you'll
[36:52] actually  feel  full  all  the  time  instead 
 of  that  sickly  feeling  where 
 you  don't  feel  full  but  you  do  feel  full
[36:57] and  you  feel  like  and  you've  just 
 ate  a  week's  worth  of  calories  i've  done 
 a  video  a  while  ago  on  how  mindfulness
[37:03] cures  binge  eating  i  think  mindfulness 
 is 
 the  most  effective  cure  for  any 
 addiction  most  addictions  we  indulge  in
[37:10] mindlessly  we  aren't  thinking  straight 
 when  we  start  overeating  and  stuff 
 having  increased  levels  of  mindfulness
[37:15] through  meditation  it  kind  of  gives  you 
 like  an  extra  second 
 a  second  chance  before  you're  about  to
[37:20] indulge  in  something  a  huge  part  of 
 binge  eating  happens  because  of  anxiety
[37:25] we  binge  eat  for  comfort  because  that  is 
 the  comfortable  thing  in  our  day  that  we
[37:30] we  we  associate  good  positive  feelings 
 with 
 especially  if  we've  had  a  stressful  day
[37:35] again  mindfulness  is  the  cure  to  that  it 
 might  seem  like  i'm  oversimplifying  it
[37:40] this  video  is  not  about  mindful 
 meditation  but  if  you  watch  one  of  the 
 playlists  you'll  probably  understand  why
[37:45] i  preach  it  so  much  now  let's  talk  about 
 diet  in  terms  of  building  muscle  the 
 most 
 effective  way  to  build  muscle  is  to  be
[37:51] in  a  calorie  surplus  but 
 do  not  follow  the  fatty  youtube 
 weightlifter  advice
[37:56] eating  in  a  calorie  surplus  does  not 
 mean  to  eat  you've  hopefully  now 
 got  the  level  of  education  required  to
[38:02] know  that 
 we  don't  want  to  spike  our  insulin  we 
 don't  want  to  mess  up  our  hormones  our 
 leptin  we  don't  want  to  eat  that
[38:08] that  gives  us  visceral  fat 
 what  we  want  is  to  simply  eat  more  of 
 the  healthy  foods  and  this 
 is  where  bulking  becomes  not  fun  this  is
[38:16] where  bulking  becomes 
 difficult  to  build  muscle  efficiently 
 you  have  to  bulk 
 and  most  people  love  to  bulk  because
[38:22] that  is  their  excuse  for  their  eating 
 disorder  they  just  want  to  eat  more 
 junk  food  if  you  don't  want  to  get 
 metabolic  syndrome  and  you  want  to  do
[38:28] this  in  a  healthy  way  to  build  muscle 
 bulking  is  difficult  because  bulking 
 literally  means  to  eat
[38:33] more  of  the  food  that  really  fills  you 
 up  so  when  you're  bulking  you  should 
 feel  like
[38:38] it's  a  struggle  that's  why  when  people 
 talk  about  weightlifting  and  diets 
 they  say  that  the  diet  is  actually  way
[38:43] harder  and  it  only  is  harder 
 if  you  eat  the  healthy  foods  bulking
[38:48] should  be  a  struggle  because  you're 
 literally  force  feeding  yourself 
 calories  if  you  eat  junk  it's  easy  but
[38:54] if  you  eat  junk 
 that's  going  into  visceral  fat  you  will 
 gain  weight  when  you  do  that 
 and  it'll  seem  like  you  are  bulking
[38:59] because  your  weight's  going  up  and  you 
 look  a  little  bit  bigger 
 but  really  what's  just  happening  is  that 
 most  of  it  is  fat  and  most  of  that  fat
[39:05] is  visceral  fat  it's  not  what  we  want  in 
 a  ideal  world 
 we'd  like  to  gain  just  muscle  and  zero
[39:12] fat 
 that  would  literally  be  like  a  dream  and 
 the  closest  you  can  get  to  that  is  by 
 doing  it
[39:17] in  the  most  clean  eating  way  the  foods 
 that  don't  mess  up  your  leptin  signal 
 just  foods
[39:22] that  don't  give  you  visceral  fat  the 
 foods  that  don't  spike  your  insulin  eat 
 big  to  get  big  is  a  myth
[39:27] we  only  need  a  moderate  calorie  surplus 
 as  a  very  rough  amount  we  only  need  to 
 eat  like  an  extra  200  calories  a  day  so
[39:33] it's  not  too  much 
 if  you're  eating  that  with  healthy  foods 
 that  don't  spike  your  insulin  that  don't
[39:38] mess  up  your  leptin 
 your  body  composition  will  look  so  much 
 better  at  the  end  of  your  bulk  than  if
[39:43] you  ate  just 
 junk  food  even  though  the  junk  food 
 would  technically  feel  like  you  were 
 doing  it  right  because
[39:48] your  weight  would  go  up  but  remember 
 strip  back  down  to  the  basics  we  don't 
 just  want  our  weight  to  go  up  we  only
[39:54] use  weights  as  just  a  way  to  track  our 
 progress  in  the  bulk  but  what  we  really 
 want  when  we  bulk
[39:59] is  just  muscle  we  want  as  close  to  100 
 muscle  gain  as  possible  we  want  as  least
[40:05] fat  gain  as  possible  because  fat  gain 
 just  means  that  we  have  to  then  go  and 
 do  a  cut 
 i'm  losing  my  voice  so  when  trying  to
[40:11] build  muscle 
 focus  on  lean  bulking  with  a  small  to 
 moderate  calorie  surplus
[40:16] and  that  calorie  surplus  should  entirely 
 come  from  the  same  foods 
 of  healthy  high  fiber  high  fats  low
[40:22] sugar 
 low  glycemic  load  so  just  remember  that 
 bulking  shouldn't  be
[40:28] fun  it  shouldn't  be  something  that 
 you're  thinking  like  oh  well  i  can't 
 wait  to  eat  some  muffins  after  my 
 workout  because  it's  got  carbs  and
[40:34] the  fitness  people  told  me  it's  okay  no 
 no  we're  still  trying  to  eat  healthy 
 bulking  is  not  an  excuse  for  your  eating
[40:39] disorder 
 that's  my  message  to  everyone  in  the 
 fitness  industry  finally  losing  fat
[40:45] losing  fat  requires  you  to  be  in  a 
 calorie  deficit  that  means  to  eat  less 
 than  your  maintenance  now  being  in  a
[40:51] calorie  deficit  is  not  a  problem 
 everyone's  so  scared  of  going  on  to  a 
 cut  because  they  eat  junk  food  when  you
[40:56] eat  junk  food 
 you  spike  your  insulin  you  mess  up  the 
 leptin  you  are  hungry  all  the  time
[41:01] so  imagine  now  trying  to  be  on  reduced 
 calories  and  still  be  easing 
 that's  what  everyone  in  the  fitness
[41:06] industry  does  don't  do  that  if  you  cut 
 and  you  only  eat 
 again  the  same  foods  that  we've
[41:11] mentioned  cutting's  fine  you  actually 
 like 
 you  actually  look  forward  to  it  because 
 it's  a  time  when  you  don't  have  to  force
[41:17] feed  yourself 
 100  grams  of  oats  and  300  grams  of  rice 
 it's  it's 
 it's  not  too  bad  perhaps  i'll  make  a
[41:23] whole  video  on  what's  called  water 
 fasting  but  that  is  now  what  i  preach  as 
 the  most  efficient  way  to  lose  fat
[41:28] so  to  lose  fats  you  have  to  be  in  a 
 calorie  deficit  we've  already  known  this 
 but  hopefully  with
[41:33] some  knowledge  that  i've  told  you  in 
 this  video  you  now  hopefully  understand 
 the  types  of  food  you  eat  will  make  or
[41:40] break  the  cut  it  will  make  or  break  your 
 life 
 so  do  not  cut  do  not  just  eat  the  the
[41:46] shitty  food  that's  making  all  this 
 difficult  that's  leading  to  the 
 metabolic  syndrome  losing  fat
[41:51] is  easy  it  is  literally  easy  when  you 
 eat 
 the  the  healthy  processed  foods  here's  a
[41:57] little  graph  of  my  fat  loss 
 i  did  it  with  healthy  foods  and  i  have 
 always  struggled  with  cutting  because
[42:02] a  day  into  the  cut  i  start  pinch  eating 
 because  i  would  try  to  cut 
 doing  if  it  fits  your  macros  if  it  fits
[42:08] your  macros  is 
 the  horrible  way  the  worst  way  to  diet 
 because 
 the  moment  you  have  a  bit  of  sugar  the
[42:14] moment  you  have  a  bit  of  that  unhealthy 
 food 
 most  people  can't  stop  there  and  so 
 every  cut  beforehand  i've  pretty  much
[42:20] failed  apart  from  this  one 
 because  i  didn't  eat  any  of that  junk 
 and  i  was  full  i  literally  did  not  feel
[42:25] hungry  i 
 i'm  being  honest  i  know  this  is  a 
 privilege  that  i'm  grateful  of 
 i  forgot  what  hunger  feels  like  you
[42:31] probably  won't  believe  me  but  that  is 
 the  truth  i  genuinely  forgot  what  hunger 
 feels  like  i  have  not  felt  hunger
[42:36] in  over  six  months  i'm  literally  being 
 serious  and  there's  some  days  where  i've 
 done  like  a  bit  of  intermittent  fasting
[42:41] i  didn't  eat  till  four  pm 
 i  have  not  felt  the  hunger  i've  not  felt 
 ghrelin
[42:46] in  six  months  let  me  say  that  again  i 
 have  not  felt  what  hunger  feels  like  in
[42:51] six  months  i've  kind  of 
 forgot  what  it  feels  like  because  i  am 
 constantly  full  and  satiated
[42:56] even  on  a  calorie  deficit  because  of  the 
 foods  that  i  eat  unprocessed 
 my  leptin  signaling  much  must  be  so
[43:02] amazing  and 
 i  can  exercise  for  about  three  hours  a 
 day  i  know  that  this  seems  like  an
[43:07] exaggeration  you're  like  he  must  be  over 
 training  or  he's  lying  like 
 it's  true  and  i  do  it  with  a  smile  on  my
[43:12] face  i  actually  feel  energized 
 throughout  all  of  it  and 
 it  feels  good  to  me  when  you  eat  this
[43:17] stuff  it  it  changes  your  life  man  for 
 example  yesterday  i  did 
 my  leg  session  in  the  gym  which  was  one
[43:22] hour  and  20  minutes  i  did  a  45  minute 
 run  a  5k 
 run  then  i  went  to  my  gymnastic  ring
[43:27] spot  and  it  did  a  one  hour  session  there 
 so  that's  about  three  hours  that  i 
 exercised  yesterday  my  body's  pretty
[43:32] like  sore  but 
 in  a  nice  way  i  could  not  imagine  being 
 like  this  a  year  ago
[43:37] i  think  the  reason  why  is  because  of  my 
 leptin  signaling  because  i  finally 
 gave  my  body  the  nutrition  it  deserves
[43:43] and 
 i  think  that  this  is  one  of  the  best 
 things  you  can  do  for  yourself 
 so  hopefully  you  enjoyed  this  video  and
[43:48] i  really  really  hope  you  got  some  value 
 you've  learned  a  lot  from  this  i 
 i  have  been  a  victim  of  the  the  shitty
[43:54] diet  that  everyone  is  recommending  the 
 doctors  are  recommended  that 
 everyone  who's  unhealthy  has  recommended
[44:00] me  an  unhealthy  diet  hopefully 
 i  am  somewhat  of  a  role  model  to  you  i'm 
 somewhat  i've  got  like  a  body  that  you
[44:06] kind  of  want  yourself  i've  got  the  the 
 performance  that  you  want  yourself 
 hopefully  you  can  look  up  to  that  and
[44:12] think  that  this  is  how  i  got  here 
 and  it's  nothing  special  i  am  not 
 genetically  like  this  because  a  year  ago
[44:18] i  was  not  like  this 
 so  that  means  that  whatever  i've 
 recently  implemented  has  caused  this
[44:23] to  be  true  and  that  is  what  everything 
 you've  learned  in  this  video  improving 
 your  diet  is  a  big  journey  it  is  quite
[44:28] difficult 
 there's  so  much  to  know  i  could  speak 
 for  another  two  hours  about  everything
[44:34] if  you  want  me  to  coach  you  on  a 
 one-to-one  basis  i  will  teach  you  so 
 much  more  and 
 we'll  walk  you  through  the  diet  plan
[44:40] we'll  do  it  in  a  way  that's  sustainable 
 i  will 
 not  get  you  fast  results  you  will  not
[44:45] get  fast  results  with  me 
 if  you  want  fast  results  i  cannot 
 promise  that  i  could  get  you  a  little
[44:50] bit  faster  than  if  you  did  it  yourself 
 the  big  benefit  of  working  with  me  is 
 that  i  will  do  it  in  a  sustainable  way
[44:55] for  you 
 i've  got  one  student  right  now  speaking 
 to  him  yesterday  and  i  said  that  the  one 
 part  of  the  diet's  goal  you  know  the
[45:01] weight  loss  goal  that  everyone  sets 
 that  everyone  forgets  about  the  one  part 
 that  we  just  forget  to  think  about
[45:06] is  that  we  want  to  lose  x  amount  of 
 weight 
 and  keep  it  off  when  you  want  fast
[45:12] results  and  you  try  and  do  loads  of 
 cardio  and  you  try  and  starve  yourself 
 and 
 do  whatever  the  messed  up  you  do  to
[45:17] lose  weight  we're  forgetting  that  we 
 want  to  lose  that  weight  and  then 
 not  have  the  weight  come  back  and  most
[45:22] people  just  never  think  about  that 
 when  you  work  with  me  we're  gonna  do  in 
 a  sustainable  way  that  will  take  a
[45:27] little  bit  longer  than  if  we  did  it  in 
 the  most  fast  brutal  way 
 but  the  hope  is  that  once  you  get  to
[45:32] that  goal  weight  the 
 goal  health  that  you  want  from  the  diet 
 you're  going  to  stay  there  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  because
[45:38] i'm  not  just  going  to  help  you  with 
 weight  loss  i'm  going  to  reframe  imagine 
 what  this  this  video  is  probably  going
[45:43] to  be  close  to  an  hour 
 imagine  this  every  week  on  a  one-to-one 
 basis  i  hope  that  that's  got
[45:49] a  huge  amount  of  value  because  i  am 
 going  to  reframe  everything  you  think 
 about 
 in  terms  of  diet  and  lifestyle  and
[45:55] everything  i 
 want  to  completely  change  your  future  i 
 don't  just  want  to  put  you  on  a  shitty
[46:00] uh  check  your  calories  mate  and  just  eat 
 two  thousand  calories  a  day 
 it's  too  basic  the  moment  you  stop
[46:06] tracking  your  calories  the  moment  you 
 stop  eating  at  the  calorie  deficit 
 you're  gonna  go  back  to  the  foods  that 
 cause  you  to  gain  that  weight  anyway  i'm
[46:11] gonna  come  in  every  single  week  we're 
 going  to  speak  and  slowly  and  surely  i'm 
 going  to  re-change  how  your  brain  is
[46:16] structured  so  that  you  just  don't 
 eat  the  same  food  now  usually  at  the  end 
 of  these  videos  it's  nice  to  link  one  of
[46:22] my  videos  so  that  you  know  i  get  more 
 views  and  watch  time  but 
 hopefully  you  understand  how  important 
 this  video  that  i'm  going  to  tell  you  to
[46:28] watch  is  because  i'm  literally  losing 
 you  know  potential  watch  time  to 
 recommend  someone  else's  video
[46:33] there  is  one  video  which  is  not  optional 
 it  is  required  and  i  know  it  might  seem 
 a  little  bit  boring  because  it's  like  an
[46:38] hour  or  two  hours  long  and  it's  kind  of 
 like  just  a  professor  talking  it  is  an 
 absolute  requirement  you  must
[46:44] watch  this  video  it's  called  fat  chance 
 it'll  be  linked  in  the  description  i 
 have  to  say  it  again  you
[46:49] have  to  watch  this  video  to  the  end  it's 
 a  long  video  so  you  can  watch  it  over  a 
 few  days
[46:54] but  seriously  i  have  to  say  this  again 
 if  it  is  not  optional 
 it  is  literally  required  you  must  watch
[46:59] it  click  on  the  link  right  now  and  watch 
 it  all  the  way  to  the  end 
 it  will  change  your  life  not  only  will
[47:04] it  change  your  life  it  would  probably 
 save  your  life  and  what  you  learned  from 
 it  i  hope  that  you  could  then  pass  it  on
[47:11] to  other  people  that  you  care  about  that 
 you  love 
 so  that  it  could  save  their  life  too 
 hope  you  appreciate  this  video
[47:16] i've  been  talking  for  a  while  i've  lost

 value  from  this  i  had  fun  making  it
