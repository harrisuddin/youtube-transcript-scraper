[00:12] social  skills  this  skillshare  class  is

 there's  something  for  everyone  in  this 
 class  we'll  be  going  over  the  30
[00:30] principles  of  social  success  before  we 
 start  Dale  Carnegie  himself  said  that
[00:35] there  is  one  magic  requirement  to  get 
 the  most  out  of  this  book  that  is  a  deep
[00:40] driving  desire  to  learn  with  a  vigorous 
 determination  to  improve  your  social
[00:45] skills  He  suggests  to  constantly  remind 
 yourself  of  how  important  these 
 principles  are  and  how  much  you  would
[00:51] like  a  richer  social  life  so  here's  a 
 quick  exercise  imagine  meeting  a  new
[00:56] person  imagine  this  person  in  your  head 
 what  they  would  look  like  what  they 
 would  sound  like  now  imagine  that  you
[01:01] had  put  in  some  work  and  effort  to 
 increase  your  social  skills  so  that  you 
 could  better  manage  a  conversation  with
[01:07] this  new  person  that  you're  meeting 
 you're  having  a  conversation  with  this 
 person  that  makes  them  feel  appreciated
[01:12] and  important  this  makes  that  person 
 feel  grateful  for  you  they  would  be  so
[01:17] glad  they  met  you  because  you  have  taken 
 the  time  to  invest  to  level  up  your 
 social  skills  your  conversation  with
[01:23] this  person  would  genuinely  make  them 
 feel  good  about  themselves  that's 
 amazing  we're  spreading  positivity  here
[01:30] by  learning  the  principles  from  this 
 book  so  well  done  for  taking  the  first 
 step  in  improving  your  social  skills
[01:35] let's  start  right  away  with  the  first 
 chapter  fundamental  techniques  in 
 handling  people  principle  one  never
[01:42] criticize  condemn  or  complain  Carnegie 
 says  that  the  best  way  to  get  the  most
[01:47] out  of  this  book  is  to  reach  each 
 chapter  rapidly  at  first  and  then  go
[01:52] back  and  reread  each  chapter  thoroughly 
 so  taking  that  advice  into  account 
 there's  different  ways  that  you  can
[01:57] watch  this  class  to  most  benefit  your  so 
 social  skills  you  could  binge  watch  all
[02:02] of  the  lectures  for  the  next  hour  or  so 
 just  to  get  an  understanding  of  what 
 we're  talking  about  here  and  then  slowly
[02:08] over  the  next  month  or  so  you  could 
 watch  one  or  two  lectures  a  day  and  then 
 you  completely  Focus  your  intention  on
[02:14] actively  trying  those  principles  that 
 you  just  learned  Carnegie  says  to  stop 
 frequently  and  to  ask  yourself  how  you
[02:20] could  realistically  use  this  principle 
 that  you're  currently  learning  in  your 
 real  life  social  interactions  so  as
[02:26] you're  watching  this  class  consider  just 
 pausing  the  video  and  taking  a  minute  or
[02:31] two  to  genuinely  think  about  the  people 
 the  times  the  environments  that  you 
 could  use  these  principles  I  hope  this
[02:37] skillshare  class  will  be  a  source  of 
 information  and  value  that  you  can  just 
 keep  re-watching  to  just  further
[02:42] solidify  these  principles  into  your  mind 
 and  with  that  said  let's  begin  with
[02:47] principle  one 
 principle  one  of  the  fundamental 
 techniques  in  handling  people  is  to
[02:53] never  criticize  condemn  or  complain 
 Carnegie  says  any  fool  can  criticize
[02:58] condemn  and  complain  and  most  fools  do 
 but  it  takes  character  and  self-control
[03:04] to  be  understanding  and  forgiving  he 
 mentions  Abraham  Lincoln's  saying  judge
[03:09] not  that  ye  be  not  judged  Lincoln  had  a 
 whole  lot  of  reasons  to  judge  other
[03:14] people  yet  he  never  did  he  said  don't 
 criticize  them  they  are  just  what  we
[03:19] would  be  under  similar  circumstances  and 
 that  makes  sense  if  all  of  the 
 circumstances  like  the  lifelong  history
[03:25] the  thought  processes  and  the 
 environmental  factors  were  all  the  same 
 you  must  have  acted  in  the  same  way  as
[03:31] them  so  we  can't  criticize  someone  for 
 doing  something  we  would  do  if  we  were
[03:36] in  the  exact  100  same  situation  as  them 
 this  principle  may  actually  be  quite
[03:41] difficult  to  implement  because  it's 
 actually  much  easier  to  be  negative  to 
 someone  who  has  messed  up  it's  harder
[03:47] but  therefore  better  for  us  to  hold  our 
 judgments  back  and  try  our  best  to 
 understand  why  they  do  what  they  do
[03:53] following  this  principle  will  turn  you 
 into  a  more  kind  person  is  the  challenge
[03:58] of  being  kind  not  exactly  at  this  moment 
 when  our  natural  instinct  linked  is  to
[04:03] criticize  so  keep  this  new  mentality  of 
 not  criticizing  condemning  or 
 complaining  about  someone  and  you'll
[04:09] find  that  you  become  a  more  kind 
 empathetic  person 
 principle  two  of  the  fundamental
[04:15] techniques  in  handling  people  is  to  give 
 honest  and  sincere  appreciation  Carnegie
[04:20] says  we  nourish  the  bodies  of  our 
 children  and  friends  and  employees  but
[04:25] how  seldom  do  we  nourish  their 
 self-esteem  we  neglect  to  give  them  kind 
 words  of  appreciation  that  would  sing  in
[04:30] their  memories  for  years  like  the  music 
 of  the  morning  Stars  he  mentions  Charles
[04:35] Schwab  president  of  the  United  States 
 Steel  company  in  1921  who  said  I  have
[04:41] yet  to  find  the  person  who  did  not  do 
 better  work  and  put  forth  greater  effort 
 under  a  spirit  of  approval  than  he  would
[04:48] ever  do  under  a  spirit  of  criticism 
 humans  learn  through  positive 
 reinforcement  we  know  that  to  be  true
[04:55] through  countless  psychological  studies 
 if  you  want  someone  to  be  happy  behaving
[05:00] in  a  certain  way  encourage  that  behavior 
 through  honest  appreciation  tell  them
[05:05] and  show  them  that  you  are  grateful  for 
 what  they  are  doing  this  is  going  to 
 make  me  sound  like  a  bad  person  but  I
[05:11] never  used  to  say  thank  you  to  my  mum 
 after  she  would  make  me  eat  breakfast  I 
 recently  started  saying  thanks  and
[05:16] complimented  her  on  how  well  she  cooks 
 fried  eggs  and  she  just  seems  to  enjoy
[05:21] it  more  and  it  certainly  made  her  smile 
 all  of  our  Associates  be  that  workers  in
[05:27] shops  factories  or  families  and  friends 
 are  human  beings  and  they  all  have  a
[05:32] hunger  for  appreciation  Carnegie 
 suggests  to  leave  a  friendly  trail  of
[05:37] little  Sparks  of  gratitude  on  your  daily 
 trips  so  try  that  next  time  you're  in  a 
 shop  and  you  see  a  staff  member  working
[05:42] hard  give  them  appreciation  next  time 
 you  get  a  lovely  meal  or  fantastic 
 service  in  a  restaurant  tell  them  thank
[05:49] them  for  it  you'll  be  spreading 
 positivity  around  your  community  and  I 
 bet  that  person  will  smile  about  it  the
[05:55] third  and  final  principle  of  the 
 fundamental  techniques  in  handling 
 people  is  to  arouse  in  the  other  person
[06:00] an  ego  wants  Carnegie  says  tomorrow  you 
 may  want  to  persuade  someone  to  do
[06:05] something  before  you  speak  pause  and  ask 
 yourself  how  can  I  make  this  person  want
[06:11] to  do  it  he  mentions  a  quote  from  Henry 
 Ford  and  some  of  the  best  relationship 
 advice  he's  ever  heard
[06:17] if  there  is  any  one  secret  of  success  it 
 lies  in  the  ability  to  get  the  other 
 person's  point  of  view  and  see  things
[06:23] from  that  person's  angle  as  well  as  from 
 your  own  instead  of  discussion  or  threat
[06:28] when  a  young  child  was  protesting  about 
 going  to  kindergarten  a  member  of  Dale 
 Carnegie's  course  tried  something
[06:34] different  he  and  his  wife  started  finger 
 painting  and  having  lots  of  fun  whilst 
 telling  his  child  about  all  of  the
[06:40] things  he  would  get  to  enjoy  in 
 kindergarten  this  principle  is  all  about 
 motivating  the  other  person  put  yourself
[06:47] in  their  shoes  and  think  about  their 
 desires  what  do  they  want  arousing  and
[06:52] ego  wants  is  very  important  in  business 
 this  is  why  companies  do  Target  Market
[06:57] Research  to  see  what  the  customer  wants 
 it's  never  about  what  your  company  wants
[07:02] it's  about  fulfilling  the  needs  and  the 
 wants  of  the  customer  this  principle  is
[07:07] very  similar  to  law  13  of  the  48  Laws  of 
 Power  when  asking  for  help  appeal  to
[07:13] people's  self-interest  never  to  their 
 Mercy  or  gratitude  emphasis  size  what
[07:18] they  will  get  out  of  it  so  you  can 
 practically  implement  this  principle  by 
 being  mindful  of  the  needs  and  the  wants
[07:24] of  the  person  in  front  of  you  and 
 talking  about  that  let  me  give  you  an 
 example  I  always  wanted  a  gym  partner
[07:31] someone  to  come  to  the  gym  with  me  and 
 spot  me  whilst  I  was  lifting  weights 
 what  I  would  tell  guys  that  I  wanted  a
[07:37] gym  partner  do  you  think  they  ever  threw 
 themselves  at  the  opportunity  no  but
[07:42] then  when  I  started  mentioning  what  they 
 would  get  out  of  coming  to  the  gym  with 
 me  and  that  was  increased  muscle 
 strength  and  confidence  all  whilst
[07:48] trading  safely  with  someone  who  has  a 
 lot  of  experience  I  started  speaking 
 about  the  benefits  they  would  experience
[07:54] instead  of  just  what  I  wanted  and  now  I 
 almost  always  have  a  guide  to  go  to  the 
 gym  with  the  fourth  principle  starts  the
[08:00] new  chapter  six  ways  to  make  people  like 
 you  and  that  is  by  becoming  genuinely
[08:05] interested  in  other  people  Carnegie  says 
 you  can  make  more  friends  in  two  months
[08:10] by  becoming  genuinely  interested  in 
 other  people  than  you  can  in  two  years 
 by  trying  to  get  other  people  interested
[08:16] in  you  you  he  mentioned  psychologist 
 Alfred  Adler  it  is  the  individual  who  is
[08:21] not  interested  in  his  fellow  men  who  has 
 the  greatest  difficulties  in  life  and 
 provides  the  greatest  injury  to  others
[08:27] it  is  from  such  individuals  that  all 
 human  failures  spring  I've  been  using
[08:32] this  principle  with  a  thought  that  I 
 keep  in  mind  everyone  has  an  interesting 
 story  a  mistake  that  they've  made  that  I
[08:39] could  learn  from  they  have  success  that 
 I  may  be  able  to  replicate  only  by 
 becoming  interested  in  other  people  can
[08:45] you  find  these  things  out  implementing 
 this  principle  will  make  your 
 conversations  deeper  a  Rowan  poet
[08:51] publilius  Cyrus  said  that  we  are 
 interested  in  others  when  they  are
[08:56] interested  in  us  your  strengthen  quality 
 friendships  this  way  by  overcoming  the
[09:01] basic  conversations  that  we  usually 
 limit  ourselves  to  practical  way  that 
 you  can  implement  this  principle  is
[09:06] simply  by  asking  the  other  person  more 
 questions  see  where  the  conversation 
 ends  up  and  you'll  probably  find
[09:12] something  that  really  interests  you  the 
 other  person  will  feel  fantastic  of  the 
 attention  you're  giving  them  and  maybe
[09:18] you'll  learn  a  thing  or  two  the  second 
 principle  of  making  people  like  you  is 
 to  smile
[09:24] Carnegie  says  that  happiness  doesn't 
 depend  on  outward  conditions  it  depends
[09:29] on  inner  conditions  it  isn't  what  you 
 have  or  who  you  are  or  where  you  are  or
[09:34] what  you  are  doing  that  makes  you  happy 
 or  unhappy  it  is  what  you  think  about  it
[09:39] he  mentions  telephone  customer  service 
 training  where  members  of  staff  are 
 instructed  to  smile  as  they  talk  on  the
[09:45] phone  because  your  smile  comes  out 
 through  your  voice  when  you  talk  what  if
[09:50] you  don't  feel  like  smiling  Carnegie 
 mentions  a  quote  from  psychologist 
 William  James  thus  The  Sovereign
[09:57] voluntary  path  to  cheerfulness  if  our 
 cheerfulness  be  lost  is  to  sit  up
[10:02] cheerfully  and  to  act  and  speak  as  if 
 cheerfulness  we're  already  there  fake  it
[10:08] till  you  make  it  we  know  that  fake  it 
 till  you  make  it  actually  works  because 
 it  starts  a  positive  feedback  loop  you
[10:15] fake  the  cheerfulness  and  smile  suddenly 
 everyone  is  smiling  back  at  you  and  the
[10:20] pleasantness  of  the  situation  actually 
 causes  your  smile  to  become  real  force
[10:25] yourself  to  smile  and  then  think  about 
 how  stupid  it  is  to  actually  fake  a 
 smile  and  then  you'll  be  finding
[10:30] yourself  smiling  naturally  remember  to 
 force  this  smile  anytime  you  see  your
[10:35] phone  ring  if  you  force  a  smile  and 
 answer  the  phone  the  other  person  will 
 just  think  that  you  are  very  very  happy
[10:42] to  speak  to  them  your  energy  will  become 
 so  much  more  pleasant  and  then  the  other 
 person  will  likely  feel  the  same  way
[10:47] implementing  this  principle  and  smiling 
 more  will  undoubtedly  make  other  people
[10:52] smile  back  at  you  it  will  make  you  feel 
 a  lot  more  connected  in  your  community 
 and  in  fact  I  personally  think  this
[10:59] principle  has  changed  my  life  the  most 
 the  images  you're  seeing  on  screen  right 
 now  are  a  few  paragraphs  from  my  own
[11:05] personal  Journal  of  the  importance  of 
 smiling  fake  it  till  you  make  it  and
[11:10] start  that  positive  feedback  loop  the 
 third  principle  of  making  people  like 
 you  is  to  remember  that  a  person's  name
[11:16] is  to  that  person  the  sweetest  sound  in 
 any  language  Carnegie  says  that  the
[11:22] average  person  is  more  interested  in  his 
 or  her  own  name  than  in  all  the  other 
 names  on  Earth  put  together  remember
[11:29] that  name  and  call  it  easily  and  you 
 have  paid  a  subtle  and  very  effective
[11:34] compliments  he  mentions  Andrew  Carnegie 
 who  learned  the  astounding  importance
[11:39] people  place  on  their  own  names  at  just 
 the  age  of  10.  he  had  a  whole  nest  of
[11:44] little  rabbits  and  nothing  to  feed  them 
 so  he  convinced  his  neighborhood  friends
[11:49] to  go  out  and  pick  some  dandelion  some 
 food  for  the  rabbits  and  in  return  he
[11:54] would  name  the  little  rabbits  after 
 those  kids  using  people's  names  in  the 
 middle  of  a  conversation  does  feel  a
[12:00] little  bit  awkward  when  you  first  start 
 but  you'll  find  that  people  do  seem  way
[12:05] more  receptive  to  you  when  you  do  use 
 their  name  anytime  I  get  someone's  phone 
 number  I  always  thought  the  first
[12:11] message  or  voice  notes  with  their  name 
 Caitlyn  it's  Hamza  we  met  earlier
[12:16] implementing  this  principle  will  make 
 the  people  you  speak  to  feel  more 
 connected  and  more  important  to  you
[12:22] remembering  their  name  is  almost  like 
 crazy 
 between  two  people  and  now  you're 
 probably  thinking  okay  well  how  do  I
[12:28] actually  begin  to  remember  people's 
 names  effectively  and  I  don't  think
[12:33] there's  any  secret  tactic  it  just  takes 
 a  little  more  intention  Carnegie  says
[12:38] that  most  people  don't  remember  names 
 for  the  simple  reason  that  they  don't 
 take  the  time  and  energy  necessary  to
[12:43] concentrate  and  repeat  and  fix  names  in 
 their  minds  so  it's  likely  that  you'll
[12:48] improve  the  ability  to  remember 
 someone's  name  if  you  just  care  about  it
[12:53] more  and  you  put  more  intention  into 
 remembering  their  name  remain  mindful  of 
 the  significance  that  we  place  on  our
[12:59] names  and  carry  this  thought  around  with 
 you  so  the  fourth  principle  of  making
[13:04] people  like  you  is  to  be  a  good  listener 
 and  to  encourage  others  to  talk  about 
 themselves  Carnegie  says  if  you  aspire
[13:10] to  be  a  good  conversationalist  be  an 
 attentive  listener  to  be  interesting  be
[13:16] interested  ask  questions  that  the  other 
 person  will  enjoy  answering  encourage
[13:21] them  to  talk  about  themselves  and  their 
 accomplishments  he  mentions  Edward  Bach
[13:26] a  Dutch  immigrant  boy  living  in  poverty 
 he  had  nothing  to  his  name  but  he  began 
 corresponding  with  really  famous  people
[13:33] how  did  you  do  that  by  encouraging  them 
 to  talk  about  themselves  he  wrote
[13:38] letters  to  people  like  Mrs  Abraham 
 Lincoln  asking  them  about  details  of 
 their  childhood  by  just  being  a  good
[13:44] listener  a  poor  boy  with  seemingly  no 
 future  became  a  welcome  guest  in
[13:50] distinguished  people's  homes  here's  the 
 deal  we  love  talking  about  ourselves 
 much  more  than  we  like  to  listen  but  if
[13:57] you  become  the  person  who  enjoys 
 listening  and  gets  people  talking  about 
 themselves  they'll  love  of  talking  to
[14:03] you  you  can  implement  this  principle  and 
 you  will  immediately  notice  how  your 
 conversations  change  people  will  open  up
[14:09] about  private  parts  of  their  life  and 
 then  they'll  probably  tell  you  that 
 they've  never  really  spoken  about  these
[14:14] things  before  if  you  implement  this 
 principle  you're  actually  doing  a 
 fantastic  service  sometimes  we  need  to
[14:21] talk  to  someone  who's  a  great  listener 
 someone  who  doesn't  just  want  to  talk 
 back  and  you  can  become  that  person  for
[14:27] your  friends  or  family  making  them 
 grateful  for  you  there  is  a  downside  to 
 this  the  people  that  you  speak  to  may
[14:34] not  be  great  listeners  to  what  you  have 
 to  say  it  might  feel  unbalanced  like 
 they're  doing  all  the  talking  and  you're
[14:40] doing  all  the  listening  when  is  it  your 
 turn  to  do  the  talking  I've  certainly 
 noticed  this  myself  I  think  that's
[14:46] because  the  average  person  has  more  of  a 
 need  to  talk  and  get  things  out  of  their 
 mind  than  their  need  to  listen  really
[14:52] the  more  people  who  read  this  book  The 
 more  great  listeners  that  we  will 
 encounter  that's  why  I  think  this  book
[14:58] should  be  recommended  to  everyone  and 
 that  is  why  I  made  this  skillshare  class 
 the  world  would  generally  be  a  better
[15:05] place  if  more  people  tried  to  implement 
 these  principles  so  consider  sharing 
 this  book  with  someone  maybe  send  them  a
[15:11] free  PDF  or  even  order  the  book  for  them 
 on  Amazon  or  send  them  a  link  to  this
[15:16] skillshare  class  if  they  internalize  it 
 then  that's  your  benefit  you've  now  got 
 someone  who  has  become  a  great  listener
[15:22] to  what  you  have  to  say  the  fifth 
 principle  of  making  people  like  you  is
[15:27] to  talk  in  terms  of  the  other  person's 
 interests  Carnegie  mentions  how  guests
[15:32] of  Theodore  Roosevelt  were  always 
 astonished  at  his  wide  range  of 
 knowledge  particularly  in  the  things
[15:37] that  they  were  interested  in  Roosevelt 
 admitted  his  Secrets  he  would  stay  up
[15:42] late  and  read  up  on  the  subjects  that  he 
 knew  his  guests  were  interested  in  in 
 Carnegie's  words  for  Roosevelt  new  as
[15:48] all  leaders  know  that  the  Royal  Road  to 
 a  person's  heart  is  to  talk  about  the
[15:53] things  that  he  or  she  Treasures  most  I 
 have  some  advice  on  implementing  this 
 principle  and  this  is  my  exact  method  on
[15:59] how  I  perform  outstandingly  in  job  and 
 use  before  the  interview  or  even  the
[16:04] initial  phone  call  I  always  do  extra 
 research  on  the  company  and  the
[16:09] recruiter  you  can  always  find  what 
 they're  interested  in  online  and  when 
 you  mention  it  in  the  interview  they're
[16:14] impressed  they  appreciate  the  fact  that 
 you  took  the  time  to  research  them  and 
 get  a  bit  more  knowledge  on  what  they
[16:20] are  interested  in  implementing  this 
 principle  is  a  Surefire  way  of  never
[16:25] running  out  of  things  to  talk  about  if 
 you  focus  on  their  interests  and  use  the 
 previous  principle  of  being  a  good
[16:31] listener  and  encouraging  them  to  talk 
 about  themselves  you  won't  have  to  talk 
 much  at  all  and  you'll  learn  a  lot  of
[16:37] new  knowledge  and  information  about 
 hobbies  and  activities  that  you  may  not 
 have  known  you  never  know  where  these
[16:43] kinds  of  conversations  could  lead  to  for 
 example  speaking  in  terms  of  the  other 
 person's  interests  has  gotten  me  invited
[16:49] to  parties  barbecues  an  interesting 
 workout  sessions  you'll  find  that  it's 
 quite  common  for  people  to  briefly
[16:55] mention  something  that  they're  really 
 interested  in  in  the  middle  of  a 
 conversation  and  when  you  pick  up  on
[17:00] that  and  you  ask  them  a  question  about 
 that  interest 
 their  eyes  light  up  like  they've  wanted
[17:05] to  talk  about  this  stuff  for  a  while  but 
 no  one  has  asked  them  no  one  has  spoke 
 in  terms  of  their  interests  they  don't
[17:11] get  to  speak  about  what  they  are  most 
 interested  in  very  often  so  pay  them 
 that  favor  and  sometimes  they  even
[17:16] invite  you  to  join  them  with  that 
 interest  the  sixth  and  final  principle
[17:21] of  making  people  like  you  is  to  make  the 
 other  person  feel  important  and  to  do  so
[17:26] sincerely  Carnegie  says  probably  the 
 most  important  rule  of  all  is  to  do  onto
[17:32] others  as  you  would  have  others  do  unto 
 you  you  want  recognition  of  your  true 
 worth  you  crave  sincere  appreciation  so
[17:40] give  that  to  others  Carnegie  mentions  a 
 restaurant  owner  in  France  who  used  this
[17:45] principle  of  making  the  other  person 
 feel  important  a  key  employee  had  sent 
 in  her  resonation  but  the  restaurant
[17:51] owner  was  able  to  make  her  withdraw  it 
 simply  by  making  her  feel  important  he 
 told  her  that  she  meant  a  great  deal  to
[17:57] the  success  of  the  restaurant  and  he 
 said  this  in  front  of  the  entire  staff 
 you'll  find  that  if  you  just  switch  up
[18:02] your  thing  thinking  everyone  is  in  some 
 way  a  cog  a  vital  piece  to  the  bigger
[18:07] picture  bin  man  janitor's  receptionists 
 all  play  an  important  role  but  I  really
[18:12] appreciated  but  now  that  you're  keeping 
 this  principle  in  mind  you  can  be  the 
 person  that  makes  them  feel  important
[18:17] just  think  about  what  they're 
 contributing  to  and  thank  them  for  it 
 implementing  this  principle  is  a
[18:22] straightforward  way  of  making  people 
 appreciated  for  their  efforts  if  you 
 yourself  want  appreciation  and  a  feeling
[18:29] of  importance  in  this  world  do  unto 
 others  as  you  would  have  others  do  unto 
 you  the  first  principle  of  the  new
[18:35] chapter  when  people  to  your  way  of 
 thinking  is  to  know  that  the  only  way  to 
 win  an  argument  is  to  avoid  it
[18:41] completely 
 Carnegie  says  you  can't  win  an  argument 
 you  can't  because  if  you  lose  it  you
[18:48] lose  it  if  you  win  it  you  lose  it  why 
 well  suppose  you  triumph  over  the  other
[18:54] man  and  shoot  his  argument  full  of  holes 
 and  prove  that  he  is  non-compass  mentis
[18:59] then  why  you  will  feel  fine  but  what 
 about  him  you  have  made  him  feel
[19:04] inferior  you  have  hurt  his  pride  he  will 
 resent  your  Triumph  and  a  man  convinced
[19:10] against  his  will  is  of  the  same  opinion 
 still  he  mentions  a  member  of  his  course
[19:15] who  gave  a  great  speech  regarding  his 
 transformation  in  avoiding  arguments  the
[19:20] more  I  argued  against  it  the  more  my 
 Prospect  argued  in  favor  of  it  and  the
[19:25] more  he  argued  the  more  he  sold  himself 
 on  my  competitors  product  as  I  look  back
[19:30] now  I  wonder  how  I  was  ever  able  to  sell 
 anything  I  lost  years  of  my  life  in
[19:35] scrapping  and  arguing  I  keep  my  mouth 
 shut  now  it  pays  arguing  is  addictive  it
[19:42] makes  us  feel  important  when  we  fight 
 for  our  beliefs  and  we  regurgitate  the 
 facts  that  we've  learned  but  everyone
[19:47] feels  like  this  so  you  really  have  to 
 think  what  the  point  of  an  argument  is 
 if  the  point  of  your  argument  is  to  win
[19:53] that  person  to  your  way  of  thinking  then 
 arguing  is  not  the  right  way  the  course 
 member  of  the  example  that  I  just  gave
[19:59] said  it  perfectly  when  you  argue  with 
 someone  and  they  argue  their  point  in 
 retaliation  they're  just  further
[20:04] solidifying  their  current  belief 
 Carnegie  has  watched  the  effects  of 
 thousands  of  arguments  and  he  said  nine
[20:10] times  out  of  ten  an  argument  ends  with 
 each  of  the  contestants  more  firmly 
 convinced  than  ever  that  he  is
[20:16] absolutely  right  so  bear  this  in  mind  as 
 you  go  about  your  day  there's  certainly 
 better  ways  to  win  people  to  your  way  of
[20:22] thinking  which  we  will  discuss  in  the 
 next  few  principles  avoid  arguments  as
[20:27] they  are  a  lose-lose  situation  the 
 second  principle  of  winning  people  to 
 your  way  of  thinking  is  to  show  respect
[20:33] for  the  other  person's  opinions  never 
 say  you  are  wrong  Carnegie  says  if  you
[20:40] can  be  sure  of  being  right  only  55  of 
 the  time  you  can  go  down  to  Wall  Street 
 and  make  a  million  dollars  a  day  if  you
[20:47] can't  be  sure  of  being  right  even  55  of 
 the  time  why  should  you  tell  other 
 people  they  are  wrong  he  mentions  the
[20:54] art  of  subtly  proving  yourself  right  in 
 a  way  that  no  one  will  feel  like  you're 
 doing  it  over  300  years  ago  galio  said
[21:01] you  cannot  teach  a  man  anything  you  can 
 only  help  him  find  it  within  himself
[21:06] Carnegie  even  gives  you  the  exact 
 sentence  you  can  use  if  someone  makes  a 
 statement  that  you  know  is  wrong  I
[21:12] thought  otherwise  but  I  may  be  wrong  I 
 frequently  am  and  if  I'm  wrong  I  want  to
[21:17] be  put  right  let's  examine  the  facts 
 this  principle  works  I  make  YouTube
[21:22] videos  and  sometimes  someone  will  come 
 in  with  something  that  I  know  is  wrong  a
[21:27] few  times  that  I've  indulged  in  calling 
 them  out  and  telling  them  that  they  are 
 wrong  an  argument  has  started  we  now
[21:32] know  that  you  can't  win  an  argument  do 
 you  think  after  arguing  with  these 
 commenters  they  suddenly  subscribed  to
[21:38] my  channel  and  smash  that  like  button  no 
 it  offends  people  when  you  outwardly  say 
 that  they're  wrong  instead  of  subtly
[21:44] telling  them  the  truth  all  of  the  people 
 I  argued  with  on  YouTube  and  said 
 directly  that  they  were  wrong  probably
[21:50] smashed  the  dislike  button  implementing 
 this  principle  of  never  saying  you're 
 wrong  to  someone  will  stop  so  many
[21:57] arguments  from  ever  taking  place  and 
 obviously  we  just  learned  that  you  can 
 never  win  an  argument  so  these  two
[22:02] principles  that  we've  just  learned  will 
 stop  us  going  down  that  rabbit  hole  of 
 negative  conversations  with  people  we
[22:09] will  avoid  arguments  and  hostile 
 disagreements  if  we  implemented  these 
 principles  the  third  principle  of
[22:15] winning  people  to  your  way  of  thinking 
 is  to  admit  when  you  are  wrong  quickly 
 and  empathetically  Carnegie  says  say
[22:22] about  yourself  all  of  the  things  you 
 know  the  other  person  is  thinking  or 
 wants  to  say  or  intends  to  say  and  say
[22:28] them  before  that  person  has  a  chance  to 
 say  them  the  chances  are  a  hundred  to 
 one  that  are  generous  forgiving  attitude
[22:34] will  be  taken  and  your  mistakes  will  be 
 minimized  Carnegie  used  this  principle 
 himself  elf  after  being  caught  with  his
[22:40] dog  loose  without  a  muzzle  or  a  leash  by 
 a  policeman  for  the  second  time  he
[22:45] didn't  wait  until  the  policeman  started 
 talking  and  instead  he  beat  him  to  it 
 and  started  admitting  his  wrongs 
 empathetically  and  apologized  Carnegie
[22:52] admitted  that  he  had  no  excuses  as  he 
 had  been  previously  warned  not  to  have 
 his  dog  running  loose  the  policeman
[22:57] responded  in  a  softer  Manner  and  allowed 
 Carnegie  to  go  without  any  further 
 punishment  that  policeman  Being  Human
[23:03] wanted  a  feeling  of  importance  so  when  I 
 began  to  condemn  myself  the  only  way  he
[23:08] could  nourish  his  self-esteem  was  to 
 take  the  magnanimous  attitude  of  showing
[23:13] Mercy  my  pronunciation  of  some  of  these 
 older  English  words  are  not  too  great
[23:18] I'm  admitting  my  wrongs  quickly  and 
 empathetically  it  feels  quite  awkward  to
[23:23] start  admitting  your  wrongs  but  once  you 
 get  into  the  flow  of  it  it  becomes  quite 
 addictive  that's  because  implementing
[23:29] this  principle  will  make  you  grow  as  a 
 person  people  find  this  trait  of 
 self-reflection  so  attractive  and  they
[23:36] respect  it  because  it  reeks  of  comfort 
 evidence  many  many  people  can't  admit
[23:41] when  they're  wrong  because  they've  got 
 big  Egos  and  so  when  you  take  that 
 uncomfortable  step  people  appreciate  it
[23:47] and  then  they  help  you  feel  better  like 
 what  you  did  wasn't  really  that  bad 
 other  people  will  minimize  your
[23:52] wrongdoings  if  you  admit  them  first  the 
 fourth  principle  of  winning  people  to
[23:57] your  way  of  thinking  is  to  begin  in  a 
 friendly  way  Carnegie  says  the  friendly 
 approach  and  appreciation  can  make
[24:03] people  change  their  minds  more  readily 
 than  all  the  Bluster  and  storming  in  the 
 world  he  mentions  a  course  member  of  his
[24:09] who  successfully  got  his  apartment's 
 rent  reduced  by  beginning  in  a  friendly 
 way  instead  of  complaining  about  the
[24:15] price  of  rents  like  the  other  tenants 
 who  had  requested  a  rent  reduction  this 
 one  tried  something  different  he  greeted
[24:21] the  landlord  in  a  friendly  Manner  and 
 started  talking  about  all  of  the  things 
 that  he  really  liked  about  the  apartment
[24:26] he  complemented  the  landlord  on  the  way 
 he  ran  the  buildings  and  then  said  that 
 he  would  love  to  stay  he  just  couldn't
[24:31] afford  the  rents  here  without  the  course 
 member  even  directly  asking  for  it  the 
 landlord  offered  to  reduce  his  rent
[24:37] that's  a  fantastic  stick  story  and  is  so 
 replicable  to  many  of  us  today  next  time
[24:42] you  have  a  reason  to  complain  consider 
 beginning  with  a  compliment  this 
 requires  more  restraint  but  as  we're
[24:47] learning  that's  usually  a  good  thing  an 
 example  is  if  you  receive  a  meal  in  a
[24:52] restaurant  that  isn't  satisfactory  you 
 could  get  loud  and  you  could  get  hostile 
 but  even  if  they  replace  your  meal
[24:57] you've  just  ruined  your  own  mood  you've 
 lowered  the  positivity  of  the  people 
 around  you  and  there's  always  a  chance
[25:02] that  the  waiter  or  the  cook  will  spit  in 
 your  free  meal  on  the  other  hand  you 
 could  start  by  giving  the  waiter  a
[25:07] compliments  on  their  service  and  then 
 just  say  that  the  meal  wasn't 
 satisfactory  I  had  a  friend  who  was  a
[25:12] waiter  for  years  and  he  said  that  this 
 was  the  exact  way  to  go  about  it  and 
 they  will  undoubtedly  replace  your  meal
[25:18] free  of  charge  the  waiter  is  much  more 
 likely  to  go  back  to  the  kitchen  and 
 make  it  clear  to  the  Cook  that  you  were
[25:23] very  nice  and  that  you  deserve  the  best 
 meal  that  they  can  possibly  make  for  you 
 all  this  and  you  get  to  feel  like  you're
[25:29] in  a  friendlier  mood  implementing  this 
 principle  will  make  the  conversation 
 with  the  other  person  feel  like  you  are
[25:34] teammates  trying  to  solve  the  problem 
 rather  than  putting  the  other  person  on 
 the  offense  and  making  it  a  you  verse
[25:40] them  situation  the  fifth  principle  of 
 winning  people  to  your  way  of  thinking 
 is  to  get  the  other  person  saying  yes
[25:46] immediately  Carnegie  says  the  more  yeses 
 we  can  at  the  very  outset  induce  the
[25:51] more  likely  we  are  to  succeed  in 
 capturing  the  attention  for  our  ultimate 
 proposal  he  mentions  Socrates  a  Greek
[25:57] philosopher  whose  technique  was  based  on 
 getting  a  yes  yes  response  Socrates 
 would  ask  questions  that  he  knew  his
[26:03] opponents  would  have  to  agree  to  winning 
 one  admission  after  the  other  leading  to 
 his  opponents  finding  themselves  at  a
[26:09] conclusion  that  supported  him  getting 
 the  other  person  to  say  yes  yes 
 immediately  is  a  technique  used  in
[26:14] copywriting  which  is  writing  sales  text 
 that  you  may  see  in  online  shopping  it's
[26:19] also  how  I  convinced  some  guys  to  start 
 going  to  the  gym  at  first  I  would 
 wrongly  make  it  all  about  me  and  tell
[26:24] them  why  I  went  to  the  gym  I'd  ask  them 
 why  they  didn't  go  to  the  gym  themselves 
 this  never  worked  to  convince  them
[26:29] instead  using  this  principle  of  getting 
 them  to  say  yes  yes  has  been  much  more
[26:34] effective  I'd  ask  them  do  you  want  to  be 
 more  confident  they  would  of  course  say 
 yes  I  think  everyone  wants  to  be  more
[26:40] confident  then  I'd  say  something  like 
 imagine  right  now  you  had  more  muscle 
 more  strength  and  you  had  accomplished
[26:45] some  fitness  goals  that  you  would  set 
 yourself  do  you  think  you'd  be  more 
 confident  after  that  yes  we  want  them  to
[26:51] agree  with  us  because  it  just  means  that 
 we're  on  the  same  side  and  when  you're 
 on  the  same  side  it's  much  easier  to
[26:57] influence  a  behavior  change  into  someone 
 human  behavior  Professor  Harry 
 Overstreet  said  a  no  response  is  a  most
[27:04] difficult  handicap  to  overcome  when  you 
 have  said  no  all  your  pride  of 
 Personality  demands  that  you  remain
[27:10] consistent  with  yourself  you  may  later 
 feel  that  the  no  was  ill-advised 
 nevertheless  this  is  your  precious  Pride
[27:16] to  consider  once  having  said  a  thing  you 
 feel  you  must  stick  to  it  implementing
[27:21] this  principle  will  make  you  better  at 
 sales  either  selling  a  product  an  idea 
 or  a  belief  if  you  sell  things  online
[27:27] you  do  e-commerce  Facebook  ads  email 
 marketing  all  of  those  things  benefit
[27:32] from  getting  the  other  person  to  say  yes 
 yes  immediately  the  sixth  principle  in
[27:37] winning  people  to  your  way  of  thinking 
 is  to  let  the  other  person  do  a  great 
 deal  of  the  talking  Carnegie  says  most
[27:43] people  trying  to  win  others  to  their  way 
 of  thinking  do  too  much  talking 
 themselves  let  the  other  people  talk
[27:49] themselves  out  he  mentions  a  mother's 
 deteriorating  relationship  with  her
[27:54] teenage  daughter  who  kept  on  misbehaving 
 the  mother  lectured  threatened  and 
 punished  but  it  never  helped  so  one  day
[28:01] she  asked  her  daughter  why  why  was  she 
 behaving  like  this  and  in  the  mother's
[28:06] words  I  had  never  listened  to  her  I  was 
 always  telling  her  to  do  this  or  that 
 when  she  wanted  to  tell  me  her  thoughts
[28:12] feelings  ideas  I  interrupted  with  more 
 orders  I  began  to  realize  that  she
[28:17] needed  me  not  as  a  bossy  mother  but  as  a 
 confidant  from  that  time  on  I  let  her  do 
 all  the  Talking  she  wanted  our
[28:24] relationship  has  improved  immeasurably 
 the  fourth  law  of  the  48  Laws  of  Power 
 supports  this  idea  to  let  the  other
[28:30] person  do  a  great  deal  of  the  talking 
 always  say  less  than  necessary  the  more
[28:35] you  say  the  more  common  you  appear 
 powerful  people  impress  and  intimidate
[28:40] by  saying  less  it's  easier  and  it's  more 
 comfortable  to  keep  talking  to  fill  in
[28:45] the  gaps  of  Silence  but  that's  not  a 
 good  thing  confident  people  who  are  sure 
 of  themselves  and  their  beliefs  are  not
[28:50] afraid  of  the  silence  in  a  conversation 
 keep  this  in  mind  if  you  find  yourself 
 over  talking  along  with  letting  the
[28:56] other  person  do  a  great  deal  of  talking 
 comes  the  necessity  of  restraints  in
[29:01] interrupting  them  if  you  disagree  with 
 them  you  may  be  tempted  to  interrupt  but 
 don't  it  is  dangerous  they  won't  pay
[29:08] attention  to  you  while  they  still  have  a 
 lot  of  ideas  of  their  own  crying  for 
 expression  implementing  this  principle
[29:14] will  make  you  seem  so  much  more 
 confident  especially  if  you're  someone 
 who  usually  over  talks  confident  people
[29:20] say  less  and  so  when  you  emulate  this  it 
 seems  like  your  beliefs  are  stronger
[29:25] than  the  person  who  just  keeps  talking 
 trying  to  convince  you  of  something  else 
 the  seventh  principle  of  winning  people
[29:31] to  your  way  of  thinking  is  to  let  the 
 other  person  feel  like  the  idea  is  his 
 or  hers  Carnegie  says  isn't  it  bad
[29:38] judgment  try  to  Ram  your  opinions  down 
 the  throats  of  other  people  isn't  it 
 wiser  to  make  suggestions  and  let  the
[29:44] other  person  think  out  the  conclusion  he 
 mentions  Edward  M  house  who  was  a
[29:49] confidential  advisor  for  President 
 Woodrow  Wilson  after  I  got  to  know  the 
 president  I  learned  the  best  way  to
[29:55] convert  him  to  an  idea  was  to  plant  it 
 in  his  mind  casually  but  so  as  to 
 interest  him  in  it  so  as  to  get  him
[30:01] thinking  about  it  on  his  own  account  I 
 was  amazed  to  hear  him  Trot  out  my 
 suggestion  as  his  own  people  don't  like
[30:07] to  be  told  what  to  do  there's  an 
 infuriating  moment  that  I'm  sure  we've 
 all  experienced  how  do  you  feel  when
[30:13] you're  about  to  do  the  dishes  or  any 
 other  chore  and  then  someone  tells  you 
 to  do  that  thing  that  you  were  just
[30:18] about  to  do  it  takes  your  free  will  out 
 of  the  picture  when  someone  has  ordered 
 you  to  do  or  believe  something  and  we
[30:25] really  dislike  that  to  change  someone's 
 way  of  thinking  you  have  to  do  so  subtly
[30:30] without  making  it  obvious  what  your 
 intentions  are  they  can  only  truly 
 believe  this  new  way  of  thinking  if  they
[30:35] reach  that  point  themselves  as  galio  in 
 previous  principal  said  you  cannot  teach
[30:40] a  man  anything  you  can  only  help  him 
 find  it  within  himself 
 the  eighth  principle  of  winning  people
[30:46] to  your  way  of  thinking  is  to  try 
 honestly  to  see  things  from  their  point 
 of  view  in  Carnegie's  own  words  an
[30:53] increased  tendency  to  think  always  in 
 terms  of  the  other  person's  point  of 
 view  and  see  things  from  that  person's
[30:58] angle  as  well  as  your  own  if  you  only 
 get  one  thing  from  this  book  it  may
[31:03] easily  prove  to  be  one  of  the  Stepping 
 Stones  of  your  career  he  mentions 
 Kenneth  M  good  stating  the  benefits  of
[31:09] implementing  this  principle  of  seeing 
 things  from  the  other  person's  point  of 
 view  you  will  have  grasped  the  only
[31:14] solid  foundation  for  interpersonal 
 relationships  namely  that  success  in
[31:19] dealing  with  people  depends  on  a 
 sympathetic  grasp  of  the  other  person's 
 Viewpoint  this  is  where  the  phrase  step
[31:25] into  their  shoes  comes  from  you  gather  a 
 fantastic  understanding  of  the 
 motivations  a  person  has  if  you  just
[31:31] take  the  time  to  think  about  how  they 
 feel  and  how  they  think  it's  a  shame 
 that  we  often  don't  take  the  time  to  do
[31:37] this  because  it's  that  small  amount  of 
 effort  that  could  change  how  our 
 conversations  go  if  you  could  perfectly
[31:42] see  things  from  someone  else's  point  of 
 view  you  could  get  them  to  do  anything
[31:47] you'd  be  able  to  say  the  right  words  and 
 convey  the  right  atmosphere  to  convince
[31:52] them  of  your  way  of  thinking  so  just 
 take  the  time  to  really  think  about  who 
 this  person  is  and  what  their  Viewpoint
[31:58] is  what  are  they  for  and  what  are  they 
 against 
 the  ninth  principle  of  winning  people  to
[32:03] your  way  of  thinking  is  to  be 
 sympathetic  to  the  other  person's  ideas 
 and  desires  Carnegie  says  that
[32:09] three-fourths  of  people  are  hungering 
 for  attention  and  sympathy  if  you  give 
 it  to  them  they  will  love  you  he
[32:16] mentions  a  very  interesting  point 
 passenger  Al  Capone  with  the  exact  same 
 body  mind  and  temperament  with  the  exact
[32:23] same  environments  and  childhood  you 
 would  then  act  exactly  how  he  did  if  we
[32:29] use  the  previous  principle  of  seeing 
 things  from  their  point  of  view  and
[32:34] putting  ourselves  in  their  shoes  it 
 becomes  easier  to  be  sympathetic  with 
 someone  and  Carnegie  even  gives  us  the
[32:40] magic  phrase  that  will  eliminate  all  ill 
 feeling  and  help  us  act  sympathetic  to 
 someone  I  don't  blame  you  one  iota  for
[32:47] feeling  as  you  do  if  I  were  you  I  would 
 undoubtedly  feel  just  as  you  do 
 understand  that  everyone  has  a  reason
[32:53] for  what  they  do  Free  Will  is  not  as 
 easy  to  understand  of  a  concept  as  you
[32:59] may  think  it  is  we  think  we've  got  free 
 will  you  think  that  you  get  to  decide 
 your  actions  do  you  think  that  you  get
[33:05] to  decide  your  thoughts  but  is  that  true 
 do  you  actually  get  to  decide  what  you
[33:10] think  next  if  you're  watching  this 
 you've  probably  got  some  kind  of 
 privilege  and  decent  upbringing  to  not
[33:16] have  the  impulse  to  go  and  hurt  someone 
 but  what  if  you  did  what  if  that  was
[33:22] your  thought  is  your  thoughts  not  then 
 determined  because  you  cannot  think  what 
 your  next  thought  is  going  to  be  up
[33:28] until  it  happens  you  can't  exactly 
 control  your  Cravings  but  your  cravings
[33:33] and  your  thoughts  are  definitely 
 influenced  by  the  type  of  life  and 
 experiences  that  you've  had  so  if  you
[33:38] had  the  same  life  and  the  same 
 experiences  as  someone  else  it's  very 
 likely  that  you  probably  would  act  in
[33:43] the  exact  same  way  as  they  did  so  in 
 that  sense 
 show  sympathy  to  yourself  and  to  other
[33:49] humans  and  so  if  you  want  to  win  people 
 to  your  way  of  thinking  consider 
 implementing  this  principle  and  the
[33:55] previous  one  to  form  a  greater 
 understanding  of  how  and  what  a  person 
 feels  shows  sympathy  to  that  and  they
[34:01] will  listen  to  you  attentively  the  tenth 
 principle  of  winning  people  to  your  way 
 of  thinking  is  to  appeal  to  their  nobler
[34:07] motives  Carnegie  says  the  person  will 
 think  of  the  real  reason  you  don't  need
[34:12] to  emphasize  that  but  all  of  us  being 
 idealists  at  heart  like  to  think  of 
 motives  that  sound  good  so  in  order  to
[34:19] change  people  appeal  to  the  nobler 
 motives  he  mentions  how  Lord  northcliffe
[34:24] was  able  to  convince  editors  of  a 
 newspaper  company  to  stop  publishing  a 
 picture  of  him  that  he  didn't  like  he
[34:30] appealed  to  the  respect  and  love  that 
 all  of  us  have  for  motherhood  he  wrote 
 please  do  not  publish  that  picture  of  me
[34:36] anymore  my  mother  doesn't  like  it 
 everyone  has  a  potential  Noble  motive 
 that  you  could  speak  about  when  trying
[34:43] to  influence  someone's  Behavior  or 
 thought  change  for  example  example  I've 
 been  able  to  convince  young  men  to  take
[34:49] the  time  and  effort  to  improve  their 
 mental  health  through  practices  like 
 mindfulness  and  gratitude  and  exercise
[34:55] however  some  guys  didn't  really  feel 
 motivated  to  help  themselves  so  my  go-to
[35:00] response  to  that  was  a  form  of  appealing 
 to  their  Noble  motives  without  me  even
[35:05] realizing  that  I  was  doing  this  I  would 
 say  after  you  learn  these  practices  and 
 you  actually  take  the  time  to  get  used
[35:12] to  them  you  can  teach  them  to  other 
 friends  and  family  that  you  know  may 
 have  some  mental  health  problems  too
[35:17] most  people's  Noble  motives  are  selfless 
 it's  something  that  helps  other  people
[35:22] that  they  love  their  friends  family  or 
 people  in  their  Community  implement  this 
 principle  appeal  to  that  selfless  desire
[35:29] and  they  will  probably  embrace  the 
 responsibility  of  change 
 the  11th  principle  of  winning  people  to
[35:34] your  way  of  thinking  is  to  dramatize 
 your  ideas  Carnegie  says  this  is  the  day
[35:39] of  dramatization  merely  stating  a  truth 
 isn't  enough  the  truth  has  to  be  made
[35:44] Vivid  interesting  and  dramatic  you  have 
 to  use  Showmanship  the  movies  do  it
[35:50] television  does  it  and  you  will  have  to 
 do  it  if  you  want  attention  he  mentions 
 how  souzas  set  up  a  romantic  atmosphere
[35:57] and  may  even  get  down  on  one  need  to 
 propose  you  could  say  the  words  of  love 
 but  adding  the  dramatization  adds  extra
[36:04] effect  it  creates  a  moment  that  they 
 will  better  remember  the  possibilities 
 of  this  principle  are  endless  so  I  would
[36:10] highly  recommend  for  you  to  just  take  a 
 few  minutes  after  this  particular 
 principle  to  think  and  creatively  come
[36:17] up  with  a  few  ways  that  you  could 
 dramatize  the  idea  that  you're  trying  to 
 convey  to  others  it'll  create  a  more
[36:22] memorable  experience  and  therefore  it'll 
 probably  be  more  influential  for  example 
 a  couple  weeks  ago  I  met  up  an  old
[36:28] friend  and  we  were  just  walking  around 
 our  city  he  said  that  he  wanted  to  be  in 
 a  relationship  ship  and  that  he  had
[36:34] slightly  been  struggling  because  he 
 would  message  girls  on  Instagram  or 
 Tinder  and  he  didn't  have  much  success
[36:39] with  it  I  told  him  the  best  way  in  my 
 opinion  is  to  actually  approach  girls  in
[36:44] person  instead  of  just  being  another  guy 
 in  her  DMS  on  Instagram  whilst  I  was
[36:49] telling  him  this  I  stopped  mid-senses 
 and  walked  up  to  a  girl  just  approached 
 her  and  asked  for  her  number  she  said  no
[36:55] but  it  seemed  to  influence  him  a  lot 
 more  than  if  I  just  told  him  to  do  so  he
[37:00] witnessed  in  his  own  eyes  that  just 
 walking  up  and  speaking  to  someone  isn't 
 as  scary  as  it  seems  I  dramatized  my
[37:07] idea  and  I  want  him  to  my  way  of 
 thinking  implementing  this  principle 
 does  take  a  little  more  confidence  but
[37:12] it  leads  to  Greater  rewards  it  increases 
 the  potential  to  change  their  minds  when 
 they  see  and  remember  something  dramatic
[37:19] the  12th  and  final  principle  of  winning 
 people  to  your  way  of  thinking  is  to 
 throw  down  a  challenge  Carnegie  says
[37:25] this  is  what  every  successful  person 
 loves  the  game  the  chance  for
[37:30] self-expression  the  chance  to  prove  his 
 or  her  birth  to  excel  to  win  he  mentions
[37:36] Charles  Schwab  who  created  an  atmosphere 
 of  challenging  competition  by  drawing  a 
 big  figure  six  on  the  floor  with  chalk
[37:43] to  indicate  a  Mill's  day  shift 
 production  the  night  shift  came  in
[37:48] worked  hard  and  changed  the  six  to  a 
 seven  then  the  day  shift  came  in  thought
[37:53] they  got  one  up  by  the  night  shift  and 
 then  worked  really  really  hard  changed 
 the  seven  to  a  10.  this  Mill  in
[37:59] particular  started  turning  out  more  work 
 than  any  other  Mill  in  the  entire  plan 
 Charles  Schwab  himself  said  the  way  to
[38:05] get  things  done  is  to  stimulate 
 competition  I  do  not  mean  an  assorted
[38:10] money  getting  way  but  in  the  desire  to 
 excel  Challenge  and  competition  truly
[38:15] works  and  a  great  practical  thing  about 
 this  is  that  you  can  compete  with 
 yourself  or  you  could  get  your  clients
[38:22] or  customers  or  staff  to  compete  with 
 themselves  for  example  as  a  weightlifter
[38:27] I  started  tracking  my  lifts  tracking 
 your  lift  just  means  taking  the  time  to
[38:32] either  use  an  app  or  a  notebook  where 
 you  just  write  down  how  much  weight  you 
 lifted  in  a  particular  exercise  how  many
[38:37] reps  how  many  sets  it  seems  quite  simple 
 but  this  is  an  act  of  creating  a 
 competition  a  challenge  through  yourself
[38:43] through  your  former  self  so  every  week  I 
 see  the  number  and  I'm  essentially
[38:49] competing  with  last  week  me  I  tried  to 
 beat  my  previous  high  score  and  it's
[38:54] actually  way  more  exciting  this  way  and 
 so  you  can  convince  your  clients  or 
 staff  to  compete  with  their  former
[39:00] selves  that's  the  mentality  I've  been 
 using  with  my  coaching  clients  I 
 constantly  ask  them  to  remember  what
[39:05] normal  behavior  was  for  their  previous 
 younger  selves  just  a  few  months  ago  so
[39:10] they  remember  that  a  few  months  ago  they 
 weren't  even  exercising  at  all  and  then 
 we  compare  that  to  now  where  they're
[39:15] exercising  three  times  a  week  I  remind 
 them  of  the  version  of  them  from  last 
 week  saying  that  he  hit  three  sessions
[39:21] and  I  say  can  you  beat  your  previous 
 version  can  you  beat  you  from  last  week 
 and  hit  four  sessions  this  week  this  is
[39:27] one  of  the  most  influential  men 
 totalities  I've  been  Drilling  in 
 challenge  seems  to  ignite  a  fire  inside
[39:34] of  us  that  actually  gets  us  just  moving 
 and  taking  action  I  think  this  might  be 
 due  to  Evolution  when  you  create  a
[39:41] challenger  competition  it's  like  your 
 fight-or-flight  mode  kicks  in  and  wants 
 to  fight  for  the  resources  that  are
[39:48] available  with  the  reward  of  hard  work 
 because  now 
 someone  else  could  win  the  reward  of
[39:54] hard  work  and  we  don't  want  that  we  want 
 as  much  resources  and  rewards  as 
 possible  this  principle  is  actually  the
[40:00] basis  of  setting  goals  you  set  a  goal 
 that's  somewhat  of  a  challenge  and  you 
 just  keep  reminding  yourself  the  goal  is
[40:06] four  workout  sessions  this  week  the  goal 
 is  to  ride  a  thousand  words  in  my  book
[40:11] we  set  these  goals  we  constantly  remind 
 ourselves  because  that  is  our  challenge
[40:16] the  22nd  principle  that  we're  covering 
 which  is  now  the  first  principle  of  the
[40:21] new  chapter  of  being  a  leader  is  to 
 begin  with  praise  and  honest 
 appreciation  Colony  says  that  beginning
[40:27] with  praise  it's  like  the  dentist  who 
 begins  his  work  with  novocaine  the
[40:32] patient  still  gets  a  drilling  but  the 
 novocaine  is  a  pain  killing  he  mentions 
 a  branch  manager  who  was  a  member  of  his
[40:39] course  who  had  successfully  encouraged  a 
 new  trainee  to  increase  their
[40:44] performance  in  an  area  of  the  job  that 
 they  struggled  with  the  trainee 
 struggled  with  balancing  the  cash  draw
[40:49] starting  the  conversation  with  praise 
 and  this  appreciation  created  a  positive
[40:54] friendly  atmosphere  and  then  the  manager 
 suggested  the  improvements  that  the 
 trainee  could  make  in  the  manager's
[41:00] words  once  she  realized  I  had  confidence 
 in  her  she  easily  follows  my  suggestions
[41:05] and  soon  mastered  this  function  we  have 
 had  no  problems  with  her  since  then  we
[41:10] want  the  best  in  the  people  that  we  want 
 to  lead  so  it's  normal  to  focus  on  the
[41:15] things  that  they  can  improve  on  but 
 always  bear  in  mind  that  the  other 
 people  would  probably  improve  better  if
[41:20] we  started  on  a  positive  note  first  but 
 do  not  implement  this  principle  of
[41:25] starting  with  praise  and  honest 
 appreciation  until  you  also  implement 
 the  next  principle  too  the  second
[41:31] principle  of  being  a  leader  is  to  call 
 attention  to  people's  mistakes 
 indirectly  Carnegie  says  that  many
[41:37] people  begin  their  criticism  with  a 
 sincere  praise  followed  by  the  word  but
[41:42] and  ending  with  a  critical  statement 
 we're  really  proud  of  you  but  if  you  had
[41:47] worked  a  little  harder  your  grades  would 
 have  been  even  better  when  someone  hears 
 the  word  but  after  a  praise  they  might
[41:53] then  question  the  sincerity  of  the 
 original  praise  he  mentions  Charles 
 Schwab  who  instead  of  calling  a  mistake
[41:59] of  his  employees  directly  used  a  softer 
 approach  his  employees  were  smoking  just
[42:05] under  a  no  smoking  sign  he  could  have 
 went  up  he  could  have  been  rude  and 
 angry  and  told  them  can  you  not  see  the
[42:10] sign  his  employees  would  have  listened 
 to  that  they  would  have  followed  his 
 orders  but  they  may  have  slightly
[42:15] resented  him  and  there's  certainly  a 
 better  way  to  get  adherents  from  people 
 instead  of  calling  attention  to  their
[42:21] mistakes  directly  as  we're  using  his 
 examples  a  lot  you  can  begin  to  realize 
 that  this  Charles  Schwab  guy  is  one  of  a
[42:28] kind  he  walked  over  and  handed  each  of 
 the  employees  a  cigar  and  he  said  I'd
[42:33] appreciate  it  boys  if  you  could  smoke 
 these  outside  subtle  but  effective  they 
 knew  what  he  meant  they  knew  they  had
[42:39] broken  a  rule  but  the  rule  didn't  even 
 come  up  but  how  could  you  not  respect
[42:44] someone  who  calls  attention  to  your 
 mistakes  like  that  I  think  we  could  all 
 learn  a  lot  from  his  examples  in  this
[42:49] book  again  I  want  to  make  it  clear  that 
 the  easier  routes  would  have  been  to 
 call  attention  to  their  mistakes
[42:54] directly  so  far  what  we've  learned  a  lot 
 through  these  23  principles  is  that  the 
 direct  easy  approach  is  often  not  the
[43:02] great  one  to  take  just  taking  the  time 
 to  think  about  a  softer  approach  seems
[43:07] to  lead  to  Greater  adherence  with 
 everything  that  we  want  Carnegie  says 
 that  you  can  easily  overcome  calling
[43:13] attention  to  people's  mistakes  directly 
 by  replacing  the  word  but 
 to  and  we're  really  proud  of  you  and  if
[43:20] you  continue  putting  in  great  effort 
 we'll  see  your  grades  improve  as  well 
 I've  been  using  this  principle  a  lot
[43:25] lately  and  I  think  it's  a  fantastic 
 fundamental  principle  to  keep  in  mind  if 
 you're  someone  who  wants  to  see  changes
[43:32] in  people  as  I've  mentioned  I've  been 
 helping  young  men  improve  their  physical 
 and  mental  health  and  one  of  the  times 
 I've  used  this  principle  is  when  a
[43:38] client  of  mine  did  three  workout 
 sessions  when  his  goal  was  four 
 previously  I  would  have  said  well  done
[43:43] on  hitting  three  workouts  but  your  goal 
 was  four  so  we're  gonna  make  sure  we 
 smash  it  next  week  it's  not  bad  it's
[43:48] still  praising  him  but  it's  not  as 
 effective  as  it  could  be  now  I  say 
 something  like  well  done  on  hitting
[43:54] three  workouts  this  week  and  next  week 
 we're  going  to  use  the  same  tactics 
 we're  going  to  get  increased  effort  from
[43:59] you  and  we're  going  to  hit  four  workouts 
 do  you  think  you  can  do  that  it's  a 
 subtle  difference  but  it  seems  to  have
[44:04] quite  a  big  effect  here's  something  that 
 I  realized  that  I  think  if  you're  some 
 kind  of  leader  or  influencer  or  someone
[44:10] who  just  wants  to  see  change  in  someone 
 you  may  be  able  to  take  away  I've  been 
 thinking  about  keeping  the  idea  of  a
[44:16] praise  as  pure  by  not  contaminating  a 
 Praise  by  straight  away  then  telling
[44:22] them  something  that  they  did  wrong 
 praise  them  for  what  they  did  right  and 
 let  that  just  be  a  moment  in  itself  and
[44:28] then  later  on  after  a  few  minutes  then 
 have  the  section  about  what  they  can 
 improve  on  implementing  this  principle
[44:34] will  have  the  people  you're  trying  to 
 lead  Crave  Your  Praises  more  everyone 
 loves  getting  praised  but  we  often  just
[44:40] ruin  it  by  calling  attention  to  their 
 mistakes  directly  after  the  praise  don't
[44:45] do  that  and  your  compliments  will 
 certainly  leave  a  positive  mark  on 
 someone  the  third  principle  of  being  a
[44:50] leader  is  to  talk  about  your  own 
 mistakes  before  criticizing  the  other 
 person  Carnegie  says  admitting  one's  own
[44:56] mistakes  even  when  one  hasn't  corrected 
 them  can  help  convince  somebody  to 
 change  his  behavior  he  mentions  the
[45:02] father  who  found  out  his  teenage  son  had 
 started  smoking  he  could  have  made 
 threats  or  warned  his  son  but  he  took  a
[45:08] different  approach  he  told  his  son  about 
 the  mistake  he  made  starting  smoking 
 himself  the  father  had  been  smoking  for
[45:14] many  years  and  he  felt  like  his 
 addiction  was  impossible  to  stop  up  he 
 had  an  irritating  cough  he  told  all  this
[45:20] to  his  son  admitting  his  own  mistake 
 instead  of  criticizing  his  son's 
 Behavior  his  son  stopped  smoking  himself
[45:26] this  is  very  similar  to  the  previous 
 principle  of  calling  attention  to 
 people's  mistakes  indirectly  but  this
[45:32] time  we're  just  highlighting  what 
 they're  doing  wrong  by  telling  them  an 
 example  about  ourselves  if  you're  trying
[45:38] to  change  someone  start  by  telling  them 
 what  you  did  wrong  in  that  situation  and 
 how  that  experience  was  for  you  tell
[45:44] them  how  you  regretted  your  actions  and 
 you  just  wish  you  had  someone  telling 
 you  something  like  this  there's  a  whole
[45:50] lot  of  mistakes  I  made  when  I  first  got 
 into  fitness  and  exercising  I  found  that 
 when  I  bring  up  my  mistake  and  tell  them
[45:56] oh  I  would  I  lost  months  of  progress 
 because  I  did  this  thing  they're  way 
 more  likely  to  listen  to  my  idea  and
[46:03] take  my  advice  than  if  I  just  tell  them 
 wait  don't  do  that  because  the  other 
 person's  more  likely  to  listen  to  your
[46:09] plead  because  admitting  your  own  failure 
 is  very  admirable  we  always  strive  to 
 learn  from  other  people's  mistakes  to
[46:15] avoid  what  negative  experiences  they  had 
 the  fourth  principle  of  being  a  leader 
 is  to  ask  questions  instead  of  giving
[46:21] direct  orders  Carnegie  says  asking 
 questions  not  only  makes  an  order  more 
 palatable  it  often  stimulates  the
[46:28] creativity  of  the  person  whom  you  ask  he 
 mentions  Ian  McDonald  a  manager  of  a
[46:33] manufacturing  plant  he  received  a  very 
 large  order  which  would  be  impossible  to 
 complete  now  he  could  have  gave  orders
[46:39] he  could  have  increased  the  time  of  his 
 employees  work  but  he  didn't  instead  he
[46:44] just  asked  his  staff  questions  is  there 
 anything  we  can  do  to  handle  this  order 
 is  there  any  way  we  can  adjust  our  hours
[46:49] or  personal  assignments  to  complete  this 
 order  the  employees  themselves  came  up
[46:54] with  the  ideas  and  insisted  that  the 
 manager  take  the  order  asking  questions 
 instead  of  giving  direct  orders  put  the
[47:00] employees  in  a  we  can  do  it  attitude 
 they  accepted  the  order  and  got  it 
 delivered  on  time  if  you  give  someone  a
[47:07] direct  order  it's  actually  quite  risky 
 either  one  they'll  accept  the  order 
 they'll  do  the  task  but  then  they'll
[47:13] have  some  kind  of  resentment  for  you 
 because  you've  almost  forced  them  to  do 
 something  oh  2  they  will  refuse  and  your
[47:19] leadership  has  now  been  challenged  a  lot 
 of  this  book  has  told  us  that  people 
 don't  like  to  be  told  what  to  do  and  the
[47:25] direct  approach  is  often  not  the  best 
 and  so  we  know  that  taking  a  softer 
 touch  is  usually  better  Carnegie  even
[47:31] says  people  are  more  likely  to  accept  an 
 order  if  they've  had  a  part  in  the 
 decision  that  caused  the  order  to  be
[47:37] issued  for  example  let's  say  you're  a 
 mother  with  a  child  who's  misbehaving 
 and  he  doesn't  want  to  put  his  shoes  on
[47:43] to  go  outside  the  mother  could  get 
 really  angry  put  your  shoes  on  right  now 
 we  have  to  go  we're  getting  late
[47:48] does  that  really  work  with  kids 
 or  the  mother  could  ask  the  question 
 instead  of  focusing  on  the  direct  order
[47:54] she  could  ask  the  question  which  pair  of 
 your  trainers  do  you  want  to  wear  which 
 pair  of  shoes  do  you  want  to  wear  today
[48:00] the  child  is  going  to  answer  which  pair 
 of  trainers  he  wants  to  wear  and  now  he 
 feels  like  he  had  a  choice  in  the
[48:05] decision  he  had  A  Creative  Touch  almost 
 and  that  probably  means  he's  more  likely
[48:11] to  follow  what  originally  was  in  direct 
 order  involve  the  people  you're  trying 
 to  lead  in  the  decision  at  the  very
[48:17] least  just  ask  them  something  like  do 
 you  think  we  can  do  it  implementing  this 
 principle  will  change  it  from  a  you
[48:23] verse  them  situation  to  a  you  plus  them 
 versus  the  situation  the  fifth  principle
[48:29] of  being  a  leader  is  to  let  the  other 
 person  save  face  Carnegie  says  even  if 
 we  are  right  and  the  other  person  is
[48:35] definitely  wrong  we  only  destroy  ego  by 
 causing  someone  to  lose  face  he  mentions
[48:40] two  completely  different  leaders  one  was 
 a  vice  president  who  just  lost  his 
 temper  and  started  arguing  and  shouting
[48:47] and  berating  his  supervisor  that 
 supervisor  designed  and  started  working
[48:52] at  a  competitors  company  and  apparently 
 did  a  fine  job  there  the  other  leader 
 was  a  marketing  specialist  boss  when  one
[48:58] of  his  employees  had  made  quite 
 significant  errors  this  boss  thanked  her
[49:03] for  her  efforts  he  said  he  had 
 confidence  that  the  employee  could 
 repeat  the  survey  that  they  were  doing
[49:08] and  that  he  had  faith  in  that  employee 
 that  employee  left  that  meeting  with 
 their  head  up  in  the  air  determined  to
[49:14] not  let  that  boss  down  again  hurting  a 
 man  in  his  dignity  is  a  crime  and  it's  a
[49:19] crime  that  just  does  not  pay  off  if  we 
 want  to  be  effective  leaders  be  careful 
 if  you  find  yourself  in  a  position  of
[49:25] power  you  may  actually  feel  slightly 
 excited  to  not  let  the  other  person  save
[49:30] face  to  highlight  their  faults  publicly 
 or  to  humiliate  them  for  their  mistakes 
 but  none  of  this  will  improve  your
[49:36] leadership  skills  and  it  won't  make 
 people  more  likely  to  respect  you  and 
 follow  your  command  if  it's  adherence
[49:41] that  you're  trying  to  get  from  your 
 staff  or  the  people  that  you're  trying 
 to  change  take  the  software  approach  and
[49:46] let  someone  save  face  the  sixth 
 principle  of  being  a  great  leader  is 
 phrase  the  slightest  Improvement  and  to
[49:52] praise  every  Improvement  be  hearty  in 
 your  approbation  and  lavish  in  your
[49:57] praise  Carnegie  says  I  can  look  back  at 
 my  own  life  and  see  where  a  few  words  of 
 Praise  have  sharply  changed  my  entire
[50:03] future  he  mentions  very  well-known 
 psychologist  BF  Skinner  Skinner  showed
[50:08] that  minimizing  criticism  and  increasing 
 praise  resulted  in  more  positive
[50:13] behavior  we  know  that  operant 
 conditioning  works  on  humans  praising 
 someone  acts  as  a  form  of  positive
[50:19] reinforcement  that  strengthens  a 
 behavior  which  means  that  they're  just 
 more  likely  to  repeat  that  same  behavior
[50:25] so  if  an  employee  or  client  of  yours  put 
 in  some  great  effort  praise  that  effort
[50:30] and  they'll  be  more  likely  to  continue 
 putting  in  the  same  effort  because  we 
 crave  appreciation  I  think  this  is  one
[50:37] of  the  most  powerful  principles  you  can 
 effectively  make  someone  act  out  a 
 certain  Behavior  with  their  soul
[50:42] principle  use  it  wisely  and  remember  to 
 never  give  out  any  hostile  criticism  or
[50:47] punishment  we  strengthen  behaviors  that 
 are  praised  and  appreciate  and  we  just 
 weaken  behaviors  which  are  ignored  I've
[50:54] been  using  this  principle  a  lot  recently 
 when  my  clients  perform  the  vital 
 behaviors  that  get  them  to  their  goals
[51:00] an  extra  tip  I  can  give  you  is  to  make 
 your  praise  as  specific  and  as  special 
 as  possible  for  example  when  I  Want  To
[51:06] Praise  my  clients  for  completing  the 
 week's  gym  goal  of  four  sessions  a  week
[51:11] I  could  just  send  them  a  few  words  on 
 the  text  and  say  Well  done  but  I  make  it 
 a  little  bit  more  special  by  always
[51:16] sending  a  voice  note  when  they've  done 
 great  behavior  that  way  they  get  to  hear
[51:21] my  voice  it  feels  more  personal  and  the 
 praise  is  more  special  I  highly 
 recommend  doing  a  little  bit  more
[51:27] research  on  operant  conditioning  because 
 if  you  want  to  see  it  Behavior  change  in 
 someone  you  should  learn  about  positive
[51:33] reinforcement  it's  a  very  powerful  tool 
 probably  the  only  tool  of  influencing  a
[51:38] behavior  change  in  someone  in  a  nice  way 
 the  seventh  principle  of  being  a  leader
[51:43] is  to  give  the  other  person  a  fine 
 reputation  to  live  up  to  Carnegie  says
[51:48] if  you  want  to  improve  a  person  in  a 
 certain  respect  act  as  though  that 
 particular  trait  were  already  one  of  his
[51:54] or  her  outstanding  characteristics  he 
 mentions  how  a  primary  school  teacher 
 was  able  to  change  the  behavior  of  one
[52:00] of  the  most  mischievous  students  in  the 
 school  she  complimented  him  on  his 
 traits  as  a  natural  leader  and  said  that
[52:06] she  was  going  to  depend  on  him  on  making 
 that  class  the  best  fourth  grade  class 
 in  the  entire  school  she  gave  the
[52:12] student  a  fine  reputation  to  live  up  to 
 and  of  course  he  lived  up  to  her  this 
 principle  is  like  highlighting  the  best
[52:18] version  of  somebody  making  it  clear  of 
 their  potential  what  they  could  do  and
[52:23] setting  that  as  their  challenge  so  we're 
 bringing  in  the  21st  principle  of 
 throwing  down  a  challenge  as  well
[52:28] there's  two  ways  that  you  can  use  this 
 principle  to  improve  your  leadership 
 skills  one  by  making  them  aware  of  their
[52:34] potential  reputation  describing  it 
 realistically  as  something  that  they 
 could  strive  for  or  two  setting  yourself
[52:40] as  a  fantastic  example  that  then  is 
 their  reputation  to  live  up  to  for
[52:45] example  I'm  teaching  young  men  how  to 
 start  exercising  I  know  that  I  can  teach 
 these  things  because  I've  got  years  of
[52:50] experience  but  my  influence  as  a  leader 
 has  increased  tenfold  over  the  last  few 
 months  because  I've  gotten  myself  into
[52:56] the  best  shape  of  my  life  it  sets  a 
 fantastic  reputation  for  other  people  to 
 strive  for  this  gives  you  more
[53:02] credibility  as  a  leader  to  influence 
 change  if  it's  a  skill  or  a  practice
[53:07] that  you've  already  mastered  the  eighth 
 principle  of  being  a  leader  is  to  use 
 encouragement  and  make  the  fault  seem
[53:13] easy  to  correct  Carnegie  says  and  this 
 is  probably  my  favorite  paragraph  in  the 
 entire  book
[53:18] tell  your  child  your  spouse  or  your 
 employee  that  he  or  she  is  stupid  or
[53:23] dumb  at  a  certain  thing  has  no  gift  for 
 it  and  is  doing  it  all  wrong  and  you 
 have  destroyed  almost  every  incentive  to
[53:29] try  to  improve  but  use  the  opposite 
 technique  be  liberal  with  your
[53:34] encouragement  make  the  thing  seem  easy 
 to  do  let  the  other  person  know  that  you
[53:39] have  faith  in  his  ability  to  do  it  and 
 that  he  has  an  undeveloped  Flair  for  it 
 and  then  he  will  practice  until  the  dawn
[53:45] comes  in  the  window  in  order  to  excel  he 
 mentions  a  course  instructor  of  his  who
[53:50] used  encouragement  and  making  faults 
 seem  easy  to  correct  which  changed  the 
 trajectory  of  his  son's  life  his  son  had
[53:56] a  rough  life  he  was  in  a  car  accident 
 when  he  was  young  and  he  had  a  massive 
 scar  over  his  forehead  he  was  behind  by
[54:02] two  years  in  school  he  was  in  the 
 special  classes  for  the  slow  Learners 
 and  he  struggled  particularly  with  mats
[54:09] so  his  father  started  teaching  him  maths 
 and  made  a  big  deal  every  single  time 
 his  son  got  an  answer  right  they  would
[54:15] celebrate  when  his  son  had  shown 
 improvements  they  showed  him  that 
 learning  fun  and  it  could  be  easier  than
[54:20] it  was  at  school  and  soon  enough  that 
 teenager  started  bringing  home 
 significantly  improved  grades  and  went
[54:27] on  to  even  improve  in  other  classes  his 
 reading  improved  rapidly  he  started 
 using  his  natural  talents  in  drawing  and
[54:33] he  actually  got  put  onto  the  honor  roll 
 multiple  years  in  a  row  this  principle 
 is  all  about  drilling  in  a  growth
[54:38] mindset  into  the  people  we're  trying  to 
 influence  we're  making  it  so  clear  that
[54:43] they  have  the  realistic  potential  to 
 improve  and  all  it  requires  is  effort 
 but  not  that  much  effort  we're  not
[54:50] making  the  behavior  seem  like  a  big  deal 
 until  they  have  done  it  and  then  we  act 
 like  it's  a  big  deal  and  then  we
[54:56] celebrate  implementing  this  principle 
 genuinely  gives  you  the  power  as  a 
 leader  to  change  someone's  life  the
[55:03] growth  mindset  empowers  someone  into 
 positive  beliefs  that  really  make  them 
 feel  that  they  can  achieve  anything  with
[55:09] enough  effort  any  leader  any  influencer 
 any  personal  trainer  or  manager  should
[55:14] use  this  principle  all  the  time  the 
 ninth  and  final  principle  of  being  a 
 leader  is  to  make  the  other  person  happy
[55:20] about  doing  the  things  that  you  suggest 
 Carnegie  mentions  a  course  member  of  his
[55:25] who  improved  his  employees  performance 
 by  giving  them  a  new  responsibility  and 
 job  title  they  were  now  the  supervisor
[55:32] of  price  tag  posting  and  they  were  asked 
 to  keep  all  the  shelves  properly  tagged 
 giving  the  other  person  a  sense  of
[55:38] importance  like  we  learned  in  the  ninth 
 principle  makes  them  feel  happier  or
[55:43] more  excited  for  what  we  want  them  to  do 
 this  principle  is  kind  of  like  bribing 
 someone  imagine  bribing  the  police  you
[55:49] make  that  police  officer  do  what  you 
 want  which  is  potentially  getting  away 
 with  minor  crime  by  giving  him  money
[55:55] which  makes  him  happy  if  you  want 
 increased  performance  from  the  people 
 you're  trying  to  lead  make  them  happy  to
[56:00] do  so  think  to  yourself  what's  in  it  for 
 them  right  now  this  is  actually  a  very 
 interesting  point  most  of  the  behaviors
[56:07] that  we  want  to  influence  onto  other 
 people  are  forms  of  delayed 
 classification  like  working  hard  or
[56:12] going  to  the  gym  these  activities  do  pay 
 off  in  the  long  run  but  right  now  they
[56:17] are  uncomfortable  the  beginners  don't 
 really  feel  happy  to  be  there  in  that
[56:22] moment  so  to  make  them  happy  to  do  what 
 we  want  them  to  do  we  may  have  to  offer 
 some  kind  of  instant  gratification
[56:28] incentive  so  if  you're  a  personal 
 trainer  who's  very  close  to  your  clients 
 you  could  offer  to  pick  them  up  and
[56:34] drive  them  to  the  gym  with  you  this 
 makes  it  way  more  convenient  for  them  to 
 do  today's  session  if  you're  a  teacher
[56:39] reward  great  Behavior  with  some  kind  of 
 tree  like  letting  the  students  leave  the 
 room  one  or  two  minutes  early  so  that
[56:45] they  can  get  ahead  of  the  lunch  or  the 
 break  line  think  and  be  creative  of  ways 
 to  make  the  other  person  happy  right  in
[56:51] this  moment  for  them  to  carry  out  the 
 vital  behaviors  that  you  want  them  to 
 I'm  grateful  that  you  reached  this  far  I
[56:57] want  to  say  again  that  this  book  has 
 positively  impacted  my  life  and  if  you 
 reach  this  far  I'm  guessing  it's  done
[57:02] the  same  thing  for  you  social  skills  are 
 ever  more  important  and  having  the 
 ability  to  manage  people  to  become  a
[57:08] leader  to  influence  a  behavior  change  in
