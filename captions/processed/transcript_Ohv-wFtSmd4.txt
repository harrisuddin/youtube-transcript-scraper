[00:00] Jeffrey  would  love  to  have  people 
 thinking  about  him  invested  into  him 
 obsessed  with  him  and  so  he  tries  the
[00:07] creepiest  weirdest  ways  to  make  this  a 
 reality  but  all  it  does  is  just  scare 
 off  the  people  that  Jeffrey  actually
[00:12] wanted  in  his  life  the  girl  that  Jeffrey 
 wants  to  attract  is  Obsession  about 
 someone  else  Adonis
[00:19] Adonis  has  a  natural  aura  about  him 
 everyone  in  his  tribe  can't  help  but  be
[00:25] obsessed  with  him  not  only  is  he  the 
 tribe  leader  but  he's  sexy  not  only  is
[00:30] he  the  best  hunter  but  he's  empathetic 
 he  brings  the  full  package  and  he  even
[00:35] uses  special  tricks  to  make  sure  that  he 
 stays  in  his  people's  minds  do  you  think
[00:40] it  sounds  controversial  to  make  people 
 obsessed  with  you  using  psychological 
 tricks
[00:45] yes  do  you  want  to  do  it  anyway  yes  in 
 my  second  year  of  University  I  was  a  boy
[00:51] and  I  used  certain  tricks  that  you're 
 going  to  learn  here  but  I  need  to 
 explain  okay  first  I  use  certain  tricks 
 to  make  girls  obsessed  with  me  I  went
[00:57] from  being  a  kissless  virgin  literally 
 kissless  virgin  about  two  three  years 
 prior  to  this  and  when  I'm  age  21  I  was
[01:03] using  these  tricks  to  the  point  of 
 having  three  girls  in  love  with  me  at 
 the  same  time  and  two  of  them  knew  about 
 each  other  and  they'd  often  like  saw
[01:09] fight  and  argue  with  each  other  when 
 they  see  children  in  the  club  they  were 
 constantly  thinking  about  me  and  they
[01:14] were  free  whenever  I  wanted  to  [ __ ]  I 
 would  literally  just  text  them  come  to 
 my  room  and  boom  literally  20  30  minutes
[01:19] later  she  would  be  there  and  I  wasn't  a 
 good  person  then  so  this  was  four  or 
 five  years  ago  I  was  just  like  a 
 degenerate  [ __ ]  boy  going  to  clubs
[01:25] taking  drugs  and  you  know  sleeping  with 
 lots  of  girls  and  stuff  I  wasn't  like  a 
 nice  person  back  then  but  I  do  remember 
 one  thing  I  did  which  I'm  not  proud  of
[01:30] but  like  one  of  the  girls  that  was 
 obsessed  with  not  even  one  honestly  I 
 was  gonna  say  one  of  the  girls  but 
 honestly  most  of  the  girls  who  were
[01:36] obsessed  with  me  who  I  was  sleeping  with 
 in  University  I'd  often  just  look 
 through  their  phones  like  they'd  usually 
 just  show  me  their  passcodes  and  stuff
[01:41] and  so  when  they'd  be  like  asleep  next 
 to  me  I  just  like  they're  doing  this 
 because  like  it's  just  interesting 
 actually  been  chatting  [ __ ]  she's  been
[01:46] [ __ ]  anyone  else  let's  just  find  out 
 but  I  don't  recommend  doing  this  bro 
 this  isn't  like  it's  not  good  for  your 
 mental  health  at  all  and  it  just  yeah
[01:52] it's  just  not  good  for  you  but  like  let 
 me  tell  you  the  story  of  what  I  did  this 
 girl's  asleep  next  to  me take  a  phone  I 
 know  the  passcode  I'd  answer  and  I  start
[01:58] looking  through  the  text  and  bro  this 
 happened  more  than  once  with  like 
 different  girls  I'd  look  through  the 
 text  and  the  best  text  to  look  through
[02:03] if  you  are  like  a  bad  person  you  want  to 
 look  through  with  girls  but  I  don't 
 recommend  doing  this  plus  if  you  are 
 going  to  do  it  the  best  text  to  look
[02:08] through  her  not  to  look  for  guys  it's 
 actually  to  click  on  her  female  friends 
 and  actually  to  see  like  has  she  been 
 talking  about  like  oh  yeah  [ __ ]  this  guy
[02:14] yesterday  I  click  on  this  girl's  female 
 friends  on  her  text  messages  and 
 literally  they're  all  just  about  me
[02:19] they're  even  like  the  cutest  saddest 
 [ __ ]  of  like  oh  my  God  Hamza  just  text 
 me  and  he's  in  the  club  he's  thinking
[02:25] about  me  yes  this  was  quite  a  long  time 
 that  I  was  using  like  certain  tricks  to
[02:30] make  girls  obsessed  with  me  and  honestly 
 I've  used  similar  tricks  but  now  in  a 
 good  way  from  what  you're  seeing  right
[02:35] now  years  later  I've  used  psychology  to 
 say  more  than  relevant  to  be  in  the
[02:40] minds  of  thousands  of  men  around  the 
 world  there  are  thousands  of  guys  who 
 are  seemingly  obsessed  with  and  that  has
[02:46] led  them  to  change  their  lives  or 
 perhaps  changing  their  lives  has  made 
 them  obsessed  with  me  it's  the  same 
 psychology  either  way  I've  just  used  it
[02:51] differently  in  a  positive  way  now  you 
 want  to  make  people  obsessed  with  you 
 this  is  exactly  what  you  do  you  get  them
[02:57] to  emotionally  invest  into  you  emotional 
 investment  simply  just  means  the  time
[03:02] energy  and  effort  someone  spends 
 thinking  about  you  and  how  much  of  their 
 emotions  is  influenced  in  any  way  by  you
[03:09] if  you  are  let's  say  a  stoic  guy  who's 
 focused  on  your  purpose  and  you  have 
 like  a  girl  you're  probably  not  that
[03:14] emotionally  invested  into  her  because 
 you  don't  spend  all  day  thinking  about 
 it  but  if  you're  more  of  like  a  feminine 
 guy  a  younger  guy  you're  less  successful
[03:19] you're  more  of  like  a  normal  guy  you're 
 probably  quite  heavily  emotionally 
 invested  in  not  just  your  girlfriend  but 
 maybe  even  just  a  like  a  girl  that
[03:25] you've  got  a  crush  on  you  so  emotionally 
 thinking  about  her  all  the  time  you  know 
 you're  so  excited  when  she  sends  you  a 
 text  message  flip  this  around  and  the
[03:31] more  that  someone  else  thinks  about  you 
 cares  about  you  feels  things  because  of 
 you  the  more  that  they  are  obsessed  with
[03:36] you  and  there's  five  tricks  five  things 
 we  can  do  to  spike  how  much  they  are
[03:41] emotionally  invested  into  you  Number  One 
 Polarized  polarized  means  to  push  people 
 to  the  extreme  dreams  of  loving  you  or
[03:46] hating  you  too  many  guys  are  so  soft  and 
 so  weak  that  they'll  keep  people  near 
 the  middle  that  they  don't  want  to
[03:51] offend  anyone  the  only  way  that  you'll 
 find  who  is  real  the  only  way  that 
 you'll  find  people  who  really  [ __ ]  with
[03:56] you  is  by  pushing  people  to  the  extremes 
 and  like  really  showing  almost  quite 
 extreme  versions  of  your  personality  and
[04:02] your  viewpoints  because  when  you  show 
 those  like  extreme  viewpoints  that  you 
 have  that's  when  anyone  else  who's
[04:07] similar  to  that  will  be  like  oh  wow  I 
 love  that  guy  I  love  his  takes  or  some 
 people  will  say  wait  I  hate  him  either
[04:13] way  whether  they  love  you  or  hate  you 
 they're  obsessed  with  you  the  second 
 psychological  trick  that  you  can  use  to
[04:18] make  people  obsessed  with  you  is  to  be 
 relatable  and  you  can  see  that  so 
 clearly  with  this  channel  if  you  are
[04:23] relatable  if  you  are  just  like  that 
 person  they'll  think  about  you  more 
 because  they're  able  to  like  put
[04:28] themselves  in  your  shoes  and  if  you're 
 able  to  be  relatable  but  slightly  ahead 
 of  them  especially  in  the  things  that
[04:34] matter  they'll  be  so  like  you  know 
 emotional  they'll  be  thinking  like  well 
 like  that  guy's  so  similar  to  me  but 
 he's  done  something  different  for
[04:40] example  let's  use  me  when  I'm  10  years 
 old  and  I'm  a  little  brown  kid  right 
 specifically  Brown  okay  and  I  see  some
[04:46] millionaire  walk  past  and  the 
 Millionaire's  an  old  white  guy  oh  wow 
 that's  really  interesting  he's  a  million 
 oh  imagine  if  I  then  see  a  millionaire
[04:52] who's  a  brown  guy  who's  only  slightly 
 older  than  me  maybe  he's  like  20  years 
 old  which  one  am  I  able  to  relate  to
[04:57] more  well  of  course  the  younger  Brown 
 guy  he's  going  to  be  in  my  mind  a  lot 
 more  than  [ __ ]  Colonel  Sanders  if
[05:03] he's  in  my  mind  more  than  I'm  more 
 obsessed  with  him  I'll  be  going  home 
 thinking  he  seems  similar  to  me  how  did 
 he  make  so  much  money  the  third  thing
[05:08] you  can  do  to  get  people  obsessed  with 
 you  is  to  get  them  to  open  up  and  this 
 is  perhaps  like  the  one  that  I  use  quite
[05:14] like  negatively  and  maybe  manipulate  I 
 didn't  I  mean  I  don't  know  for  just 
 obviously  a  few  years  ago  back  in  the 
 [ __ ]  boy  days  like  it's  you  know  girls
[05:20] are  in  love  with  me  she's  next  to  me 
 sleeping  and  stuff  and  you  know 
 obviously  being  sexual  and  stuff  it 
 opens  up  and  so  if  she's  gonna  open  up
[05:26] emotionally  to  me  more  and  tell  me  like 
 you  know  deeper  things  or  experience 
 deeper  emotions  with  me  and  of  course
[05:32] she's  going  to  be  more  obsessed  with  me 
 and  again  this  is  what  I've  been  able  to 
 do  in  a  more  positive  way  with  what  I'm 
 doing  now  because  the  nature  of  the  work
[05:38] that  we  do  here  talking  about 
 self-improvement  the  deep  [ __ ]  that 
 we've  been  through  usually  when  I'm 
 speaking  to  my  boys  who  follow  me  you'll
[05:43] end  up  opening  up  and  telling  me  some 
 stuff  and  when  you  open  up  to  someone 
 you  start  thinking  about  them  more  you
[05:48] start  obsessing  over  them  all  because 
 you've  kind  of  shared  a  piece  of  your 
 experiences  feelings  and  maybe  traumas
[05:54] the  four  psychological  trick  that  you 
 can  use  to  get  people  obsessed  with  you 
 and  perhaps  my  favorite  which  is  ah  I
[06:00] feel  like  a  bad  person  talking  about  my 
 [ __ ]  buddies  but  it's  like  it's  a  part 
 of  me  um you  know  I'm  grateful  for
[06:05] everything  expressed  the  fourth  thing 
 you  can  do  is  create  an  enemy  we  have  an
[06:10] enemy  don't  we  and  you  know  some  people 
 think  it's  Jeffrey  not  really  Jeffrey's 
 like  the  younger  version  of  us  who's 
 just  not  really  on  self-improvement  but
[06:16] he's  not  like  a  bad  person  the  enemy  is 
 the  modern  addictions  the  modern  sort  of 
 system  that  has  bred  us  and  conditioned
[06:21] us  to  be  weak  it's  the  social  media 
 companies  the  porn  companies  only  fans 
 that  is  the  enemy  if  you  create  an  enemy
[06:27] for  yourself  and  the  person  that  you 
 want  to  obsess  over  you  it  will  create 
 the  psychological  term  what's  called  in
[06:32] group  and  out  group  people  will  identify 
 with  you  and  want  to  be  on  your  side 
 it's  like  you're  fighting  a  war  and  that
[06:38] is  so  Primal  so  animalistic  that  people 
 will  just  automatically  think  about  you 
 and  our  side  more  which  is  emotional
[06:44] Investments  I  I  use  this  in  a  quite 
 negative  way  to  be  honest  I  never 
 started  doing  this  purposefully  when  I
[06:49] was  like  a  [ __ ]  boy  you  know  creating  an 
 enemy  meant  that  there  was  like  two 
 girls  who  were  arguing  with  each  other  I 
 didn't  do  that  like  on  purpose  thinking
[06:54] oh  yeah  if  I  create  an  enemy  a  little 
 it'll  be  psychological  trivia  it  was 
 just  more  that  like  I  was  [ __ ]  two 
 girls  and  like
[06:59] I  didn't  really  do  it  on  purpose  but  it 
 ended  up  achieving  what  I  wanted  at  the
[07:04] time  and  now  it's  very  clear  that  I'm 
 doing  it  purposefully  I  have  created  an 
 enemy  for  us  because  it's  causing  us  to
[07:10] rise  up  and  actually  take  this  so  much 
 more  seriously  and  the  fifth  thing 
 you're  really  gonna  like  this  one  the 
 fifth  thing  that  you  can  do  to  make
[07:15] people  obsessed  with  you  stay  mysterious 
 a  lot  of  guys  don't  have  the  confidence 
 for  this  and  they'll  spill  everything
[07:21] about  them  straight  away  and  so  once  the 
 mystery  is  gone  it's  kind  of  like  yeah 
 well  I  don't  need  to  think  about  you
[07:26] anymore  do  I  so  when  you  meet  a  new  girl 
 for  example  are  you  the  kind  of  guy  who 
 just  opens  up  and  just  talks  and  talks
[07:31] and  talks  and  talks  or  do  you  maintain 
 like  almost  a  level  of  mystery  because 
 if  you  keep  some  mystery  if  you  don't
[07:36] reveal  everything  about  you  it  will  make 
 the  other  person  think  about  you  more 
 not  less  more  because  there's  more  that
[07:42] they  want  to  piece  together  they  want  to 
 like  solve  you  they  want  to  like  figure 
 you  out  if  you  tell  someone  everything
[07:47] there  is  about  you  which  most  guys  they 
 are  my  favorite  color  my  favorite  type 
 of  music  what's  your  favorite  type  of
[07:52] music  yeah  I  play  video  game 
 today  but  today  I  did
[07:57] until  3  P.M  and  then  I  most  guys  aren't 
 mysterious  at  all  so  it's  obvious  that 
 like  most  girls  aren't  going  to  be 
 obsessed  with  that  guy  the  girls  are
[08:02] obsessed  with  the  guy  who  stays 
 mysterious  maybe  you're  watching  this 
 right  now  thinking  wait  this  is 
 controversial  as  [ __ ]  I  don't  want  to  be
[08:07] a  bad  person  you  can  use  these 
 psychological  tricks  for  good  psychology 
 is  not  inherently  a  bad  thing  it  can  be
[08:13] used  negatively  and  I  hold  my  hand  up  I 
 hold  like  responsibility  for  this  and 
 say  yes  I  use  it  in  a  negative  way  but
[08:19] it  can  also  be  used  positively  and  again 
 I  hold  my  hand  up  and  say  yes  I  take 
 responsibility  I  have  used  it  in  this
[08:25] way  it  sounds  kind  of  bad  to  learn  and 
 to  utilize  you  know  tricks  to  use  on 
 people  but  I  think  it's  better  to  learn
[08:31] this  stuff  and  use  it  in  a  good  way  than 
 it  is  to  just  like  blindly  navigate  in 
 the  dark  we  are  in  a  new  age  of  business
[08:37] and  success  and  we're  in  the  age  where 
 the  new  currency  is  attention  if  you  can 
 make  people  obsessed  with  you  you  can
[08:42] become  extremely  wealthy  extremely 
 successful  and  you  can  make  huge
[08:47] movements  so  you  can  use  these 
 psychological  tricks  that  will  make 
 people  obsess  with  you  for  good  do  the
[08:52] hard  work  especially  when  you  don't  feel 
 like  it  mwah
