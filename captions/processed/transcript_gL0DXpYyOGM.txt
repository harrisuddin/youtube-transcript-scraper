[00:00] so  you're  stuck  in  the  first  stage  of 
 self-improvement  the  self-improvement 
 struggle
[00:05] you  know  about  self-improvements  you've 
 seen  the  results  of  it 
 you  might  have  experienced  some  results
[00:10] of  it  yourself  but 
 you're  still  stuck  in  that  depressive 
 period  you  haven't  dropped  your
[00:15] addictions 
 you  have  for  a  couple  of  days  max 
 and  then  you're  jacking  off  five  times  a
[00:20] day  again  and  then  you're  playing  league 
 of  legends  again  and  then  you're  taking 
 whatever  [ __ ]  drug  you're  addicted  to
[00:25] again 
 and  you  just  can't  seem  to  get  away  from 
 it  if  you  want  this  video  to  help  you  if 
 you  want  me  to
[00:30] help  you  lose  your  ego 
 your  brain  is  the  reason  why  you  are
[00:35] still  here 
 distrust  your  brain  i  can't  tell  you
[00:40] any  advice  up  until  you  can  trust  my 
 brain  over  yours 
 your  brain  is  the  reason  why  you  are
[00:45] still  in  this 
 period  you  still  have  depression  none  of 
 this  not  meditation  doesn't  work  for  you
[00:51] shut  up 
 your  brain  is  has  convinced  you  and  you 
 are  still  in  this  position  because  you
[00:56] keep 
 listening  to  your  brain  so  you  must 
 distrust  your  brain  hopefully  put  your 
 trust  in  someone  else
[01:01] that's  scary  if  you  can't  do  that  then 
 there's  no  point  watching  my  videos 
 hopefully  i've  i've
[01:06] become  the  trustworthy  guide  for  you 
 that  hopefully 
 just  stop  thinking  about  what  your  brain 
 says  and  just  start  thinking  okay
[01:12] what  is  hamza's  brain  recommending  to  me 
 let's  begin  you've  made  fake  attempts  at
[01:17] stopping  your  addiction  and  it's  usually 
 the  type  of  attempts  that  i  criticize  on
[01:22] my  channel  and  yet  you  keep 
 doing  them  you  deleted  the  social  media 
 apps  you  uninstalled  league  of  legends
[01:28] you  threw  away  the  junk  food  you  threw 
 away  the 
 the  drug  that  you  have  in  your  house 
 congratulations
[01:34] you're  a  [ __ ]  when  you're  ready  to  stop 
 the  addiction  properly  please  take  this 
 advice 
 do  not  throw  them  out  by  deleting  social
[01:41] media 
 you're  a  [ __ ]  because  the  reason  why 
 you're  deleting  social  media  isn't 
 because  you're  done  with  it  it  isn't
[01:47] because  you  no  longer  use  it 
 it's  because  you  think  that  just  by 
 holding  the  button  and  pressing  the  x 
 that  oh  oh  i'm  cured  of  the  addiction
[01:53] hamza  are  you  happy  i  deleted  social 
 media  yesterday  i'm  sorry  i  don't  even 
 use  that  [ __ ]  anymore  hamza
[01:58] i  i  uninstalled  league  of  legends  hamza 
 you're  a  [ __ ] 
 you  want  easy  validation  from  me  maybe
[02:03] from  yourself  maybe  from 
 someone  else  you  want  easy  validation 
 without  actually  doing  the  work  what  we
[02:08] want  is  league  of  legends  installed  on 
 your  computer  what  we  want  is 
 instagram  and  whatever  the  [ __ ]  apps
[02:13] you  use  installed  on  your  phone 
 and  we  want  to  slightly  very  slightly
[02:18] build  up  that  willpower  in  you  where  you 
 go  onto  the  apps  less 
 at  this  stage  if  you're  stuck  in  stage
[02:23] one  your  mindset  is  your  biggest  problem 
 it's  your  brain  that's  the  problem  but 
 there's  a  part  of  your  brain  that  could
[02:28] just  choose  to 
 stop  listening  to  itself  and  i  hope  that
[02:33] you  can  just 
 turn  that  part  on  and  start  thinking  you 
 know  what  whatever  thoughts  whatever
[02:38] impulses  i  get  in  my  brain  has  led  me  to 
 this  moment  if  i  keep  listening  to  these 
 impulses
[02:44] i'm  going  to  stay  here  my  brain  is  not 
 good  enough 
 now  there's  this  guy  on  youtube  and
[02:49] maybe  i've  had  a  coaching  call  with  him 
 he  seems  to  know  what  he's  talking  about 
 you  must  just  turn  that  on
[02:54] because  the  next  thing  we've  got  to  talk 
 about  is  streaks  if  you're  stuck  in 
 stage  one 
 it's  because  you  haven't  taken  the  good
[02:59] advice  of  forgetting  about  streaks 
 you  still  want  your  nofap  streak  you 
 start  but  i  i  got  to  day  three  yesterday
[03:06] and  now  i've  reset  my  stream 
 you're  still  talking  about  streaks 
 streaks  are
[03:11] entirely  toxic  you  will  fail  the  streak 
 i  will  fail  the  streak  that's  why  i
[03:17] don't  why  why 
 would  i  set  a  goal  that  i  would 
 literally  100 
 of  the  time  be  failing  how  silly  is  that
[03:23] when  you  set  a  streak  you're  literally 
 saying  to  yourself 
 of  course  i'm  going  to  do  this  thing  one
[03:28] more  time  in  my  life  so  i'm  going  to  set 
 this  goal 
 and  there  is  a  100  chance  that  i'm  going 
 to  fail  it  eventually
[03:33] but  you  get  to  say  that  you're  on  day  7 
 of  nofap  you  get  to  say  oh  it's  been 
 three  days  since  i've  played  league  of
[03:38] legends  it's  been  i've  worked  out  three 
 days  in  a  row  congratulations 
 you  want  that  social  validation  again
[03:43] because  you're  a  [ __ ]  forget  the  90-day 
 challenge 
 dumbass  forget  that  the  nofap  the  month
[03:48] of  nofap  and  stuff  forget  all  of  that 
 you  aren't  good  enough  for  the  street 
 you  aren't  good  enough  for  7x  whatever
[03:54] days  you  want  to  go  to  you  aren't  good 
 enough  for  that  yet  you've  got  to  lose 
 your  ego  and  think  you  know  what 
 i  am  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  i've  got  a  pawn
[04:01] addiction  i've  got  a  [ __ ]  league  of 
 legends  addiction  i've  got  i've  got  an 
 addiction  to  weed  into  some 
 [ __ ]  i'm  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  you've  got  to
[04:08] have  that  in  your  mind  first  of  all  and 
 think  you  know  what 
 i'm  not  so  great  and  so  by  setting  a
[04:13] goal  trying  to 
 not  fap  for  30  days  when  i've  got  a  porn 
 addiction
[04:18] it's  probably  not  gonna  work  out  is  it 
 so  then  don't  do  it  because  the  better 
 way  doesn't  get  you  the  social
[04:23] validation  but  it  does  get  you  out  of 
 this 
 this  depressive  period  so  hopefully 
 you'd  like  to  follow  that
[04:28] the  better  way  is  to  forget  about 
 streaks  and  just  think  about 
 how  many  times  you've  done  the  bad
[04:33] behaviors  or  the  good  behaviors 
 over  a  given  period  that's  why  we  put
[04:38] our  trust  into  these  systems  that  you 
 can't  see  right  now  but  we  put  our 
 trust  into  these  self-improvement
[04:43] systems  like  the  habit  tracker 
 that's  what  we  do  it  on  we  don't  set  a 
 nofap  streak 
 we  don't  say  oh  for  30  days  i'm  not
[04:49] going  to  attack  for  90  days  i'm  going  to 
 go  on  a  dopamine  day  shut 
 up  we  don't  do  the  x  days  challenge
[04:54] because  we  are  not  [ __ ]  we're  not 
 doing  this  for  social  validation  and  the 
 reason  why  you're  still  stuck  in  this
[04:59] stage 
 is  because  you  keep  doing  it  for  social 
 validation  you  want  people  to  hear  your 
 story  of  our  i  was  on  90  day  streak  and
[05:06] that's  why  you  keep  failing  because  that 
 you  can't  succeed 
 when  you've  set  this  dumb  ass  challenge
[05:12] so  in  terms  of  your  bad  habits  let's  say 
 fapping 
 instead  of  setting  the  intention  to  go 
 onto  nofap  and  to  do  a  nofap  streak
[05:19] what  you're  now  going  to  do  is  track  it 
 and  you're  going  to  see  what  is  average
[05:24] for  your  fapping  behaviors  for  a  month 
 let's  say  you  jack  off  20  times  in  this 
 month 
 well  then  guess  what  next  time  we're
[05:29] going  to  aim  for  15.  and  the  next  month 
 we're  going  to  aim  for  12  and  the  next 
 month  we're  going  to  aim  for  10  you  can
[05:34] see  what  we're  doing  you  are  not  good 
 enough  you  haven't  leveled  yourself  up 
 to  the  point  where  you  can  just  make  a
[05:39] zero  you  haven't  leveled  yourself  up  to 
 the  point  that  you  could  even  make  it  10 
 per  month  right  now  because  you  can't
[05:45] because  what  of  what  i've  just  said 
 either  offended  you  or  because  you 
 didn't  want  to  listen  to  it
[05:50] you  will  not  make  any  progress  you  can 
 only  make  progress  when  you  lower  your 
 ego  and  really  really  see  where  you're
[05:55] at  and 
 just  think  about  your  behaviors  recently 
 think  about  your  mindset  recently
[06:00] you  aren't  that  great  you  are  a  piece  of 
 [ __ ]  right  now  and  a  piece  of  [ __ ] 
 isn't  supposed  to  suddenly  be  able  to
[06:05] stop  their  porn  addiction 
 because  you've  been  leveling  this  porn 
 addiction  up  for  like  five  years
[06:10] straight  so  how  are you  expecting  to 
 just  suddenly  drop  it 
 and  have  the  the  willpower  of  it  like  of
[06:15] a 
 warrior  you  are  not  that  great  right  now 
 you  aren't  that  important  you  aren't 
 that  special  you're  actually  a  piece  of
[06:20] and  this  keeps  hurting  if  this  is 
 pissing  you  off  right  now  this  is  why  i 
 want  you  to  be  thinking  of  what  your
[06:26] thoughts  feel 
 as  i've  just  called  you  a  piece  of  [ __ ] 
 five  times  in  this  video  if  you're
[06:31] offended  at  that 
 if  it  does  something  inside  of  you  where 
 you're  like  wait  this  guy's  a  prick  he's
[06:36] like 
 he's  not  helping  that  actually  this 
 guy's  the  piece  of  [ __ ]  it's  your  ego 
 you  know  deep  down  we  all  know  deep  down
[06:41] with  the  type  of  behaviors  you  have  that 
 you're  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and  until  you  can 
 accept  that  you're  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and
[06:46] say  you  know  what 
 tomorrow  i'd  like  to  be  one  percent  less 
 of  a  piece  of  [ __ ] 
 and  again  and  again  and  again  because
[06:52] you  can't  accept  that  because  you  still 
 have  this  this  arrogance  and  this 
 ignorance  to  think  no  i'm  actually
[06:57] pretty  sick  even  though  you 
 you  don't  really  believe  it  you  won't  do 
 the  tasks  you  won't  do  the  work  required
[07:03] lose  the  ego  the  book  ego  is  the  enemy 
 by  ryan  holiday  may  help  you 
 i  highly  suggest  you  have  a  look  at  that
[07:09] it's  literally  like  two  pounds  on 
 kendall  just  buy  it 
 trying  to  stop  your  addictions  in  a  fake 
 manner  it's  fueled  by  haste
[07:15] you  throw  out  the  addiction  in  a 
 monumental  event 
 but  inside  your  mind  you  knew  that  it
[07:20] was  not  the  last  time 
 when  you  uninstalled  league  of  legends 
 you  knew  that  it  wasn't  the  last  time 
 you'd  ever  play  that  game
[07:26] when  you  delete  reddit  or  instagram  or 
 or  snapchat  or  you  unfollow  your  ex  you
[07:31] knew  that  that  was  not  the  last  time  you 
 ever  do  that  behavior 
 and  so  you  do  it  because  you  want  the 
 social  validation  you  want  you  do  it
[07:37] because  you  want  to  tell  someone  huh 
 i  deleted  instagram  but  if  it's  some 
 kind  of  monumental  events  where  you
[07:42] delete  something  you  throw  away 
 the  addiction  it's  not  going  to  work  you 
 are  still  addicted  until  you  can  have
[07:47] the  thing 
 in  front  of  you  and  you  choose  not  to  do 
 it  if  it  if  all  you  do
[07:52] is  throw  the  chocolate  bar  away  then 
 you're  you  still  have  an  addiction 
 you're  just 
 right  now  not  going  to  indulge  because
[07:58] it's  not 
 in  front  of  you  congratulations  you're 
 you're  cured  for  three  hours  up  until 
 you  go  and  buy  some  more  chocolate  or  up
[08:04] until  you  download  league  of  legends 
 again  that  isn't  the  fix  how  many  times 
 have  i 
 if  you've  been  watching  my  videos  for  a
[08:09] while  how  many  times  have  i  said  that  we 
 don't  uninstall  this  stuff 
 we  keep  it  on  our  computers  i  still  have
[08:14] all  of  the  video  games  on  my  computers 
 but 
 will  will  power  get  strained  willpower
[08:19] is  limited  yes  it  is 
 that's  how  we  level  it  up  you've  watched
[08:24] the  one  video  by 
 he's  a  fantastic  youtuber  but  you've 
 watched  that  one  video  by  the  youtuber
[08:29] what  i've  learned 
 and  he  said  that  willpower  is  limited 
 and  it  is  but  that  is  how  we  level  it  up
[08:34] that's  like  saying  oh  but  wait  if  i  go 
 to  the  gym  tomorrow 
 my  muscles  will  be  sore  if  my  muscles
[08:41] are  sore  then  that  means  they'll  get 
 weaker  yeah 
 dumbass  because  they  get  stronger 
 afterwards
[08:47] so  when  we  deplete  our  willpower  by 
 having  the  chocolate  bar  in  front  of  us 
 and  just 
 looking  at  it  eventually  we  might
[08:52] indulge  but  if  we  spent  the  entire  day 
 just  just  this  will  power  of  inside  of 
 us  just  learning  what  our  mind  is  like
[08:57] just  staring  at  the  chocolate  bar  and 
 just  thinking  like 
 being  mindful  of  our  cravings  eventually
[09:03] we're  probably  gonna  eat  the  chocolate 
 and  at  the  end  of  the  night  our 
 willpower  is  gonna  be  depleted  perhaps 
 we  might  even  do  some  of  the  bad  habits
[09:09] but  tomorrow  we're  going  to  wake  up  with 
 a  recharge  willpower  and  it's  going  to 
 be  slightly  bigger  than  it  was  yesterday
[09:14] because  you  just  slightly  leveled  it  up 
 you've  just  been  training 
 the  willpower  skill  too  often  i've  seen
[09:19] guys  who  don't  even  want  to  induce  or 
 think  about  willpower  at  all 
 and  they  want  easy  little  systems  they
[09:24] want  technology  to  help  them 
 they  want  to  delete  the  apps  because 
 yeah  it's  going  to  take  it's  going  to 
 add  some  friction  to  the  habit  it's
[09:29] going  to  take  me  a  few  more  seconds  to 
 download  it  again  and  how  many  times 
 have  you  deleted  the  app
[09:34] how  many  times  has  it  really  helped  you 
 i  haven't  used  snapchat  in  a  while  i 
 still  have  it  on  my  phone  i  haven't 
 binge  in  a  long  time  and  i  still  have
[09:40] all  the  foods  that  i  would  binge  on  and 
 that's  why  i've  i've  cured  these 
 problems  is  because  i've  kept  them  in
[09:46] front  of  me 
 so  that  my  willpower  keeps  increasing 
 every  single  day 
 you're  hiding  away  from  it  because  you
[09:51] don't  want  the  discomfort  of  just 
 acknowledging  that  your  willpower  is 
 like  you  know  being  used  right  now 
 but  that's  how  we  level  it  up  if  you're
[09:57] in  this  stage  stage  one  of  the 
 self-improvement  struggle  please 
 forget  about  women  forget  about  getting
[10:03] laid  just 
 hold  it  in  be  a  [ __ ]  monk  if  you're 
 literally  depressed  right  now 
 if  you  feel  like  you've  got  porn
[10:08] addiction  feel  like  you've  got  a  weed 
 addiction  or  a  binge  you  know  mental 
 health  problems 
 thinking  about  women's  gonna  make  it
[10:13] worse  you've  got  bigger  things  on  your 
 plates  this  is  on  the  red  pill  this  is 
 like  something  that's
[10:18] so  so  heavily  talked  about  on  the  ask 
 trp  subreddits  where  all  these  dumbass 
 little  19  year  olds  are  talking  about
[10:24] wanting  to  get  girls  and  this  and  this 
 and  this 
 and  it's  like  they  haven't  even  checked 
 off  the  step  one  of  self-improvement
[10:29] which  is 
 work  on  yourself  if  your  mental  health 
 isn't  right  if  anything  isn't  right
[10:34] your  success  with  women  is  trash  because 
 let's  say  perfect  scenario 
 you  meet  the  girl  who's  gonna  save  you
[10:39] from  demand  oh  you  know  the  one  special 
 girl's  gonna  help  you  yeah 
 perfect  relationship  you're  gonna  [ __ ]
[10:44] it  up  because  you're  depressed  because 
 you're  in  this  depressive  struggle 
 period  your  framish  trash  you're  not
[10:49] masculine 
 you're  going  to  [ __ ]  it  up  and  feel  even 
 worse  wouldn't  you  like  to  just  wait 
 and  meet  the  girl  when  you're  already
[10:55] doing  good  how  about  you  go  hook  up  with 
 a  girl  oh  you  got  the  the  big  boy 
 confidence  me  me  big  alpha  male
[11:00] me  have  sex  with  lots  of  women 
 congratulations  you're  gonna  have  this 
 empty 
 nihilistic  feeling  afterwards  this
[11:06] darkness  feeling  where  you  finally  got 
 everything  you  wanted  and  you  realized 
 it  was  literally  just  a  stinky  wet  hole
[11:11] congratulations  your  depression  is  worse 
 now 
 life  feels  pointless  because  you've 
 literally  gotten  the  height  of  the
[11:17] masculine  experience  which 
 you  actually  believe  that  is  the  height 
 for  some  reason  instead  of  thinking  of
[11:22] achieving  your  purpose  and  so  you  feel 
 like 
 and  you're  not  going  to  enjoy  it  because 
 you've  got  mental  health  problems 
 because  you're  going  to  be  you're
[11:27] literally  gonna  be  having  sex 
 with  a  girl  whilst  having  insecure 
 thoughts  whilst  having  like 
 mindlessness  you  have  the  confidence  to
[11:32] go  approaching  well  you're  gonna  get 
 black-pilled  immediately  because  you've 
 got  such  a  horrible  mindset  right  now
[11:37] women  should  not  be  in  your  life  at  all 
 in  stage  one  and  i  know  that  there's 
 gonna  be  some  random  [ __ ]  whoa  but  i'm
[11:43] in  stage  one  and  my  girlfriend  shut  up 
 bro 
 you  would  level  up  so  much  faster  if  you 
 just  put  100  of  your  focus  onto  this  and
[11:50] it's  almost  like  a  meditative  practice 
 when  you  see  your  mind 
 bring  up  the  fact  that  women  and  sex 
 exist  if  you  feel  like  you  need  to  go
[11:56] for  a  fap  it's  because  you've  got  an 
 addiction  not  because  you're  actually 
 that  horny 
 just  sit  there  and  just  feel  the  craving
[12:01] you  don't  actually  have  to  do  something 
 when  you  feel  horny  when  you  feel  the 
 need  to  go  and  watch  porn  try  this
[12:07] don't  do  it  we've  built  up  this  habit  to 
 think  okay 
 if  i  feel  like  i  should  watch  pawn  and
[12:12] jack  off  i  should  watch  pawn  and  jack 
 off  instead  of  thinking  okay  if  i  feel 
 like  i  should  watch  pawn  and  jack  off  i
[12:17] should  be  curious  to  actually  see 
 how  that  feels  why  is  that  coming  let  me 
 actually  feel
[12:22] that  craving  just  stop  doing  stuff  if 
 you're  in  this  stage 
 probably  the  best  thing  that  you  could
[12:28] do 
 is  sit  around  and  do  nothing  now  most
[12:33] guys  in  this  stage  won't  do  this  they 
 won't  take  this  advice  because  it 
 doesn't  seem  valuable 
 and  so  they'd  rather  keep  clicking  on
[12:38] the  youtube  videos  hopefully  if  you  can 
 just  trust  what  i  say 
 as  someone  who's  been  through  this  stage 
 as  someone  who's  helped  a  couple  of  guys
[12:43] from  the  stage 
 do  nothing  turn  everything  off  just  sit
[12:48] there  with  a  piece  of  paper  and  a  pen 
 all  day  every  day  this  isn't  a 
 short-term  thing  i'm  not  saying  oh  you
[12:53] know  check  off  the  journaling  box  and  do 
 it  for  five  minutes  no  no  i  mean 
 this  is  like  your  base  attack  now  this
[12:58] is  like  the  activity  that  you  just 
 do  like  there  isn't  much  else  that  you 
 do  in  your  day  apart  from  literally  just
[13:03] sit  there  and  just  journal 
 every  messed  up  thought  that  you  have  in 
 your  mind 
 at  this  stage  if  you've  been  stuck  in
[13:09] this  stage  now  you  can  experience  the 
 stage  fair  enough 
 but  if  you're  stuck  in  this  stage  it's 
 because  something  is  wrong  with  you
[13:15] mentally 
 yes  that's  offensive  and  you're  so 
 annoyed  that  i  said  something's  wrong 
 with  you  but 
 healthy  happy  people  aren't  stuck  at
[13:20] this  stage  and  there's  something  wrong 
 with  me  too  because  i  was  stuck  in  this 
 stage  for  a  [ __ ]  year 
 if  you're  stuck  in  this  stage  your
[13:25] journals  are  going  to  be 
 so  incredibly  valuable  to  yourself  into
[13:30] the  world 
 and  if  you  could  get  into  the  habit  of 
 journaling  for  hours  every  day  make  it
[13:35] like  literally 
 the  thing  that  you  do  like  you  are  now  a 
 journaler  you  literally  journal  for 
 every  hour  that  you  have  free  you
[13:41] journal  and  you  free  up  time  to  journal 
 that's  what's  going  to  get  you  out  of 
 here 
 and  you  are  going  to  be  so  so  grateful
[13:46] that  you've  got  a  couple  of  journals 
 after  this  because  you  might  be  able  to
[13:51] achieve  what  i've  done  here  where 
 because  you've  experienced  this  because 
 you've  journaled  it  so  much
[13:56] you've  now  got  an  exact  resource  and  the 
 perfect  mindset  to  help  someone  else  out 
 of  this 
 out  of  this  struggle  and  there's  a  lot
[14:02] of  people  here  and  this  is  somewhat  of  a 
 priceless 
 pain  point  to  solve  this  can  very  easily
[14:07] be  your  business  within  the  next  12 
 months 
 this  is  my  own  personal  story  but  you 
 might  not  believe  it  right  now  because
[14:12] you  know 
 you're  in  this  this  stage  but  if  you're 
 stuck  in  this  stage  just  know  as  someone 
 who  was  stuck  in  here
[14:17] once  you  do  the  right  things  you'll  look 
 back  and  you'll  be  grateful  for  it  this 
 will  be  one  of  the  most  important  parts
[14:22] of  your  life 
 and  that's  a  very  very  important  mindset 
 you're  stuck  in  this  stage  you're
[14:27] probably  a  young  man 
 you've  probably  got  this  ego  and  this 
 this  feeling  of  importance  that  right 
 now  it's  all  supposed  to  work  and  even
[14:33] though  you'll  you'll  disagree  with  that 
 you  won't 
 you'll  say  no  no  i  don't  expect  it  to 
 work  right  now  but
[14:38] you  do  your  biggest  issue  at  this  point 
 is  your  mindset 
 now  environment  environment  is  important
[14:45] an  environment  will  change 
 quite  a  lot  if  suddenly  you  moved  away 
 from  wherever  you're  living  if  you  moved
[14:51] to  somewhere  else  and  you  were  by 
 yourself  or  you  were  with  family  or 
 whatever  you  know  something  changed 
 that  would  probably  be  a  big  spike  but
[14:57] the  issue  with  that  is  that 
 it  would  only  be  a  big  spike  in  that  it 
 might
[15:02] allow  you  the  the  logistics 
 to  work  on  your  mind  and  so  really  that
[15:08] means  that  the  mind  is  the  most 
 important  part  because  where  are  all 
 your  problems  coming  from  now  you're 
 going  to  say  porn
[15:13] you're  going  to  say  food  you're  going  to 
 say  whatever  whatever  you  know  the 
 symptom  is  but  those  are  all
[15:18] that's  the  word  those  are  symptoms  your 
 porn  addiction  your  league  of  legends 
 addiction  your  social  media  addiction
[15:24] whatever  the  [ __ ]  bad  habits  you're 
 doing 
 those  are  only  symptoms  every  bad  thing 
 that  happens
[15:29] at  least  that  we  do  purposely  to 
 ourselves  is  a  symptom  of  something 
 wrong 
 in  here  and  you  probably  know  what  it  is
[15:35] you  probably  don't  need  me  to  tell  you 
 it's  something  to  do  with  abuse  or 
 something  to  do  with  trauma  it's  because 
 you  think  you're  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  because
[15:40] your  dad  abused  you  something 
 like  that  now  of  course  it's  different 
 for  everyone  but  it's  something  like  you
[15:45] probably 
 have  noticed  like  something  just  jumped 
 inside  of  you  and  you're  like  wait 
 this  [ __ ]  knows  like  something
[15:51] too  much  about  me  because  he  just 
 spelled  it  out  it's  something  about  that 
 and  if  you  don't  dive  deep  into  that
[15:56] through  journaling 
 it  won't  resolve  many  people  don't  ever 
 really  experience
[16:01] this  stage  they  go  from  not  thinking 
 about  self-improvement  not  knowing 
 self-improvement
[16:06] and  straight  to  self  stage  two  and 
 straight  on  to  stage  two  where  there's 
 some 
 you  know  like  kind  of  struggling  with
[16:12] consistency  but  they're  at  least  trying 
 it 
 the  people  who  get  stuck  in  this  stage 
 it's  because  of  the  mind  it's  because  of
[16:17] the  mental  health 
 only  a  few  people  seem  to  get  stuck  in 
 the  stage  but  they  get  stuck
[16:22] hard  and  the  issue  with  these  people  is 
 that  again 
 that  the  problem  is  the  mind  and  imagine
[16:28] trying  to  coach  someone  whose  problem  is 
 the  mind 
 whose  problem  is  his  own  ego  that  he 
 doesn't  believe  that  he's  in  stage  one
[16:34] it's  very  tricky 
 but  the  answers  are  all  there  you  could 
 use  this  one  video  in  a  couple  of  my
[16:40] different  other  videos 
 as  the  guide  to  your  life  right  now  but 
 only  if  you  can  reduce  your  ego  to  think
[16:45] that  this  is  actually  what  you  need 
 because 
 if  you're  in  this  stage  you're  probably 
 thinking  that  this  video  was  made  for
[16:51] someone  else 
 hopefully  not  now  because  you've  watched 
 this  far  of  it  but  that's  the  issue  with 
 helping  someone  in  this  stage
[16:56] they  didn't  watch  this  far  of  this  video 
 they  already  clicked  off  because 
 they  wanted  me  to  say  oh  straight  away
[17:02] cold  showers  will  save  you  uh 
 reading  this  book  this  this  one  thing
[17:07] this  one  quick  trick  it's  a  24-hour 
 reset  your  mind  they  want  to  hear  that 
 they  don't  want  to  hear  that  you're  a
[17:13] piece  of  [ __ ] 
 and  you've  got  to  be  less  of  a  piece  of 
 [ __ ]  tomorrow  one  percent  less  and  it's
[17:18] gonna  take  you  hundreds  of  days 
 potentially 
 to  stop  being  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and  you're 
 still  gonna  feel  like  one  afterwards
[17:23] it's  an  unsexy  answer  because  you've 
 been  sold  this  live  like  the  24-hour
[17:28] change 
 that's  what  it's  gonna  take  if  you're 
 stuck  in  this  stage  i  wish  i  could  hug 
 you  right  now  i  wish  i  could  just  tell
[17:33] you  that 
 you  will  come  out  of  this  stage  with 
 gratitude  but  you  need  to  suffer
[17:38] if  you're  stuck  in  here  honestly  you 
 need  to  suffer 
 that  suffering's  gonna  be  the  most
[17:43] profitable  suffering  you  ever 
 experienced  but 
 with  this  young  man's  ego  you're  not 
 going  to  realize  it  you're  going  to  be
[17:49] so  depressed  and  angry  about  it  you're 
 going  to  be  angry  about  your  anger 
 you're  going  to  be  depressed  about  your 
 depression
[17:54] you  can  have  negative  thoughts  because 
 you're  having  negative  thoughts  your 
 mind  is  your  biggest  enemy  right  now  and
[18:00] it's  uh  i  wish  i  could  just  just  almost 
 force  you 
 to  just  understand  that  it's  your  ego
[18:05] who's  telling  you 
 that  the  basic  habits  of 
 self-improvement  aren't  good  enough  for 
 you
[18:10] that  meditation  doesn't  work  that 
 journaling's  pointless  that 
 like  if  you're  stuck  in  the  stage  you
[18:15] have  not  been  consistently 
 exercising  meditating  and  journaling 
 every  single  day  now  you'll  say  you  have
[18:20] you'll  say  that  wait  but  i  did  meditate 
 but  you  meditated  once  you  meditated  20 
 times  congratulations  meditate  every
[18:26] single  day  for  the  rest  of  your  life  if 
 you  refuse  to  do  that 
 you  will  stay  here  if  you  refuse  to 
 journal  you  will  stay  here
[18:32] oh  but  but  i  exercise  but  you  exercise 
 twice  a  week  three  times  a  week 
 you've  got  to  be  exercising  at  least  six
[18:38] times  a week  there's  no  reason  not  to 
 exercise  seven  times  a  week  just  because 
 you're  on  some  [ __ ]  weight  lifting
[18:43] program  which  tells  you  of 
 ppl  or  whatever  it  doesn't  matter  humans 
 don't  take  rest  days  weight  lifters  can
[18:48] if  they're  competing  gymnastics  whatever 
 if  you're  competing  in  a  real  sport  you 
 can  take  a  rest  day  but  that  doesn't
[18:53] mean  that  you  should  then  just  be  an 
 inactive 
 weirdly  human  being  who  just  sits  there 
 on  his  computer  chair
[18:58] how  could  you  not  have  depression  with 
 the  things  that  you're  doing 
 get  a  picture  of  all  of  the  the  habits
[19:03] and  actions  that  you've  been  taking 
 how  could  you  not  be  in  this  stage  you
[19:08] deserve  to  be  in  this 
 stage  so  just  make  yourself  deserve  to 
 be  in  the  next  stage
[19:14] and  just  stop  listening  to  your  brain 
 set  the  plan 
 and  know  that  as  soon  as  you  deviate
[19:20] from  the  plan 
 it's  your  lizard  brain  get  used  to 
 telling  your  own  brain  to  shut  up  get
[19:25] used  to  listening  to  your  words  and 
 thinking  you  know  what  i  don't  trust 
 what  i've  just  thought 
 be  critical  of  your  own  brain  this  is
[19:31] some  of  the  best  advice  i've  ever  gave 
 out  of  my  mouth 
 listen  to  what  i've  just  said  be 
 critical  of  your  own  brain  it's  your  own
[19:37] voice  in  your  mind  that  is  the  lizard 
 brain  that's  telling  you  to  skip  the 
 workout  that's  telling  you  that  this
[19:42] video  is  not  important  it's  telling  you 
 that  you  don't  even  need  to  journal  it's 
 telling  you  that  meditation  doesn't  even 
 work 
 it's  telling  you  that  you  may  as  well
[19:48] give  up  hope  that  you  may  as well  just 
 go  jack  off  again  then  you  may  as  well 
 just  go  play  league  of  legends 
 it's  going  to  be  your  own  words  in  your
[19:53] brain  telling  you  to  do  that 
 don't  listen  to  your  brain  be  very 
 critical  of  every  thought  that  you  get
[19:58] spend  just  a  bit  of  time  planning 
 the  the  course  of  action  and  then  just
[20:03] make  it  so  clear  to  yourself  that  this 
 one  page 
 if  you  deviate  away  from  this  plan  that
[20:08] is  your  lizard  brain  that  is  failure 
 no  matter  how  logical  it  sounds  that  oh 
 we're  going  to  skip  the  workout  today
[20:13] because  tomorrow  we'll  do  it  all 
 we're  really  tired  today  it  doesn't 
 matter  if  you  don't  do  this  plan  you
[20:18] fail  and  hold  yourself  accountable  to 
 that 
 failure  do  the  hard  work  especially  when
[20:23] you  don't  feel  like  it
