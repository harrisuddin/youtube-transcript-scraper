[00:00] your  biggest  problem  is  your  lizard 
 brain 
 you're  probably  not  gonna  believe  me  but 
 i  don't  even  hear  mine  anymore
[00:06] i  can't  even  tell  you  the  last  time  that 
 i  heard  the  voice  in  my  head 
 trying  to  give  me  an  excuse  to  not  go  to
[00:12] the  gym  i  can't  remember  the  last  time 
 when  my  lizard  brain  tried  to  convince 
 me  to  play  video  games  to  watch  porn  to
[00:17] waste 
 time  life  is  amazing  when  you  destroy 
 your  lizard  brain
[00:22] everything  that  you  want  in  your 
 self-improvement  benefits  from 
 overcoming  your  lizard  brain  so  i'm
[00:27] going  to  teach  you  exactly  how  i've  done 
 it  let's  cover  some  sciency  [ __ ]  first 
 because  understanding  this
[00:32] is  half  the  battle  the  lizard  brain  is 
 the  amygdala 
 the  amygdala  is  one  of  the  oldest  parts
[00:37] of  our  brain  the  amygdala 
 is  the  reason  why  we  are  alive  today  it 
 is  the  reason  why  humans  are  still
[00:43] in  existence  because  that  was  the  part 
 of  our  brain  that  allowed  us  to  overcome 
 the  saber-toothed  tiger  that  attacked
[00:49] the  tribe  we  were  given  the 
 fight-or-flight  message  by  the  amygdala 
 it  kept  us  safe  it  is  an  amazing  strong
[00:56] part  of  our  brain  but 
 it's  not  as  strong  as  the  modern  day 
 addictions  the  software  developers
[01:01] and  the  food  companies  they  know  exactly 
 how  your  amygdala  works 
 and  so  they're  going  to  manipulate  that
[01:07] have  you  ever  felt  fomo 
 fear  of  missing  out  that  is  your 
 amygdala  lighting  up
[01:13] fear  of  missing  out  pretty  much  always 
 means  in  terms  of  social  experiences  and 
 it's  especially  experienced  in  people
[01:19] who  quit  social  media 
 they  want  you  to  feel  like  that  they 
 want  your  amygdala  to  give  you  that
[01:24] feeling  of  fomo  that  is  the  feeling  that 
 kept  people  alive  because  if  you  felt 
 that  fear  of  missing  out  there  was  a
[01:29] chance  that  you  would  be  banished  from 
 the  tribe  that  the  tribe  might  leave 
 without  you 
 that  is  what  kept  people  alive  again  the
[01:36] software  developers  know  that 
 they've  done  everything  in  their  power 
 to  make  sure  that  you  feel  that  fomo
[01:41] before  you  quit  social  media  just  know 
 that  most  of  your  problems  right  now 
 comes  from  your  amygdala  either  being
[01:46] manipulated  by 
 the  modern  day  society  that  we've  got  or 
 just  in  general  with  your  amygdala
[01:52] lighting  up  when  it's  not  supposed  to 
 this  is  also  how 
 anxiety  works  anxiety  is  just  when  your
[01:57] amygdala  is  overactive 
 the  amygdala  is  countered  by  the 
 prefrontal  cortex
[02:03] this  pfc  this  is  the  newest  part  of  our 
 brain  the  most  evolved  part  of  our  brain
[02:08] this  is  what  makes  humans  humans 
 if  you  can  remember  your  goals  if  you 
 can  remember  the  law  of  the  country  that
[02:14] you're  in 
 if  you  can  remember  that  it's  it's  bad 
 to  steal 
 to  punch  someone  that's  your  pfc  and
[02:21] what  we  want 
 in  every  endeavor  that  we're  trying  to 
 get  we  want  our  pfc  to  be  as
[02:26] active  as  possible  because  that  is  what 
 reminds  us  of  our  goals  you  can  probably 
 remember  sometimes  right  now  where  you
[02:31] had  an  internal  battle  the  words  in  your 
 mind  were  fighting  each  other  one  side 
 was  telling  you  to  do
[02:37] a  bad  activity  to  eat  the  junk  food  and 
 the  other  side  was  saying  no  no  but  if  i 
 eat  it  i  feel  guilty  and  you  know  i
[02:43] don't  want  to  eat  it  because  i've 
 already  broken  my  diet  once  this  week 
 this  clash  is  the  amygdala  fighting  the
[02:48] pfc 
 you  can  literally  hear  the  different 
 sides  of  your  brain 
 arguing  and  that's  a  good  thing  that  is
[02:55] at  least  you  having  a  decent  level  of 
 awareness  so  if  you  felt  this  before 
 you're  already  halfway  to  curing
[03:01] yourself  let  me  tell  you  my  personal 
 transformation 
 story  so  you  can  better  understand  this
[03:06] what  was  life  like  for  me 
 let's  say  a  year  or  two  ago  i  definitely
[03:11] although  i  didn't  have  any  kind  of 
 brain  scans  i  had  at  least  the  symptoms 
 of  someone  who  has  an
[03:16] overactive  amygdala  i  had  major  anxiety 
 i  genuinely  believed
[03:21] that  i  was  in  danger  every  single  day  no 
 no  that  that  is  me  literally 
 sugarcoating  it  i  believe  that  i  was  in
[03:27] danger  every  few 
 seconds  every  few  seconds  a  thought 
 would  pop  into  my  head
[03:32] that  guy  over  there  might  stab  you  that 
 guy  over  there  might  run  behind  you  and 
 put  you  into  a  chokehold
[03:37] don't  step  on  that  it  might  break  scary 
 do  you  think  i  was  focused  during  this 
 time  do  you  think  i  was  mindful  and
[03:42] grateful  of  the  moments  do  you  think  i 
 was 
 thinking  about  my  goals  no  i  was 
 thinking  about  skipping  the  gym  because
[03:48] on  the  way  to  the  gym 
 there  might  be  a  group  of  guys  who  tried 
 to  stab  me  so  i  missed  the  gym  i  missed 
 the  gym  quite  a  lot  now  i  have
[03:54] always  had  a  binge  eating  disorder  for 
 as  long  as  i  can  remember  i  have  over
[03:59] ate  even  when  i  am  sickly  full  to  the 
 point  that  i 
 my  stomach  genuinely  is  painful  with  how
[04:05] much 
 it's  been  pressed  and  i  feel  sick  and 
 disgusted  by  myself  but 
 i'd  continue  i  can  now  describe  this  as
[04:11] the  feeling  of  of  needing  to  eat  to 
 counter  the  thoughts  of  the  amygdala 
 it's  it's  kind  of  hard  to  explain  and  i
[04:17] know  that 
 someone  in  this  position  would  be  able 
 to  relate  if  you've  got  a  binge  eating
[04:22] disorder  you'll  know  exactly  what  i  mean 
 it  feels  like  there's  a  part  of  your 
 brain  that  you  have  to  satisfy  and
[04:29] only  when  it's  satisfied  do  you  move 
 into  the  pfc 
 in  which  then  you're  just  left  with  the
[04:34] guilt  and  disappointment  of  of 
 forgetting  about  your  goals  another 
 reason  why  i  believe  i've  always  had  a
[04:40] overactive  amygdala  is  because  i  am 
 prone  to  addiction 
 i  am  prone  to  overdoing  any  kind  of
[04:47] substance 
 including  drugs  including  video  games  i 
 found  that  when  i 
 get  into  something  and  i  seem  to  enjoy
[04:53] it  i  do  it  until  i  can't  do  it 
 anymore  the  drugs  that  i  talk  i  was 
 doing  them  every  day  including  ones  that
[04:59] you  wouldn't  even  believe  that  people 
 were  doing  every  day  like 
 mdma  is  reasonable  to  take
[05:05] let's  say  three  four  times  a  year  i  was 
 doing  it  twice  a  week  weed  obviously
[05:10] a  lot  of  people  smoke  weed  but  i  was 
 smoking  weed  not  just 
 every  day  but  all  day  i  was  waking  up
[05:16] smoking  it  and  smoking  until  it  was 
 bedtime 
 pretty  much  every  day  i  felt  powerless
[05:22] and  constantly  anxious  about  this  that 
 i  felt  anxious  until  i  had  that  thing
[05:27] that  cured 
 the  thought  of  the  amygdala  it's  truly 
 been  such  a  detriment  in  my  life
[05:32] and  now  that  i'm  at  this  stage  of 
 overcoming  the  lizard  brain
[05:37] i  look  back  and  i  get  quite  sad  because 
 to  cure  this  problem  all  it  really  took
[05:43] was  two  steps  of  education  and  just 
 doing  some  practical  steps  that  i'm
[05:48] going  to  tell  you 
 if  i  watched  this  video  10  years  ago  my 
 life  would  have  been  very  very  different
[05:53] of  course  you  know 
 i  can  say  i'm  grateful  for  this  stuff 
 now  so  it  doesn't  really  count  because 
 obviously 
 the  worst  things  that  have  happened  to
[05:58] me  that  you  know  the  addictions  and  all 
 this 
 is  why  i'm  here  today  so  i'm  grateful
[06:03] for  it  but 
 at  least  if  you're  watching  this  and 
 you're  currently  trying  to  quit  weed  if
[06:08] you're  watching  this  and  you  keep  binge 
 eating  if  you  keep  going  on  to  video 
 games  or  all  the  addictions  that  you've 
 got
[06:13] if  you  feel  like  that  lizard  brain  the 
 amygdala  is  just  [ __ ]  your  life 
 i  hope  to  give  you  that  value  that  will
[06:19] change  that  so  how  do  i  feel  now 
 after  around  eight  months  of
[06:24] actively  trying  to  destroy  this  lizard 
 burying  the  amygdala 
 how  do  i  feel  life  is  amazing
[06:31] i  i  am  being  honest  i  don't  hear  the  the 
 lizard  brain  in  my  mind  anymore  there  is
[06:36] no  clash 
 you  know  before  there  would  be  a  clash 
 where  you  know  you  should  go  you  should
[06:41] go  to  the  gym  you  want  to  make  muscle 
 you've  only  been  four  times  this  week 
 you  should  go  to  no  no  don't  go 
 don't  go  it's  comfy  right  now  you're
[06:46] comfy  in  bed  let's  go  play  video  games 
 no  don't  play  video  games  because  you've 
 been  playing  so  much  and  it's  not  good
[06:51] for  you 
 go  eat  the  junk  food  make  sure  you  eat 
 it  right  now  because  your  brother  might 
 eat  all  the  food  instead  so  if  you  don't
[06:57] eat  it  someone  else  will  eat  it  no 
 because  you're  in  a  calorie  deficit 
 you're  trying  to  cut  and  you've  been 
 bulking  up  whilst  on  this  cut  imagine
[07:03] that  being  in  your  mind  every  day  and 
 now  imagine  that  it's  not 
 at  all  that  when  i  wake  up  it's  like
[07:08] there's  only  one 
 source  of  thoughts  and  it's  coming  from 
 my  pfc  that  i  wake  up  yeah 
 it's  it's  the  gym  days  just  training  day
[07:15] and  it's  leg  day 
 i  don't  even  debate  it  there's  no  debate 
 and  now 
 it's  like  i  can  do  so  much  that  it  seems
[07:23] ridiculous  that  i  don't  just  go  and 
 train  once  in  the  gym  upper  body 
 just  today  this  this  is  i'm  gonna  be
[07:29] honest  this  is  not  a  special 
 day  at  all  i  woke  up  i  went  and  trained
[07:34] upper  body  for  about  one  hour  and  ten 
 [Music]
[07:42] minutes
[07:48] [Music]
[08:10] so
[08:17] i  then  put  on  my  gym  rings  let  me  show 
 you  my  gym  rings  bag 
 which  has  got  quite  a  lot  of  stuff  in
[08:23] this  bag  weighs  at  least 
 let's  say  five  kilograms  that's  probably 
 even  sugarcoating  it's  probably  a little
[08:28] bit  heavier  five  kilograms  and  then  i 
 ran 
 four  kilometers  with  that  to  my  gym  ring 
 spot  or  two  kilometers  to  my  gym  ring
[08:34] spot 
 hit  an  hour  of  gym  rings  training  here's 
 a  few  clips  as  well  we  also 
 tried  hitting  the  back  lever  for  the
[08:40] first  time  and  this  is  what  it  looked 
 like
[08:50] i  said  brace  that  core
[08:55] straight 
 bring  your  upper  body  a  little  bit
[09:00] higher  up  your  neck  and  your  upper  back
[09:20] uh 
 hold  up  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it 
 hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it
[09:25] hold  it 
 hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it 
 hold  it
[09:43] nice  nice  holy  [ __ ] 
 [Applause]
[09:48] what  the  [ __ ]
[09:55] all  right  yeah  go  down  right  then  bring 
 them  back  up  squeeze  squeeze  squeeze 
 squeeze  squeeze  squeeze  squeeze  squeeze
[10:00] squeeze 
 squeeze  man  that  is  it  that  is  it  that 
 is  it  that's  the  line
[10:05] that's  awesome  that's  the  line  that  is 
 the  line  there's  no  doubt  about  that  man 
 that  was  intense 
 pretty  sick  and  then  i  ran  another  two
[10:11] kilometers  back  this  was  first  thing  in 
 the  morning  so 
 essentially  i  did  three  training
[10:16] sessions  the  gym  session 
 the  weighted  run  and  the  gym  ring 
 session  and  i
[10:21] smiled  through  it  genuinely  i  smiled 
 through  it 
 it's  like  it  was  obviously  tough
[10:27] physically 
 but  honestly  it  was  it  was  pleasant
[10:32] emotionally  and  psychologically  and  this 
 has  never  been  the  case  before  these 
 last  few  months  where  i've  put  all  my
[10:37] intention 
 into  destroying  this  weak  part  of  my 
 brain  in  a  practical  sense  that  means
[10:42] that  i  don't 
 think  about  eating  the  chocolate  there 
 is  literally 
 two  bags  full  of  crisps  and  chocolate
[10:49] right  there  i  don't  touch  them 
 it  it's  not  even  that  you  know  that  i've 
 got  the  willpower  it's  like  willpower
[10:54] isn't  even  needed  it's  like 
 imagine  willpower  being  that  debate 
 between  the  pfc  and  the  amygdala  and  the
[10:59] pfc  winning 
 there  is  no  longer  a  debate  it  is 
 literally  just  the  thought  of  the  the
[11:04] prefrontal  cortex 
 and  honestly  it's  barely  even  the 
 thoughts  of  the  prefrontal  cortex  it's
[11:09] like 
 it's  not  even  in  my  mind  thinking  no 
 don't  eat  it  because  you've  got  goals 
 it's  like
[11:14] it's  nothing  it's  just  an  entity  in  this 
 world  that  means 
 nothing  to  me  how  sick  is  that  as
[11:20] someone 
 like  i  want  to  be  proud  of  myself  here 
 as  someone  who's  been  a  binge  eater  for 
 all  of  his  life
[11:25] there  is  the  the  stuff  that  i  would 
 binge  eat  right  there 
 and  it  does  nothing  to  me  anxiety  this
[11:32] is  probably  the  biggest  part  of  this 
 transformation 
 i  genuinely  had  severe  anxiety  and  here
[11:37] is  my  mental  health  score  when  i  took 
 the  nhs  test  now  i'm  gonna  be  honest  i
[11:42] don't  completely  believe  that  it  would 
 be  exactly  zero  zero 
 it  definitely  is  zero  for  depression  i
[11:47] feel  absolutely  no  depressive  symptoms 
 but  i'd  say  for  anxiety  realistically  if
[11:52] you  know  on  this  scale  of  zero  to  twenty 
 i  think  i'd  be  around  four  or  five  the
[11:57] reason  why  my  score  is  so  low 
 for  anxiety  on  this  test  is  just  because
[12:02] i  haven't  really  been  in  the 
 situations  much  where  anxiety  would 
 flare  up 
 my  anxiety  always  used  to  flare  up  when
[12:08] i'd  be  outside  and  especially 
 on  public  transport  now  it  was  active  in 
 the  house  as  well  but  either  way  you  can
[12:14] see  it's  been  a  terrific 
 progress  whether  or  not  you  know  the 
 scale  is  completely  accurate  or  whatever 
 but
[12:19] a  huge  progress  my  mind  is  so  still
[12:24] that  i  don't  feel  like  i'm  in  danger  how 
 amazing  is  that 
 and  personally  i  haven't  really  seen
[12:31] anyone 
 give  you  a  specific  guide  on  how  to  do
[12:36] this  or  at  least  you  know  tell  their 
 story  of  okay 
 this  is  the  lizard  brain  it  is  the  cause 
 of  your  problems  this  is  how  to  crush
[12:42] that  lizard  and  so 
 there  is  two  things  i  did  you're  already 
 gonna  know  what  they  are  meditation
[12:48] dopamine  detox  don't  click  away  just 
 because  i  said  meditation  there's  two 
 types  of  people  watching  this
[12:53] some  people  have  already  tried  to 
 meditate  because  i've  told  them  to  and 
 they're  like  oh  yes  like  meditation  is
[12:58] so  good 
 fair  enough  and  the  other  people 
 watching  this  tried  to  meditate  twice 
 it  didn't  work  for  them  so  now  they  get
[13:04] annoyed  anytime  someone  mentions 
 meditation  if  you're  that  person  know 
 that  you  are  truly  missing  out  and
[13:09] you've  just  got  this  dumbass  ego  that's 
 stopping  you  because  oh 
 you  tried  it  three  times  and  it  didn't
[13:14] have  an  effect  on  you  the  analogy  i 
 always  give  is  that  meditation  will  work 
 for  you
[13:19] just  stop  being  like  that  dumbass  who 
 goes  to  the  gym 
 three  days  and  says  oh  but  it  didn't
[13:24] even  work  i'm  still  fat 
 no  sh  you  have  been  doing  the  actions 
 that  have  polluted  your  brain
[13:30] with  the  internet  for  10  years  20  years 
 25  years 
 to  counteract  that  it's  not  going  to  be
[13:35] three  meditation  sessions  of 
 you  know  15  minutes  of  meditation  isn't 
 going  to  counter  that  you're  not  going 
 to  feel  that  at  all  but  five  minutes
[13:41] every  single  day  for  six  months 
 you  will  feel  it  and  when  you  feel  it 
 you  will  be  making  these  videos  just
[13:46] like  i  am  you'll  be  going  up  to  friends 
 and  family  and  almost  getting  a  little 
 bit  aggressive  thinking
[13:51] how  is  it  possible  that  other  people 
 don't  want  this  benefit  how  is  it 
 possible  that  other  people  refuse  to
[13:56] meditate  that  is 
 insane  like  you  have  to  genuinely  be 
 crazy
[14:01] to  not  want  these  benefits  i  feel  like 
 i'm  just  going  on  a  rant  but  at  least 
 that's 
 it  shows  how  much  meditation  has
[14:06] transformed  my  life  and 
 for  the  people  that  i've  put  onto  it 
 it's  the  exact  same  i'm  not  special
[14:11] they're  not  special  meditation  does  that 
 for  you  if  you  just 
 open  your  mind  up  to  it  and  stop  being
[14:16] so  ignorant  and  you  know  oh  but  it 
 didn't  even  work  for  me  shut  up  bro 
 didn't  even  work  for  me  oh  yeah  i 
 meditated  for  five  minutes  and  i  didn't
[14:22] counteract 
 20  years  of  internet  addiction  it  didn't 
 even  work  for  me 
 dumbass  so  on  a  lighter  note  okay  here
[14:27] is  my  meditation  stats 
 using  the  two  apps  that  i  use  i  forgot 
 what  it  is  exactly  but  it's  more  than
[14:33] 300  sessions  on  just  one  of  the  app 
 and  the  other  one  i  believe  is  about  35 
 at  total  hours  maybe  a  little  bit  more
[14:39] so 
 fantastic  this  is  over  eight  months 
 meditation 
 has  scientific  proof  that  it  alters  your
[14:45] brain  states 
 not  many  things  do  that  in  fact  only 
 from  what  i  know  only  a  few  a  handful  of
[14:52] things  do  that 
 and  that's  the  things  that  i  preach  to 
 you  guys  meditation  gratitude  journaling 
 daily  exercise  generosity
[14:58] kindness  loving  relationships  with 
 friends  and  family  meditation  has  that 
 proof
[15:03] that  it  reduces  activity  in  the  amygdala 
 and  increases  activity  in  the  prefrontal 
 cortex
[15:08] amazing  that  is  exactly  what  we're 
 trying  to  do  here 
 so  the  practical  advice  i  want  to  give
[15:13] to  you  is  to  think  of  meditation  as  a 
 lifelong  habits  to  stop  thinking  that  oh
[15:18] you  know  it's  something  you're  going  to 
 try  no  no 
 it  is  going  to  be  like  sleeping  and 
 eating  you're  going  to  be  sleeping  and
[15:23] eating  and  breathing 
 for  the  rest  of  your  life  every  single 
 day  well  i  want  you  to  now  consider
[15:28] meditation  as  part  of  one  of  those 
 baseline  activities  the  non-negotiable
[15:33] of  course  you're  going  to  be  sleeping 
 of  course  you're  going to  be  meditating 
 part  of  your  day  i  want  you  to  imagine
[15:38] being  65 
 still  meditating  every  single  day  that's 
 all  you  got  to  do  two  minutes  a  day
[15:43] one  minute  a  day  just  focus  on  that  stop 
 trying  to  think  oh  but  i  can't  feel  it 
 yeah  it  does  nothing  for  me  bro  it  does
[15:49] nothing  shut  up  bro  it  does  nothing  for 
 you  you've  done  it  for  like  two  weeks 
 or  you've  done  it  for  like  three 
 sessions  of  course  it  does  nothing  for
[15:55] you  if  you're  watching  my  videos  and 
 we're  a  few  minutes  into  this  now 
 put  your  trust  in  me  your  brain  what
[16:01] you're  hearing  in  your  mind  telling  you 
 that  it  doesn't  work 
 is  literally  the  amygdala  anytime 
 someone  tells  me  oh  meditation  doesn't
[16:07] work  that  is  your  amygdala 
 fighting  against  what  would  kill  it  so
[16:12] stop  listening  to  it  start  listening  to 
 my  brain  because 
 right  now  your  pfc  is  too  weak  for  you 
 to  even  listen  to  it  for  you  to  even
[16:18] hear  it 
 so  you've  got  to  listen  to  the  brain  of 
 someone  who's  putting  more  intention 
 into  this 
 and  if  i'm  telling  you  meditation's  good
[16:24] and  you've  been  watching  my  channel  and 
 [ __ ] 
 literally  what  do  i  gain  from  telling 
 you  to  meditate  meditation  is  is
[16:29] completely  free 
 no  one  gains  anything  from  you 
 meditating  i  want  to  be  recommending  it
[16:34] if  it  didn't  help 
 and  again  it's  got  to  be  a  daily  effort 
 it's  going  to  be  something  you  try  and 
 do 
 every  single  day  and  you  don't  hold  any
[16:41] kind  of  judgment  you  have  like 
 you  practice  a  bit  of  stoicism  and  you 
 don't  do  it  with  the  expectation  like  oh
[16:47] i  hope  to  clear  my  mind  of  thoughts 
 no  no  all  i  want  you  to  do  is  just  show 
 up  to  practice
[16:53] stop  thinking  about  clearing  your 
 thoughts  stop  thinking  about  does  it 
 work  it  doesn't  work  whatever 
 just  show  up  to  the  meditation  practice
[16:59] each  and  every  day 
 and  there'll  be  a  moment  where  it  just 
 hits  your  dumb  ass  and  you're  like  oh
[17:04] this  is  what  it  does  that's  amazing  i 
 wish  everyone  else  would  do  this  i  wish 
 i  started  this  earlier  that  hamza  guy
[17:09] was  right  i  shouldn't  have  been  a 
 dumbass  who  said  that  meditation  doesn't 
 work 
 and  finally  dopamine  detox  i  want  you  to
[17:15] think  right  now  that  all  those  easy 
 dopamine  those  instant  gratification 
 activities  that  we're  trying  to  avoid
[17:21] they  are  causing  your  amygdala  to  to  get 
 louder 
 so  severely  reducing  or  even  eliminating
[17:28] those  behaviors 
 would  then  at  least  stop  their  effect  on 
 your  amygdala  and 
 usually  when  you  go  onto  something  like
[17:34] the  dopamine  detox  and  you're 
 spending  most  of  your  day  on  delayed 
 gratification  like  exercise  and
[17:39] journaling 
 automatically  the  habits  that  you  then 
 choose  to  level  up 
 are  also  the  habits  that  level  up  your
[17:45] pfc  so  i  found 
 a  direct  correlation  between  how  much  of
[17:50] the  bad  habits  someone  does 
 and  how  loud  their  amygdala  is  that's 
 how  it  was  for  me  that's  how  it
[17:55] is  for  100  of  the  people  that  i've  that 
 i've  ever  met  in  my  life  so
[18:00] i  think  that  this  is  a  fact  these 
 average  bad  behaviors  netflix  video 
 games  porn 
 youtube  junk  food  drugs  it  strengthens
[18:07] your  amygdala  and 
 weakens  your  pfc  do  the  opposite  of  that 
 cure  yourself
[18:12] of  these  addictions  and  hop  on  the 
 dopamine  detox  not  the  clickbait  version 
 not  the  24  hour
[18:17] on  a  sunday  like  that's  going  to  do 
 anything  it's  a  lifestyle  change  this  is 
 something  you  just
[18:22] follow  each  and  every  day  and  we're  not 
 doing  it  for  a  challenge  we're  not  doing 
 it  to  tell  people  like  hey  guys  i'm  on  a
[18:27] dopamine  detox  i  shut  up  bro  i'm  on  a 
 dopamine  dish 
 what  the  [ __ ]  you  dumb  ass  oh  i'm  gonna
[18:32] do  a  dopamine  detox  tomorrow  no 
 a  dopamine  detox  isn't  something  you  do 
 it's  not  something  you  try  it's  not
[18:38] something  that  is  like  a  challenge  that 
 you  tell  people  about  when  you're  acting 
 proud  no  it's  just  a  lifestyle  change 
 that  you  no  longer
[18:43] indulge  in  those  easy  dopamine 
 activities  or  at  least 
 severely  reduce  to  the  point  that  you
[18:49] only  keep  like  the  absolute  most 
 fun  instant  gratification  activities 
 that  is  it  these  two  behaviors
[18:55] meditation  and  dopamine  detoxing 
 that  is  what  has  killed  my  lizard  brain
[19:00] in  the  last  eight  months 
 i  urge  you  if  you  want  the  benefits  of 
 someone  with  a  reduced
[19:05] lizard  brain  a  reduced  amygdala  to  to 
 really  consider  this 
 and  start  with  education  start  with
[19:11] learning  so  much 
 about  meditation  and  dopamine  detoxing 
 learn  about  instant  gratification  i've
[19:16] got  like  the  whole  playlist 
 learn  about  mindfulness  the  benefits  of 
 meditation  just  know  that  every  time  you
[19:22] learn  something  about  these  things 
 you're  just  more  likely  to  do  it  because 
 you're  more  motivated  you  won't  really
[19:27] see  much  educational  stuff  about  the 
 dopamine  detox  because  it's  mostly  full 
 of  the  big  youtubers  who  are  just  lying
[19:32] to  you  for  clickbait  like  i'll  reset 
 your  mind  in  24  hours  uh 
 they  say  that  stuff  because  it's  far
[19:38] more  marketable  obviously  saying  you  can 
 reset  your  mind  in  24  hours  just  do  this 
 on  a  sunday
[19:43] it's  far  more  marketable  even  though 
 it's  not  valuable  to  people 
 so  if  you  search  for  dopamine  detoxing
[19:48] personally 
 i  never  found  anything  of  value  i  had  to 
 go  experiment  it  by  myself  and  that's
[19:53] why 
 i'm  here  today  on  this  eight  month 
 dopamine  detox 
 i  did  a  class  on  it  so  if  you  want  to
[19:59] learn  directly  from  me  i  did  a  one  hour 
 class  where  i  explained  the  differences 
 between  the  24  hour  version
[20:05] and  the  lifestyle  change  that  i'm  on  the 
 lifestyle  dopamine  detox  is 
 in  my  opinion  it's  absolutely  necessary
[20:11] for  everyone  who's  on  the 
 self-improvement  i  feel  like  your 
 self-improvement  is 
 is  hindered  it's  it's  handicapped
[20:19] if  you're  still  addicted  to  the  instant 
 gratifications  so  i  made  a  skillshare 
 class  of  how  to  do  the  detox  just  like  i
[20:25] do 
 the  skillshare  link  is  in  the 
 description  you  can  watch  it  for  free 
 using  their  free  trial 
 so  you  should  probably  go  and  watch  that
[20:30] if  you  want  some  education  on  this  so 
 think  of  these  two  meditation  and 
 dopamine  detoxing  think  of  them
[20:36] as  the  twenty  percent  of  activities  that 
 get  you  eighty  percent 
 of  the  lizard  brain  killing  results
[20:42] there  probably  is  some  other  things  that 
 would  help  but  these  two  at  least  for  me 
 has  made  a  very very  drastic
[20:48] life-changing  difference  in  just  a 
 couple  of  months  you  might  think 
 but  perhaps  a  couple  of  months  is  a  lot
[20:53] shut  up  bro  a  couple  months  is  a long 
 time  bro 
 the  time's  gonna  pass  anyway  it's 
 january  right  now  let's  say  that  you
[20:59] could  have  a  significant  difference  in 
 your  you  know  your  decision  making  your 
 amygdala  versus  pfc  argument  in  your
[21:05] head 
 you  could  have  a  significant  difference 
 in  that  before  june 
 the  time  is  going  to  pass  anyway  you  can
[21:10] hop  onto  this  right  now  you  can  think 
 right  now  this  is  going  to  be 
 an  intention  that  i  set  myself  that  i
[21:15] want  to  reduce  my  lizard  brain 
 or  you  can  just  forget  about  this  video 
 and  either  way  when  june  comes  around
[21:21] that  version  of  you  the  older  version  of 
 you  is  gonna  look  back  at  you  in  january 
 and  just 
 either  be  proud  or  look  back  with  some
[21:28] self-hatred  it's  your  choice  and  i  look 
 back  at  my  younger  self 
 with  pride  and  gratitude  it's  a  good  way
[21:34] to  be  i  think  you  should  try  that  you 
 can  book  a  30-minute  call  with  me  for
