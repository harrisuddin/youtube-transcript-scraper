[00:00] jeffrey  doesn't  track  his  nutrition  he 
 eats  whatever  he  craves  and  that  usually 
 means  low  quality  junk  food  he  thinks
[00:06] people  who  care  about  their  health  are 
 weird  younger  hamza  was  scared  of 
 gaining  fats  he  had  just  done  a
[00:11] successful  diet  going  from  chubby  to 
 skinny  and  he  wanted  to  stay  lean  but 
 this  meant  slow  progress  in  the  gym  he
[00:17] constantly  kept  switching  from  bulk  to 
 cut  cut  to  bulk  scared  of  getting  fat
[00:22] but  also  annoyed  at  how  little  his 
 muscles  were  he  wasted  time  adonis 
 adonis  feasts  like  a  king  his  appetite
[00:29] and  diet  allow  him  to  grow  bigger  than 
 all  of  his  friends  and  enemies  because 
 of  that  adonis  is  fueled  with  confidence
[00:35] he  feels  better  than  good  enough  he's 
 looked  up  to  as  the  leader  of  his  tribe 
 when  a  guy  tells  me  how  many  calories
[00:41] he's  eaten  and  the  number  starts  with 
 one 
 i  feel  the  pain  right  here  you  want  to
[00:48] speed  up  your  body  transformation  you 
 want  to  go  from  a  skinny  fat  curry  cell 
 to  a  chad  pre  light  well
[00:54] you  got  a  bulk 
 huh 
 i'm  fat  already  i  can't  bulk  i'm  fat
[01:01] hamster 
 you  want  fat  fat  okay  this  is  fat  fat
[01:06] you  aren't  fat  fat  you're  just  skinny 
 fats  essentially  you  just  don't  have 
 enough  muscle  to  look  good  you've  got 
 the  asian  jeans  where  you've  got  the
[01:12] skinny  fat  look  instead  of  the  lean 
 white  boy  look  and  the  cure  to  the 
 skinny  fat  body  is  the  bulk  and  when  we
[01:19] say  bulk  we  mean  to  eat  more  when  we  eat 
 more  we  gain  more  muscle  and  strength  in 
 the  gym  that's  what  you  need  you  don't
[01:25] need  to  lose  fat  right  now  you  need  more 
 muscle  our  testosterone  goes  up  so 
 unless  you  want  to  be  a  little  [ __ ]
[01:30] you've  got  a  bulk  and  you're  going  to 
 learn  the  easiest  but  also  one  of  the 
 most  effective  ways  to  start  bulking
[01:36] because  i  didn't  i  wasted  so  much  time 
 when  i  first  started  weight  lifting  and 
 i  had  like  kind  of  like  the  skinny  fat
[01:41] body  that  you  probably  have 
 i  knew  that  i  should  be  bulking  to  gain 
 strength  and  muscle  and  everyone's
[01:46] telling  me  you  know  your  lift  should  be 
 going  up  in  the  gym  but  i  had  this 
 obsession  with  wanting  to  get  lean  and
[01:51] wanting  to  get  abs  i'd  train  in  the  gym 
 and  i'd  eat  like  1800  calories  a  day
[01:56] trying  to  cut  down  even  though  i  had  bit 
 i  hadn't  even  built  any  muscle  yellow 
 what  what  the  [ __ ]  are you  trying  to  cut
[02:01] down  to  bro  like  you've  got  to 
 understand 
 i  had  this  idea  that  if  i  lost  enough
[02:08] fat  i  would  look  like  a  smaller  version 
 of  a  shredded  guy  i  thought  i  thought
[02:13] that  you'd  have  those  muscles  it's  just 
 that  i  would  be  smaller  but  eventually 
 if  i  lost  enough  fat  i  would  begin  to
[02:19] look  like  a  shredded  person  but  just 
 kind  of  smaller 
 loud  ass  car  bro  [ __ ]  you
[02:26] honda  civic 
 i  don't  even  know  what  the  [ __ ]  a  honda 
 civic  is 
 it  doesn't  work  like  that  you  have  to
[02:31] build  the  muscle  first  before  you  can 
 cut  down  which  means  that  you're  being  a 
 little  bit  if  you  are  in  the  first  one
[02:37] maybe  even  two  years  of  your  lift  in 
 career  and  you're  you're  on  a  cutting 
 phase  right  now  like  how  many  times  do  i
[02:42] have  to  say  this  you  don't  deserve  to  be 
 lean  right  now  you  could  be  bulky  you 
 could  look  way  bigger  and  everyone's 
 gonna  notice  and  everyone's  gonna  be
[02:47] like  oh  my  god  did  you  go  to  the  gym 
 you're  getting  strong  you're  getting  big 
 masha'allah  or  you  can  just  cut  your
[02:52] calories  reduce  your  testosterone 
 increase  your  courses  i'll  [ __ ]  up  your 
 sleep 
 all  part  of  your  life  your  mental
[02:57] concentration  for  your  exams  for  the 
 pursuit  of  trying  to  get  abs  in  like 
 shreds  when  you're  like  three  months
[03:03] into  lifting  and  now  this  is  what  i  look 
 like  i  look  sick  because  i've  bulked 
 over
[03:08] 60  pounds  of  almost  lean  weight  since  i 
 first  started  that's  over  seven  years  i
[03:13] started  at  115  pounds  i'm  175  now  if  you 
 like  the  look  of  my  physique  and  you
[03:19] want  to  look  similar  to  me  i've  linked 
 the  workout  routines  that  i  recommend 
 below  in  the  description  oh  and  worst  of
[03:24] all 
 please  do  not  ever  get  onto  a  [ __ ] 
 maintenance  phase  a  maintenance  recom  oh
[03:30] shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  [ __ ]  jeff  nippon 
 had  to  go  make  this  viral  now  everyone  i 
 speak  to  he's  like  oh  yeah  like  sam
[03:36] [ __ ]  does  oh  i'm  gonna  do  it  why  the 
 [ __ ]  would  you  do  that  bro  like 
 ah  to  make  a  good  amount  of muscle
[03:42] you've  got  a  bulk  when  so  many  guys  are 
 starting  off  and  they've  got  this  idea 
 of  like  oh  but  you  know  i've  got  a  bit
[03:47] of  fat  right  now  so  uh  i'll  sacrifice 
 the  most  important  thing  which  is  muscle
[03:52] so  that  i  can  try  and  stay  like  how  did 
 it  go  sam  a  little  bit 
 like  you  gained  in  space  for  a  couple  of
[03:57] months  not  really  gaining  anything  sam's 
 been  on  a  solid  bulk  now  for  a couple  of 
 months  and  i  can  i  know  for  a  fact  that
[04:02] this  is  the  most  like  he  said  it  himself 
 like  he'll  start  to  go  like  way  more 
 often  he  enjoys  his  training  his
[04:07] strengths  going  up  and  he  actually  looks 
 like  he's  filling  out  like  sam  give  us  a 
 [ __ ]  double  biter  pump  he's  actually 
 getting  thick  now  which  is  [ __ ]  sick
[04:13] like  i  told  him  a  couple  of  times  you 
 don't  deserve  to  be  lean  now  you  can  get 
 bulky  which  is  what  he's  finally  doing
[04:19] or  you  can  just  stay  looking  weirdly 
 skinny  fat  and  the  thing  is  sam  you  tell 
 him  bro  you  worked  out  for  a  couple  of 
 months  how  did  they  go  go  out  for  you
[04:26] i  wasn't  necessarily  doing  as  well  i  was 
 doing  okay  but  i  wasn't  doing  as  well
[04:32] when  i  was  on  a  maintenance 
 now  the  only  times  that  i've  made  a  good 
 amount  of  progress  and  that  the  only
[04:38] times  that  you  will  make  a  good  amount 
 of  progress  is  when  you  clean  bulk  now 
 i'm  telling  you  to  bulk  but  you  better 
 not  be  a  bit  bro  you  better  not  be  a
[04:44] little  taking  advice  from  these  fitness 
 youtubers  doing  dirty  bulks
[04:49] off  bro 
 children  bro  full  day  of  eating  i'm 
 eating  300  grams  of  cocoa  off  bro  we
[04:55] don't  eat  that  [ __ ]  we  want  to  level  up 
 our  discipline  we  want  to  become  like 
 strong  men  we  don't  want  to  be  in  these
[05:00] fluffy  little  bodybuilders  when  we  bulk 
 we  only  bulk  with  clean  nutritious  food
[05:05] and  every  now  and  then  maybe  every  day 
 we  have  a  small  treat  just  as  like  you 
 know  just  to  be  mindful  of  like  a  one
[05:10] cube  of  dark  chocolate  one  cube  you  have 
 to  understand  and  take  what  i  say 
 seriously  because  i  say  this  in  every
[05:15] video  and  still  i  feel  like  too  many  of 
 my  boys  are  watching  fitness  youtubers 
 they  make  videos  for  views  and  what  gets
[05:21] views  is  the  shredded  guy  doing  this  and 
 he's  like  oh  look  at  all  the  junk  food 
 i'm  eating  that  gets  more  views  than  the
[05:27] shredded  guy  was  like  yeah  obviously  i'm 
 eating  [ __ ]  healthy  foods  bro  we're 
 gonna  eat  healthy  now  bulking  should  be
[05:32] difficult  repeat  with  me  bulking  should 
 be  difficult  you  shouldn't  be  excited  to 
 bulk  if  you're  excited  to  bulk  that 
 means  you're  a  little  [ __ ]  bro
[05:37] bulking's  like  it's  it's  so  much  harder 
 like  the  training  is  honestly  easy  the
[05:42] training  is  literally  just  like  once 
 you're  in  motion  you  just  train  you  go 
 lift  your  days  yeah  you  know  it's 
 challenging  and  stuff  and  it's
[05:47] physically  fatiguing  but  it's  like  you 
 get  it  done  no  problem  cutting  for  most 
 people  honestly  it's  fine  some  people
[05:52] with  mental  health  problems  struggle  but 
 it's  like  it's  not  that  difficult  reduce 
 your  calories  do  some  more  cardio  fine 
 bulking  with  clean  nutritious  food
[05:58] should  be  like  one  of  the  most  difficult 
 things  you  do  bro  like  i  i  feel  so  close 
 to  being  sick  in  my  kickboxing  sessions
[06:04] because  i've  added  down  for  like  3  800 
 calories  before  6  p.m  it  should  be  the
[06:09] most  difficult  part  of  your  regimens  and 
 this  is  exactly  what  you're  going  to  do 
 now  i'm  not  going  to  tell  you  the 
 standard  advice  okay  let's  go  on  to
[06:14] myfitnesspal  and  let's  check  our 
 calories  and  and  weigh  our  food  because 
 if  you  were  going  to  do  that  which  you
[06:19] should  it  is  the  best  way  to  go  about 
 your  nutrition  is  to  literally  just 
 weigh  and  track  every  gram  of  food  you 
 eat  that's  what  athletes  do  if  you  were
[06:25] going  to  do  that  then  you  probably  would 
 have  already  considered  it  like  it's  not 
 new  news  for  me  to  tell  you  like  oh  yeah 
 go  track  your  food  so  if  you're  watching
[06:31] this  right  now  and  you're  not  currently 
 in  the  flow  of  tracking  your  food  on 
 myfitnesspal  i'm  not  going  to  suggest
[06:37] that  to  you  and  instead  i'm  just  going 
 to  suggest  something  which  is  easier  and 
 it  is  still  pretty  effective  too  all  you
[06:42] have  to  do  is  just  have  a  simple  mindset 
 when  you're  eating  you're  eating  good 
 clean  foods  but  don't  knock  in  cocoa
[06:47] when  you're  eating  good  clean  foods  and 
 you  feel  full  eat  a  little  bit  more 
 that's  the  one  difference  i  want  you  to
[06:52] make  when  you're  first  starting  off 
 bulking  if  you're  a  young  guy  right  now 
 you're  like  a  16  year  old  you've  been
[06:57] overwhelmed  by  the  diet  advice  and 
 everything  you  want  to  build  muscle  you 
 want  to  get  testosterone  you  want  to 
 even  grow  taller  and  everything  eat
[07:03] clean  healthy  food  that  your  mum  makes 
 as  soon  as  you  feel  full  eat  a  little 
 bit  more  than  you  normally  would  i've 
 asked  your  mom  for  a  little  bit  more  and
[07:09] actually  think  to  yourself  it's  almost 
 like  the  workout  mindset  where  you're 
 thinking  okay  you  know  push  yourself  one 
 more  rep  and  everything  you've  got  to  do
[07:14] that  with  your  food  to  think  like  okay 
 come  on  one  more  spoonful  have  that  same 
 mindset  to  think  okay  this  plate  of  food
[07:19] is  like  a  challenge  now  it's  not  going 
 to  be  a  challenge  if  you're  eating  like 
 a  little  bit  if  you're  eating  pizza  if
[07:24] you're  eating  [ __ ]  sweeties  and  stuff 
 for  your  calories  you're  being  a  little 
 bit  now  if  you  want  to  eat  that  stuff 
 it's  like  a  nice  treat  to  be  mindful  of
[07:30] once  every  now  and  then  absolutely  fine 
 if  you  think  that  that  stuff  should  be 
 like  filling  up  your  calories  because  of
[07:35] these  [ __ ]  fitness  youtubers  then 
 bulking's  gonna  be  easy  you  won't  need 
 this  advice  that  means  you're  a  [ __ ]
[07:40] that  means  that  you're  gonna  look  like 
 in  a  couple  of  months  you're  gonna  be 
 fluffy  and  you're  going  to be  buying  the 
 [ __ ]  diet  plans  and  stuff  because
[07:46] nothing  else  is  working  for  you  we're 
 going  to  eat  clean  nutritious  food  and 
 if  you  want  the  perfect  diet  for  your 
 bulk  you  can  click  on  this  video  right
[07:52] here  in  short  the  foods  that  you  want  to 
 eat  are  the  ones  that  help  your  gut 
 microbiome  be  healthy  literally  the
[07:57] unsexy  advice  is  like  lots  of  a  variety 
 of  different  colored  fruits  and 
 vegetables  it's  just  that  bro  it's  a
[08:03] meat  with  whole  grains  like  wholemeal 
 bread  just  have  beef  and  bread
[08:10] bulking's  hard  bro  it's  not  supposed  to 
 be  easy  go  eat  your  [ __ ]  beef  bread 
 bro
[08:16] [Laughter] 
 honestly  you  know  the  healthy  food  that 
 your  mum  makes  which  you  don't  like  to
[08:21] eat  because  you  want  to  eat  your  [ __ ] 
 processed  food  eat  your  mom's  food  bro 
 and  maybe  your  mom  maybe  your  parents
[08:26] don't  make  healthy  food  and  if  they 
 don't  you  will  suffer  for  the  rest  of 
 your  life  i'm  not  going  to  give  you  the 
 like  a  lie  here  if  your  parents  are  fat
[08:32] if  your  parents  don't  make  like  they 
 don't  cook  healthy  food  you  will  suffer 
 for  the  rest  of  your  life  because  of
[08:37] that  not  only  is  it  setting  you  off  the 
 start  of  your  life  till  you're  an  adult 
 with  a  pretty  diet  but  generally  we  do
[08:44] imitate  the  behavior  that's  been  modeled 
 by  our  parents  and  if  our  parents  are 
 drinking  coke  then  we're  gonna  end  up
[08:49] drinking  coke  because  it's  normalized 
 now  of  course  you  don't  have  to  and  it 
 takes  like  a  big  change  180  of  your  life
[08:54] to  not  follow  your  biggest  sort  of  role 
 models  and  that's  kind  of  what  i've  done 
 but  you  it  does  certainly  set  you  down  a
[09:01] certain  trajectory  which  you  just  should 
 have  like  a  sense  of  compassion  in  your 
 mind  to  know  that  if  your  parents  are 
 unhealthy  if  for  example  in  your
[09:07] household  there's  no  like  healthy  food 
 being  cooked  you  are  like  fighting  an 
 uphill  battle  this  is  supposed  to  be
[09:12] difficult  it's  not  supposed  to  be  easy 
 but  having  said  that  if  you  are  fighting 
 this  uphill  battle  then
[09:18] you're  a  man  now  it's  time  to  put  in  the 
 action  and  you  take  charge  of  your  diet 
 so  here  is  exactly  the  practical  step  of
[09:24] exactly  what  you  do  after  this  video 
 from  now  on  every  single  day  have  one
[09:29] new  very  very  healthy  meal  and  the  meal 
 that  i  suggest  which  i  like  i  literally 
 i'm  gonna  totally  show  you  this  meal  and
[09:35] like  you'll  make  it  with  me  and 
 everything  just  make  this  meal  every 
 single  day  for  the  rest  of  your  life  and 
 it's  literally  just  roasted  vegetables
[09:41] and  the  main  part  of  the  vegetable  is 
 potatoes  so  this  is  what  you  do  you  get 
 some  potatoes  wash  them  cut  them  up  get
[09:46] your  oven  tray  with  some  tin  foil  put 
 some  olive  oil  and  this  is  very 
 important  that  the  fat  world  have  told
[09:51] you  that  oil  is  unhealthy  that  olive  oil 
 is  unhealthy  it's  [ __ ]  bulky  bro  oil 
 fats  are  very  very  good  for  you  it's  way
[09:57] better  than  a  lot  of  the  balls  that 
 these  people  are  recommended  to  you  so 
 we're  gonna  put  some  olive  oil  over  this
[10:02] tray  put  the  potatoes  over  and  then 
 literally  this  is  so  easy  for  the 
 vegetables  just  go  to  like  the 
 supermarket  they've  got  frozen
[10:07] vegetables  in  a  bag  bro  whatever  once 
 you  could  like  visualize  yourself 
 enjoying  grab  a  couple  of  them  literally
[10:13] just  cut  open  a  bag  unless  you  just  pour 
 them  in  i  don't  even  weigh  the 
 vegetables  you  can  eat  as  many 
 vegetables  as  you  want  just  pour  them
[10:18] all  in  a  bit  of  seasoning  a  bit  more 
 olive  oil  put  it  in  for  like  half  an 
 hour  come  downstairs  check  it  it's 
 probably  like  not  fully  cooked  yet  you
[10:24] look  around  at  it  set  another  timer  on 
 for  like  10  minutes  and  then  come  back 
 you've  got  like  a  peg  plate  of  roasted
[10:30] vegetables  roasted  potatoes  high  in 
 carbs  pretty  high  in  fiber  and  protein
[10:35] and  if  you  want  to  make  it  taste  even 
 better  just  sprinkle  some  mature  cheddar 
 don't  be  a  little  bit  like  mild  or  like
[10:41] oh 
 the 
 plastic  the  pla  i  saw  my  dad  trying  to 
 cook  with  that  like  literally  the
[10:46] plastic  oh  bro  i  want  to  slap  you  if  you 
 use  that  cheese  bro  you  know  which  one 
 i'm  talking  about  the  [ __ ]  square
[10:52] plastic  that  mcdonald's  uses  that  like 
 why  do  we  have  that  in  our  kitchen  bro  i 
 saw  my  dad  like  pull  it  out  the  kitchen
[10:58] and  he  was  like  looking  at  it  he  was 
 like  gonna  use  it  for  a  sandwich  i  was 
 like 
 stop 
 get  some  mature  cheddar
[11:07] so  that  is  a  meal  that  i  have  every 
 single  day  it's  helping  me  bulk  and  once 
 you've  been  doing  that  for  a  couple  of
[11:12] weeks  you  can  then  start  to  have  another 
 good  healthy  meal  on  top  of  that  this  is 
 how  you  structure  your  diet  skate  if
[11:17] you've  been  trying  to  reform  your  diets 
 all  in  one  day  and  you  failed  in  the 
 next  three  days  you  know  why  because 
 you're  supposed  to  do  it  one  meal  at  a
[11:23] time  change  one  meal  this  month  next 
 meal  to  change  the  second  meal  third 
 meal  and  eventually  after  like  four 
 months  you're  literally  that  guy  who's
[11:29] eaten  just  healthy  meals  in  the  entire 
 day  you  have  to  start  with  just  one  meal 
 make  that  consistent  make  it  the  same
[11:34] meal  just  roast  your  vegetables  bro
