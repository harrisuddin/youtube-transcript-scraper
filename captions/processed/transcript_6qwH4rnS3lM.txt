[00:00] jeffrey  downloads  a  youtube  blocker  he 
 can  no  longer  watch  the  videos  on 
 youtube  yes  finally  he's  going  to  make
[00:05] some  progress  he  even  has  a  pawn  blocker 
 installed  on  his  pc  this  is  it  this  is 
 the  time  that  jeffrey's  actually  going
[00:10] to  finally  improve  himself 
 wait  who's  that  a  mysterious  figure
[00:15] uninstalls  the  blocker  from  jeffrey's 
 computer  who  could  it  be  who  would 
 undermine  your  self-improvement  attempts
[00:22] there  is  only  one  man  we  can  trust  to 
 find  out  the  answer  for  us
[00:34] adonis
[00:39] how  dare  you  sacrifice  young  geoffrey's 
 attempts  to  improve  himself  the 
 mysterious  figure  tries  to  run  away  but
[00:44] he's  no  match  for  adonis  the  fastest  man 
 on  the  planet  anonymous  sweeps  him  to 
 the  floor  and  holds  him  there  in  a
[00:50] camorra  he  slowly  pulls  the  mask  off  our 
 perpetrator
[00:57] mark  zuckerberg 
 [Applause] 
 so  it  was  zuck  all  along  ruining
[01:03] jeffrey's  efforts  to  improve  himself 
 mystery  solved  well  done  adoles  the
[01:08] first  habit  that  helped  me  get  my  life 
 together  was  weightlifting  this  was  like 
 the  first  productive  thing  i  ever  did  in
[01:13] my  life  age  17.  and  if  you've  been  into 
 lifting  or  calisthenics  recently  you'll 
 know  that  this  is  the  case  when  it's
[01:18] like  the  first  good  habit  that  you  do  it 
 really  is  like  the  cornerstone  that  gets 
 you  to  do  all  the  good  things  i  started
[01:24] weightlifting  at  age  17  looking  like 
 this  115  120  pounds  i  was  so  skinny  my
[01:29] wrists  and  my  forearms  were  skinnier 
 than  my  sisters  weightlifting  was  a 
 beautiful  crucial  thing  for  me  i
[01:35] remember  that  this  is  extremely  valuable 
 to  say 
 it  gave  me  hope  it  gave  me  optimism  i
[01:41] saw  the  path  ahead  of  me  okay  i've 
 started  weightlifting  as  long  as  i  never 
 quit  i'll  build  like  my  dream  physique  i
[01:47] felt  like  that  was  a  guarantee  and  so  it 
 got  me  perhaps  for  one  of  the  first 
 times  in  my  life  to  look  forward  to  the
[01:53] future  to  think  that  i  can  do  something 
 today  that  will  make  my  future  better 
 because  i  never  really  understood  the
[01:59] concept  of  working  hard  in  school  or 
 anywhere  else  it  was  weightlifting  i 
 really  started  my  life  then  the  second
[02:05] habit  that  helped  me  get  my  life 
 together  was  learning  so  at  age  21  i 
 took  an  online  course  which  is
[02:10] completely  free  and  it's  called  the 
 science  of  well-being  it  was  going  kind 
 of  viral  at  that  time  and  i  saw  some
[02:15] people  talk  about  it  on  reddit  and  so  i 
 took  the  course  it's  online  it's  free 
 you  can  literally  just  google  the 
 science  of  well-being  it's  kind  of  like
[02:21] an  online  course  where  you  just  kind  of 
 sit  there  you  open  up  the  browser  and 
 it's  almost  like  youtube  videos  we  just 
 let  the  video  play  but  it's  extremely
[02:27] educational  and  so  for  the  first  time  in 
 my  life  i  was  actually  learning  it's 
 very  very  [ __ ]  sad  to  hear  that  isn't
[02:33] it  i  was  21  years  old  and  that  was  the 
 first  time  i  was  learning  i  had 
 literally  graduated  from  university  and
[02:38] i  don't  consider  any  of  the  things  that 
 i  learned  in  the  education  system  actual
[02:43] learning  the  pathetic  education  that  i 
 went  through  was  a  complete  waste  of 
 time  but  when  oddly  oh  you're  not
[02:49] supposed  to  say  this  because  education 
 is  like  education  is  absolutely  key  but 
 the  education  system  the  school  the
[02:54] college  the  universities  are  [ __ ] 
 [ __ ]  and  this  is  maybe  a  side 
 tangent  but  age  21  is  the  first  time
[02:59] that  i  actually  ever  learned  anything  i 
 took  this  course  it  changed  my  life  it's 
 all  about  mental  health  and  i kind  of 
 explained  the  real  research  on  how  to  be
[03:06] happy  on  how  to  have  good  mental  health 
 i  had  never  learned  these  things  before 
 so  many  of  my  problems  were  fixed
[03:12] because  i  took  this  course  and  i 
 implemented  the  steps  the  third  habit 
 that  helped  me  get  my  life  together  is
[03:17] one  that  i  learned  from  the  course  that 
 we  just  mentioned  the  instructor  in  the 
 course  tells  you  of  the  vast  benefits  of
[03:23] meditation  so  the  third  habit  was 
 meditating  and  i  struggled  hard  trying 
 to  meditate  when  i  first  started  i
[03:28] literally  couldn't  even  last  one  minute 
 and  yeah  like  every  time  i  say  this 
 everyone  says
[03:33] one  minute 
 that's  what  he  said  shut  up  it's  not 
 even  that  funny  i  remember  struggling 
 hard  when  i  first  started  to  meditate  i
[03:39] download  some  of  those  apps  and  within 
 literally  30  seconds  to  one  minute  i'd 
 be  so  bored  i  need  more  stimulation  that
[03:45] i  just  opened  my  eyes  and  just  cancelled 
 the  app  early  meditation  became  a 
 beautiful  thing  and  it  became  so
[03:50] consistent  in  my  morning  routine  just  a 
 few  minutes  every  single  morning 
 eventually  i  leveled  it  up  to  20  minutes
[03:55] in  the  morning  what  meditation  did  for 
 me  honestly  the  biggest  benefit  which  is 
 somewhat  unexpected  it  immediately
[04:01] significantly  improved  my  diet  perhaps 
 you  could  probably  connect  the  dots  but
[04:06] when  i  was  researching  meditation 
 oftentimes  people  were  just  saying  you 
 know  it's  mindfulness  and  presence  and
[04:11] you  know  there's  this  benefit  in  this 
 one  as  soon  as  i  became  more  mindful  i 
 didn't  want  to  eat  that  junk  that  i
[04:16] would  usually  be  eating  and  i  got  so 
 much  more  pleasure  and  enjoyment  from 
 eating  healthy  foods  i  remember  before  i
[04:22] started  meditating  and  along  with  mental 
 illness  like  mental  health  problems  like 
 depression  anxiety  stress  i  was  a  big
[04:29] big  binge  eater  it's  almost  weird  for  me 
 to  say  this  right  now  because  it's  been 
 so  long  since  i've  binge  eight  you  know
[04:34] a lot  of  people  say  like  oh  yeah  like  i 
 ate  lots  of  food  no  no  binge  eating  is 
 like  you  eat  till  you  feel  [ __ ]  sick
[04:40] and  then  you  keep  eating  you  have  this 
 weird  need  not  just  finish  the  food  that 
 you've  got  in  front  of  you  but  to  finish
[04:46] everything  to  eat  everything  in  sight 
 and  it's  heavily  heavily  related  to 
 anxiety  it's  heavily  related  to  like
[04:52] needing  a  sense  of  comfort  which  you  can 
 get  from  food  and  feeling  full  it's  kind 
 of  dark  actually  but  i  remember  there
[04:58] was  a  guy  i  coached  i  used  to  do  like 
 one-on-one  coaching  i  don't  do  it 
 anymore  but  there  was  a  guy  i  coached
[05:03] who  was  sexually  abused  as  a  child  and 
 he  was  overweight  like  he  was  obese  but
[05:09] you  know  that  was  the  thing  that  i  was 
 trying  to  help  him  with  and  i  remember 
 once  he  just  said  something  that  really 
 almost  it  broke  my  heart  but  he
[05:15] explained  so  much  we  were  trying  to  get 
 you  know  really  explain  logically  okay 
 like  why  do  you  eat  so  much  what  like
[05:20] you  know  he  would  eat  until  he  was  so 
 [ __ ]  sick  and  agitated  with  himself 
 and  i  had  known  about  what  had  happened
[05:25] to  him  as  a  child  and  just  once  he  just 
 connected  the  dots  and  he  said  like  well 
 when  i  eat  that  much  and  i'm  so  full  i
[05:31] feel  so  like  disgusting  that  it  kind  of 
 feels  like  a  way  to  protect  myself  from
[05:37] further  sexual  abuse  trauma  and  abuse 
 and  things  that  mess  up  your  mental
[05:42] health  can  truly  truly  make  make  you  do 
 some  like  really  crazy  self  detrimental
[05:48] things  like  binge  eating  like  drug  abuse 
 like  self-harming  meditation  i 
 personally  believe  is  the  single  best
[05:54] thing  you  can  do  to  improve  on  that  the 
 list  of  benefits  of  meditation  and  this
[05:59] video  would  be  over  an  hour  long  if  i 
 actually  told  you  the  list  of  benefits 
 it's  just  one  of  those  where  it's  almost 
 like  a  weird  vague  thing  where  you're
[06:05] not  100  sure  if  it's  working  if  i  can 
 give  you  one  piece  of  advice  right  now 
 it's  start  meditating  you  know  you
[06:11] follow  one  of  those  apps  the  app  i 
 recommend  is  called  medito  completely 
 free  app  i'm  not  even  like  associated
[06:16] with  them  i  would  download  an  app  and  i 
 would  just  follow  you  know  five  minutes 
 three  minutes  one  minute  every  single
[06:21] morning  and  just  have  this  kind  of 
 perception  that  yes  as  long  as  i'm  doing 
 this  i'm  gonna  be  making  progress  and  it
[06:26] will  become  clear  to  me  soon  in  the 
 future  really  relate  yourself  to  like 
 the  guy  who  goes  to  the  gym  does  the
[06:32] workout  and  then  looks  in  the  mirror  and 
 says  like  well  i'm  not  any  thinner  or 
 i'm  not  any  like  you  know  more  muscular
[06:37] yet  well  yeah  you've  been  eating  [ __ ] 
 food  and  you  haven't  been  exercising  for 
 years  and  years  and  years  maybe  decades
[06:42] so  to  that  guy  we  have  to  say  well  yeah 
 go  to  the  gym  for  three  months  and  then 
 you'll  probably  see  some  gains  so  for 
 you  you've  been  doing  the  equivalence
[06:48] you've  been  [ __ ]  up  your  mental 
 health  with  all  this  content  stimulation 
 with  social  media  with  porn  for  years
[06:53] and  years  and  years  and  so  it's  gonna 
 take  a  couple  of  weeks  at  least  for  you 
 to  see  something  and  it's  usually
[06:58] someone  meditates  for  two  weeks  and 
 their  life  transforms  forever  the  fourth 
 habit  is  journaling  specifically
[07:03] gratitude  journaling  this  is  so  simple 
 literally  just  write  down  a  couple  of 
 things  that  you're  grateful  for  this 
 puts  you  in  a  very  positive  mindset
[07:09] because  for  once  in  your  life  you're 
 actually  sat  there  and  not  striving  to 
 want  anything  else  you're  not  like
[07:14] thinking  about  anything  else  you're 
 literally  just  thinking  okay  what  am  i 
 happy  about  what  am  i  grateful  that  is 
 in  my  life  it's  a  very  beautiful
[07:19] practice  and  when  you  get  more 
 consistent  you'll  find  that  you'll  start 
 expressing  gratitude  just  throughout
[07:24] your  normal  day  it's  kind  of  like  a 
 skill  and  the  higher  you  level  up  this 
 skill  by  simply  writing  down  things  or 
 just  expressing  gratitude  or  thinking
[07:30] about  what  you're  grateful  for  the  more 
 that  it  will  just  naturally  come  in 
 imagine  you  just  sat  there  one  day  and
[07:35] just  randomly  you  get  a  feeling  of 
 gratitude  that  oh  yeah  i'm  really 
 grateful  to  be  alive  i'm  really  grateful
[07:40] for  my  family  it's  a  very  beautiful 
 feeling  the  fifth  habit  that's  changed 
 my  life  is  reading  i  know  that  i've 
 already  mentioned  learning  but  i'm  gonna
[07:46] put  this  as  a  separate  one  because  i 
 think  reading  and  learning  are  two  of 
 the  most  important  things  that  you  can 
 do  as  a  young  man  reading  is  literally
[07:52] like  such  a  high  value  skill  that  i'd 
 say  over  90  of  young  men  aren't  doing  if
[07:58] you're  watching  this  video  right  now  and 
 you  don't  currently  read  books  you  are 
 going  to  get  destroyed  you  are  going  to
[08:03] get  dominated  by  another  man  who's 
 reading  it's  as  simple  as  that  the  woman 
 that  you  want  will  be  his  the  money  that
[08:08] you  want  will  be  his  the  status  that  you 
 want  will  be  his  you  choose  stay  in  this 
 lowly  position  of  like  oh  well  greetings
[08:13] not  that  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  i  get 
 aggressive  about  this  because  when  you 
 realize  the  roi  of  reading  and  then  i
[08:18] see  that  people  don't  actually  read  and 
 they  choose  to  just  watch  [ __ ] 
 netflix  and  anime  and  [ __ ]  and  i  just 
 think  to  myself  like  there  is  literally
[08:24] the  pathway  to  wealth  there  is  literally 
 the  pathway  to  love  it's  literally  just 
 all  there  in  books  all  you  have  to  do  is
[08:29] just  read  and  then  just  try  to  implement 
 those  things  that  you  learned  and  your 
 life  changes  forever  and  when  people
[08:34] don't  read  it  it  honestly  pisses  me  off 
 because  i  just  think  why  are  you  missing 
 out  on  life  reading  is  quite  literally
[08:39] like  a  10  out  of  10  thing  i  wouldn't 
 speak  like  this  if  i  didn't  preach  it 
 get  into  reading  it  seems  a  little  bit
[08:44] boring  when  you  first  start  off  it's  a 
 bit  tricky  because  your  mind  is  so 
 [ __ ]  you  can  barely  read  a  few
[08:49] sentences  before  your  mind  starts 
 thinking  about  something  else  reading  is 
 a  skill  right  now  you're  level  one  in 
 this  skill  because  in  the  real  world
[08:54] when  you  don't  level  up  a  skill  you 
 actually  lose  experience  you  need  to 
 like  look  yourself  in  the  mirror  and
[08:59] have  a  little  bit  of  hatred  towards 
 yourself  and  say  like  [ __ ]  i  can't  even 
 read  bro  i  read  like  three  sentences  in
[09:04] my  mind  wonders  what  a  [ __ ]  disgrace 
 you  need  to  have  some  aggression  about
[09:09] this  and  literally  say  to  yourself  what 
 a  disgrace  that  i  can't  and  i  will  not 
 read  what  a  privilege  it  is  to  read  and
[09:16] to  get  the  wisdom  and  knowledge  from  men 
 who  are  better  than  us  and  i  choose  not 
 to  read  because  it's  not  that  fun
[09:21] because  it's  a  little  bit  hard  slap  some 
 sense  into  yourself  pick  out  a  couple  of 
 books  and  start  reading  for  an  hour  a
[09:26] day  every  single  day  for  the  rest  of 
 your  life  it's  that  simple  this  is 
 literally  how  you  become  rich  like  i  was 
 gonna  make  a  separate  video  titled  like
[09:32] obnoxiously  titled  the  reason  why  i'm 
 rich  and  you're  broke  simply  because  i 
 read  that  is  the  one  you  can  say  it's
[09:37] privilege  whatever  the  [ __ ]  you  want  to 
 say  i  read  the  right  book  at  the  right 
 time  and  that  changed  my  life  forever
[09:43] the  book  was  the  millionaire  fastlane  by 
 mj  demarco  it's  kind  of  like  a  new 
 blueprint  to  understanding  wealth  and
[09:49] money  i  read  it  at  about  age  21  when  i 
 was  first  starting  to  make  money  like 
 you  know  i  was  first  like  working 
 full-time  jobs  after  i  finished
[09:55] university  i  was  trying  businesses  and 
 just  because  i  read  that  single  book  i 
 never  fell  into  the  trap  that  the 
 majority  of  like  99  of  people  do  and
[10:01] they're  okay  making  2k  a  month  3k  a 
 month  and  like  you're  probably  thinking 
 about 
 two  games  it's  actually  pretty  good  bro
[10:07] reading  changes  like  i  sound  like  a 
 [ __ ]  and  yeah  i  am  i  am  okay  but 
 reading  will  change  your  life  and  you
[10:12] don't  have  to  take  my  word  for  it  either 
 you  read  and  your  life  improves  or  you 
 don't  and  you  stay  like  everyone  else
[10:17] when  i  think  about  i  went  20  something 
 years  without  reading  if  i  started 
 reading  when  i  was  in  high  school  holy
[10:23] [ __ ]  and  i'm  not  talking  about  reading 
 what  your  [ __ ]  dumb  teacher  gives  to 
 you 
 i'm  talking  about  reading  some  good
[10:28] books  that  you  see  recommended  in  our 
 space  what's  interesting  is  that  what's 
 popular  is  usually  wrong  so  whatever  99
[10:34] of  people  recommend  is  usually  wrong 
 what  i  found  personally  is  that  the 
 books  that  are  recommended  you  know
[10:39] widely  recommended  are  actually  really 
 really  good  it's  really  interesting  i 
 think  because  people  who  consistently
[10:44] read  are  in  like  the  top  five  percent 
 anyway  so  you  know  the  same  books  keep 
 getting  recommended  by  the  people  who
[10:49] read  consistently  then  you  know  it's  a 
 pretty  good  book  you  don't  have  to  look 
 for  like  a  very  weird  niche  book  that  no
[10:54] one's  recommended  because  you  know  we 
 want  to  be  like  the  one  percent  like  the 
 one  percent  are  the  people  who  read  i 
 hope  that  makes  sense  the  sixth  habit
[11:00] that  helped  me  get  my  life  together  is 
 very  interesting  it's  failing  i  got  into 
 the  habit  of  failing  of  trying  things
[11:05] and  failing  them  there's  a  video  of  mine 
 which  is  getting  a  lot  of  views  right 
 now  and  it's  titled  i  am  a  failure  it's
[11:10] kind  of  like  a  epic  montage  edits  like 
 you  know  with  music  and  hype  and 
 everything  and  i  describe  the  process  of
[11:16] actually  becoming  successful  is 
 constantly  just  trying  and  failing  and 
 being  okay  with  that  failure  and  then
[11:21] learning  from  it  and  then  trying  again  i 
 think  my  generation  especially  has  a 
 problem  with  this  i  see  perfectionism  is
[11:27] like  through  the  roof  it's  kind  of  a 
 weird  term  perfectionism  because  it 
 almost  seems  like  a  positive  thing 
 perfectionism  is  for  [ __ ]  like  if
[11:33] you're  a  perfectionist  you  have  to  be  a 
 coward  you  have  to  be  a  [ __ ]  i'd  say 
 most  of  my  generation  is  so  deathly
[11:38] afraid  of  failure  and  if  you're  afraid 
 of  failure  you  will  never  become  a 
 success  and  finally  the  seventh  habit
[11:43] one  that  you  can  probably  guess  is 
 uploading  content  i  realized  about  two 
 years  ago  that  social  media  is  the
[11:49] single  greatest  opportunity  of  our 
 generation  this  is  our  generation's  gold 
 rush  uploading  content  consistently  led
[11:55] me  to  where  i  am  today  at  first  i  was 
 doing  it  just  for  the  sake  of  like 
 entrepreneurship  and  making  money  online
[12:00] and  slowly  and  surely  when  an  audience 
 started  building  up  and  i  got  way  more 
 purposeful  and  more  driven  and  more
[12:05] focused  it  became  more  like  a  movement  a 
 revolution  a  revolution  of  young  men  who
[12:10] are  sick  and  tired  of  living  normal 
 lives  we've  done  years  of  playing  video
[12:15] games  of  watching  porn  of  eating  shitty 
 junk  food  and  we  hate  our  lives  for
[12:20] years  we  scrolled  on  social  media 
 because  that's  the  normal  thing  to  do 
 and  we  hated  our  lives  i  felt  these
[12:25] emotions  i  felt  this  sickness  this  pain 
 inside  of  me  this  agitation  of  living 
 like  a  normal  person  and  i  was  so  fed  up
[12:32] with  it  that  i  transformed  my  life 
 forever  and  i  started  documenting  my 
 process  and  just  coming  onto  camera  and 
 just  teaching  my  learning  lessons  of
[12:38] living  quite  a  weird  life  detached  away 
 from  like  not  fully  detached  away  from 
 modern  technology  you  know  i've  got  my
[12:43] computer  on  right  now  i've  got  a 
 document  open  with  like  today's  script 
 and  everything  but  enough  that  i  don't
[12:48] have  social  media  i  haven't  watched  porn 
 in  years  i  don't  have  dating  apps  i 
 don't  eat  shitty  junk  food  i  don't  eat
[12:54] sweets  and  crisps  uploading  content 
 starts  it's  just  a  habit  that  you  know 
 you're  just  kind  of  doing  to  try  and
