[00:00] there  she  is  Jeffrey  it's  Jessica  how 
 can  I  start  a  conversation  with  her 
 she's  walking  here  quick  well  what
[00:05] should  I  say  what  should  I  say  oh  man 
 she's  walked  past  already  she  didn't 
 even  look  at  me  next  time  definitely
[00:10] I'll  speak  to  her  Adonis 
 the  most  beautiful  feminine  woman  walks
[00:15] past  Adonis  what  do  you  think  he  does  he 
 walks  right  up  to  her  and  starts  a
[00:20] conversation  Jeffrey's  watching  from  the 
 bushes  how  that  looks  so  easy  how  did  he 
 do  that  he  just  went  up  and  he  just  said
[00:26] something  what  did  he  last  night  I  was 
 just  at  Mike  thurston's  place  recording 
 a  podcast  with  him  he's  like  really
[00:31] attractive  really  successful  like  Chad 
 looking  type  of  guy  and  he  even  said 
 that  for  him  growing  up  the  hardest  part
[00:37] was  to  break  the  ice  with  a  girl 
 breaking  the  ice  kind  of  means  like 
 starting  the  conversation  and  when  he 
 said  that  I  realized  that  a  lot  of  guys
[00:43] actually  struggle  with  the  first  like 
 I'm  not  talking  about  you're  the  deep 
 relationship  or  even  the  date  I'm 
 talking  about  literally  okay  you've  seen
[00:49] her  how  do  you  open  your  mouth  to  say 
 anything  to  her  that's  honestly  the 
 hardest  part  for  most  guys  a  lot  of  guys
[00:55] actually  once  they've  had  an  okay  little 
 conversation  they  can  go  from  there  but 
 so  many  guys  will  see  the  girl  that
[01:00] actually  they're  attracted  to  they'll 
 hold  eye  contact  with  a  girl  they'll 
 smile  at  the  girl  the  girl  will  smile 
 back  and  they'll  say  nothing  because
[01:06] they're  just  not  used  to  like  opening  up 
 their  mouth  and  I've  had  this  before 
 I've  been  in  Starbucks  with  my  sister 
 see  a  cute  girl  from  like  the  side  she
[01:12] looks  at  me  I  look  at  her  she  looks  away 
 I  know  what's  gonna  happen  when  a  girl 
 looks  away  when  you've  made  icons  like 
 Don't  Look  Away  she'll  look  back  again
[01:17] this  time  smile  give  her  like  a  little 
 cheeky  smile  I  gave  her  a  smile  she 
 smiled  at  me  and  I  had  this  thought  okay 
 I  could  stand  up  right  now  probably  like
[01:23] Chad  move  and  walk  across  Starbucks  and 
 go  interrupt  her  conversation  with  her 
 mother  and  you  know  just  says
[01:30] I  could  have  done  that  I  did  nothing  I 
 sat  there  just  coping  like  once  I 
 finished  my  drink  then  I'll  go  over
[01:35] there  she  stands  up  with  her  mom  they're 
 about  to  leave  she's  walking  out  and  I'm 
 literally  thinking  wait  I  could  run  up 
 right  now  and  just  Chase  it  down  come
[01:40] here  nothing  happens  I  don't  end  of 
 story  I  don't  regret  it  that  much  I'm 
 past  that  stage  of  like  really  feeling
[01:45] like  if  I  don't  go  speak  to  a  girl  but  I 
 have  been  there  and  so  many  guys  have 
 every  guy  has  this  story  when  you've
[01:51] looked  into  like  cold  approaching  and 
 speaking  to  girls  where  there's  a  girl 
 that  you  could  have  approached  you  could 
 have  spoke  to  and  you  didn't  and  then
[01:56] you  realize  that  regretting  that 
 decision  of  not  speaking  to  her 
 literally  would  have  felt  worse  than  her
[02:01] just  rejecting  you  every  guy  gets  this 
 life  lesson  that  regret  is  worse  than 
 rejection  and  so  today  we're  gonna  solve
[02:07] a  way  that  you  no  longer  regret  seeing  a 
 girl  and  not  speaking  to  her  I  want  you 
 at  the  end  of  this  video  to  be  equipped
[02:12] that  next  time  you  see  a  girl  you're 
 actually  gonna  not  only  be  able  to  do  it 
 but  you'll  actually  feel  good  going  up
[02:18] to  her  to  speak  to  her  now  I  started  my 
 cold  approach  like  starting 
 conversations  with  girls  around  my  time
[02:23] in  University  although  it  was  still 
 difficult  it  was  a  lot  easier  because  it 
 was  night  time  it  was  in  university  it
[02:28] was  in  parties  or  in  nightclubs  and 
 everyone's  drinking  so  it  was  kind  of 
 like  way  easier  to  walk  up  to  a  girl  in
[02:33] the  middle  of  a  nightclub  and  go  speak 
 to  her  like  you  know  outside  of  like  the 
 um Dance  Floor  she's  next  to  the  bar  or
[02:38] she's  outside  in  the  smoking  area 
 smoking  area  was  always  my  favorite  to 
 go  speak  to  girls  and  obviously  this  is 
 like  the  generate  stuff  but  it  really
[02:44] came  in  handy  because  this  is  an 
 important  skill  you  might  be  thinking  oh 
 I  don't  care  about  getting  pillows  I'm 
 like  oh  this  is  well  how  are  you  gonna
[02:50] meet  the  woman  who's  supposed  to  be  your 
 wife  how  are  you  going  to  meet  the  woman 
 who's  gonna  have  your  kids  you're 
 obviously  not  gonna  meet  her  on  only
[02:55] fans  or  something  you're  going  to  meet 
 her  in  person  and  you're  gonna  need  to 
 walk  up  to  her  and  speak  to  her  out  yeah 
 so  no  matter  if  I've  practiced  this  in
[03:01] clubs  or  whatever  this  can  be  useful 
 even  if  you  literally  want  like  a  good 
 girl  like  a  wife  so  I  lived  that  life
[03:06] for  a  couple  of  years  where  I  was  going 
 to  clubs  and  I  was  practicing  this  you 
 know  starting  conversations  with  girls 
 and  then  when  I  left  that  City  and  I
[03:11] went  home  you  know  I  started  all  this 
 stuff  often  became  productive  dopamine 
 detox  and  stuff  I  still  wanted  to  level
[03:16] up  my  cold  approach  skill  so  I'm  not 
 even  lying  bro  I'd  literally  just  go  on 
 like  a  half  an  hour  walk  every  day  and
[03:21] literally  just  go  approach  I  know  it's 
 like  silly  like  I  don't  I  wouldn't 
 suggest  doing  this  because  it  was  such  a 
 time  consuming  it's  not  worth  it  but  I'm
[03:27] kind  of  glad  that  I  did  not  that  it  was 
 really  high  Roi  but  I  learned  quite  a 
 lot  that  I  can  teach  you  right  now  so
[03:32] what  I  realized  is  that  there's  a 
 three-step  process  like  to  start  this 
 conversation  with  a  girl  and  it's  gonna
[03:37] seem  so  detailed  but  just  trust  me  on 
 this  if  you  can  understand  this  three 
 puts  that  process  it's  so  easy  the  first
[03:42] step  is  like  when  you  actually  see  the 
 girl  that  you  now  are  thinking  okay  and 
 I'm  probably  gonna  approach  her  the 
 reason  why  this  is  an  important  step  is
[03:48] because  you  literally  need  to  go  and  see 
 the  girl  in  your  [ __ ]  Vision  to  go 
 and  approach  her  most  guys  live  a  life
[03:54] where  they  don't  even  see  girls  like 
 maybe  you  do  in  school  for  example  or  in 
 the  workplace  but  so  many  guys  spend
[03:59] most  of  their  days  just  inside  looking 
 on  the  computer  screen  and  so  you  don't 
 see  women  with  their  own  eyes  maybe  you
[04:04] see  them  on  Instagram  but  that  doesn't 
 count  we're  talking  about  Regal  not  like 
 digital  [ __ ]  you  need  to  be  outside  more
[04:09] now  I  did  this  by  literally  just  going 
 on  a  daily  walk  and  just  finding  women 
 to  go  speak  to  there's  cringe  I  wouldn't 
 recommend  this  but  what  I  would  do  and  I
[04:15] would  suggest  to  you  which  all  high 
 value  guys  do  is  be  open  to  speaking  to 
 girls  as  you  go  about  your  normal
[04:21] day-to-day  life  so  don't  leave  your 
 house  to  go  and  try  and  find  some  women 
 to  go  speak  to  you  that's  just  sad
[04:26] honestly  like  I  look  back  and  almost 
 cringe  when  I  did  this  but  I'm  glad  that 
 I  can  you  know  give  you  the  experience 
 don't  go  out  looking  for  women  but  go
[04:32] out  of  your  house  to  go  to  the  gym  to  go 
 shopping  to  do  this  to  do  this  to  do 
 this  and  there  in  those  environments
[04:37] where  you  were  gonna  go  to  anyway  speak 
 to  those  girls  so  get  out  into  the 
 environment  which  is  the  gym  or  the  cafe
[04:42] you  know  things  that  you  do  outside  of 
 your  house  you  need  to  specifically  just 
 be  outside  of  your  house  I  know  this  is
[04:48] silly  but  I  guarantee  you're  not  better 
 than  this  I  guarantee  you're  watching 
 this  thinking  oh  I'm  just  going  to  skip 
 over  I  guarantee  you're  not  better  than
[04:54] this  I  guarantee  that  you  would  see  a 
 boost  to  your  dating  life  and  the  amount 
 of  women  that  you're  speaking  to  if  you
[04:59] actually  set  the  intention  to  get 
 outside  of  your  house  more  you  spend 
 most  of  your  days  in  your  house  on  your
[05:04] phone  on  the  laptop  wondering  why  you 
 can't  get  girls  or  wondering  why  all 
 girls  have  thoughts  because  you're 
 meeting  them  all  on  Instagram  or  on
[05:09] Tinder  or  something  you  need  to  simply 
 be  outside  your  house  more  the  easiest 
 way  way  to  do  go  for  a  walk  every  day
[05:14] the  best  way  go  into  the  city  where 
 there's  a  lot  of  people  and  be  around 
 those  areas  so  you  get  outside  and  now
[05:20] you  actually  have  women  in  Your  Vision 
 like  you're  gonna  actually  see  women 
 that's  that  one  most  guys  won't  follow 
 this  step  they'll  be  interested  in  the
[05:26] other  two  steps  maybe  they've  already 
 skipped  over  and  they're  gonna  keep 
 wondering  like  oh  this  is  it's  not 
 working  for  me  it's  because  of  my 
 genetics  and  stuff  if  the  guy  skipped
[05:32] this  step  I  guarantee  the  next  two  steps 
 won't  work  once  you  have  seen  the  woman 
 that  you  want  to  approach  and  honestly
[05:37] you  only  get  like  a  split  second  first 
 you  see  look  at  this  is  the  girl  you 
 want  to  go  speak  to  the  way  to  start 
 this  conversation  and  I'm  talking  with  a
[05:42] stranger  right  if  there's  a  girl  who's 
 in  your  class  and  you  you've  got  some 
 similarities  it's  a  lot  easier  to  speak 
 to  her  because  you  can  just  say  oh  have
[05:48] you  done  the  homework  today  and  start 
 the  conversation  but  I'm  saying  let's 
 teach  you  how  to  speak  to  a  complete 
 stranger  so  that  it's  actually  easier  to
[05:53] speak  to  like  female  friends  or  anyone 
 else  that  you  know  right  so  there's  a 
 girl  there  which  was  step  one  that  you 
 see  her  step  two  which  is  so  like  again
[06:00] specific  but  trust  me  this  is  so 
 important  step  two  as  soon  as  you  see 
 that  girl  is  literally  command  your  legs
[06:05] to  walk  towards  her  this  is  the  most 
 important  like  step  and  trust  me  if  you 
 don't  do  this  step  it  won't  happen  you
[06:11] must  command  your  legs  to  walk  towards 
 her  without  thinking  anything  as  soon  as 
 you  walk  to  water  you  start  to  feel  a
[06:17] lot  more  bold  when  you  see  that  girl  and 
 you  spend  some  time  thinking  okay  should 
 I  approach  what  should  I  say  what  should 
 I  say  trust  me  when  I  say  that  you  won't
[06:23] end  up  approaching  what  you  need  to  do 
 is  walk  over  there  without  a  pre-built 
 sentence  in  your  mind  you  see  that  girl
[06:29] maybe  10  meters  away  and  you  literally 
 command  your  legs  walk  towards  a  walk 
 towards  or  walk  towards  her  and  then 
 part  of  step  two  is  to  also  get  her
[06:35] attention  physically  by  doing  something 
 like  yo  excuse  me  like  this  stick  your 
 hand  up  and  shoot  so  she  sees  you  it's
[06:40] absolutely  normal  in  this  step  and  she 
 might  be  a  bit  you  know  weird  a  bit 
 scared  straight  away  this  happens  he
[06:45] literally  I've  even  seen  videos  of 
 Chad's  like  approach  girls  and  she  gets 
 a  bit  scared  because  it's  quite  abnormal 
 right  usually  when  someone  stops  you  on
[06:51] the  street  they're  quite  Shady  people 
 they're  scammers  they're  asking  for 
 money  or  something  so  it's  normal  so 
 when  you  do  see  her  instant  reaction
[06:57] don't  be  like  scared  by  I  don't  like  you 
 know  looking  at  her  body  or  anything 
 just  just  assume  oh  yeah  you  know  a
[07:02] little  scared  girl  whatever  yeah  ask  it 
 don't  ask  you  oh  I'm  sorry  but  that's 
 fine  that's  step  two  step  two  is  so
[07:07] important  most  guys  again  won't  even  do 
 this  because  they'll  see  the  girl  and 
 they  think  no  no  but  I  can't  go  over 
 yeah  I've  got  to  think  of  something  no
[07:12] specifically  you  need  to  walk  to  water 
 before  you  have  thought  of  something 
 because  when  you  think  of  something  it's
[07:17] too  late  you  can't  sit  there  and  think 
 oh  what  should  I  say  should  I  approach 
 her  because  at  that  point  it's  gone  you 
 literally  see  her  from  step  one  step  two
[07:23] as  soon  as  you  see  her  literally  just 
 command  your  legs  just  walk  towards  and 
 I  know  you're  scared  because  you're 
 gonna  think  wait  what  do  I  say  though
[07:28] what  do  I  say  I'm  saying  trust  me  when  I 
 say  just  walk  towards  her  get  her 
 attention  yo  excuse  me  hello  excuse  me 
 something  like  this  now  at  step  three
[07:34] she  is  in  front  of  you  you  have  got  her 
 full  attention  she's  looking  directly  at 
 you  you're  looking  at  her  step  through
[07:39] say  something  now  the  thing  is  if  you're 
 waiting  for  me  to  say  okay  say  this 
 exactly  I  know  that  you're  never  gonna 
 do  good  with  women  you  know  why  because
[07:45] you  can't  treat  women  like  this  base 
 like  online  you  can  right  online  all 
 women  are  Bots  until  proven  otherwise
[07:50] online  like  all  women  are  literally  just 
 all  they  deserve  is  like  copy  and  paste 
 messages  up  until  she's  met  you  in 
 person  and  then  you  put  more  effort  in
[07:56] but  in  person  when  you  see  this  woman 
 you  can't  just  have  a  copy  and  paste 
 sentence  to  say  to  it  you  can  do  that  on 
 Tinder  you  can  do  that  on  Instagram  DMS
[08:02] but  in  person  you  can't  just  know  okay 
 the  first  thing  I'm  gonna  say  to  say 
 every  girl  that  I  approach  is  this 
 sentence  because  it  seems  fake  you  walk
[08:07] straight  up  and  whatever  naturally  comes 
 into  your  mind  I  found  that  when  you  let 
 your  brain  think  on  the  spot  you  you
[08:13] actually  do  a  lot  better  than  if  you've 
 preemptively  thought  of  this  and  your 
 brains  kind  of  disagree  right  now  and
[08:18] that  no  no  I'm  way  better  with 
 preparation  if  that  was  true  you  would 
 be  great  at  approaching  girls  anyway 
 wouldn't  you  you  wouldn't  need  this
[08:23] video  I  know  my  way  is  very  scary 
 because  I'm  literally  saying  okay  you 
 walk  towards  her  before  you  even  know
[08:28] what  you're  gonna  say  then  it  has  been 
 time  I'll  be  honest  with  you  there's 
 been  times  where  I  walked  over  to  a  girl 
 and  I  don't  even  know  what  I'm  about  to 
 say  I  stutter  or  something  and  I'm  like
[08:33] oh  sorry  I  thought  you  were  someone  else 
 and  then  she  goes  it's  embarrassing  it 
 happens  right  but  there's  been  a  lot  of 
 times  where  I'll  just  walk  towards  her
[08:38] and  instantly  my  brain  will  just  come 
 off  of  something  where  I  just  like  you 
 know  see  something  on  her  that  she's 
 wearing  or  I  say  something  or  there  was
[08:44] a  girl  who's  holding  like  a  bag  of  KFC  I 
 was  like  what  did  you  buy  what's  in 
 there  another  girl  recently  she's  like 
 taking  some  supplement  or  something  so  I
[08:49] walk  over  there  I'm  like  what  is  that 
 and  she  shows  me  it's  like  black  seed 
 oil  and  she's  telling  me  about  like  the 
 prophet  Muhammad  was  taking  this  and  it
[08:55] cured  all  diseases  or  something 
 literally  just  go  over  and  just  allow 
 your  brain  to  say  something  naturally 
 the  reason  why  this  seems  scary  is
[09:01] because  you  have  D  trained  your  brain's 
 natural  ability  to  be  good  in  a  social 
 conversation  and  now  you're  watching
[09:07] videos  on  like  social  anxiety  and  videos 
 like  titling 
 you  need  to  train  that  again  so  that  you
[09:12] can  actually  be  good  with  girls  and  so 
 follow  this  three-step  process  step  one 
 actually  see  her  get  outside  see  more
[09:18] women  in  person  step  two  command  your 
 legs  to  walk  towards  it  get  her 
 attention  yo  excuse  me  step  three  you're 
 already  there  now  just  allow  your  brain
[09:24] to  say  some  kind  of  observational 
 question  to  her  you  might  be  pissed  off 
 because  you're  thinking  oh  man  I  wish 
 she  just  told  me  like  something  to  say
[09:29] the  issue  with  that  that  this 
 pre-prepared  question  is  that  this  will 
 actually  make  you  less  likely  to  go  on
[09:36] approach  because  then  you  start  to 
 practice  the  senses  in  your  mind  and  it 
 adds  to  the  mental  turmoil  if  right  now
[09:41] you  I  just  tell  you  okay  just  go  up  even 
 if  you're  not  gonna  say  anything  just  go 
 up  and  you'll  get  some  experience  of  you
[09:46] know  walking  towards  a  girl  and  getting 
 her  attention  that's  still  positive  but 
 if  you  won't  even  go  up  because  you're 
 overthinking  about  wait  should  I  say
[09:52] this  that  that  special  copying  space 
 sentence  should  I  say  it  what  if  I 
 started  when  I  say  it  and  you  don't  end 
 up  doing  it  the  three-step  process  you
[09:58] can  literally  go  out  and  try  this  today 
 and  I  guarantee  you  will  have  better 
 results  starting  conversations  with 
 girls  than  you've  ever  had  before  click
[10:03] and  watch  this  video  about  dating  right 
 now  do  the  hard  way  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah
