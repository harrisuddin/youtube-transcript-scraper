[00:00] we  often  insult  jeffrey  at  the  start  of 
 these  videos  but  jeffrey  is  a  young  man 
 who  has  fallen  victim  to  the  modern
[00:06] addictions  modern  technology  social 
 media  hyper-stimulating  porn  and  video 
 games  is  it  jeffrey's  fault  that  he's
[00:13] down  bad  it's  so  easy  for  us  to  make  fun 
 of  him  but  he's  fighting  an  uphill 
 battle  jeffrey  checks  his  phone  and  this
[00:18] notifications  in  a  certain  shade  of  red 
 that  are  so  enticing  that  he  just  can't 
 help  but  to  click  on  them  then  he
[00:23] scrolls  and  scrolls  and  scrolls  falling 
 victim  to  the  social  media  platforms 
 that  use  this  endless  scroll  like  this
[00:29] death  scroll  technology  hours  and  hours 
 and  hours  every  single  day  every  week
[00:34] every  month  every  year  up  until 
 jeffrey's  left  so  depressed  empty
[00:39] nihilistic  unaccomplished  and  then 
 jeffrey  kills  himself  this  isn't  a  meme 
 jeffrey's  a  guy  from  your  high  school
[00:45] picture  your  high  school  class  right  now 
 you  had  maybe  a  main  class  then  you  had 
 a  class  like  maths  and  science  and  stuff
[00:50] and  picture  the  guys  in  your  class 
 see  their  faces  within  a  few  years  at 
 least  one  of  those  faces  that  you've
[00:56] just  seen  in  your  mind  will  kill 
 themselves  you  hear  this  statements  and 
 it  doesn't  you  know  it's  scary
[01:02] it's  dark  to  hear  this  and  you  maybe 
 you'll  see  it  one  day  where  people  are 
 posting  about  on  social  media  but  you
[01:08] never  really  take  the  time  to  visualize 
 the  last  moments  of  a  man  who  literally
[01:13] kills  himself  because  of  the  modern 
 technology  has  made  him  so  depressed 
 he's  crying  he's  fighting  negative
[01:18] thoughts  he's  already  been  thinking 
 about  it  for  a  while  and  then  he  decides 
 to  take  action  constant  overwhelming
[01:25] relentless  negative  thoughts  bad  mental 
 health
[01:30] because  of  these  platforms  he  doesn't 
 want  to  be  this  way  he  doesn't  want  to 
 be  weak  but  the  modern  world  this
[01:35] technology  it's 
 it's 
 extremely  extremely
[01:40] strong  it  is  incredibly  hard  to  overcome 
 the  addictions  that  are  caused  by  things
[01:46] like  modern  social  media  the  smallest 
 things  like  that  shade  of  red 
 notification  they've  optimized  that
[01:52] those  nerds  in  like  silicon  valley  have 
 optimized  that  because  they  know  that 
 that  spikes  something  inside  of  your
[01:57] brain  to  make  you  click  on  it  they 
 understand  like  it's  almost  like  a 
 gambling  machine  where  they  understand 
 that  if  they  show  you  a  good  post  a  post
[02:03] that  they  know  that  you'll  like  followed 
 by  six  posts  that  are  going gonna  be 
 kind  of  boring  and  you  know  just  mild
[02:08] and  then  another  post  that  you  like  that 
 gives  you  dopamine  followed  by  three 
 posts  it's  different  every  time  you
[02:13] don't  know  when  the  next  hit  of  dopamine 
 is  gonna  come  and  it's  so  exciting  it's 
 so  addictive  that's  how  gambling  works 
 imagine  those  people  who  like  just  spent
[02:19] all  day  like  cranking  the  the  gambling 
 machines  they  don't  know  when  the  next 
 big  hit  the  reward  is  gonna  hit  that
[02:24] makes  it  so  much  more  addictive  and 
 these  nerds  know  this  they  specifically
[02:30] create  technology  like  this  knowing  that 
 it  [ __ ]  up  your  mental  health  knowing
[02:35] that  it  leads  to  people  killing 
 themselves  and  they  do  it  with  a  smile 
 on  their  face  because  these  nerds  who 
 work  at  like  facebook  get  paid  500k  a
[02:42] year  for  being  the  death  of  society  when 
 you  think  about  the  most  powerful  person 
 the  most  powerful  people  of  society  you
[02:48] might  think  of  like  donald  trump  like 
 the  president  wouldn't  you  maybe  you 
 think  of  like  some  big  strong  looking
[02:53] guy  but  it's  not  it's  a  nerd  with  like  a 
 tucked  in  shirt  forward  neck  posture 
 hunched  over  shoulders  i'm  telling  you
[02:58] right  now  this  is  going  to  sound  weird 
 nerds  silicon  valley  nerds  are  more 
 powerful  than  any  president  of  any
[03:04] country  they  control  who  is  the 
 president  how  do  people  get  picked  for
[03:09] like  presidency  how  do  people  like  vote 
 through  the  information  that  they  get 
 and  information  is  controlled  again  by
[03:14] these  like  silicon  valley  nerds  the 
 people  in  silicon  valley  these  tech  like 
 nerds
[03:19] control  who  gets  to  be  president  by  the 
 control  of  information  they  control  what
[03:24] [ __ ]  up  your  mental  health  what  news 
 goes  viral  and  what  news  doesn't  and  the 
 biggest  thing  that  they  want  why  these
[03:29] like  guys  these  little  nerds  are 
 employed  into  these  big  companies  like 
 facebook  retention  there's  one  main
[03:34] reason  why  these  people  are  employed 
 it's  for  retention  to  retain  you  to  keep 
 you  on  the  platform  for  longer  and
[03:39] longer  and  longer  imagine  these  guys  are 
 very  very  smart  these  are  like  extremely
[03:45] smart  like  geeks  they're  being  employed 
 paid  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars 
 per  year  and  their  sole  mission  is  to
[03:51] make  the  platform  more  addictive  then 
 imagine  if  this  company  has  hundreds  of
[03:56] these  employees  the  best  smartest  minds 
 and  these  like  these  nerds  bro  they're 
 optimizing  [ __ ]  they're  literally  taking
[04:01] like  nootropics  you  know  like  brain 
 altering  like  pills  and  not  like  they 
 they  do  some  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  up  [ __ ]  to  like
[04:07] improve  their  performance  their 
 cognitive  ability  to  write  better  code 
 to  come  up  with  more  ideas  all  of  these 
 guys  like  micro  dosing  and  everything
[04:13] that  is  what  we're  up  against  you  know 
 you  wanted  to  like  take  a  step  back  from 
 porn  or  video  games  or  social  media  you
[04:19] are  just  one  young  man  going  against 
 hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  these
[04:24] software  developers  these  data  analysis 
 they  know  everything  i  just  made  a  video
[04:29] which  is  gonna  go  live  like  today  it's 
 monday  the  18th  you  can  go  find  on  my 
 channel  it's  just  literally  titled 
 delete  instagram  now  and  i  was  telling
[04:35] you  the  story  of  like  what's  made  me 
 delete  my  instagram  which  i  got  [ __ ] 
 pissed  right  i  spent  an  hour  on  the
[04:40] platform  when  i  didn't  mean  to  i 
 literally  meant  to  just  go  on  to  it  to 
 send  a  single  message  and  i  ended  up 
 scrolling  for  over  an  hour  and  a  half
[04:46] seeing  like  50  different  girl  profiles 
 and  like  oh  my  god  this  girl's  got  big 
 titties  and  she's  not  that  far  away  so 
 like  my  evolutionary  brain  is  getting
[04:52] excited  but  then  the  next  profile  that  i 
 click  on  it's  like  a  big  muscular  guy  so 
 it's  like  oh  [ __ ]  that's  really  scary
[04:58] think  about  what's  that  what  that  is 
 doing  to  your  psychological  like  space
[05:03] and  then  i  said  in  this  video  that  the 
 way  i  expressed  my  frustration  for  when
[05:08] that  happened  you  know  i  spent  too  long 
 on  instagram  was  by  grabbing  my  phone 
 going  on  to  my  instagram  stories  and
[05:13] recording  myself  like  being  frustrated  i 
 was  frustrated  at  instagram  and  i  went 
 on  instagram  to  vent  my  frustration  i
[05:20] said  that  i  sat  there  for  a  second  and  i 
 literally  looked  at  the  camera  and  said 
 oh  [ __ ]  they  have  us  by  the  balls  you
[05:26] don't  realize  how  addicted  you  are  and 
 the  people  are  around  you  hopefully 
 you're  one  of  the  very  few  people  who've
[05:31] made  some  good  progress  here  and  if  you 
 have  if  right  now  you're  watching  this 
 and  you've  made  some  pretty  good
[05:36] progress  reducing  your  social  media  time 
 reducing  how  much  you  watch  porn  or  play 
 video  games  right  now  you  know  yeah  it's
[05:42] nice  you  you  know  you're  acknowledging 
 it  fair  enough  you  don't  realize  what 
 you've  just  done  you  have  just  done
[05:48] something  that  should  be  impossible  if 
 you  have  made  progress  to  reduce  your 
 social  media  use  that  literally  means
[05:54] you  are  winning  against  these  thousands 
 of  nerds  their  total  pay  is  in  the
[05:59] hundreds  of  millions  per  company  if  not 
 more  you  versus  thousands  of  nerds  who
[06:04] are  microdosing  who  are  on  nootropics 
 who  are  like  literally  employed  just  to
[06:09] make  sure  you  stay  addicted  to  the 
 platform  if  you've  made  any  progress  at 
 all  bro  holy  [ __ ]  you're  a  [ __ ]
[06:15] legend  and  if  you  haven't  if  right  now 
 you  still  feel  like  you  are  in  the 
 depths  of  like  social  media  addiction
[06:20] porn  addiction  video  game  addiction  it's 
 all  the  same  when  i  talk  about  these 
 like  silicon  valley  nerds  for  like 
 facebook  it's  also  the  same  nerds  who
[06:26] are  designing  like  porn  up  it's  also  the 
 same  nerds  who  are  designing  like  video 
 games  it's  all  the  same  kind  of 
 technology  all  of  these  nerds  have  been
[06:33] hired  literally  for  the  one  cause  of 
 retention  make  people  stay  here  for 
 longer  if  you  haven't  made  great
[06:38] progress  just  yet  and  you  find  yourself 
 okay  you  are  still  in  the  depths  of  this 
 addiction  it's  not  your  fault  it  is
[06:44] perhaps  one  of  the  hardest  like  modern 
 day  rites  of  passage  that  you  could  ever 
 come  across  is  taking  a  step  back  i  just
[06:50] want  you 
 to  see  the  life  that  is  waiting  for  you 
 on  a  practical  sense  if  you  cut  out  this
[06:56] cancer  from  your  life  the  three  big 
 things  social  media  video  games  and  porn
[07:01] on  a  practical  sense  you  will  save 
 probably  more  than  10  hours  per  week 
 that's  realistic  isn't  it  it's  probably
[07:07] more  than  that  that  10  hours  is 
 literally  how  you  as  a  young  ambitious 
 man  are  able  to  build  your  kingdom  the
[07:13] progress  that  you  wanted  you  know  you've 
 always  wanted  to  like  be  financially 
 free  and  have  freedom  and  success  and
[07:18] confidence  it  comes  from  being  in 
 control  of  your  time  when  you  have  time
[07:23] you  can  then  go  invest  that  into  things 
 like  learning  getting  therapy  spending 
 time  in  nature  sleeping  more  all  of
[07:28] these  things  which  are  so  good  for  you 
 and  then 
 when  you  start  putting  that  time  when 
 you're  like  a  healthy  person  and  you  put
[07:34] that  time  then  into  a  business  a  career 
 your  studies  you  get  that  success  that
[07:39] you've  always  wanted  you  feel  more 
 confident  and  you're  making  money  and 
 you  can  give  money  to  your  family  i  was 
 only  ever  able  to  make  any  progress  in
[07:46] life  and  feel  productive  in  life  at  age 
 22.  guess  what  i  did  i  cut  it  all  off  at 
 the  same  time  social  media  video  games
[07:52] and  porn  at  the  same  time  may  2020  i  cut 
 it  all  off  and  that  was  literally  the 
 start  of  like  the  new  chapter  of  my  life
[07:58] and  i  became  very  successful  after  that 
 because  i  saved  all  this  time  now  my 
 mental  power  like  my  mental  focus  isn't
[08:04] going  to  like  these  girls  just  showing 
 ass  on  instagram  finally  i'm  harnessing 
 it  for  myself  and  i'm  thinking  okay
[08:10] let's  put  in  some  [ __ ]  work  for 
 myself  for  once  let's  gather  my 
 attention  my  focus  into  my  own  things
[08:16] that  will  actually  develop  my  life 
 rather  than  consuming  this  mindless 
 content  that  is  a  modern  day  rite  of
[08:21] passage  for  men  i  want  you  to  just  see 
 the  vision  that  i  see  first  the  negative
[08:26] vision  if  you  don't  make  progress  in 
 this  if  you  continue  to  be  somewhat  of  a
[08:31] normal  person  who  makes  excuses  even 
 though  even  though  your  excuses  seem 
 valid  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  oh  i  can't  delete
[08:37] instagram  and  snapchat  because  there's 
 someone  to  message  shut  the  [ __ ]  up 
 don't  you  [ __ ]  say  that  to  yourself
[08:42] don't  you  sell  yourself  short  don't  you 
 like  advertise  for  these  nerds  oh  but
[08:47] there's  messages  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  if 
 there  was  important  messages  for  you  to 
 reply  to  on  facebook  instagram  whatever
[08:53] bro  you'd  have  each  other's  phone 
 numbers  if  they  don't  have  your  phone 
 number  if  you  don't  have  theirs  if  you 
 don't  text  each  other  it  wasn't  ever
[08:58] that  important  it's  not  you  talking  this 
 is  so  so  [ __ ]  interesting  when  you
[09:03] argue  for  something  that  you  know  is  so 
 totally  bad  for  you  social  media  video
[09:08] games  and  porn  when  you  argue  for  it 
 that  isn't  even  you  thinking  that's  the 
 addiction  it's  the  same  way  the  heroin
[09:14] addicts  say  like  oh  no  but  it's  good  for 
 me  i  can't  stop  [ __ ]  weed  smokers 
 every  day  like  oh  nobody  it  makes  me  a
[09:19] lot  it  makes  me  crave  it  it's  not  even 
 that  bad  video  game  as  well  but  it's  a 
 video  game  ideas  and  i  might  be  in
[09:24] esports  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  yeah  i  might  be 
 an  esports  player  it's  the  same  way  fat 
 people  talk  about  like  unhealthy  food
[09:29] that  is  the  addiction  talking  become 
 aware  of  it  become  aware  when  you  have  a
[09:34] thought  that  is  not  in  your  best 
 interest  and  realize  that  is  like  the 
 jeffrey  part  of  your  brain  that's  trying 
 to  keep  you  weak  this  may  be  some  of  the
[09:40] weirdest  most  specific  like 
 weirdest  [ __ ]  advice  you've  ever
[09:45] heard  before 
 a  lot  of  the  times  you  can't  trust  your 
 own  brain  a  lot  of  the  times  your  brain
[09:50] will  push  you  like  your  entire  body  will 
 crave  things  that  aren't  good  for  you 
 you  know  this  you  will  get  cravings  for
[09:55] things  that  aren't  good  for  you  porn 
 video  games  junk  food  drugs  you'll  get 
 cravings  for  them  you  will  have  every
[10:01] reason  to  believe  that  you  want  those 
 things  you  don't  you  rationally  know  you 
 objectively  know  that  these  things  are
[10:06] bad  for  you  but  you  have  this  feeling 
 inside  of  you  and  the  majority  of  young 
 men  are  so  weak  so  uncertain  so  unaware
[10:13] that  this  like  this  is  a  concept  that 
 you  have  like  a  jeffrey  brain  that  they 
 listen  to  it
[10:18] they  feel  like  watching  porn  so  they 
 watch  porn  they  feel  like  there's  a  good 
 reason  to  be  on  social  media  so  they  go
[10:23] on  social  media  they  don't  realize  that 
 a  lot  of  the  things  like  the  feelings 
 that  you  have  and  the  thoughts  that  you
[10:28] have  don't  actually  serve  you  they  are 
 manipulated  your  thoughts  and  your 
 feelings  and  your  desires  and  your
[10:33] cravings  are  manipulated  by  the  modern 
 addictions  these  nerds  are  being  paid  a 
 very  good  price  to  manipulate  your  brain
[10:40] and  to  make  you  feel  like  you  need  to 
 stay  on  to  the  platform  because 
 otherwise  you're  going  to  miss  out  and 
 you're  going to  be  lonely  but  i  need  to 
 be  on  there  to  message  people  that  is  in
[10:46] your  brain  talking  it's  the  message 
 that's  been  implanted  by  these  [ __ ] 
 nerds  who  want  to  make  you  feel  like
[10:51] you're  going  to  miss  out  for  more  fear 
 of  missing  out  that's  literally  what 
 they've  implanted  into  your  brain  if
[10:57] there  was  an  important  conversation  if 
 there  was  an  important  person  that  you 
 valued  you  would  have  each  other's  phone
[11:02] number  and  you  would  text  each  other  you 
 would  call  or  you  would  send  messages  on 
 like  whatsapp  if  they  don't  have  your
[11:07] phone  number  if  you  don't  have  theirs 
 that  conversation  was  never  important  77
[11:12] 000  followers  is  what  i'm  giving  up  by 
 not  using  instagram  anymore  that's  a 
 good  level  of  [ __ ]  car  i  want  you  to
[11:17] imagine  right  imagine  you  had  77  000 
 followers  on  instagram  imagine  you  go 
 meet  a  new  person  and  you  exchange  into

 kind  of  nice  and  she's  kind  of  vibing 
 you  and  you  exchange  instagrams  and  she
[11:27] sees  that  number  77k  now  she  likes  you

 another  guy  and  he  sees  oh  my  god  you've
[11:32] got  so  many  followers  what  do  you  do 
 77  000  followers  is  what  i'm  giving  up
[11:37] because  it  only  just  hit  me  like  i  knew 
 this  but  i  fell  into  the  trap  or  for  the 
 last  six  months  i  kind  of  just  like
[11:42] forgotten  i  just  thought  oh  yeah  you 
 know  i'm  using  instagram  and  it's  really 
 nice  and  i'm  using  it  mindfully  i  swear

[11:53] honest  this  is  how  i  get  girls  it's  my 
 instagram  the  pictures  i  post  and  the 
 fact  that  i've  got  like  clout  this  is
[11:58] how  i've  met  like  a  bunch  of  guys  who 
 like  look  up  to  me  and  you  know  like 
 like  hi  status  kind  of  attractive  guys
[12:03] message  me  and  they're  like  oh  bro  we 
 should  do  a  workout  and  everything  how 
 we're  making  friends  i'm  giving  that  up
[12:08] for  the  roi  of  improving  my  mental 
 health  because  that  is  the  single  best
[12:13] thing  that  if  there  is  something  bro

 piece  of  advice  i  can  give  you  if  there 
 is  something  that  improves  your  mental
[12:19] health 
 that  is  incredibly  valuable  the  things

[12:40] money  right  bro

 yourself  to  the  things  that  improve  your
[12:45] mental  health  and  perhaps  one  of  the 
 single  most  important  things  that  we  all 
 need  to  talk  about  is  stopping  social
[12:50] media  video  games  porn  you'll  get  to 
 live  and  then 
 you'll  be  so  saddened  when  you  look
[12:55] around  and  you  see  everyone  else 
 consumed  staring  into  their  [ __ ] 
 phones  like  jefferies  and  you'll  try  and
[13:00] save  as  many  people  as  possible  and 
 you'll  realize 
 why  i'm  making  a  video  exactly  like  this
[13:06] the  real  alpha  males  are  no  longer  like 
 those  big  steroid  tough  guys  the  guys  in 
 power  the  guys  who  are  in  charge  are
[13:12] these  skinny  neck  forward  neck  hunched 
 over  posture  nerds  and  they  know  what

 taking  away  your  family  from  you  they 
 know  that  they're  taking  away  your

 not  jacking  off  watching  porn  anymore 
 and  meditating  going  out  to  the  gym

 really  see  yourself  in  third  person  and 
 just  see  yourself  finally  doing  those
[15:07] right  habits  almost  like  flashes  of  you 
 just  being  [ __ ]  productive  running 
 around  like  lifting  weights  looking
[15:13] [ __ ]  sick  looking  like  stylish  as 
 [ __ ]  you've  been  improving  yourself 
 you're  doing  like  weird  habits  like
[15:18] meditating  and  journaling  all  that  [ __ ] 
 that  you  knew  like  you've  been  told  so 
 many  times  that  you  should  do  that  stuff
[15:23] that  you  should  prioritize  your  sleep 
 that  you  shouldn't  be  watching  porn  or 
 video  games  like  you've  taken  a  step 
 back  from  that  you've  raised  your
[15:28] slunken  head  away  from  your  computer 
 screen  and  you're  out  there  like 
 navigating  like  penetrating  through  the
[15:33] world  a  confident  smile  on  your  face 
 finally  the  life  that  you've  wanted  to 
 live  and  that's  just  that's  literally
[15:38] the  short  term  that's  the  life  you  will 
 live 
 weeks  from  now  weeks  from  now  you  can
[15:43] have  that  life  close  your  eyes  once  more 
 and  now  see  this  in  the  long  term  see 
 years  fly  by  years  of  you  living  a  life
[15:49] like  this  and  you  see  the  people  around 
 you  just  live  in  like  that  unideal  bad 
 habit  and  it's  so  different  to  the  way
[15:54] that  you've  been  living  and  the  law  of 
 the  compound  effect  starts  really 
 hitting  and  your  life  is  so  so  different
[15:59] after  implementing  and  staying 
 consistent  in  all  of  these  good  habits 
 you're  a  lot  older  and  more  mature  and
[16:04] like  you  look  built  and  successful  and 
 productive  your  mental  health  is  so 
 [ __ ]  good  whilst  other  people  that
[16:09] you  know  have  literally  killed 
 themselves  and  then 
 close  your  eyes  once  more
[16:15] years  from  now  you  meet  her  and  she  has 
 been  on  the  same  journey  as  you  and  you 
 have  children  and  you're  the  kind  of
[16:21] father  who  has  been  meditating  for  years 
 who's  physically  mentally  healthy  who's 
 grateful  and  present
[16:27] warm  loving  you've  got  brothers  around 
 you  men  that  you  really  respect  who  have 
 been  on  the  same  pathway  you  teach  your
[16:33] son  these  things  and  he  lives  a  life 
 just  like  you  through  your  son's  eyes
[16:38] imagine  what  he  sees  when  it's  time  for 
 him  to  go  to  school  he's  let's  say  he's 
 a  teenager  he's  in  high  school  imagine
[16:43] how 
 dark  and  deep  the  addictions  of  his 
 generation  will  be  how  different  your

 actions  that  you  take  today  if  there's
