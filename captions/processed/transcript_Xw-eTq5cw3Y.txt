[00:00] Jeffrey  is  a  racist  for  some  reason  he 
 just  hates  people  who  believes  in  God 
 now  of  course  there's  some  normal
[00:05] atheist  but  Jeffrey  is  a  hater  he  spends 
 his  time  on  Reddit  and  in  the  YouTube 
 comments  section  swearing  at  people  God
[00:11] doesn't  exist 
 come  on  Jeffrey  people  are  entitled  to 
 their  own  beliefs  Adonis
[00:18] when  you  think  of  Adonis  what  kind  of 
 man  do  you  think  he  would  be  would  he  be 
 a  Reddit  atheist  or  would  he  be  a  Godly
[00:25] Man  wouldn't  a  man  like  Adonis  raise  his 
 children  in  a  way  to  fear  God  wouldn't
[00:30] he  prefer  to  have  a  woman  whose  whole 
 Community  believes  in  God  and  follows  a 
 structured  system  to  live  their  lives  by
[00:36] Adonis  is  a  man  of  values  and  he  gets 
 that  from  his  religion  I  hated  being
[00:41] brown  skinned  I  hated  identifying  as  a 
 Muslim  I  was  born  in  Pakistan  and  we
[00:47] moved  to  the  UK  when  I  was  just  a  few 
 years  old  and  my  parents  raised  me  to  be 
 a  Muslim  and  by  the  time  I  got  a  few
[00:52] years  old  and  9  11  had  happened  all  I 
 saw  on  the  TV  was  issues  with  brown
[00:57] people  as  a  young  child  it  became 
 confirmed  in  my  mind  that  being  Brown 
 was  a  bad  thing  being  Muslim  meant  that
[01:02] I  was  a  terrorist  it  was  a  source  of 
 ridicule  and  bullying  in  school  till
[01:07] eventually  I  started  adopting  more  of 
 this  like  white  British  culture  but  I 
 never  really  fit  in  with  the  people  here
[01:13] I  made  jokes  about  my  own  race  and  my 
 own  religion  and  you  know  I  was  like  the 
 self-deprecating  little  Pakistani  guy
[01:18] who's  like  making  jokes  about  brown 
 people  and  everything  and  like  calling 
 myself  a  terrorist  just  to  try  and  make 
 the  white  boys  laugh  when  I  look  back
[01:23] now  like  you  know  it's  cringe  and  I  it's 
 kind  of  annoying  when  I  think  of  that 
 little  [ __ ]  version  of  me  but  I  also
[01:28] just  see  like  this  young  boy  who  was  so 
 pressured  by  the  society  and  the  media 
 around  him  that  convinced  him  that  being
[01:33] Brown  was  a  bad  thing  that  being 
 religious  was  a  bad  thing  that  being 
 Muslim  meant  that you're  a  terrorist  and 
 that's  all  I  saw  every  single  day  on  the
[01:39] TV  every  single  day  here  in  the  news  and 
 everything  that  okay  brown  people  are 
 bad  and  you  know  about  Muslims  are 
 terrorists  and  so  of  course  I  didn't
[01:44] want  to  identify  with  that  when  there 
 would  be  like  some  kind  of  terrorist 
 attack  I  would  literally  personally  feel 
 shame  and  I  would  rarely  want  to  deviate
[01:50] away  from  those  people  and  act  extra 
 white  next  to  my  friends  I  abandoned  my 
 race  My  Religion  my  faith  my  God  and  I
[01:58] indulged  in  the  pleasures  of  the  West 
 the  degeneracy  that's  available  here  you 
 know  there's  those  Temptations  whether
[02:03] you're  a  religious  man  or  not  there's 
 those  temptations  that  you  will  have 
 those  desires  promiscuity  of  [ __ ]
[02:08] these  girls  here  of  watching  porn  taking 
 drugs  of  partying  and  drinking  alcohol 
 enjoying  yourself  I  did  all  of  that  you
[02:13] can  literally  see  my  journey  through 
 these  hundreds  of  videos  that  I've  made 
 you  can  see  that  this  is  real  that  I
[02:18] indulged  in  that  lifestyle  we  have 
 hundreds  of  videos  of  me  in  parties 
 hooking  up  with  girls  I  enjoyed  that
[02:23] lifestyle  all  that  the  Godless  West  has 
 to  offer  and  here  I  am  today  in  front  of 
 you  saying
[02:28] it  wasn't  that  great  why  is  it  that  you 
 see  men  like  Andrew  Tate  who  again  has 
 experienced  like  all  that  the  West  has
[02:33] to  offer  all  these  hedonistic  Pleasures 
 convert  into  Islam  because  once  you've 
 fulfilled  all  of  these  Primal  desires  of
[02:38] yours  you're  left  with  this  spiritual 
 numbness  this  emptiness  but  then  also
[02:43] this  paranoia  this  fear  of  what  may 
 arise  when  you  are  a  Godless  man  now  if
[02:49] you're  watching  this  and  you're  thinking 
 this  is  weird  and  wait  whites  Hamza 
 preaching  religion  to  us  I  don't  want 
 you  to  feel  like  you're  not  welcome  so
[02:54] much  I'm  not  religious  religious  not  yet 
 I've  been  atheist  for  literally  most  of 
 my  life  and  only  just  in  the  last  few
[02:59] months  have  I  realized  like  something 
 has  got  to  change  now  Tate  has  recently 
 just  come  out  and  said  that  he's  Muslim
[03:05] and  he's  a  man  that  I  respect  I  hope 
 that  this  video  doesn't  seem  like  I'm 
 just  imitating  him  or  copying  him 
 because  this  is  a  major  life  decision
[03:10] that  we're  talking  about  but  he's  a  man 
 that  I  respect  and  when  he's  gave  the 
 arguments  for  and  against  believing  in 
 God  for  and  against  being  religious  it
[03:16] makes  total  sense  to  me  there  was 
 something  that  I  realized  a  while  ago 
 I've  been  reading  the  book  sapiens  it's
[03:21] like  a  very  famous  book  you  might  have 
 heard  of  it  it's  kind  of  like  the 
 history  of  how  our  species  is  you  know
[03:26] like  humans  as  like  sapiens  have  develop 
 and  it  goes  on  to  say  that  one  of  our 
 most  important  developments  was  how
[03:32] advanced  our  brain  got  to  the  point  that 
 we  could  start  to  think  of  things  that 
 aren't  exactly  right  in  front  of  us  we
[03:38] can  imagine  just  think  about  that  we  can 
 literally  imagine  things  we  can 
 fantasize  about  things  we  can  think  of
[03:43] something  that  is  not  in  front  of  us 
 right  now  and  share  that  story  to  our 
 fellow  man  and  that's  what  causes  us  to 
 unite  because  before  we  had  this
[03:49] Advanced  Brain  we  were  neanderthals  just 
 bashing  each  other  with  rocks  and  as 
 soon  as  our  Consciousness  got  to  that 
 level  where  we  could  believe  in
[03:54] something  bigger  than  us  we  joined 
 together  to  say 
 there's  such  a  thing  called  God  and
[03:59] maybe  if  we  follow  what  he  says  and  be 
 good  people  we'll  prosper  and  if  we 
 delay  gratification  we'll  get  into
[04:05] heaven  now  if  you've  watched  a  bunch  of 
 my  videos  what  is  the  most  important 
 concept  of  self-improvement  that  I  ever 
 talk  about  instant  gratification  versus
[04:11] delayed  gratification  the  ultimate  delay 
 gratification  is  the  promise  of  Heaven 
 be  good  in  this  life  for  a  better
[04:17] afterlife  I  teach  you  nothing  original 
 whatsoever  everything  that  I  say  comes 
 from  religion  be  a  good  person  be  kind
[04:23] be  generous  meditate  be  grateful  be  a 
 strong  person  have  a  family  rejected 
 generacy  and  Hedonism  but  I  realized  a
[04:29] while  ago  when  I  was  reading  this  book 
 sapiens  that  you  know  we  have  this 
 Advanced  Brain  that  we  can  believe  in 
 things  it  made  me  realize  that  as  a
[04:35] human  being  because  of  the  capability  of 
 our  Advanced  Brain  we  are  always  going
[04:40] to  worship  something  I'm  gonna  say  this 
 again  you  are  always  worshiping 
 something  if  you're  an  atheist  which  I
[04:46] am  so  I'm  not  being  hateful  or  anything 
 but  I  am  too  but  if  you're  an  atheist 
 and  you  don't  believe  in  God  you're 
 still  worshiping  something  you  still
[04:52] have  some  kind  of  God  okay  it's  not  a 
 religious  God  it's  not  the  god  from  the 
 Bible  it's  not  Allah  but  you  still 
 worship  something  you  know  I  carried
[04:58] this  concept  I  hope  this  makes  sense  I 
 carried  this  concept  in  my  mind  okay 
 you're  always  worshiping  something 
 religious  people  worship  a  God  and  a
[05:03] holy  book  atheists  what  do  they  worship 
 what  do  atheists  scream  and  go  crazy
[05:08] about  what  do  people  in  like  this 
 Godless  country  I'm  in  the  UK  what  do 
 people  worship  here  Brothers  gang
[05:14] members  if  you're  uncertain  about  that 
 you  can  search  on  YouTube  right  now 
 search  for  some  rapper  and  write  concert 
 at  the  end  of  it  and  you  will  see  all
[05:20] these  people  crazy  crazy  oh  my  god  oh 
 that's 
 their  God  when  you  live  in  a  Godless
[05:26] country  you're  still  being  given  people 
 to  worship  now  the  issue  is  the  person 
 that  you're  worshiping  isn't  this  holy
[05:31] Almighty  power  it's  not  like  this  force 
 of  good  it's  this  random  [ __ ]  Thug 
 degenerate  who's  got  women  twerking  in
[05:37] his  music  video  and  he's  talking  about 
 stabbing  people  and  taking  drugs  and 
 maybe  you've  known  this  already  because
[05:42] I've  kind  of  known  this  for  a  while  so 
 what's  the  new  revelation  that  I've  had 
 well  I  am  quite  certain  that  this  is  how 
 these  countries  will  fall  once  you  start
[05:48] to  open  your  eyes  to  this  possibility 
 that  the  country  that  we  are  in  doesn't 
 always  have  to  stay  safe  there's
[05:53] countries  out  there  right  now  they're  in 
 a  middle  of  a  war  now  I've  lived  in  the 
 UK  maybe  you're  in  the  UK  or  some
[05:58] country  in  the  west  which  seems 
 relatively  safe  we've  never  had  a  war  in 
 our  lifetimes  on  our  own  soil  the
[06:03] thought  of  being  dominated  by  a 
 different  country  if  you  live  in  the  UK 
 or  the  US  it  seems  something  like  that
[06:08] wouldn't  happen  because  yeah  the  America 
 is  really  really  strong  is  it  because 
 the  people  here  are  weak  there's  no
[06:13] doubt  about  that  whatsoever  the  people 
 here  are  weak  the  people  in  the  west  are 
 weak  there's  no  families  there's  all 
 reasons  for  a  man  to  be  strong  anymore
[06:18] because  there's  no  families  there's  no 
 like  I  hate  this  time  there's  no  good 
 women  older  women  have  fallen  prey  it's
[06:23] like  the  evil  propaganda  telling  them  to 
 devalue  themselves  religion  tells  women 
 to  Value  themselves  so  highly  and  tells
[06:29] men  to  Value  women  so  highly  that  you 
 keep  them  in  this  almost  this  state  of 
 like  semi-worship  and  the  Godless  West
[06:35] tells  women  to  degrade  themselves  to  the 
 point  that  they  literally  lose  their 
 value  because  it  tells  them  that  Purity
[06:40] is  not  an  important  thing  every  single 
 man  if  he  is  totally  just  you  know  you
[06:45] could  be  watching  this  disagreeing  with 
 me  right  now  you  could  be  some  male 
 feminist  if  you  just  stay  silent  don't 
 ever  speak  about  this  to  anyone  else  but
[06:50] if  you  just  see  how  you  feel  at  the 
 thought  of  a  woman  being  Godless  and 
 sleeping  around  and  enjoying  the
[06:55] Hedonism  of  the  West  if  you  think  of 
 your  future  wife  getting  [ __ ]  down  by 
 Childs  and  she  matched  with  this  guy  on
[07:00] Tinder  it  gives  you  this  gut  feeling  of 
 pain  inside  of  every  single  man  is  this 
 gut  feeling  of  pain  that  a  Godless  woman
[07:06] it's  not  right  it's  not  attractive  it's 
 not  what  we  want  but  outside  because  of 
 this  propaganda  because  of  this  pressure
[07:11] that  I  have  this  fear  of  being  canceled 
 by  speaking  about  this  right  now  you  go 
 girl  oh  don't  be  sexist  don't  be
[07:16] misogynist  Pierce  Morgan  saying  this  to 
 Andrew  Taylor  oh  that's  misogynist  Tate 
 just  said  this  in  a  recent  podcast  of
[07:21] his  that  Islam  is  a  cure  for  degeneracy 
 I  can't  think  of  any  other  better  cure  I
[07:26] honestly  can't  I  was  so  certain  for  all 
 of  my  life  that  I  would  you  know  it  was 
 never  something  that  important  to  me  but
[07:32] it  was  like  kind  of  certain  yeah  just 
 I'd  be  an  atheist  for  the  rest  of  my 
 life  like  I  don't  believe  in  God  right 
 maybe  you've  seen  over  the  last  like  one
[07:37] year  or  so  that  I've  really  started  to 
 consider  this  more  and  more  to  the  point 
 now  that  I'm  literally  reading  the  Quran
[07:42] my  mom  used  to  make  me  read  that  when  I 
 was  a  child  and  you  know  I  never  really 
 wanted  to  I  always  like  struggled  or 
 whatever  and  now  I've  actively  started
[07:48] reading  it  by  my  own  accord  and  I  called 
 my  mum  two  days  ago  and  told  her  and  I 
 just  saw  like  the  biggest  smile  on  her
[07:53] face  when  I  told  her  that  I  started 
 reading  you  know  our  holy  book  and  she 
 just  got  like  so  happy  she  told  me  it 
 was  the  right  thing  she  told  me  that
[07:58] this  you  know  this  was  the  way  forward 
 right  here  right  now  you  either  fully 
 believe  me  you  agree  with  me  and  you're
[08:03] like  yeah  this  is  amazing  Amazon  might 
 turn  Muslim  you  know  he'll  be  one  of  our 
 brothers  that's  amazing  and  that's 
 awesome  but  maybe  if  you're  watching
[08:08] this  right  now  and  you're  just  feeling 
 weird  and  thinking  okay  this  guy  is 
 preaching  to  us  I  don't  care  about 
 religion  religion  is  not  important  trust
[08:13] me  when  I  say  I  felt  exactly  the  same 
 way  for  all  of  my  life  maybe  you're  not 
 there  just  yet  but  there  will  be  a  point
[08:18] as  you  keep  advancing  your 
 self-improvement  especially  when  you 
 start  looking  into  like  The  Wider  scale
[08:23] of  things  you  start  are  really 
 investigating  why  countries  rise  and 
 fall  you  start  investigating  the  kind  of
[08:28] country  that  you  want  to  raise  your 
 children  and  then  you  start  to  realize 
 that  countries  that  eventually  give  up 
 their  culture  their  values  and  their
[08:33] religion  end  up  getting  [ __ ] 
 decimated  by  another  country  that's  kept 
 their  hardcore  values  there  are  no
[08:40] nuclear  families  here  there's  no  reason 
 for  a  man  to  be  strong  in  this  country 
 and  so  we  see  that  every  man  here  is
[08:45] weak  I'm  talking  about  the  UK  but  you 
 know  what's  interesting  where  are  the 
 strong  British  men  in  Spain  in  Dubai  the
[08:51] most  successful  most  wealthy  the  hardest 
 working  guys  here  in  the  west  they  make 
 their  money  and  then  they  go  to  a
[08:56] different  country  so  these  countries 
 can't  even  retain  like  the  strong  men 
 who  would  have  kept  societies  like  this
[09:01] balanced  the  strong  men  of  these 
 countries  don't  even  want  to  stay  here 
 if  you  ask  these  people  right  here  right
[09:06] now  would  they  fight  for  this  country 
 they'd  look  at  you  weird  they  would 
 literally  look  at  you  with  ketamine 
 around  their  nose  right  now  looking  at
[09:12] you  like  oh  what  were  you  talking  about 
 oh  just  passes  the  packet  like  we  talk 
 about  let's  go  to  the  public  I'm  just
[09:18] having  a  wank  if  you  feel  safe  right 
 here  right  now  in  these  countries  I  am 
 sure  that  you  have  not  opened  your  eyes
[09:24] to  the  brutal  truth  the  brutal  facts 
 that  are  happening  around  the  world  I 
 made  a  video  which  was  my  most
[09:29] uncensored  most  brutal  most  important 
 video  yeah  it's  titled  Tick  Tock  is 
 worse  than  you  thought  if  you  haven't
[09:34] seen  that  already  I  highly  suggest  you 
 watch  all  of  that  it's  not  like  a  normal 
 anti-social  media  video  I  rarely  show
[09:39] you  the  research  that  shows  that  Tick 
 Tock  is  the  greatest  weapon  of  war  that 
 we've  ever  experienced  Tick  Tock  is 
 literally  more  deadlier  than  any  nuclear
[09:45] weapon  that  we've  ever  devised  once  you 
 look  at  the  research  of  that  and  you  see 
 the  country  behind  that  and  you  see  that
[09:50] countries  right  here  right  now  are 
 preparing  for  war  whilst  your  country 
 celebrates  [ __ ]  your  country
[09:56] celebrates  degeneracy  it  celebrates 
 removing  men  from  the  household  it
[10:01] literally  actively  helps  no  it  actively 
 forces  fathers  out  of  the  household
[10:06] which  means  that  children  may  be  like 
 yourself  are  raised  by  single  mothers 
 becoming  weak  lacking  values  and  you  do
[10:12] realize  that  there's  such  a  thing  called 
 drafts  you  do  realize  that  there  is  a 
 possibility  that  you  may  be  forced  to
[10:17] fight  for  your  country  and  you  probably 
 don't  even  see  it  as  your  country  the 
 first  thing  people  in  this  country  do
[10:22] when  they  make  money  is  they  leave 
 there's  two  music  videos  that  I've 
 watched  recently  I  don't  watch  this  kind
[10:27] of  [ __ ]  content  but  there  was  two 
 that  my  friend  Sam  kind  of  told  me  to 
 watch  one  of  them  you  can  go  and  have  a 
 look  right  now  it's  called  messy  in
[10:33] heaven  and  it's  made  by  like  some  random 
 girl  who's  just  she's  saying  that  Jesus 
 Took  cocaine  like  you  know  it's  a
[10:38] [ __ ]  degenerate  [ __ ]  it  just  shows 
 her  and  her  friends  like  enjoying 
 themselves  drinking  taking  drugs  oh  in 
 parties  bro  when  I  tell  you  right  now
[10:43] that  that  music  video  is  such  an 
 accurate  depiction  of  a  night  out  in 
 British  culture  where  these  people  will
[10:48] come  in  early  start  drinking  then  go  out 
 and  start  smoking  in  the  middle  of  the 
 Rave  and  they're  all  [ __ ]  up and  stuff 
 this  is  what  the  people  are  doing  here
[10:53] that's  like  what  Godless  young  people  do 
 and  then  there  was  another  video  that 
 Sam  showed  me  was  like  some  random
[10:58] rapper  just  you  know  like  some  American 
 rapper  with  like  a  bunch  of  like  jewelry 
 on  and  everything  he's  got  like  girls
[11:03] twerking  around  him  and  everything  you 
 know  it's  just  a  stereotypical  like  rap 
 song  if  that  guy  walks  through  the
[11:08] streets  and  people  knew  he  was  there  he 
 would  be  bombarded  all  of  his  worshipers 
 would  go  and  like  kneel  before  him  it's
[11:14] a  random  rapper  when  they  do  concerts 
 people  literally  kneel  before  them  and 
 like  girls  throw  that  is  that  your 
 future  wife  throwing  her  bra  to  this
[11:19] rapper  is  that  you're  gonna  be  your 
 future  wife  in  this  country  oh  but  I 
 just  like  going  to  concerts  to  dance 
 with  my  girls  some  run  rapper  as  your
[11:25] future  wife's  bra  if  you've  read  the 
 book  Hard  Times  quite  strong  man  you're 
 already  panicking  at  this  Global  State
[11:30] of  Affairs  and  if  you've  not  read  that 
 book  right  now  maybe  your  eyes  are  still 
 closed  and  maybe  you  think  that  I'm  some 
 weirdo  all  those  guys  who  don't
[11:35] understand  this  concept  are  probably 
 clicked  off  the  video  and  thinking  yeah 
 I'm  just  going  crazy  whatever  if  you 
 haven't  already  the  book  Hard  Times
[11:40] create  strong  men  by  Stefan  O'Neill  is  a 
 10  out  of  10  must  read  and  you  must 
 start  reading  it  now  if  there's  one 
 thing  I  can  command  you  to  do  if  that
[11:46] you  have  any  like  level  of  like 
 adherence  to  what  I  say  if  there's  one 
 thing  I  can  make  you  do  go  find  the  book 
 Hard  Times  create  strong  men  and  start
[11:52] reading  it  right  now  as  you  start 
 reading  it  you  will  Panic  you  will 
 literally  start  a  fear  for  the  physical
[11:57] safety  of  your  family  you  will  start  to 
 think  okay  [ __ ]  I  need  to  make  more 
 money  and  get  my  family  out  of  this 
 country  fast  it's  been  written  in  books
[12:03] of  the  exact  pattern  that  we're  going 
 through  a  guy  who  wrote  this  book  who 
 mysteriously  died  after  writing  it
[12:08] predicted  exactly  what's  happening  and 
 he  mentioned  the  term  which  I've  spoke 
 about  in  a  previous  video  called 
 subversion  subversion  is  when  you
[12:13] destroy  a  country's  cultures  and  value 
 so  that  it  becomes  weak  from  the  inside 
 and  you  do  this  before  you  even  go  to
[12:18] war  with  them  So  eventually  when  you're 
 going  to  war  you're  gonna  go  fight  some 
 guy  who's  on  day  Zero  of  notefab  you're 
 gonna  go  fight  some  guy  who  doesn't  even
[12:23] have  a  family  to  fight  wait  for  I've 
 said  this  so  many  times  bro  imagine 
 these  countries  going  to  war  with  a
[12:28] country  who  still  values  family  and 
 religion  imagine  an  atheist  hey  boy  390
[12:33] grams  of  Tesla  I  can't  even  take  that 
 bit  out  because  YouTube  will  [ __ ] 
 can't  tell  me  if  I  use  a  word  like  oh  I
[12:38] got  canceled  on  skillshare  for  talking 
 about  the  death  of  masculinity  in  these 
 countries  when  you  destroy  masculinity
[12:43] in  the  young  men  of  your  why  it  doesn't 
 make  [ __ ]  sense  when  you  think  about 
 it  why  are  these  countries  destroying
[12:48] their  own  men's  masculinity  because  they 
 live  in  a  state  of  [ __ ]  comfort  and 
 they  think  that  now  this  is  troubling 
 this  is  toxic  you  see  our  videos  of
[12:54] helping  young  men  rise  up  and  cure  their 
 addiction  support  and  social  media  into 
 junk  food  we  are  seen  as  Toxic  by  our
[13:00] own  countries  we  are  trying  to  become 
 strong  so  that  we  may  protect  our  own 
 countries  and  they  literally  see  us  as
[13:05] toxic  and  they  want  to  silence  us  every 
 video  that  I  record  these  days  bro  I 
 don't  even  know  which  one's  gonna  get  me
[13:10] totally  silenced  two  years  of  hard  work 
 employees  who  rely  on  the  income  that  we
[13:15] make  and  I  don't  even  know  which  random 
 video  I  make  is  just  totally  gonna 
 remove  everything  how  crazy  is  that
[13:21] YouTube  is  a  western  company  I  think 
 it's  like  a  US  company  and  it's  sees 
 content  from  guys  who  are  trying  to  make
[13:26] these  countries  stronger  and  it  will 
 literally  silence  you  we've  got  to  the 
 State  of  Affairs  where  companies  and
[13:32] people  and  leaders  in  these  like  Western 
 Godless  countries  aren't  even  supporting 
 their  own  country  and  so  of  course  when
[13:38] you  see  a  strong  successful  man  being 
 silenced  being  hate  on  being  called 
 toxic  where  do  you  see  them  all  go  they
[13:43] don't  stay  in  these  [ __ ]  countries 
 anymore  you  see  Tate  just  move  over  like 
 you  know  he  was  started  in  UK  then  he
[13:48] moved  over  to  Romania  then  he's  moved  to 
 Dubai  I'm  going  to  Dubai  you  see  Iman 
 move  to  Dubai  bro  everyone's  moving  East
[13:53] every  smart  rich  person  is  moving  East 
 and  literally  they're  all  moving  to  a 
 Muslim  country  why  think  about  that
[13:58] these  guys  are  probably  Your  Role  Models 
 all  of  your  role  models  are  moving  to  a 
 Muslim  country  and  all  of  the  broke  guys
[14:04] are  still  going  out  to  the  pub  and  you 
 see  them  like  lying  down  on  the  floor 
 like  the  other  gritty  dirty  floor  at  the 
 end  of  the  night  I  was  like  oh  I'm  so
[14:10] [ __ ]  like  oh  I  had  too  many  jager 
 bombs  lad  you  know  there's  countries 
 because  of  religion  that  totally
[14:15] inhibits  especially  the  sexual  just 
 freedom  but  just  the  sexual  freedom  of 
 their  young  people  Islam  restricts  that
[14:20] Islam  restricts  the  sexual  freedom  of 
 the  young  people  there  you  only  get  to 
 have  sex  and  your  own  only  get  to
[14:25] experience  the  opposite  sex  once  you're 
 about  to  get  married  and  guess  what 
 happens  then  a  young  Muslim  guy  and  a 
 young  Muslim  girl  since  they're
[14:30] restricted  from  being  able  to  you  know 
 date  or  have  sex  or  anything  they're 
 focused  on  being  productive  good
[14:35] citizens  in  a  right  like  in  an  enforced 
 Islamic  country  people  go  through  the 
 school  system  focus  on  their  studies  and
[14:41] so  they  produce  some  top  level  doctors 
 and  engineers  and  their  country  gets 
 stronger  hear  what  happens  through  the
[14:46] school  system  here  if  you're  in  the  UK 
 or  the  US  what  happens  during  school 
 sure  there  might  be  some  like  nerds  who 
 are  like  you  know  focused  even  they
[14:51] think  about  it  those  people  are 
 demonized  they're  the  person  who's 
 actually  focused  in  school  is  demonized 
 and  called  a  nerd  like  I  just  call  this
[14:56] guy  a  nerd  bro  but  for  the  majority  of 
 people  in  the  school  system  like  you 
 know  the  new  generation  of  workers  who 
 are  supposed  to  defend  the  country
[15:02] they're  too  busy  thinking  oh  has  she 
 replied  oh  did  he  just  [ __ ]  me  and  now 
 he's  not  replying  anymore  think  about 
 how  much  of  their  brain  power  was  being
[15:08] taken  away  by  the  openness  of  the  sexual 
 Revolution  here  bro  kids  are  having  sex 
 at  age  30  in  here  do  you  really  think
[15:13] they're  focused  on  their  studies  do  you 
 really  think  this  country  is  going  to 
 produce  like  the  best  workers  that  it 
 could  do  I've  had  the  chance  to  invest
[15:19] money  you  know  this  company  is  making  a 
 good  amount  of  money  and  I  try  and 
 reinvest  as  much  of  it  as  possible  back 
 into  the  business  but  got  to  the  point
[15:25] now  where  our  income's  pretty  high  and 
 it's  time  for  me  to  try  and  invest  into 
 like  you  know  other  companies  other  you 
 know  crypto  stocks  and  stuff  and  you
[15:30] know  the  conventional  advice  that  I've 
 always  heard  is  oh  invest  in  the  S  P  500 
 and  it  would  probably  be  a  good
[15:35] investment  guess  why  I've  not  invested 
 in  those  index  funds  guess  why  I've  not 
 invested  in  those  American  companies  you 
 can  call  me  crazy  but  I  don't  think  they
[15:40] will  stand  it  another  20  years  from  now 
 I  don't  think  that  the  top  us  companies 
 will  either  exist  or  will  still  be  like
[15:45] registered  as  us  companies  20  years  from 
 now  all  these  people  are  still  trying  to 
 like  invest  into  the  West  as  it  [ __ ]
[15:51] degrades  it  makes  no  sense  to  me  it 
 makes  absolutely  no  sense  you  can  see 
 the  degration  of  all  elements  of  a
[15:57] Godless  Western  Society  inflation  mental 
 health  suicide  gang  war  someone's
[16:02] getting  stabbed  every  single  day  in 
 London  like  Tate  says  this  and  I  thought 
 it  was  over  dramatic  I  kind  of  knew  that
[16:07] the  brutal  facts  of  how  unsafe  it  is 
 here  but  when  you  just  bro  if  you  really 
 want  to  [ __ ]  give  yourself  anxiety 
 and  see  how  [ __ ]  this  country  is  just
[16:13] go  on  to  Google  and  just  search  London 
 stabbing  he  was  totally  right  if  you  do 
 this  you'll  ruin  your  [ __ ]  day  I 
 don't  know  if  I  sound  crazy  and
[16:18] everyone's  gonna  think  oh  I'm  just  lost 
 it  now  but  once  you  start  looking  into 
 this  and  you  look  into  this  concept  of
[16:23] these  countries  are  falling  because  of 
 the  degration  of  like  strong  masculine 
 virtues  and  they're  becoming  more 
 feminine  more  emotional  they  becoming
[16:29] more  like  politically  correct  which  is 
 weakness  and  you  start  to  think  okay 
 well  every  part  of  society  is  getting
[16:34] worse  with  this  and  then  you  see  the 
 rise  of  strong  countries  that  are  still 
 enforcing  like  hard  [ __ ]  disciplined
[16:39] rules  you  know  we  always  thought  China 
 was  crazy  you  always  used  to  hear  oh 
 China's  like  Advanced  social  media  and
[16:44] they've  done  this  and  they've  done  this 
 we  thought  oh  yeah  they're  so  crazy  why 
 don't  they  just  like  allow  people  to  go 
 onto  Facebook  this  is  why  they  don't
[16:50] want  Western  degeneracy  to  infiltrate 
 their  culture  there  I  don't  even  think 
 it's  enough  to  just  have  good  values  and
[16:55] be  like  a  good  Muslim  in  this  country  I 
 really  don't  because  I  see 
 this  might  get  me  [ __ ]  hated  by  the
[17:00] Muslim  Community  but  bro  honestly  a  lot 
 of  Muslims  in  these  countries  are  not 
 even  Muslims  they're  just  fakers  a  lot 
 of  like  the  girls  who  have  been  raised
[17:06] by  good  Muslim  parents  eventually  get 
 like  so  [ __ ]  brainwashed  by  their 
 friends  in  the  school  system  and  by  Tick 
 Tock  and  stuff  that  they  turn  into  [ __ ]
[17:12] they  won't  have  sex  but  they  will  suck 
 dick  and  it  seems  [ __ ]  vulgar  I 
 promise  you  that  this  shit's  happening
[17:17] and  100  this  sounds  contradictive  coming 
 from  someone  who's  indulged  in  the 
 degeneracy  here  yo  this  is  the  case  of
[17:22] me  experiencing  these  things  [ __ ] 
 around  enjoying  the  drug  culture  the 
 party  culture  here  and  then  transforming
[17:27] and  telling  you  don't  do  it  and  you  can 
 say  it  to  yourself  wait  but  this  guy's 
 done  it  so  how  is  he  telling  me  not  to 
 do  it  well  the  only  way  that  I  could
[17:32] tell  you  not  to  do  these  things  like  for 
 example  to  not  continue  playing  video 
 games  so  maybe  maybe  reconsider  being  an
[17:38] atheist  maybe  don't  take  drugs  maybe 
 don't  be  so  sex  obsessed  with  the  women 
 here  because  I've  done  them  myself  and
[17:43] I'm  speaking  from  experience  how 
 interesting  is  that  that  you  are  seeing 
 the  rise  of  strong  men  who  are  from
[17:48] Western  countries  who  have  indulged  in 
 every  pleasure  that  the  degenerate 
 Western  world  has  to  offer  and  you  are 
 seeing  these  men  take  a  big  step  away
[17:54] from  the  Western  World  and  tell  you  like 
 it's  not  even  that  great  you're 
 literally  seeing  guy  guys  who  have 
 indulged  in  everything  and  they're
[18:00] telling  you  that  it's  not  that  great  now 
 I'll  speak  directly  to  the  Muslims  who 
 are  watching  this  the  young  Muslims  who
[18:05] might  have  some  kinds  of  Temptations 
 right  now  I  can  emphasize  with  you 
 especially  if  you  live  in  countries  like 
 this  and  all  you're  seeing  is  just  ass
[18:10] every  day  ass  on  Tick  Tock  ass  on  social 
 media  your  school  teacher's  a  stripper 
 because  that's  oh  well  you  know  sex
[18:15] workers  your  school  teachers  got  [ __ ] 
 only  fans  these  days  oh  man  you  know  oh
[18:20] we've  got  to  support  sex  workers  as  a 
 young  Muslim  and  you're  being  sold  sex 
 and  the  Temptation  will  keep  increasing
[18:25] hopefully  you  can  see  a  man  like  me 
 maybe  a  man  like  Tate  and  just  think 
 these  guys  have  indulged  in  that  and 
 they're  literally  still  telling  you  that
[18:30] it's  not  worth  pursuing  I've  started 
 reading  the  Quran  and  maybe  you  should 
 too 
 click  and  watch  this  video  right  now  do
[18:36] the  hard  work  especially  when  you  don't 
 feel  like  it
