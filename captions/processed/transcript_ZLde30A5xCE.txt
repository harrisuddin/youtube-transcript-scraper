[00:00] bro  i  think  you're  all  a  little  gay  for 
 liking  this  hamza  hamza  hamza  y'all  need
[00:05] some  friends  bro  this  is  crazy  don't 
 manage  to  do  this  all  this  videos  are 
 like  every  day  you  have  to  improve  he's
[00:10] a  gym  bro  he  can  speak  eloquently  what 
 the  [ __ ]  you  watch  get  grow  the  [ __ ]  up
[00:15] bro  do  you  not  have  friends  you  don't 
 have  friends  do  you  all  of  you  are  just 
 18  year  old  and  lonely  bro
[00:23] i  thought  me  and  sneaker  were  cool  i 
 have  him  on  whatsapp  and  i've  connected 
 really  really  well  with  his  brother  who 
 we'll  speak  about  soon  and  before  we
[00:29] continue  on  with  this  video  i  really 
 just  want  to  say  like  i  love  sneako's 
 old  videos  i  love  his  old  vibe  i  just
[00:34] think  that  he  might  have  went  down  the 
 wrong  path  nico  made  a  reaction  video  to 
 our  movement  where  he  was  insulting
[00:40] towards  the  young  men  who  were  on 
 self-improvement  saying  that  they're  on 
 like  lesser  stages  than  life  than  he  is
[00:45] and  that  he  doesn't  need  it  anymore  all 
 of  you  are  just  18  year  old  and  lonely 
 bro  and  you're  in  college  and  [ __ ]  you
[00:50] want  to  get  a  job  you're  like  i  need  to 
 do  something  with  my  life  and  this  guy's 
 like  just  he's  feeding  that  mentality
[00:55] which  is  good  it's  good  to  push  people 
 but  bro  i  don't  need  this  i'm  not  at
[01:00] that  point  the  first  thing  that  i  really 
 picked  up  on  was  how  like  fragile  i've 
 never  wanted  to  say  this  you know
[01:05] fragile  masculinity  but  how  how  fragile 
 his  masculinity  seemed  when  he  saw  a 
 video  of  me  stretching  on  his  live
[01:10] stream  he  watched  like  a  day  in  the  life 
 video  that  i  made  on  my  second  channel 
 where  i'm  showing  like  my  life  in
[01:15] thailand  i'm  training  really  hard  and  i 
 started  the  day  with  some  like  light 
 stretching  it's  something  that  i  wanted 
 to  get  more  consistent  in  and  he  just
[01:20] fully  fully  like  called  me  gay  for  it 
 called  me  weird  for  posting  that  video 
 and  saying  like  oh  you  like  he  brought 
 his  friends  look  look  how  gay  it  is  like
[01:25] look  wearing  shorts  and  it  looks  kind  of 
 gay  bro  get  the  go  bro  bro  bro  that's
[01:30] crazy  imagine  if  i  made  these  videos 
 would  you  still  respect  me  in  short
[01:35] shorts  and  i  think  we're  all  kind  of 
 surprised  that  he  has  this  viewpoint 
 because  sneaker  himself  was  even  a  bit
[01:40] of  an  athlete  he  used  to  box  and  lift 
 heavy  weights  so  he  knows  the  importance 
 of  stretching  and  keeping  your  body 
 mobile  stretching  is  really  important  i
[01:47] neglected  it  for  years  but  now  i'm 
 training  harder  than  ever  i'm  lifting 
 heavy  weights  six  times  a  week  i'm 
 training  muay  thai  six  times  a  week  i'm
[01:53] signing  up  for  an  amateur  muay  thai 
 fight  so  that's  gonna  be  a  very  very 
 interesting  chapter  of  my  life  and  so  of
[01:58] course  with  everything  that  we're  doing 
 we  go  to  the  gym  so  often  stretching  and 
 mobility  work  being  flexible  is  so  so
[02:03] important  so  i  was  really  surprised  by 
 sneaker  thought  it  was  like  gay  to 
 stretch  and  then  i  realized  he  doesn't 
 go  to  the  gym  anymore  in  the  react  video
[02:09] that  he  posted  on  his  second  channel  he 
 criticized  us  and  our  movements  that 
 self-improvement  is  cringe  it's  for
[02:14] people  who  are  in  this  is  his  words 
 lesser  stages  of  life  than  he  is  nico 
 your  ego  is  blinding  you  you  are  at  that
[02:20] lesser  stage  you  are  not  a  man  of 
 character  you  cheated  on  your  last 
 girlfriend  you  have  no  integrity  you
[02:26] drink  alcohol  just  sat  there  by  yourself 
 that's  a  horrible  habit  you  watched 
 another  guy  have  sex  with  your
[02:31] girlfriend  that's  weird  and  you  can  call 
 us  all  insecure  for  that  if  you  want 
 i've  seen  her  [ __ ]  other  men  and  it's
[02:36] just  like  that  was 
 imagine  seeing  the  girl  you  love  like 
 get  [ __ ]  get  [ __ ]  love  her  it  was
[02:42] literally  like  this  far  away  from  me 
 we're  on  the  same  bed  i  was  with  his 
 girl  he  was  with  my  girlfriend
[02:47] yeah  yeah  what's  wrong  with  you  you're 
 odd  you  sat  on  the  bed  while  she  got 
 [ __ ]  i  i  was  there  too  i  mean
[02:54] i  got  up 
 were  you  [ __ ]  his  girl  i  i  was  not 
 [ __ ]  with  her  so  you  just  sat  there  i
[02:59] wonder  what  goes  on  in  your  brain  you 
 don't  meditate  you  don't  journal  you 
 don't  even  go  to  the  gym  anymore  tanika
[03:04] you  say  that  you're  past  that  point  in 
 life  where  you  need  self-improvement  i 
 say  this  not  as  an  insult  but  i  think
[03:09] you're  being  delusional  and  you  know 
 what's  weird  literally  just  like  a  day 
 before  nico  made  this  video  about  me  he
[03:14] posted  this  celebratory  post  on 
 instagram  with  him  like  he  had  three 
 youtube  plaques  he  had  like  two  silver
[03:19] ones  for  100k  and  one  gold  one  and  i 
 literally  bro  i  saw  that  post  i 
 literally  showed  it  to  my  friends  i  was
[03:24] like  bro  he's  like  he's  such  a  sick 
 creator  and  like  i  want  to  take  a 
 picture  just  like  this  because  i've  got 
 like  two  silver  plaques  from  youtube
[03:29] from  my  main  channel  for  my  second 
 channel  and  i'm  getting  closer  and 
 closer  to  getting  that  gold  one  for  one 
 million  and  so  i  saw  that  picture  and  i
[03:34] visualized  it  for  myself  and  i  was  so 
 hyped  for  him  but  then  after  all  this  i 
 did  some  investigating  sneaker  your
[03:39] channel's  dying  your  daily  views  have 
 dropped  significantly  you  did  just  cross 
 over  the  one  million  mark  and  i  didn't
[03:45] really  feel  so  proud  of  you  for  that  but 
 i  had  to  look  through  some  of  your 
 videos  and  anyone  else  can  do  this  most
[03:50] of  the  comments  from  your  subscribers 
 were  negative  the  old  sneaker  used  to 
 post  thought-provoking  videos  he  was
[03:56] literally  like  a  modern  day  philosopher 
 now  it  just  seems  like  you  watch  too 
 much  red  pill  and  routine  content  and  it
[04:01] seems  like  you're  trying  to  be 
 controversial  to  get  those  views  to 
 spike  up  again  the  old  sneaker  would 
 post  beautifully  edited  like  very
[04:07] creative  videos  like  the  editing  that 
 you  would  do  in  those  videos  was  so 
 artistically  impressive  your  videos  used
[04:13] to  feel  like  a  cinematic  masterpiece  and 
 now  you're  just  sitting  there  reacting 
 to  other  youtubers  dishing  out  insults
[04:19] whilst  you're  literally  drunk  brother 
 you  need  self-improvement  now  more  than 
 ever  now  i  speak  directly  to  my  boys  and
[04:25] to  eco  subscribers  if  they  do  find  this 
 video  boys  make  sure  you  do  not  get 
 complacent  self-improvement  setting
[04:31] goals  setting  challenges  for  yourself 
 experiencing  discomfort  is  what  grows 
 you  as  a  man  if  you  stop
[04:37] self-improvement  if  you  stop  the  good 
 habits  if  you  stop  meditating  if  you 
 stop  going  to  the  gym  what  happens  you
[04:42] lose  those  gains  this  is  for  life  it 
 seems  to  us  that  sneaker  got  complacent 
 he  achieved  a  fantastic  level  of  success
[04:48] that  i  respect  so  much  but  then  at  some 
 point  in  the  last  one  or  two  years  i'm 
 not  sure  exactly  when  he  just  took  his
[04:54] foot  off  the  gas  pedal  he  stopped 
 improving  himself  and  he  started 
 indulging  in  pleasures  instead  of
[04:59] staying  purposeful  what  i  see  from  this 
 sad  image  is  a  young  man  who  has  no 
 purpose  and  we  all  know  how  sad  of  a
[05:05] life  that  is  and  now  my  message  directly 
 to  sneakers  nico  i  know  that  you're 
 watching  this  video  i  know  that  you  love
[05:10] youtube  you've  probably  been  reacting 
 live  to  this  video  acting  like  a  proper 
 jeffrey  getting  like  insulting  getting 
 loud  and  swearing  and  saying  oh  this  is
[05:16] gay  like  oh  i'm  making  fun  of  me  like  oh 
 my  god  he's  wearing  gold  or  some  [ __ ]  i 
 know  that  you're  probably  doing  that 
 right  now  i  just  want  to  remind  you  that
[05:22] you  are  an  influencer  you  know  that 
 quote  that  we  are  the  average  of  the 
 five  people  we  spend  time  with  i  think
[05:27] the  updated  version  of  that  quote  is 
 that  we  are  the  average  of  the  content 
 that  we  consume  people  are  becoming  more
[05:33] like  you  when  they  watch  your  content  i 
 think  you  should  take  the  responsibility 
 to  just  keep  in  mind  to  always
[05:38] try  to  be  a  positive  influence  on  the 
 lives  of  your  viewers  i  urge  you  to  have
[05:43] humility  to  be  able  to  see  your 
 weaknesses  and  improve  on  them  instead 
 of  staying  complacent  to  improve  your
[05:48] life's  nico  it  starts  with  humility 
 humility  is  the  skill  of  defying  your
[05:53] ego  the  awareness  of  knowing  that  you 
 have  things  to  improve  on  i  highly 
 suggest  that  you  read  the  book  ego  is
[05:58] the  enemy  by  ryan  holiday  i  really  hope 
 that  you  reconsider  the  importance  of 
 self-improvement  i  deeply  deeply  care
[06:04] about  young  men  getting  onto  this 
 pathway  getting  onto  this  journey 
 joining  our  community  and  improving 
 themselves  especially  their  mental
[06:10] health  i  don't  want  to  keep  seeing  you 
 or  anyone  else  go  down  that  dark  path  of 
 purposelessness  you  and  your  boys  are
[06:16] always  welcome  in  my  movements  and  boys 
 do  you  know  who's  part  of  our  movement 
 this  is  where  it gets  interesting
[06:21] forgive  me  for  sounding  insulting  but 
 the  upgraded  version  of  synecos  nico  2.0
[06:26] his  brother  vince  nico's  brother  is  like 
 the  og  he  lifts  heavy  weights  he's  got  a 
 very  impressive  physique  he's  a
[06:31] successful  entrepreneur  he  stars  in 
 plays  and  he's  steered  clear  from  drugs 
 and  he  really  seems  to  live  a  life  of
[06:37] like  integrity  and  values  and  virtue 
 that's  a  young  man  that  we  respect  me 
 and  sneaker's  brother  vince  really  get
[06:42] on  and  vince  actually  wrote  a  class 
 project  about  me  and  my  journey  on  the 
 video  where  sneaker  was  criticizing
[06:48] self-improvement  in  our  movements  he 
 even  mentioned  that  his  brother  was  like 
 on  all  of  the  self-improvement  habits
[06:53] this  is  vincent  vincent  be  [ __ ] 
 stretching  the  [ __ ]  off  in  the  [ __ ] 
 store  bro  what  an  interesting  sight  is
[06:59] to  see  the  younger  brother  who  is  the 
 adonis  and  the  older  brother  who's  the 
 jeffrey  sniko  you  used  to  be  one  of  my
[07:05] all-time  favorite  youtubers  i  remember 
 this  one  period  where  i  literally  went 
 through  your  channel  and  watched  all  of
[07:11] your  old  videos  but  recently  i  found 
 myself  just  not  clicking  on  your  content 
 again  just  thinking  oh  more  drama  more
[07:16] obnoxiousness  and  so  i  think  it's  time 
 for  me  to  unsubscribe  and  use  the  time 
 that  i  was  spending  watching  your  videos
[07:22] on  my  own  self-improvement  journey  i 
 wish  you  the  best  sneaker  if  you're 
 watching  this  video  and  you  don't  know 
 who  i  am  or  the  movement  that  i'm
[07:28] leading  here  my  name  is  hamza  i  help 
 young  men  go  through  the  geoffrey  to 
 adonis  transformation  through
[07:33] self-improvements  we  are  literally  a 
 cult  of  young  men  who  refuse  to  continue
[07:38] living  like  the  weak  comfortable  lives 
 that  we've  had  we  don't  want  to  be 
 feminine  anymore  we  want  to  be  more 
 masculine  we're  done  watching  porn  and
[07:43] playing  video  games  and  taking  drugs  we 
 want  to  go  out  there  and  achieve 
 something  that  gives  us  confidence  if
[07:48] that  interests  you  you  can  subscribe  to 
 our  channel  if  you  want  to  you'll 
 probably  like  this  video  right  here  do
[07:53] the  hard  work  especially  when  you  don't 
 feel  like  it
