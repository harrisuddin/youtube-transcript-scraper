[00:00] i'm  gonna  start  this  video  by  giving  the 
 viewer  that  means  you  dumbass  some 
 motivation  so  listen  up  it's  actually
[00:07] better  to  be  somewhat  unattractive 
 naturally  to  experience  ugly  duckling
[00:12] syndrome  because  you  enjoy  the  trials 
 and  tribulations  of  being  unattractive 
 and  that  coupled  with  self-improvement
[00:19] is  the  best  of  both  worlds  you'll 
 improve  your  physical  attractiveness 
 with  ways  that  you'll  learn  by  the  end
[00:24] of  this  video  and  by  experiencing  both 
 sides  to  life  you  become  more  grateful
[00:29] and  appreciative  for  your  increased 
 attractiveness  with  that  being  said  let 
 me  briefly  tell  you  my  story  and  then
[00:35] we'll  move  on  to  the  practical  guide 
 which  will  improve  your  physical 
 attractiveness  and  seriously  this  is
[00:40] very  important  when  i  was  growing  up 
 people  used  to  say  that  i  was  cute  but  i
[00:45] always  thought  i  was  pretty  ugly  i  was 
 short  i  had  these  adorable  chubby  cheeks 
 skinny  fat  you  know  the  deal  however  i
[00:52] always  had  a  great  positive  mindset 
 that's  what  you're  gonna  learn  in  this 
 video  i  knew  that  all  it  would  take  to
[00:58] look  better  was  effort  so  after  high 
 school  i  started  putting  some  effort 
 into  my  looks  by  lifting  weights  doing
[01:04] some  bits  of  optimization  to  my  hair  and 
 my  skin  and  i'm  gonna  be  honest  almost
[01:09] straight  away  people  started  treating  me 
 better  it  was  like  i  went  from  being 
 invisible  to  most  people  to  suddenly
[01:15] getting  a  lot  more  attention  and  quite 
 positive  attention  this  made  all  of  life
[01:21] better  because  think  for  a  second  about 
 the  positive  feedback  loop  of  improving
[01:26] your  attractiveness  people  treat  you 
 better  when  you  get  treated  better  by 
 other  people  you  feel  more  confident
[01:32] more  happy  more  positive  this  makes  your 
 life  better  and  serves  as  a  loop  because 
 confident  happy  people  are  even  more
[01:39] attractive  you're  more  likely  to  make 
 friends  get  invited  to  social 
 experiences  you're  more  likely  to  get
[01:44] more  tips  in  your  job  get  more 
 opportunities  let  me  remind  you  that 
 this  is  not  the  result  of  being
[01:50] attractive  the  specific  word  that  we're 
 using  is  improving  attractiveness  any
[01:56] improvements  to  your  physical 
 attractiveness  will  improve  the  rest  of 
 your  life  and  the  overwhelming  majority
[02:03] of  us  can  make  some  simple  improvements 
 to  our  physical  attractiveness  and  we 
 could  start  today  the  mentality  of  this
[02:09] is  that  there's  lots  of  things  about  our 
 looks  that  we  can't  change  you  can't 
 change  any  physical  deformities  that
[02:15] make  you  feel  insecure  you  can't  change 
 your  height  you  can't  change  your  race
[02:20] you  can't  change  lots  of  things  about 
 you  but  that's  okay  because  there  are 
 some  things  that  we  can  just  devote  our
[02:25] focus  to  which  we  can  make  improvements 
 in  and  for  men  the  biggest  most
[02:30] important  thing  is  our  body  and  i'm  not 
 talking  about  dieting  and  doing  cardio
[02:36] to  get  slim  i'm  talking  about  resistance 
 training  to  build  a  muscular  aesthetic
[02:41] body  your  body  is  a  symbol  a  sign  of  how 
 much  work  you've  put  into  your 
 self-improvement  how  much  intention
[02:47] you've  put  into  pushing  past  the  burn 
 and  how  much  you  have  invested  into  a 
 healthy  diet  your  body  is  the  physical
[02:55] indicator  of  the  amount  of  delayed 
 gratification  you  have  invested  in  the 
 entire  world  can  see  that
[03:01] that's  powerful  quick  side  note  this  is 
 also  why  i  don't  trust  any
[03:06] self-improvement  youtubers  unless  they 
 are  fit  and  muscular  if  they  haven't 
 trained  their  body  they're  missing  a
[03:11] vital  pillar  of  self-improvement  they're 
 speaking  about  self-improvement  for  the 
 sake  of  growing  a  self-improvement
[03:17] youtube  channel  not  for  the  sake  of 
 providing  real  authentic  value  to  the
[03:22] audience  building  muscle  and  improving 
 your  body  also  makes  your  face  look  more 
 attractive  do  not  believe  that  in  cell
[03:29] black  pill  that  you  see  online 
 getting  muscular  will  undoubtedly 
 improve  your  face  too  your  face  looks
[03:35] more  masculine  and  strong  when  you've 
 got  a  muscular  body  and 
 my  theory  is  that  the  positive  feedback
[03:41] loop  of  increased  attractiveness  also 
 improves  your  testosterone  because  it 
 makes  sense  increased  attractiveness
[03:46] would  probably  mean  that  you'd  get  more 
 girlfriends  and  dates  in  your  life  that 
 would  increase  your  testosterone  and
[03:51] increase  testosterone  would  improve  your 
 face  as  well 
 train  hard  with  different  styles  of
[03:56] exercise  i  like  weightlifting  and  using 
 the  gymnastic  rings  if  you've  been
[04:01] watching  the  clips  of  the  gymnastic 
 rings  and  thinking  that  that  looks  like 
 a  cool  style  of  training  they  seriously
[04:06] are  i've  never  been  this  strong  or 
 jacked  before  and  i  think  that's  due  to 
 the  gymnastic  rings  training  that  i've
[04:12] been  doing  seriously  fun  style  of 
 training  a  card  will  pop  up  on  screen 
 right  now  click  on  it  to  watch  a  20
[04:18] minute  video  on  the  gymnastic  rings  diet 
 is  extremely  important  in  physical
[04:23] attractiveness  we  used  to  say  that  you 
 are  what  you  eat  and  that  was  the 
 correct  sentence  the  fitness  industry  is
[04:30] now  essentially  lying  to  you  and  saying 
 it  doesn't  matter  what  you  eat  it  only 
 matters  how  much  you  eat  that  isn't
[04:35] exactly  true  i  would  have  to  go  into  so 
 much  more  detail  but  if  you  can  just 
 blindly  trust  me
[04:41] just 
 stick  to  the  unprocessed  low  sugar  high 
 fiber  high  fat  foods  it's  those  foods
[04:48] that  will  fill  you  up  keep  you  so 
 satiated  keep  you  full  of  energy  and 
 feeling  strong  and  that  in  turn  will
[04:54] lead  to  better  performance  in  the  gym 
 which  will  lead  to  better  muscle  and 
 physical  attractiveness  you  of  course
[05:00] can  lose  fat  by  going  in  a  calorie 
 deficit  by  whatever  you  eat  but  don't 
 trust  the  fitness  industry  that  is  one
[05:05] of  the  worst  ways  to  lose  fat  there's  no 
 such  thing  as  unhealthy  food
[05:10] i  feel  healthier  than  i've  ever  been 
 before  and  i  literally  just  had  like  a 
 binge  yesterday  and  i  had  the  binge  the
[05:16] night  before  and  the  night  before 
 i  went  to  mcdonald's  three  days  in  a  row
[05:21] for  some  reason  taking  pride  in  your 
 appearance  and  wanting  to  improve  it  is 
 seen  as  vain  especially  in  our
[05:27] generation  if  that's  the  case  then  i 
 don't  care  i  am  vain  and  i  suggest
[05:32] anyone  watching  this  to  be  vain  because 
 the  benefit  of  being  a  vain  person  who 
 takes  pride  in  their  appearance  is  far
[05:38] better  than  someone  who  doesn't  care 
 about  how  they  look  take  a  look  at 
 yourself  right  now  and  be  honest
[05:44] what  cannot  be  changed  chances  are 
 you're  over  thinking  about  things  that 
 you  can't  change  your  skin  color  your
[05:50] height  how  something  about  you  looks  if 
 you  can't  change  it  it  isn't  even  worth
[05:55] having  the  thought  in  your  head  focus  on 
 what  you  can  change  what  can  you  make
[06:00] improvements  on  as  a  guy  your  body  is 
 the  number  one  do  not  underestimate  how 
 important  a  muscular  physique  is  in
[06:07] terms  of  physical  attractiveness  do  not 
 believe  the  the  media  and  the
[06:12] that  you  know  women  were  saying  that 
 they  prefer  dad  birds  it's  not  true  the 
 girls  who  say  that  they  prefer  dad  bods
[06:18] are  the  ones  who 
 like  the  muscular  bodies  the  most  from 
 my  experience  when  you  build  up  some
[06:24] muscle  you'll  find  the  same  thing  that 
 those  are  the  girls  who  stare  at  your 
 muscles  the  most  and  look  with
[06:30] lust
