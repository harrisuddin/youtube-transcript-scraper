[00:00] I  didn't  hit  puberty  till  I  was  like  16 
 17  years  old  like  I  was  literally  five
[00:07] foot  four  till  I  was  17  years  old 
 and  the  the  guys  that  I  grew  up  with
[00:13] like  the  video  Gamers  I  started  to  see 
 them  one  by  one  in  our  teenage  years  14
[00:18] 15  16. 
 start  attracting  girls  and  getting  into 
 relationships  and  the  concept  of  that
[00:24] like  when  I  was  in  high  school  the 
 feeling  of  that  just  made  me  feel 
 awkward  and  I  couldn't  tell  why
[00:30] and  it  it  was  because  I  had  this  belief 
 that  like  I  wasn't  involved  I  wasn't
[00:35] invited  to  the  dating  scene  like  it  just 
 felt  awkward  to  me  I  come  from  a  brown 
 Muslim  family  and  so  that  there  was
[00:42] always  like 
 you  know  a  weird  feeling  with  that  can  I 
 even  get  a  girlfriend  one  time  I  asked 
 my  mom  like  I  literally  said  to  her  like
[00:47] I  want  to  get  a  girlfriend  and  she 
 looked  at  me  weird  and  she's  like  no  you 
 finish  your  studies  first  lit  that's  the
[00:52] truth 
 and  another  time  I  remember  most  of  it 
 like  13  14  years  old  no  problem  yeah  14
[00:58] years  old  and  my  best  friend  was  around 
 my  house  we  were  literally  downstairs 
 and  he  had  been  dating  recently  he  was
[01:04] speaking  about  some  girl  and  he  kind  of 
 like  went  quiet 
 and  he  he  like  almost  in  like  a  shy  way
[01:09] he  asked  me  something  that  he  thought 
 was  really  embarrassing  and  but  he 
 wasn't  doing  it  to  you  know  feel  bad
[01:14] about  me  he  was  just  kind  of  like  asking 
 me  as  a  friend  he  went  like  don't  you 
 want  a  girlfriend  like  don't  you  want  to
[01:20] experience  this  and  I  just  I  literally 
 just  got  like  almost  shocked  like  just 
 like  just  stuck  I  didn't  know  what  to
[01:26] say 
 I  felt  totally  left  out
[01:31] you  know  people  in  my  school 
 a  lot  like  some  people  were  having  sex 
 at  age  13  and  14  and  I  don't  think
[01:37] that's  right 
 quite  a  lot  of  the  people  I  grew  up with 
 at  age  15  and  16  were  drinking  alcohol
[01:44] going  to  parties  and  literally  having 
 sex  like  in  those  parties  like  girls 
 from  from  this  class  were  going  to  this
[01:50] party  with  a  bunch  of  guys  and  like  they 
 were  drinking  and  you  know  like  being 
 flirtatious  and  stuff  and  then  literally
[01:55] going  to  the  toilet  stuff  [ __ ] 
 I  didn't  actually  realize  that  people
[02:00] were  having  sex  till  I  was  about  just 
 under  18  years  old  I  genuinely  didn't 
 think  anyone  else  was
[02:07] I  felt  like  I  was  missing  out  on  this 
 and  more  than  that  it's  like  I  did  have
[02:12] this  COPE  in  my  mind  which  you  might  do 
 which  was 
 what  if  in  some  ways  it  could  be
[02:17] beneficial  to  experience  this 
 because  if  I  keep  waiting  like  my  mom
[02:24] says  if  I  keep  waiting  to  pass  my 
 studies 
 keep  waiting  to  develop  myself
[02:30] I  won't  have  like  any  experience  with 
 women 
 and  so
[02:35] when  it  comes  to  needing  that  experience 
 maybe  with  the  the  other  girl  I 
 eventually  really  want  to  get  then  I'll
[02:41] struggle  with  her  these  were  the 
 thoughts  I  was  getting  when  I  was  17 
 years  old
[02:46] and  then  eventually  things  did  change 
 I'm  18  years  old  I'm  about  to  go  to 
 university  I've  been  going  to  the  gym
[02:52] I'm  hyping  up  I'm  actually  looking  kind 
 of  good  I'm  looking  confident  I'm 
 literally  hopping  on  Tinder  now  I'm
[02:57] getting  some  matches  on  Tinder  finally 
 because  I  upload  the  shirtless  picture 
 now  is  going  to  be  the  time  that  I'm 
 gonna  get  some  practice  with  women  I'm
[03:03] gonna  get  some  experience  with  women 
 this  is  going  to  be  really  productive 
 this  is  going  to  be  really  good  for  me
[03:11] I  went  to  University  and  it  just  so 
 happened  that  I  ended  up  getting  into  my 
 first  ever  real  relationship  with  a  girl
[03:17] that  I  truly  loved  things  didn't  work 
 out  with  her  and  I  explained  the  full 
 story  with  her  in  the  previous  video
[03:23] that  I  just  did  on  this  channel 
 did  the  breakup  with  her  which  which  was 
 totally  like  heartbreaking  and
[03:30] depressing 
 after  about  a  month  of  spending 
 literally  24  7  in  my  student  Hall's  room
[03:37] and  just  playing  Minecraft  and  RuneScape 
 after  about  a  month  of  feeling  just
[03:43] sorry  for  myself 
 I  started  to  be  more  social  make  more 
 friends  go  out  to  mob  parties  and
[03:49] nightclubs  and  actually  for  the  first 
 time  ever  start  hooking  up  with  girls 
 and  getting  the  experience  with  girls
[03:54] that  I  wanted  for  so  long  and  that  you 
 probably  want  to 
 this  isn't  like  another  like  red  pill
[03:59] alpha  male  video  where  the  guy's  gonna 
 say  like  yeah  yeah  I  I  get  with  loads  of 
 supermodels  man  I'm  so  amazing  like  the
[04:05] girls  I  was  like  I  slept  with  a  lot  of 
 girls  during  this  time  and  I  don't  say 
 that  to  both  or  anything  I'm  just
[04:10] telling  you  the  truth  and  the  girls  that 
 I  was  sleeping  with  were  absolutely  not 
 like  high  quality  of  course  not  they 
 weren't  like  very  beautiful  girls
[04:18] naturally  when  you  want  to  practice  with 
 women
[04:23] the  reason  why  we're  saying  practice  the 
 reason  why  you  may  have  thought  this  I 
 need  to  practice  I  need  to  get 
 experience  the  reason  why  is  okay  get
[04:28] experience  for  what 
 so  that  you  can  get  more  girls  okay  for
[04:33] what  what's  the  experience  for 
 oh  for  the  woman  that  I  eventually  have
[04:38] children  with  right  so  the  experience  or 
 the  practice  that  we  want  right  now  is 
 for  us  to  be  good  enough  to  get  or  even
[04:44] to  attract  or  whatever  to 
 for  the  the  future  wife  who  we're  gonna 
 have  children  with
[04:50] I  want  to  break  down  this  line  of 
 thinking  with  you  because  three  guys 
 literally  asked  me  this  question 
 yesterday  on  a  group  call  and  one  by  one
[04:56] when  they  asked  that  it  was  almost  like 
 a  funny  joke  between  the  guys  who  had 
 been  on  the  group  call  for  a  while 
 because  we  were  almost  laughing  of  how
[05:01] many  guys  we're  asking  this  exact  same 
 question 
 and  chances  are  if  you're  watching  this
[05:06] and  this  titles  intrude  you  you're  a 
 younger  man  you've  been  watching  my 
 videos  takes  videos  emans  videos  maybe
[05:12] first  month's  videos  and  first  man  it's 
 a  friend  of  mine  who's  been  pushing  this 
 message  recently  that  guys  should  not
[05:18] actually  pursue  building  getting 
 experience  with  girls  guys  should  not 
 pursue  like  girls  or  dating  at  all  when
[05:23] they're  young  and  instead  Focus 
 relentlessly  on  improving  yourself  and 
 growing  and  his  idea  has  been  criticized
[05:29] by  many  people  who  think  they  should 
 live  more  of  a  balanced  lifestyle  and 
 who  think  that  you  should  integrate 
 women  into  your  life  as  you  grow  up  and
[05:35] the  thing  is 
 I  didn't  do  what  first  man  said
[05:43] I  got  the  experience  I  got  the  practice 
 that  you  might  have  wanted
[05:48] and  I'm  here  to  tell  you  today  that  it 
 it  will  be  will  not  might  it  will  be  the
[05:53] biggest  mistake  one  of  the  biggest 
 mistakes  you  make  in  your  life 
 no  one  has  ever  pointed  these  arguments
[05:59] out  not  even  first  man  has  has  pointed  a 
 few  of  the  arguments  that  I'm  going  to 
 say  to  you  and  I  think  you're  gonna  find
[06:04] this  like  deeply  deeply  interesting 
 so  ask  you  just  just  to  listen  to  some
[06:09] of  the  points  I've  got  with  an  open  mind 
 and  just  to  kind  of  know  that  like
[06:14] I'm  on  the  other  side  of  this  I'm  not 
 some  some  strict  parents  or  Imam  or  past
[06:19] their  respect  to  them  but  I'm  not  like 
 someone  who  has  no  experience  of  this 
 just  kind  of  telling  you  that  all  this
[06:24] stuff's  bad  I  had  the  same  mindset  as 
 you  of  wanting  to  get  experience  with 
 girls  and  I  did  it
[06:31] and  so  I'm  on  this  like  where  you  want 
 to  be  technically  right
[06:36] and  I  don't  think  it's  a  good  idea  for 
 you  to  do  this  now  someone  might  say  to 
 this  like  Albert  Hamza  you  did  it  so
[06:41] like  how  can  you  tell  us  not  to  but  I 
 see  this  comment  quite  a  lot  when  I  talk 
 about  like  oh  yeah  like  I  I  was  a
[06:46] degenerate  I  slept  around  with  girls  and 
 stuff  so  you  shouldn't  and  it's  always 
 like  a  guy  who  gets  a  little  bit
[06:51] triggered  by  that  and  says  like  oh  but 
 you  got  to  so  how  can  you  tell  us  not  to 
 that's  not  fair  but 
 hopefully  you  understand  like  this  is
[06:57] the  nature  of  like  passing  our  wisdom 
 onto  each  other  it's  like  I  have  to  make 
 the  mistake  to  eventually  tell  you
[07:06] the  first  reason  why  you  don't  need 
 experience  with  women 
 and  what  pretty  much  everyone  who  gives
[07:12] this  advice  online  of  first  man  is  is 
 this  YouTuber  who  says  this  there's  a 
 bunch  more  roll  automatic  you  know  all
[07:17] these  guys  who  kind  of  say  that  okay 
 build  yourself  up  as  a  man  first  and 
 maybe  don't  think  about  girls  so  much
[07:22] when  you're  younger  and  the  first  and 
 biggest  reason  why  is  so  that  you  can 
 focus  on  your  own  growth  your  own 
 self-improvement  and  your  own  success
[07:29] this  is  something  that  you've  already 
 known  and  you've  already  thought  yeah 
 like  in  our  focus  more  without  a  girl
[07:34] but  maybe  you've  never  really 
 experienced  what  it's  like 
 totally
[07:39] one  being  deep  in  like  the  part  not  just 
 Party  Zone  but  like  you  know  with  with
[07:44] getting  girls  dating  and  literally 
 having  sex  with  girls  or  having  sex  with 
 multiple  girls  a  week
[07:50] but  two  also  maybe  you  haven't 
 experienced  the  other  side  of  like  total 
 monk  mode  where  you  actually  don't  want
[07:55] to  get  girls  so  there's  two  big 
 different  sides  and  I've  experienced 
 both  so  I'll  tell  you  right  now
[08:01] if  this  is  so  interesting  right  no  one 
 has  said  this  before  but  like  I  promise
[08:06] you  this  is  the  case  I  am  very  like 
 observant  of  my  brain  and  I'm  very  much 
 into  self-improvement  and  I'm  very  like
[08:11] aware  of  things  right  you  might  have 
 known  like  I'm  quite  like  aware  of 
 myself
[08:16] I  do  have  a  lot  of  journaling  and 
 meditation  so  this  is  going  to  be  really 
 interesting  I  promise  you  right  now
[08:22] let's  say  You're  not  meeting  girls 
 you're  not  meeting  anyone  dating  anyone 
 let's  say  you're  not  having  sex  with  any
[08:28] girls  but  let's  just  say  you  are  texting 
 texting  just  one  girl  that  you  like
[08:33] you're  texting  just  one  girl  you're  not 
 even  going  on  phone  calls  whether  you're 
 not  even  meeting  her  in  person  you're
[08:39] just  texting  one  girl  that  you  like  I 
 promise  you  that  will  sap  about  40  of
[08:46] your  brain  power 
 literally  just  opening  up  like  the  door
[08:51] of  dating  of  like  women  a  tiny  Creek 
 it's  like  it  has  this  huge  impact  on  how
[08:58] much  like  brain  power  you  lose  which  you 
 could  put  into  growing  yourself  a  huge 
 like  a  huge  level
[09:04] it's  absolutely  crazy  that  even  a  small 
 amount  of  like  being  open  to  dating  a 
 small  amount  of  for  example  just  looking
[09:10] at  girls  on  Instagram  maybe  just  maybe 
 just  having  a  Tinder  account  and  your 
 own  online  dating  accounts  and  saying  oh
[09:15] no  but  this  is  like  an  efficient  way  to 
 date  you  know  I'd  have  to  go  on  a  date 
 and  I  can  just  quickly  write  type  and 
 stuff  I  promise  you  you're  losing  so
[09:20] much  of  your  brain  power  because  you  if 
 you  want  to  know  like  how  to  get 
 successful  you  want  me  to  tell  you 
 something  right  now  that  this  piece  of
[09:26] advice  that  I  don't  hear  often  the  route 
 to  success  is  to  pick  one  maybe  two  big
[09:31] goals  and  to  dedicate  as  many  thoughts 
 as  possible  to  that  goal  when  you're
[09:36] having  a  [ __ ]  you  should  be  thinking 
 about  your  goals  when  you're  having  a 
 shower  you  should  be  thinking  about  your
[09:41] goals  when  you're  going  to  bed  you 
 should  be  thinking  about  your  goals  if 
 you  want  to  become  a  successful  man  this 
 is  what  it  takes  and  when  you  say  that
[09:48] oh  but  it's  just  half  an  hour  a  day  for 
 me  to  check  Tinder  or  you  know  just 
 three  hours  a  week  for  it  for  for  dates
[09:53] it's  not  about  the  time  where  we 
 physically  do  the  thing  it's  it's  that
[09:58] it  saps  thousands  of  thoughts  a  week 
 away  and  this  is  like  this  is  undeniable
[10:04] this  is  non-negotiable  we  as  men  know 
 this 
 and  if  you  have  an  experienced  the  total
[10:09] Bliss  of  like  full  on  declaring  to 
 yourself  like  I  am  in  a  period  just  the 
 period  not  for  life  just  a  period  where
[10:16] I'm  not  even  open  to  girls 
 and  you  close  that  door  fully
[10:21] you  will  be  so  surprised  of  how  much  of 
 your  brain  power  comes  back  it  will  not 
 be  like  what  you  thought  was  the
[10:28] equivalent  of  how  much  you  were  putting 
 into  dating  it  will  not  be  that  it's 
 like  this  weird  like  outsized  return
[10:33] back  to  your  brain  power  I  know  this  is 
 like  a  weird  thing  to  say
[10:39] the  benefit  of  this  is  that  you  will 
 excel  and  you  will  push  forward  in  your
[10:45] goals  your  business  your  developments 
 even  improving  your  smv  your  sexual 
 market  value  you're  literally  like  you 
 know  be  able  to  focus  more  on  becoming
[10:52] more  attractive  later  it's  the  delayed 
 gratification  it's  setting  yourself 
 future  self  up  and  this  is  like  the
[10:57] fundamental  principles  of 
 self-improvement  this  is  the  whole  point 
 of  self-improvement  we  we  delay  a  bigger
[11:02] reward  for  our  future  selves  instead  of 
 our  current  selves  we  take  the  second 
 marshmallow  15  minutes  from  now  rather
[11:08] than  just  indulging  in  the  first  one  we 
 don't  cash  out  our  current  life  in  smv 
 right  now  for  the  girls  that  we  can  get
[11:14] right  now  and  instead  we  just 
 relentlessly  focus  on  the  better  girls 
 that  we  could  get  in  the  future  now  you
[11:20] might  say  okay  sweet  you  could  you  know 
 gain  some  attractiveness  and  stuff  but 
 you'd  have  no  experience  with  girls  and
[11:25] so  when  you  do  finally  attract  some 
 girls  you  know  okay  maybe  you've  offer 
 six  pack  a  year  from  now  but  what  if
[11:30] you're  like  really  awkward  with  girls 
 what  if  you're  not  like  good  with  them 
 what  if  you  don't  know  how  to  navigate 
 dating  and  sleeping  with  girls  when
[11:36] you're  eventually  improve  yourself  and 
 maybe  you  meet  like  a  really  good  well 
 but  you've  never  had  practice  before
[11:43] this  is  where  it  gets  very  interesting 
 because  I  have  not  seen  this  argument 
 online  but  I'm  going  to  tell  you  right 
 now
[11:49] practicing  and  getting  experience  with 
 girls
[11:54] fundamentally  means  that  those  skills 
 are  going  to  be  off  lower  quality
[11:59] you  can  agree  with  that  right  practice 
 saying  that  we  want  to  just  practice 
 with  some  girls  right  now
[12:04] literally  means  that  these  girls  are 
 going  to  be  lower  quality  and  easier  to 
 get  than  our  actual  future  wife  right  if
[12:10] you  could  meet  the  10  out  of  10  like 
 Dream  Woman  for  you  right  no  girl's 
 perfect  but  if  you  can  meet  literally 
 like  imagine  like  a  full-on  stunning  10
[12:16] out  of  10  and  she  likes  you  too  right 
 you  will  just  get  with  her  and  that 
 would  probably  be  your  future  wife  right
[12:21] if  everything  else  worked  out  we  can't 
 get  her  right  now 
 but  we  can  get  some  random  girl  on
[12:26] Tinder  who  we  know  is  not  our  future 
 wife  but  we  can  get  some  practice
[12:32] so  we  have  to  like  confirm  this  the 
 practice  and  the  experience  that  we  can
[12:37] get  right  now  is  specifically  with  lower 
 quality  and  unfortunately
[12:43] degenerates  women  it's  with  women  that 
 we're  going  to  meet  in  easier  places
[12:48] like  online  dates  in  Tinder  and 
 nightclubs  and  you  know  some  other 
 places  find  some  gym  and  stuff  but  when
[12:54] you  get  into  this  thing  of  like  okay  I 
 need  some  experience  most  likely  I'll  go 
 through  online  dating  and  you'll
[12:59] automatically  meet  lower  quality  women 
 who  are  [ __ ]  a  bunch  of  guys  using  the
[13:04] same  like  app  just  before  you 
 and  then
[13:11] this  is  where  it  gets  so  interesting 
 where  my  heart  breaks  knowing  that  I've
[13:16] done  this  and  where  I  want  to  like  stop 
 you  from  feeling  the  pain  that  I  have 
 you  learn
[13:22] and  you  practice  the  wrong  things 
 you  see  two  get  experience  with  the
[13:29] girls  who  are  quite  easy  to  get  the 
 girls  that  you  can  get  right  now  when 
 you're  quite  lower  quality  to  get
[13:35] experience  with  these  girls  on  Tinder  to 
 get  experience  with  these  random  girls 
 that  you  see  around  you  who  aren't  wife
[13:40] material  because  again  if  they  were 
 white  material  then  you  wouldn't 
 consider  it  as  experience  you're  just 
 think  oh  [ __ ]  I  I  met  like  an  awesome
[13:45] girl  already  I  might  seriously  get  in  a 
 relationship  with  her  so  these  low 
 quality  women  most  likely  the  general
[13:50] women  and  the  way  to  like  actually  be 
 good  with  these  girls  if  you've  never 
 heard  this  before  this  is  like  the
[13:55] greatest  tip  the  way  to  get  experience 
 with  these  girls  and  to  to  do  well  with 
 these  girls
[14:01] is  to  act  in  a  in  quite  a  like  in  a  way 
 for  you  in  a  way  that  you  wouldn't  act
[14:07] your  future  wife  you  see  to  attract  like 
 a  girl  on  Tinder  you  need  to  play  this 
 game  that  you  don't  care  about  how  you
[14:12] need  to  play  this  game  that  you  don't 
 give  a  [ __ ]  you  need  to  play  this  game 
 like  you're  some  like  Stone  Cold  Chad 
 this  like  alpha  male  personality  where
[14:18] you  don't  even  like  her 
 you're  not  going  to  tell  her  how  you 
 actually  feel  you're  not  going  to  tell
[14:23] her  about  your  goals  because  these  kinds 
 of  girls  like  you  think  oh  no  I  might  do 
 actually  but  bro  you  can  try  your
[14:29] authentic  way  with  these  dating  apps  and 
 stuff  but  eventually  you'll  realize  if 
 you  want  to  get  good  at  dating  apps  and
[14:34] Nightclub  game  and  a  night  game  and 
 everything  to  get  girls  right  now  and 
 you  want  to  hook  up  with  girls  right  now 
 bro  I  learned  this  stuff  the  way  to
[14:40] attract  those  kinds  of  girls  is  to  dumb 
 yourself  down  and  also  to  date  in  a  way
[14:45] that's  quite  toxic  to  date  in  a  way 
 where  you  act  like  you  don't  even  like 
 or  respect  her  today  in  a  way  where  you
[14:50] and  her  aunt  don't  even  feel  like  a  team
[14:55] to  make  these  kinds  of  women  more 
 attracted  to  you 
 you  literally  [ __ ]  them  and  then
[15:01] disappear  and  they'll  come  after  you 
 to  make  these  kinds  of  women  more
[15:06] attracted  to  you  you  literally  don't 
 reply  to  their  messages
[15:12] do  you  see  the  problem  that  we're 
 getting  at  here 
 the  experience  and  the  practice  that  we
[15:17] can  get  right  now  with  the  girls  that  we 
 can  get  right  now  that's  gonna  give  us 
 the  experience  of  dating  in  the  wrong
[15:25] way 
 because  when  you  try  to  eventually  use 
 what  you've  just  learned  on  your  future
[15:30] wife 
 she's  not  going  to  be  attracted  to  you
[15:35] so  what  is  the  practice  for  if  you're 
 not  going  to 
 actually  improve  the  level  that  you
[15:41] needed  to  begin  with  the  skill  that  you 
 needed  to  begin  with 
 let's  say  our  ultimate  ideal  goal  is
[15:48] beautiful  really  high  quality  wife 
 really  good  like  characteristics  traits 
 foundations  family  everything  right
[15:54] really  beautiful  girl  really  like  highly 
 like  sexual  and  everything  right  and 
 also  have  like  children  with  her  and
[15:59] everything  that's  like  the  ultimate  goal 
 right 
 that's  the  skill  we  can  say  this  is  like
[16:04] a  basketball  competition  okay  we  need  we 
 need  to  be  good  at  basketball  to  get
[16:09] this  right 
 what  we're  doing  right  now  by  saying  we 
 need  to  practice
[16:14] we're  practicing  football 
 we're  practicing  football  with  the  girls
[16:20] that  aren't  like  her  because  this 
 inherently  our  future  wife 
 we're  gonna  set  high  standards  with  men
[16:26] on  self-improvement  we're  ambitious  men 
 so  our  future  wife  she's  going  to  be 
 attracted  to  a  secure  warm
[16:33] guys  she's  gonna  be  attracted  to  a 
 secure  warm  loving  guy
[16:38] these  women  they're  attracted  to 
 avoidance  cold  guys
[16:45] I  will  say  that  again  these  women  that 
 you  can  get  right  now  you  will  get  more 
 girls  if  you  act  in  this  way  and  now  you
[16:51] might  get  excited  and  think  okay  I'll 
 just  act  in  that  way  and  I'll  get  some 
 girls  but  just  think  right  now  again  we
[16:56] are  ambitious  men  we  don't  just  think 
 one  step  in  the  future  you  want  to 
 become  successful  a  great  tip  is  okay
[17:01] think  50  000  steps  in  the  future 
 becoming  successful  is  as  simple  as
[17:07] literally  just  looking  further  into  the 
 future  than  all  of  the  mediocre  people 
 around  you  it's  literally  that  simple 
 it's  choosing  the  second  marshmallow  but
[17:13] you  have  to  wait  15  minutes  for  it  so 
 don't  just  think  okay  but  I  can  get  some 
 girls  right  now  so  I'll  just  do  that  but
[17:18] just  think  let's  think  about  the 
 consequences  of  our  actions  we  practice 
 with  these  girls  we  practice  being  cold 
 we  practice  not  replying  to  text  we
[17:24] practice 
 the  way  that  you  know  like  how  we  speak 
 to  them  and  how  we  make  them  feel  and  we
[17:29] and  you  realize  that  these  toxic  traits 
 are  very  good  at  attracting  a  certain
[17:34] kind  of  women  and  this  certain  kind  of 
 women  are  the  ones  that  dominate  social 
 media  Instagram  that  dominates  online
[17:39] dating  and  everything  and  so  we've  all 
 this  time  been  practicing  playing 
 football 
 hoping  that  it's  gonna  help  us
[17:45] eventually  for  the  basketball 
 competition  where  we  will  meet  our 
 future  wife
[17:50] you're  gonna  go  to  you're  going  to  go  to 
 this  competition  eventually  and  start 
 [ __ ]  dribbling  the  ball  kicking
[17:55] around  the  ball  and  stuff  and  everyone's 
 gonna  think  you're  stupid  now  this 
 sounds  like  a  silly  analogy  I'm  telling
[18:00] you  from  experience  I'm  from  pain 
 this  is  exactly  what  will  happen
[18:06] I  practiced  I  got  the  experience  that  I 
 thought  that  I  needed  and  I  got  good
[18:11] very  good  surprise  honestly  surprisingly 
 good 
 at  attracting  like  the  common  girl  that
[18:17] you  can  find  on  dating  apps  and  I  again 
 I'm  not  saying  this  to  both  because  this 
 is  not  something  boastful  this  is  like
[18:23] getting  these  girls  is  literally  like 
 level  one  okay  congratulations  you  can 
 literally  get  some  girl  that  has  already
[18:28] been  [ __ ]  this  week  and  you  can  [ __ ] 
 it  too  it's  like  this  is  level  one  bro 
 if  you  think  I'm  boasting  right  now
[18:34] this  is  level  one 
 level  10  is  like  attracting  the  [ __ ]
[18:39] beautiful  like  high  high  high  high 
 quality  and  she  wants  to  be  your  wife
[18:44] and  she  wants  to  give  you  children  and 
 she  is  so  like  securely  loving  and  warm 
 that  she  feels  like  a  wind  on  your  back
[18:50] she's  pushing  you  you're  literally 
 making  more  progress  to  your  goals  that 
 when  you  meet  her  the  kind  of  woman  that
[18:56] when  you  have  some  kind  of  setback  you 
 actually  can  tell  her  about  it  and  she 
 just  looks  at  you  with  almost  like  like
[19:02] a  smug  look  on  her  face  saying  like  well 
 I  know  you  can  do  it
[19:07] what  [ __ ]  girl  you  meet  from  social 
 media  or  from  online  dating  is  gonna  say 
 that  to  you  bro  what  [ __ ]  girl  you're
[19:12] gonna  meet  from  like  from  Tinder  and 
 you're  gonna  tell  her  about  your  goals 
 but  you  can  try  that  stuff  you  can  try
[19:17] telling  some  random  girl  about  your 
 goals  and  she  might  be  into  you  bro  I'm 
 telling  you  right  now  it's  not  right
[19:22] so  I  got  good  at  this  like  cold-hearted 
 degenerate  pickup  Game  Party  game
[19:28] nightclubs  and  stuff  right  I  got  good 
 right  I  got  the  experience  that  I  always 
 wanted  maybe  the  experience  that  you
[19:34] wanted 
 do  you  think  that  experience  now 
 translates  into  finding  a  good  woman
[19:44] if  the  test  is  to  attract 
 a  low  quality  woman  a  hoe
[19:50] who's  got  Daddy  oh  bro  I'm  sick  of  that 
 oh  oh  a  star  if  the  test  is  to  attract  a
[19:56] secure  woman 
 a  good  woman 
 I'm  telling  you  right  now
[20:03] I'm  being  honest  with  you  I  had  a  decent 
 amount  of  experience  I'm  telling  you 
 right  now  if  a  woman  of  wife  quality
[20:10] sees  me  and  interacts  with  me  she  would 
 not  be  attracted  to  me 
 because  I  have  built  like  the
[20:16] neuroplasticity  in  my  brain  I  have  built 
 like  the  like  the  the
[20:21] muscle  memory  of  acting  like  a  fuckboy 
 in  dating
[20:27] it  is  natural  for  me  to  act  in  a  way 
 that  attracts  a  certain  kind  of  woman
[20:32] but  would  fully  like  unattract  another 
 kind  of  woman  and  this  is  the  issue  of 
 going  down  like  the  degenerate  path  it
[20:39] it's  common  sense  when  someone  says  it 
 to  you  like  this  but  we  need  to  kind  of 
 declare  this  when  you  go  down  the
[20:44] degenerate  path 
 you  sacrifice  you  you  undermine
[20:49] the  future  most  important  relationship 
 of  your  life  you  don't  improve  it
[20:54] you  will  not  get  like  a  better  wife 
 by  Sleeping  with  a  bunch  of  like  low
[21:00] quality  girls
[21:06] and  this  isn't  even  bringing  out  a  huge 
 extra  issue
[21:11] maybe  some  people  can  be  different  to 
 this  but  when  you  practice  with  girls 
 and  you  practice  dating  and  eventually
[21:17] you  go  on  to  like  you  know  sleep  with 
 some  girls  that  you  know  aren't  your 
 wife  right  you  know  this  one  it  eats  you 
 up  in  life  alive  because  you  know  that
[21:23] okay  you're  kind  of  messing  around  but 
 you're  like  yeah  whatever  like  you  know 
 religions  like  false  anyway  I  don't 
 really  believe  in  God  anymore  or  I  don't
[21:29] even  want  to  get  married  like  people  say 
 not  to  get  married  anyway 
 I  totally  understand  that  by  the  way I
[21:35] totally  understand  like  I  we  wouldn't 
 marry  99.99  of  women  of  course  not  so
[21:40] it's  like  I  totally  understand  why  we 
 could  just  generalize  that  and  say  yeah 
 don't  get  married  the  idea  is  here  I
[21:45] don't  get  married  to  99  of  women 
 but  here  is  the  thing
[21:50] when  you  are  on  this  path  of  of 
 practicing  and  getting  experience  and 
 you're  doing  it  with  women  that  you  know
[21:55] aren't  your  future  wife  the  thing  is 
 there  will  be  a  time  when  you  can't 
 avoid  this  you  will  end  up  getting
[22:01] really  like  deep  feelings  for  some  of 
 these  girls  one  of  these  girls
[22:07] you  will  literally  fall  in  love  with  a 
 girl 
 who  was  supposed  to  be  practice
[22:14] this  is  one  of  the  most  painful 
 experiences  that  I've  ever  felt
[22:20] you  will  form 
 a  bond  that  is  so  primal
[22:26] a  bond  an  attachment  that  literally 
 regulates  your  nervous  system  like  these
[22:31] weird  things  inside  of  us  you've  you 
 release  these  these  dopamines  this 
 oxytocin  you  have  these  memories
[22:37] together 
 with  a  girl  that  you  genuinely  know 
 you're  not  actually  gonna  stay  with  you
[22:43] know  like  you  fall  in  love  with  a  girl 
 that  you  know  eventually  you're  gonna
[22:48] break  up  with 
 now  you  might  say  oh  but  I  wouldn't  fall 
 in  love  with  these  hoes  you  might  say
[22:53] that 
 but  the  truth  is  when  you're  having  sex 
 with  someone  consistently  and  you're
[22:58] having  like  good  times  and  stuff  it's 
 almost  like  it's  bound  to  happen  now
[23:03] with  certain  girls  it  just  won't  but  if 
 you  do  actually  practice  like  a  lot  it
[23:08] will  happen  maybe  one  in  ten  for  example 
 it  will  happen  where  you  like  you  end  up 
 bonding  and  actually  having  like  you 
 know  the  personality  fits  and  everything
[23:15] but  you  just  will  never  be  able  to  take 
 her  seriously  because  of  how  you  met  her 
 you  met  her  through  again  these  dating
[23:20] apps  and  everything  and  you  know  that 
 she  was  she  was  [ __ ]  a  guy  literally 
 the  day  before  you  so  you  know  like
[23:26] there's  no  coping  you  know  that  she's 
 not  your  future  wife  you  know  it 
 and  yet  you've  got  this  huge  attachment
[23:33] to  her  that  you  don't  want  to  get  rid  of 
 you've  leveled  up  that  you've  gotten  a 
 bit  more  seriously
[23:45] and  that's  not  what  you  wanted  you  don't 
 want  this  attachment  with  this  girl 
 let's  be  honest  right  now  now  okay  if
[23:50] you  want  to  practice  you  want  to 
 practice  so  why  don't  you  fall  in  love 
 with  a  hoe 
 so  it  was  never  about  practice  was  it  we
[23:55] did  that's  not  the  situation  you  wanted 
 to  be  and  you  know  that  right  you're  a 
 small  enough  guy  you  do  not  want  to  be
[24:00] in  a  situation  where  you're  genuinely  in 
 love  with  a  girl  who  is  like  this  right
[24:05] and  this  is  no  disrespect  to  those  girls 
 or  anything  but  it's  just  one  one  thing 
 we  have  to  acknowledge  is  like  this  is
[24:10] your  responsibility  and  accountability 
 right  if  you're  in  love  with  the  whole 
 chances  are  you're  the  hoe  as  well  bro
[24:15] that  being  said 
 Maybe
[24:21] maybe  just  maybe  we  we  be  honest  with 
 ourselves  and  say  you  know  what
[24:26] seeking  practices  cope 
 saying  they  are  but  I  need  experience 
 with  women  maybe  that's  just  cope  maybe
[24:33] it's  just  cope  bro  maybe  it's  just  not 
 maybe  it's  not  experience  because  again 
 experience  with  something  means  that
[24:38] eventually  you're  gonna  use  that 
 experience  with  something  else  in  the 
 future  and  so  we've  just  acknowledged
[24:43] and  hopefully  you can  believe  this 
 experience  with  the  girls  that  you  can 
 get  right  now  will  not  help  you  with
[24:48] your  future  wife  and  you  might  think  oh 
 well  experience  with  these  girls  right 
 now  will  help  me  get  more  experience  so 
 I  can  get  more  of  these  girls  and  you'll
[24:54] just  literally  dig  deeper  in  the  in  the 
 the  depth  of  the  degeneracy  and  we  know
[24:59] that's  not  good  for  us  we  know  it  okay 
 you've  seen  all  those  like  rejected 
 generacy  videos  and  stuff  bro  it's  like
[25:04] I  know  that's  a  meme  and  stuff  but  it  is 
 so  true  that  going  down  this  pathway  of 
 degeneracy  of  like  casual  sex  and  stuff
[25:10] it's  not  good  for  you  you  know  this  and 
 you  don't  need  like  a  vice  you  don't 
 need  it
[25:15] because  why  the  idea  I'm  not  saying  is 
 that  like  you  know  I'll  just  be  a  monk
[25:20] forever  and  ever  have  sex  never  have 
 women  in  your  life  the  idea  is 
 wait  for  the  second  marshmallow
[25:27] because  the  better  you  can  navigate  your 
 dating  life 
 the  better  quality  your  future  wife  is
[25:33] gonna  be 
 the  single  most  important  decision 
 you'll  ever  make  is  of  what  woman  to 
 have  children  with  is  it's  just  a  fact
[25:40] and  so  if  you  mess  this  up 
 and  you  waste  a  bunch  of  your  your  brain
[25:45] power  your  ability  to  develop  yourself 
 and  to  grow  and  you  know  to  become 
 successful  and  build  wealth  the  things
[25:50] that  would  attract  a  really  high  quality 
 woman  as  well  as  you  know  building  the 
 character  that  comes  from  being  an 
 entrepreneur  and  all  these  things  right
[25:56] you  will  sacrifice  some  of  these  goals 
 by  being  open  to  dating  and  also
[26:01] eventually  falling  in  love  with  the 
 lower  quality  girls  that  you  know  and  is 
 not  your  future  wife
[26:06] and  maybe  that  the  concept  of  a  future 
 wife  is  so  weird  and  distant  for  you 
 that  it's  hard  to  think  about  it
[26:13] but  genuinely  if  you  build  yourself  up 
 and  just  kind  of  wait  and  just  keep 
 building  and  building  and  building 
 whilst  also  you're  still  building  like
[26:19] all  areas  of  life  you're  still  building 
 like  your  social  life  you've  got  friends 
 and  stuff  so  you're  not  like  awkwardly
[26:24] just  sat  inside  all  day  but  you're  still 
 like  imagine  you're  a  confident  guy  who 
 just  right  now  has  this  like  confidence
[26:29] of  like  nope  she's  not  my  future  wife 
 nope  she's  not  no  no  no  guys  I've  got 
 I've  just  got  really  high  standards
[26:34] imagine  that  bro  imagine  being  the  guy 
 who  can  say  nope  I've  just  got  really 
 high  standards  sorry  like  you  know  what
[26:39] his  friends  are  saying  like  oh  well  why 
 don't  you  ever  get  girls  bro  imagine 
 building  yourself  up  you've  got  a 
 six-pack  you  look  good  you're  actually
[26:44] handsome  you're  a  bit  older  now  and  all 
 of  the  random  girls  that  you  see  that 
 sometimes  hold  eye  contact  with  you  you
[26:50] just  think  to  yourself  nope  not  my 
 future  wife  I'm  waiting  for  the  second 
 marshmallow  because  I  know  that's  the 
 right  thing  to  do  I  know  it  is  I  know
[26:56] that  that's  the  right  thing  to  do 
 if  you  did  that 
 and  you  essentially  sacrifice  which
[27:02] isn't  a  sacrifice  because  you're  going 
 to  have  a  fun  time  doing  this  anyway 
 you're  like  building  your  business  and 
 developing  yourself  and  still  spending
[27:08] time  with  friends  and  stuff  right 
 essentially  just  specifically  not  being 
 a  degenerate  not  [ __ ]  like  random 
 girls  and  stuff  right
[27:14] eventually  bro  you're  gonna  meet  her 
 like  and  not  just  you  know  oh  the  one
[27:19] already  I  don't  believe  in  like  some 
 Disney  the  one  but  you're  gonna  meet 
 extremely  high  quality  women  who  are
[27:25] beautiful  have  got  a  great  personality 
 and  have  also  got  like  a  great 
 foundation  with  her  father  and  a  mother
[27:30] are  still  together  in  love  her  father's 
 masculine  her  mother's  feminine  this  her 
 parents  are  in  love  which  is  fantastic
[27:35] to  see 
 she's  got  a  really  good  personality 
 maybe  she  maybe  she's  never  even  been
[27:40] with  a  guy  before  and  so  you're  gonna  be 
 her  everything 
 and  then  because  you  you're  on
[27:46] self-improvement  because  you  you  look 
 sexy  because  you've  been  going  to  the 
 gym  and  everything  because  you're
[27:51] masculine  because  you've  been  watching 
 videos  like  this  because  you've  been 
 becoming  like  a  superior  man  and 
 learning  how  to  breathe  properly  and  to
[27:56] to  level  up  your  sex  life  and  stuff 
 right 
 you're  gonna  meet  this  awesome  woman
[28:01] who's  literally  gonna  be  literally 
 prettier  than  the  girls  you  could  get 
 right  now 
 and  the  sex  life  where  there's  going  to
[28:07] be  better 
 one  one  fear  I  had  for  a  long  time  was 
 like  oh  but  if  I  do  this  like  the  sex 
 life's  just  gonna  be  dead  with  like  you
[28:13] know  some  like 
 um  wife  quality  girl  you  know  it's  a 
 common  thing  about  our  husband  and  wife 
 get  together  and  the  sex  goes  down
[28:19] I  think  that's  only  with  chump  husbands 
 honestly  because  I'm  thinking  right  now 
 okay  you've  got  a  six-pack  you're  going
[28:24] to  the  gym  you're  like  leading  a  class 
 in  the  gym  or  in  Jiu  Jitsu  or  something 
 you're  a  successful  guy  confident  guy
[28:29] and  you  know  how  to  polarize  women  you 
 literally  imagine  like  for  the  next  10
[28:35] years  learning  how  to  actually  use  what 
 you  learn  in  this  book  learning  how  to 
 polarize  women 
 because  her  wanting  sex  with  you  is
[28:41] literally  just  as  simple  as  are  you 
 polarizing  her  and  most  husbands  are 
 Chumps  right  most  husbands  get  a  good
[28:46] wife  but  then  they  don't  know  how  to 
 polarize  and  So  eventually  they  don't 
 praise  her  and  stuff  and  then  she  feels 
 like  Baron  out  of  corn  they  stop  having
[28:52] sex  that's  not  gonna  happen  to  us 
 because  the  thing  is  we  have  the  the 
 brain  capacity  this  is  kind  of  like  an
[28:58] insult  to  our  fathers  but  bro  we're 
 smart  enough  that  if  we  weren't  having 
 sex  with  our  wife  we'd  do  something 
 which  is  just  so  [ __ ]  obvious  would
[29:04] Google  it  and  we'd  watch  it  on  YouTube 
 and  there'd  be  people  giving  us  good 
 advice  like  oh  yeah  keep  going  to  the 
 gym  do  this  do  this  make  her  feel  like
[29:10] you  know  praise  her  like  you  follow 
 advice  literally  as  long  as  you've  got 
 this  book  you're  gonna  have  a  lot  of  sex
[29:15] when  you're  married  probably  more  than 
 with  the  random  girls  right  now  and 
 better  bro  better  because  you  know  this
[29:22] woman  now  and  you  actually  love  us  you 
 can  open  up  your  heartfully  and  she  can 
 do  the  same  to  you
[29:28] so  there's  not  gonna  be  like  when  you 
 get  into  that  good  good  relationship 
 there's  not  going  to  be  a  sacrifice  like
[29:33] oh  man  but  like  you  know  she's  oh  but 
 she's  not  you  know  she's  not  going  to  be 
 good  at  giving  ahead
[29:38] you  will  train  her 
 let  me  let  me  let  me  ask  you  something 
 bro
[29:43] how  do  you  think  girls  get  good  ahead 
 all  the  guys  have  trained  her
[29:50] so  when  you  find  a  girl  who's  amazing  at 
 head  right  now  and  it's  so  good  oh  yeah 
 oh  yeah  guys  I'm  getting  experience
[29:56] another  guy  trained  her  for  that 
 but  when  it's  your  future  wife
[30:01] and  of  course  you  set  high  standards 
 most  likely  you  know  our  values  are
[30:07] different  but  most  likely  you'll 
 probably  want  her  to  be  quite  pure 
 sexually  right  you  probably  don't  want 
 her  to  have  had  too  many  experiences
[30:12] beforehand 
 you  will  train  her
[30:18] that's  the  the  best  of  all  cases 
 and  so  we  need  to  acknowledge  that
[30:23] practice  and  experience  with  with  these 
 random  girls  these  low  quality 
 degenerate  girls
[30:29] it's  cope  it's  not  that  it's  some 
 productive  self-improvement  thing  that 
 we  can  do  yeah  I'm  just  practicing
[30:34] getting  girls  guys  it's  just  instant 
 gratification  it's  just  pleasure  so  what 
 we  need  to  do  right  now  is  remove  the
[30:41] word  experience  remove  the  word  practice 
 because  that  makes  it  sound  productive 
 and  simply  just  be  honest  right  we  can
[30:46] be  respectfully  honest  and  just  say  you 
 know  what  I  just  want  some  pleasure  I 
 honestly  I  just  want  to  [ __ ]  I  just  want
[30:51] to  know  and  at  that  point  it's  like  okay 
 now  you're  being  honest  because  bro  of 
 course  we  feel  those  urges  of  course  we
[30:57] do  that's  a  better  question  to  ask 
 we  should  reject  like  this
[31:03] this  false  cope  this  cope  of  oh  but  you 
 know  it'd  be  productive  if  I  got  with
[31:08] girls  right  now  because  we  know  it 
 wouldn't  so  don't  say  that  this  is  for 
 self-improvement  for  your  own 
 development  as  a  man  because  it  would
[31:13] like  lead  your  life  down  a  wrong  path 
 right  with  no  degeneracy  is  bad  for  us 
 you  see  this  with  so  many  guys  right  so
[31:19] it's  not  about  that  oh  I  need  to 
 practice  it's  simply  just  oh  man  I'm 
 horny  and  I'm  lustful
[31:24] and  I'd  like  to  like  ejaculate  when  you 
 say  it  like  that  it's  not  attractive  now
[31:29] is  it  like  um  I'd  like  to  ejaculate  bro 
 like 
 and  what  can  we  say  about  this  well  you
[31:34] know  there's  so  many  videos  online  I  can 
 tell  you  about  like  oh  yeah  how  to  like 
 control  your  lust  and  everything  but
[31:39] there's  a  few  principles  from  this  book 
 which  are  really  good  so  you  can  just 
 have  a  look  at  this  book  if  you  want  but 
 in  general  the  thing  is  like  you  can
[31:45] control  that  luster  and  you  can  you  know 
 you've  heard  the  term  like  sexually 
 transmutates  like  a  bunch  of  like  the
[31:50] old  school  Success  people  used  to  say 
 this  like  you  can  sexually  transmutate 
 that  energy  that  lust  into  your  work  and
[31:56] the  gift  that  you  give  the  world  it's 
 like  when  you  choose  to  you  can  almost
[32:01] turn  off  the  lust  so  that  it  doesn't 
 feel  bad  like  lust  you  know  how  we  want 
 to  [ __ ]  right  that's  like  some  like  a
[32:08] build  up  of  weird  energy  inside  of  us 
 usually  either  in  our  mind  we're  in  our 
 balls  and  in  this  weird  like
[32:14] visualization  you  can  just  imagine 
 breathing  deeply  and  having  it  spread 
 across  your  body  differently  and  almost
[32:21] like  thank  the  women  of  the  world  that 
 they've  given  you  this  energy  and  say  to 
 yourself  again  I'm  gonna  use  this  energy
[32:27] now  to  to  fulfill  my  purpose  to  work  on 
 my  goals  it's  a  weird  practice  that  I 
 personally  like  to  do  and  I  learned  from
[32:33] this  book  The  Way  of  the  superior  man 
 and  so  that  can  help  you  with  the  love 
 so  it's  like  okay  we  know  it's  not 
 practice  we  know  it's  not  experienced
[32:38] and  also  the  fact  that  it's  okay  but  I 
 just  want  some  pleasure  hamster  we  know 
 pleasure  is  not  good  for  us  oh  but  you
[32:43] know  like  I'm  really  lust  like  I've 
 lustful  and  stuff  well  there's  things 
 you  can  do  about  that  you  can  go  YouTube 
 right  now  how  to  deal  with  us  how  to
[32:48] deal  with  urges 
 the  worst  case  scenario  bro  honestly 
 like  I've  never  said  this  on  YouTube
[32:53] before  so  I  might  get  criticized  for  it 
 but  worst  case  scenario 
 maybe  it's  better  to  fap  once  a  week
[32:59] with  no  porn  it's  not  even  like  that  fun 
 or  something  let's  just  do  it  fast  once 
 a  week  to  control  some  of  the  urges  no
[33:05] porn  prom  make  that  promise  no  porno 
 it's  Pawn's  [ __ ]  horrible  for  you  bro 
 literally  no  point  just  imagination  just
[33:11] imagine  your  future  wife 
 and  I  just  get  back  to  work  worst  case 
 scenario  if  that's  what  you  got  to  do  to
[33:16] like  control  some  of  the  urges  you  can 
 do  that  that's  that's  better  than  that 
 having  that  same  ejaculation  but  like
[33:22] inside  of  a  random  girl  that  you've  just 
 met  that's  a  lot  better  for  you  right  so
[33:27] if  you  feel  like  you  can't  control  your 
 urge  just  fap  once  or  twice  a  week 
 honestly  like  I'd  give  you  that  like 
 doctor's  recommendation  right  now  if  if
[33:33] it's  gonna  distract  you  so  much  because 
 I  do  get  into  some  moments  where  it  is 
 very  distracting  for  me
[33:40] and  one  one  extra  like  Point  here  is  you 
 know  okay  but  we  want  to  practice  we 
 want  to  get  experiences  because  when  we
[33:46] do  eventually  meet  the  woman  like  we 
 don't  want  to  be  like  [ __ ]  with  her 
 right 
 well  practice  with  her  when  you  meet
[33:53] that  high  quality  woman  that's  when  the 
 practice  is  worth  it  because  you're 
 practicing  with  women  that  aren't  her
[33:59] before  this  like  I  have  right  I've 
 practiced  with  women  who  aren't  the 
 woman  that  I  actually  want  and  it
[34:04] doesn't  fit  perfectly  like  what  I've 
 learned  to  what  I'm  gonna  need  to  learn 
 it  doesn't  fit  because  every  woman  is
[34:10] genuinely  like  very  unique  and  I  don't 
 say  this  we're  just  like  oh  you  know 
 like  what  they  like  to  do  yeah  I  like  to
[34:15] watch  TV  it's  like  their  feminine  energy 
 the  depth  of  like  a  feminine  energy
[34:20] the  way  that  she  loves  and  what  she 
 needs  is  incredibly  unique  and  you  don't
[34:25] want  to  have  this  preconceived  like  this 
 pre-built  experience  from  girls  who
[34:30] aren't  but  like  the  woman  who  actually 
 matters  and  again  I  will  say  like  I 
 don't  think  there's  the  one  or  you
[34:36] should  wait  out  for  your  soul  mates  I'm 
 just  saying  okay  wait  till  till  the 
 women  who  are  coming  into  your  life  are 
 of  us  such  high  quality  where  they're
[34:42] beautiful  but  then  also  have  like  a 
 great  foundation  for  for  marriage  and 
 children  and  at  that  point  right  now  you
[34:48] might  be  thinking  oh  but  you  know  we 
 should  get  married  in  the  western  stuff 
 when  you  meet  a  woman  who  genuinely  has
[34:53] like  a  strong  masculine  father  who 
 genuinely  has  like  a  submissive  feminine 
 mother  who  you  can  see  is  literally  like
[34:59] religious  she's  never  had  a  guy  before 
 you  and  so  if  that's  when  you'll 
 reconsider  it  because  you'll  think  like 
 wait  like  she's  literally  waiting  for
[35:04] marriage  all  of  the  the  anti-marriage 
 stuff  is  based  on  yeah  don't  [ __ ] 
 marry  the  the  other  girls  bro  of  course
[35:10] not  bro  no  matter  how  much  you're  in 
 love  with  with  one  of  the  other  girls 
 don't  marry  them  but  there's  gonna  be  a
[35:16] moment  when  you  genuinely  you  will  know 
 it  is  actually  right  to  marry  a  woman  I 
 am  sure  I  am  certain  of  this  no  no
[35:21] matter  what  any  red  pill  guy  says 
 they're  talking  about  the  girls  that 
 they  get  which  are  the  DJ  and  party  club
[35:26] girls  the  Instagram  girls  the  tender 
 girls  there's  going  to  be  a  moment  at 
 some  point  and  I'll  explain  how  we're 
 actually  going  to  meet  this  like  this
[35:31] this  really  10  out  of  10  woman  soon 
 right 
 but  just  remember  because  you  know  we
[35:36] like  to  improve  things  right  this 
 doesn't  mean  that  we're  never  going  to 
 improve  our  date  in  life  it  just  means 
 we're  not  going  to  improve  it  improve  it
[35:42] in  in  the  worst  way  we're  going  to  wait 
 till  we  have  like  one  of  the  high 
 quality  women  one  of  the  healthy  women 
 and  improve  it  with  them  so  when  you
[35:48] meet  your  future  wife  you  start  to 
 practice  an  experience  with  her  you  read
[35:53] these  books  that  tell  you  about  how  to 
 love  a  woman  you  read  attached  by  Amir
[35:58] Levine  you'll  read  like  books  on 
 attachment  styles  on  love  and  maybe 
 together  and  this  is  now  your  journey 
 like  your  project  together  where  you
[36:03] literally  think  okay  I  actually  really 
 [ __ ]  want  to  make  it  work  with  this 
 woman  she's  so  high  quality  and  you  say
[36:10] to  her  like  let's  do  this  together  let's 
 learn  about  the  type  of  people  we  are 
 and  how  we  love  and  what  we  need  from
[36:15] each  other  and  like  you  tell  me  like 
 what  what  would  you  like  from  me  you  can 
 learn  and  practice  with  her  so  why  would
[36:21] you  like  do  that  with  some  random  girl 
 that  you  don't  actually  care  about  that 
 you're  faking  to  care  about  that  you
[36:27] know  like  you  know  these  random  girls 
 you  know  that  eventually  you're  gonna 
 break  up  with  them
[36:32] and  not  only  because  of  the  fact  that 
 eventually  you  know  you're  gonna  you 
 want  the  future  wife  and  These  Girls 
 Aren't  but  also  the  fact  that  like
[36:37] you're  climbing  very  fast  as  a  man  on 
 self-improvement  no  bro  I'm  telling  you 
 right  now
[36:43] no  girls  that  I  mean  the  least  that  I've 
 met  but  maybe  this  they're  awesome  out 
 there  no  girls  can  match  the  rate  that
[36:49] we  can  collide 
 if  you've  been  like  a  like  a  big  fan  of
[36:55] mine  for  maybe  two  years  you've  seen  the 
 relationships  that  I  got  into  really
[37:00] happy 
 and  then  ended  up  breaking  up  with  every 
 single  girl  that  I  dated  simply  because 
 we  would  meet  on  the  same  level  and
[37:06] three  months  six  months  later  it's  like 
 I  just  this  sounds  [ __ ]  horrible 
 right  this  is  like  a  first  man  concept
[37:11] that  I  learned  from  him  that  every  other 
 YouTuber  every  other  like 
 um  person  out  there  will  say  like  oh
[37:16] this  is  such  a  weird  thing  truthfully 
 when  you're  on  self-improvement  and 
 you're  you're  ruthlessly  improving
[37:21] yourself  your  value  like  the  person  you 
 are  you  will  out  Climb  Every  Woman 
 especially  like  the  the  sort  of  online
[37:27] dating  apps  Instagram  kind  of  girls 
 even  the  girl  who's  on  self-improvement
[37:32] herself  but  you  know  her  foundations  all 
 cracked  and  stuff  and  and  she  slept 
 around  a  lot  before  you  she's  taking  a
[37:37] lot  of  drugs  and  her  father's  not  in  the 
 picture  and  stuff  even  if  she's  really 
 on  self-improvement  she'll  never  be  able
[37:42] to  match  your  rate  of  growth 
 it's  just  as  simple  as  that
[37:50] so  practice  and  experience  with  your 
 wife  learn  how  to  love  her  forever  you 
 know  with  these  books  and  still  learn
[37:56] some  red  pill  truth  so  this  isn't  to  say 
 like  yeah  be  totally  blue  pill  this  is 
 to  like  learn  some  things  that  you  still
[38:02] need  to  know  learn  about  hypergamy  learn 
 about  like  female  nature  and  stuff  still 
 learn  some  of  these  things  but  with
[38:09] the  best  women  not  with  the  lowest 
 quality  women  that  you  can  get  right  now 
 this  is  literally  just  all  about  are  you
[38:14] going  to  take  the  marshmallow  right  now 
 or  the  second  one  later  it's  just  simply 
 just  that 
 when  you've  heard  of  that  marshmallow
[38:20] study  you  know  the  kids  are  sat  there 
 and  they're  told  do  you  want  the  one 
 marshmallow  now  the  second  marshmallow 
 later  it's  like  I  don't  know  about  you
[38:25] but  it  makes  me  feel  awkward  hearing 
 that  study  knowing  that  as  a  kid  I  would 
 have  taken  the  first  one  and  that  really
[38:30] like  reflected  like  my  first  like  18 
 years  where  I  was  just  playing  video 
 games  and  stuff  you  know  the  instant
[38:35] gratification  is  not  good  for  you 
 instant  gratification  has  never  served 
 you  not  even  once  it  has  Stripped  Away
[38:40] years  of  your  [ __ ]  youth 
 imagine  if  you  never  took  the  first
[38:45] marshmallow  in  the  in  the  reflection  of 
 playing  video  games  and  watching  porn 
 for  like  10  years  straight  imagine  if  we
[38:51] were  literally  bro  you  can  be  a  10  year 
 old  who's  actually  productive  in  reading 
 books  genuinely  I  know  that's  like  rare
[38:57] to  see  but  like  we  could  have  been  if  we 
 were  the  kind  of  kids  who  took  the 
 second  Marshmallow  with  instant
[39:03] gratification  has  never  served  us  once 
 why  would  it  serve  us  here  in  such  an 
 important  part  of  our  Lives  which  is  our
[39:08] day  in  life  and  who  we  bonded  with  and 
 attach  with 
 and  one  point  that  none  of  the  red  pill
[39:13] guys  actually  say 
 is  that  the  highest  quality  women  you're 
 the  really  wifey  qualities  right  I'm  not
[39:19] just  saying  like  the  just  the  beautiful 
 girl  or  something  I'm  saying  imagine  the 
 girl  who's  got  the  package  like  she's 
 beautiful  and  she's  also  got  a  really
[39:24] awesome  personality  and  she's  also  got  a 
 really  awesome  family  right  I'm  not  like 
 like  you  know  she's  not  perfect  right  no
[39:30] one's  perfect  right  but  just  imagine 
 right  those  kinds  of  women  have  high 
 standards  of  course  they  do  so  they  want
[39:36] the  best  mental  what  are  the  best  men 
 because  so  far  you've  thought  that  the 
 best  men  are  simply  the  high  value  men 
 they're  like  the  the  red  pill  alpha
[39:42] males  you  know  they've  got  success  and 
 they've  got  girls 
 there's  a  level  of  man  above  those  guys
[39:47] those  guys  are  above  most  most  men  but 
 there's  a  level  of  man  above  those  guys
[39:52] and  that  is  the  guy  who's  High  status 
 who's  high  value  who's  attractive 
 but  who's  also  got  incredibly  high
[39:58] standards  that  he  doesn't  [ __ ]  around 
 who's  also  religious
[40:03] this  is  hard  to  imagine  because  this  is 
 you  know  like  we  said  oh  the  top  one 
 percent  man  those  are  the  red  pill  guys 
 right  this  is  like  the  top  zero  zero
[40:09] zero  one  percent  man  right
[40:14] there  is  a  level  of  man  that  that  isn't 
 really  on  the  internet  these  days  and 
 I'm  certainly  not  him  right  so  there's
[40:19] the  one  percent  guy  that  we  want  to  be 
 like  oh  yeah  private  jets  and  girls  oh 
 wow  that's  amazing  right  but  above  that
[40:24] is  the  guy  who  doesn't  indulge  in  women 
 is  the  guy  who's  got  such  high  standards
[40:31] that  he  just  he  literally  keeps  thinking 
 that  this  girl's  not  good  enough  this 
 girl's  not  good  enough  this  girl's  not
[40:36] good  enough  and  everyone  especially 
 people  on  the  internet  think  he's  crazy 
 oh  man  you  need  to  lower  your  standards 
 and  all  this  [ __ ]  they'll  say  like  oh 
 but  no  one  no  girl's  gonna  be  perfect
[40:42] and  no  girl's  gonna  and  he  just  knows 
 he's  got  this  to  see  nope  nope  I  know 
 what  I'm  looking  for  five  years  down  the
[40:47] line  six  years  down  the  line  maybe  he's 
 discovered  God  or  something  and  then  he 
 founds  a  woman  who  respects  literally
[40:53] likes  him  more  because  she  can  see  that 
 he's  actually  had  such  high  standards 
 that  he  hasn't  indulged  on  the  way  there
[41:00] with  lower  quality  girls 
 you  want  to  know  how  like  okay  I  want 
 you  to  imagine  not  just  like  the
[41:05] beautiful  girl  who's  who's  kind  of  like 
 a  [ __ ]  okay  I'm  I'm  talking  the  highest 
 quality  girls  right  they've  literally
[41:11] got 
 undeniably  this  is  impossible  without 
 them  I'm  sorry  for  the  girls  watching
[41:16] this  but  to  be  the  highest  quality  girl 
 you  need  to  have  a  strong  masculine 
 father  figure  who  still  married  to  your
[41:21] mother  it's  like  they  can't  be  split  up 
 literally  it's  it's  that's  just  a 
 non-negotiable  maybe  if  a  father  passed
[41:26] away  it's  a  bit  different  but  literally 
 the  highest  quality  women  have  got  a 
 strong  masculine  Father  Figure  who's
[41:32] still  in  love  in  still  married  maybe  in 
 like  a  religious  marriage  to  his
[41:37] feminine  Like  Loving  beautiful  wife 
 right  that  that's  what  your  woman  future 
 woman  seeing  right  this  is  the  highest
[41:43] quality  like  this  is  an  absolute 
 undeniable  if  that  man  or  if  she  is  as 
 high  qualities  as  we  think  she  is  that
[41:49] father  has  to  be  as  observant  and  strong 
 as  we  think  he  would  have  needed  to  be 
 to  to  nurture  his  daughter  into
[41:56] essentially  not  being  a  degenerate  in 
 this  modern  world  that's  hard  right  you 
 probably  never  even  like  saw  this 
 Dynamic  before  where  a  girl  is  growing
[42:01] up  to  not  be  like  a  Degen  at  all  right 
 so  this  requires  a  strong  father  bro 
 when  you're  the  top  one  percent  man  and
[42:07] you  sit  in  front  of  him  and  the  strong 
 father  can  see  through  you  that  you 
 [ __ ]  a  hundred  girls  he's  gonna  know
[42:13] he's  going  to  know  that  you're  actually 
 not  the  level  that  he's  looking  for 
 because  he's  looking  for  the  kind  of  guy
[42:18] who's  got  the  personality  the  money  the 
 status  the  the  fame  and  everything  but 
 he's  also  looking  for  the  kind  of  like
[42:23] usually  godly  man  who  has  literally  been 
 like  waiting  for  the  second  marshmallow
[42:30] view  this  is  literally  like  like  an 
 example  of  the  highest  quality  people 
 ever
[42:36] and  it's 
 it's  unrealistic  for  us  to  reach  towards
[42:41] that 
 that's  what  everyone  will  tell  you  it's 
 unrealistic 
 and  of  course  if  anyone  puts  down  your
[42:47] goals  they're  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and  you 
 shouldn't  spend  time  with  them 
 I'm  very  lucky  that  when  I  announced  my
[42:53] goals  years  ago  to  my  family 
 no  one  put  my  goals  down
[43:01] every  goal  that  I've  achieved  over  the 
 last  few  years  is  unrealistic 
 so  why  not  this  one  why  not  this  one  for
[43:07] you 
 the  highest  like  literally  the  highest 
 quality  women  will  be  thinking  about
[43:14] your  previous  dating  life  and  of  course 
 you  could  hide  it  from  them  of  course 
 you  don't  need  to  tell  them  details 
 about  the  women  you  [ __ ]  and  practiced
[43:19] with  right 
 is  that  the  kind  of  relationship  you 
 want  to  start  with  where  she's  not  even
[43:24] dating  like  the  real  you  where  she  knows 
 like  60  of  actually  Who  You  Are
[43:29] in  some  ways  be  mysterious  in  some  ways 
 you  know  be  busy  you  know  with  your  work 
 100  you  know  like  I  give  this  advice
[43:34] yeah  bpsc  be  like  you  know  focus  on  your 
 purpose  yeah 
 but  at  the  same  time  like  imagine  not
[43:41] actually  being  able  to  show  the  real  you 
 to  the  woman  that  you're  entrusting 
 everything  with
[43:52] I  think  I  could  be  wrong  but  I  think 
 with  the  ideal  relationship  you  should
[43:57] know  and  accept  and  love  100  of  her  her 
 past  her  experiences  her  values
[44:03] everything  and  she  should  do  the  exact 
 same  thing  for  you  you  can  still 
 maintain  mystery  past  this  you  can  still
[44:08] go  to  the  gym  and  not  reply  to  a  phone 
 for  like  three  hours  you  can  still  go 
 work  on  your  purpose  and  stuff  of  course
[44:17] but  when  you  get  to  this  depth  of  like 
 openness 
 I  think  that's  when  you'll  get  the  best
[44:22] relationship  you  could  possibly  get  and 
 I  think  that's 
 is  the  foundation  in  which  we  should
[44:29] have  our  kids 
 you  see  all  this  time  we've  just  been 
 speaking  about  girls  and  future  wife  and
[44:35] stuff  but  in  the  end  it  just  comes  down 
 to  fatherhood 
 how  much
[44:40] how  long  you  will  wait  for  that  second 
 marshmallow  defines
[44:46] [ __ ]  me  bro 
 how  long  you  will  wait  for  that  second 
 marshmallow
[44:51] defines  how  many  guys  will  [ __ ]  your 
 future  daughter
[44:57] if  you  go  about  this  wrong 
 and  you  expect  to  have  children  at  some
[45:02] point  and  you  go  about  this  wrong  and 
 you  practice  and  you  mess  around  and 
 stuff 
 your  daughter  will  literally  have  a
[45:07] higher  body  count  your  daughter  will 
 give  her  soul  to  guys  who  don't  even 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  her  to  guys  she
[45:12] doesn't  give  a  [ __ ]  about  and  she'll  end 
 up  getting  into  that  situation  where 
 like  she's  one  of  these  Degen  women 
 who's  ended  up  partnering  up  with  like  a
[45:18] self-improvement  guy  and  he  can  never 
 just  accept  the 
 your  inability  to  delay  for  that  second
[45:25] marshmallow  literally  means  that  more 
 guys 
 will  will  [ __ ]  like  nut  over  your
[45:30] [ __ ]  future  daughter  bro
[45:35] it  means  that  your  son  will  be  more  of  a 
 Jeffrey 
 it  means  that  your  son  will  have  [ __ ]
[45:40] posture  whilst  he  literally  like  he 
 indulges  in  the  [ __ ]  futuristic  porn
[45:45] that's  out  there  this  is  the 
 consequences  of  our  actions  as  young  men 
 and  when  you  spend  time  distracted  by
[45:51] degeneracy 
 degeneracy  will  compound  in  your 
 bloodline
[45:58] you  are  not  that  kind  of  man  who  would 
 allow  this  to  pass  the  room  you  would 
 not  be  watching  a  video  like  this  you
[46:03] would  not  be  watching  my  channel 
 I  don't  think  we  even  comprehend
[46:09] the  consequences  of  our  actions  here 
 but  our  decisions  in  dating  is  one  of
[46:14] the  most  important  not  only  for  what 
 happens  in  dating  but  also  for  how  much 
 like  dating  can  distract  you  in  certain
[46:20] ways  now  if  you  meet  the  high  quality  10 
 out  of  10  woman  that  is  not  a 
 distraction  then  that's  the  woman  to
[46:25] pair  up  with  100  but  till  you  meet  her 
 stay  focused  on  growing  yourself  and
[46:31] this  doesn't  mean  I'll  just  be  indoors 
 and  don't  talk  to  anyone  do  like  a 
 semi-monk  mode  where  you  still  want  to
[46:36] build  like  a  vibrant  life  of  of  male 
 friends  and  then  it's  like  okay  that's
[46:41] awesome  maybe  even  make  some  female 
 friends  but  you  know  like  like 
 specifically  I'm  going  to  tell  you 
 specifically  the  issue  is  just  you
[46:47] having  sex  with  women 
 who  aren't  going  to  be  your  future  wife 
 it  literally  comes  down  to  that  and  I
[46:53] know  how  weird  it  is  for  me  to  say  that 
 as  a  guy  who's  done  it  but  of  course 
 like  this  is  how  I'm  able  to  pass  on  the
[46:58] wisdom  series  like  I  made  the  mistake  so 
 now  I'm  telling  you  what  I  did  wrong  you 
 don't  have  to  take  the  Learning  lesson
[47:04] but  honestly  I  wish  I  did
[47:10] so  how  should  we  navigate  our  day  in 
 life  then 
 maybe  the  best  way  is  literally  just
[47:17] permanently  be  in  a  full  state  of  of 
 hard  work  and  growth  and  not  just  you
[47:22] know  like  oh  grind  or  like  thingy  but 
 like  you  know  like  hard  working  growth 
 also  means  take  a  long  walk  every  day  it
[47:28] also  means  the  journal  and  read 
 generally  just  essentially  how  about  we 
 just  don't  date
[47:33] honestly  religious  people  had  this  role 
 how  about  we  just  literally  don't  date
[47:38] within  a  glance  like  you're  coping  if 
 you  if  not  right  bro  within  a  glass 
 you'll  come  across  some  women  in  the  gym
[47:43] or  whatever  right  within  one  single 
 glance  one  conversation  you  can  tell  if 
 she's  not  eligible  to  be  your  wife  you
[47:49] can  tell  don't  don't  cope  bro  you  see  a 
 tattoo  on  her  bro  she's  not  your  future 
 wife  simple  as  that  you  see  this  she's
[47:54] got  colorful  hair  bro  she's  not  your 
 future  wife  you  see  that  she's  got  that 
 that  friend  who's  a  bit  of  a  [ __ ]  bro 
 don't  cope  don't  cope  she's  not  your
[48:01] future  wife  now  this  is  easy  to  do  when 
 you're  rational  headed  but  when  you  meet 
 these  women  or  like  a  date  and  you  end
[48:06] up  having  sex  with  them  then  it's  harder 
 then  you  like  you  have  sex  with  this 
 girl  knowing  that  she's  got  tattoos  and 
 stuff  oh  yeah  I'm  just  practicing  bro 
 I'm  just  you  know  getting  some  instant
[48:12] gratification  yeah  I  feel  like  a  man  bro 
 and  then  you  see  how  the  general  family 
 you  see  the  general  friends  and  you're 
 like  you're  in  too  deep  and  you've
[48:18] fallen  in  love  with  the  bro  you  don't 
 want  to  be  in  that  situation  from  one 
 glass  just  don't  have  sex  with  these 
 women  it's  literally  as  simple  as  that  I
[48:23] don't  have  sex  with  them  because  then 
 you'll  pair  the  attachment  with  them  and 
 it's  not  worth  it  it's  a  distraction 
 from  your  business  and  and  over  the  next
[48:28] five  years  ten  years  that  distraction 
 compounds  you  don't  realize  how  much 
 you'll  miss  out  on  this  not  just  for  the
[48:33] work  but  also  for  the  kind  of  what  man 
 that  you  become  to  attract  the  the  Dream 
 Woman  of  yours
[48:40] maybe  literally  just  don't  date  as  soon 
 as  you  see  women 
 within  a  second  you  know  within  one
[48:46] conversation  you  know  there's  some 
 brutal  like  facts  which  a  lot  of  women 
 don't  like  to  hear  but  tattoos
[48:52] she's  got  guys  around  her  she's  got 
 [ __ ]  friends  those  kinds  of things  as 
 soon  as  you  see  that  her  parents  are 
 divorced  personally  like  I've
[48:59] nope  sorry 
 my  standard  literally  don't  even  say  it 
 to  her  but  just  say  to  yourself  I'm  a
[49:04] man  of  really  high  standards  I  hold 
 myself  like  say  it  with  a  sense  of 
 [ __ ]  pry  like  you're  in  the  military 
 I  hold  myself  to  really  high  standards  I
[49:10] hold  myself  to  really  high  standards  I 
 hold  myself  to  really  high  standards
[49:15] I  will  wait  for  the  second  marshmallow
[49:24] just  no  dating  just  keep  improving 
 yourself  and  then  you  might  think  okay 
 well  how  do  I  find  her
[49:30] honestly  I  think  women  are  supposed  to 
 find  you  I  think  that  you  will  tend  to
[49:35] the  god  and  I  think  that  you  will  keep 
 improving  and  ruthlessly  running  and 
 going  to  the  gym  and  stuff  and  when
[49:41] you're  like  high  attractive  enough  when 
 you're  high  value  enough 
 good  women  just  seem  to  find  you  and  we
[49:47] can  wait  for  that  because  as  soon  as  we 
 try  to  find  the  woman  we  start  cooking 
 about  it  in  the  d-gen  ways  you  know
[49:52] we're  on  dating  apps  we're  looking 
 online  we're  on  Instagram  and  stuff 
 we're  going  to  parties  and  and  you  know 
 trying  to  go  out  cold  approaching  and
[49:57] that  just  practices  the  wrong  thing  I 
 think  if  we  focus  entirely  on  just 
 building  but  also  living  like  a  vibrant
[50:03] life  with  our  male  friends  or  going  on 
 Hikes  we're  going  to  to  stuff  like  that 
 I  think  you'll  end  up  just  naturally
[50:09] just  coming  across  some  women  not 
 nowhere  near  as  much  as  if  you're  on 
 online  dating  and  stuff 
 and  then  with  that  start  to  just  filter
[50:16] them  out  with  really  high  standards  and 
 then  you  might  actually  meet  some  women
[50:21] who  are  really  high  quality  because  you 
 yourself  are  high  quality
[50:30] three  guys  asked  me about  this  yesterday 
 three  different  guys  on  a  three  hour 
 group  call  I  have  a  new  like  online
[50:36] community  which  is  for  guys  to  come 
 together  and  to  like  get  very  close  to 
 me  like  I  literally  was  on  on  the  phone
[50:41] call  for  like  five  hours  yesterday  and 
 there's  the  top  Link  in  the  description 
 if  you're  interested  in  that  do  the  hard
[50:46] work  especially  when  you  don't  feel  like 
 it  what
