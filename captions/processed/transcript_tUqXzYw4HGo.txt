[00:00] Jeffrey  looks  down  at  his  weak  frail 
 body  my  genetics  are  terrible  I  could
[00:05] never  get  jacked  genetics  Jeffrey  look 
 around
[00:11] that's  not  because  of  your  genetics  but 
 because  of  your  actions  but  it  hurts  you
[00:16] to  admit  this  you  need  to  follow  just 
 five  crucial  steps  to  go  from  skinny  to 
 jacked  just  like  Adonis  Adonis  is  the
[00:24] embodiments  of  physical  Perfection  his 
 broad  shoulders  and  defined  muscles  are 
 the  result  of  years  of  dedication  to  his
[00:30] fitness  and  health  but  Adonis  wasn't 
 born  like  this  he  didn't  have  the 
 perfect  genetics  there  was  a  time  when
[00:35] Adonis  was  skimming  in  weak  just  like 
 Jeffrey  but  he  did  not  complain  about 
 this  he  put  in  the  hard  work
[00:43] please  believe  me  when  I  tell  you  this 
 that  everything  that  I  have  achieved  in 
 my  life  every  good  thing  that  has 
 happened  to  me  whether  it's  the
[00:49] attraction  from  women  or  money  or  status 
 or  fame  or  any  of  like  the  positive 
 things  that  I've  had  in  the  last  few
[00:54] years  has  started  because  of  my  fitness 
 journey  when  I  started  to  pack  on  more 
 muscle  I  disciplined  myself  to  get  into
[00:59] the  gym  and  also  whilst  remaining  lean 
 at  a  low  body  fat  percentage  you  don't 
 realize  just  how  much  your  life  gets
[01:04] better  by  building  an  aesthetic  body  now 
 you've  probably  had  the  goal  to  build 
 like  a  muscular  good-looking  Tick-Tock
[01:09] boy  boy  aesthetic  body  before  and  you 
 may  have  struggled  because  you  haven't 
 followed  some  of  these  crucial  steps
[01:14] that  we're  gonna  go  over  today  number 
 one  eat  clean  and  eat  a  lot  in  other 
 words  clean  bulking  when  you  search  for
[01:20] fitness  videos  on  YouTube  you  can  see 
 who  the  sellouts  are  because  they're 
 going  to  try  and  sell  you  this  clickbait 
 idea  which  doesn't  even  work  but  it
[01:26] sounds  really  awesome  and  it's  called 
 maintaining  game-taining  this  idea  that 
 you  don't  need  to  eat  a  lot  you  don't 
 need  to  bulk  you  don't  need  to  increase
[01:31] your  body  weight  and  you  can  just  stay 
 lean  the  title  that  all  these  guys  use 
 for  their  videos  that  get  so  many  views
[01:36] is  how  to  build  a  muscle  and  lose  fat  at 
 the  same  time  which  isn't  an  effective 
 way  of  building  your  dream  body  you  have
[01:41] to  bulk  and  then  you  have  to  cut  after 
 that  bulky  means  you  eat  more  food  than 
 how  many  calories  you  needed  so  that
[01:46] you're  in  a  surplus  and  that  Surplus  is 
 used  to  build  the  muscle  this  is  common 
 sense  for  guys  who've  been  into 
 bodybuilding  they  understand  that  you
[01:51] need  to  bulk  to  gain  muscle  but  a  lot  of 
 guys  don't  believe  this  and  they  think 
 that  they  can  just  stay  lean  and  not  eat
[01:56] any  differently  and  they'll  pack  on  good 
 amount  of  muscle  size  which  just  simply 
 isn't  the  case  so  what  you  need  to  do  is
[02:01] to  start  eating  more  but  specifically  to 
 eat  clean  because  there's  an  extreme 
 version  of  this  which  is  called  Dirty
[02:06] bulking  where  guys  will  eat  pizza  every 
 day  and  milkshakes  and  you  know  they'll 
 just  say  oh  well  I  need  to  get  the 
 calories  we  don't  want  to  do  it  like
[02:12] that  what  we  want  to  do  is  eat  as  clean 
 as  we  can  and  also  try  to  eat  above  our 
 calorie  maintenance  for  you  that  might
[02:18] be  2  700  calories  a  day  3  000  calories  a 
 day  if  you  can  hit  that  whilst  eating 
 clean  food  I'm  talking  vegetables  meat
[02:25] nuts  eggs  your  physique  is  going  to  look 
 very  different  compared  to  the  version 
 of  you  that  dirty  bulks  and  just  has
[02:30] milkshakes  and  sugar  and  pizza  every  day 
 number  two  and  most  interesting  for 
 young  men  optimize  your  testosterone
[02:36] levels  the  truth  is  that  you've  probably 
 been  walking  around  with  testosterone 
 levels  that  it's  maybe  a  third  of  what
[02:41] your  great  grandfather  had  I'm  gonna  say 
 that  again  bro  you  probably  have  one 
 third  of  the  testosterone  levels  that
[02:47] your  great-grandfather  did  the  average 
 man  over  100  years  ago  had  a  four  digit 
 testosterone  level  one  thousand
[02:53] nanograms  per  deciliter  the  average 
 range  of  today  is  270  all  the  way  up  to
[02:58] around  700.  if  you  have  270  nanograms 
 per  deciliter  of  testosterone  you  are
[03:03] considered  normal  and  healthy  which  is  a 
 disgrace  now  if  you're  watching  this 
 video  chances  are  you've  already  seen  a 
 bunch  of  the  testosterone  videos  out
[03:09] there  and  it's  kind  of  boring  to  hear 
 the  exact  same  video  where  the  guy  says 
 yeah  make  sure  you  sleep  and  make  sure 
 you  eat  and  make  sure  you  don't  overdrin
[03:14] and  you  know  when  someone  isn't  educated 
 on  testosterone  and  they're  just  like 
 literally  just  a  parrot  when  the  first 
 thing  that  they  say  when  they're  talking
[03:19] about  testosterone  is  they  lift  heavy 
 weights  when  there's  no  research  that 
 actually  shows  lifting  heavy  weights 
 increases  your  testosterone  literally
[03:24] just  doesn't  and  all  these  Bros  online 
 it's  the  first  and  only  thing  they  can 
 say  is  lift  heavy  weights  and  make  sure
[03:29] you  sleep  in  all  of  those  things 
 actually  result  in  not  even  that  high  of 
 a  testosterone  boost  I've  looked  at  the
[03:34] research  and  there's  a  few  practices 
 that  can  double  triple  or  quadruple  your 
 testosterone  and  I  speak  about  them  for
[03:39] free  and  a  couple  of  the  testosterone 
 videos  I've  made  over  the  last  few 
 months  go  and  have  a  look  at  those  I 
 guarantee  that  those  tactics  that  you've
[03:45] never  even  heard  of  before  and  they'll 
 actually  work  and  they're  actually  like 
 so  exciting  because  no  one  has  ever  said 
 this  to  you  before  you'll  give  it  a  try
[03:50] and  you'll  actually  feel  it  work  way 
 more  than  oh  yeah  lifting  heavy  weighted 
 oh  it's  sleep  eight  hours  like  those 
 things  are  nice  but  those  things  can  get
[03:56] you  a  20  increase  in  your  testosterone 
 I'm  talking  400  click  and  watch  that 
 video  right  now  the  third  step  to  go
[04:01] from  skinny  to  Jack  is  to  understand  the 
 concept  of  building  an  aesthetic  body 
 this  is  a  term  aesthetic  body  that  I
[04:06] think  I  have  personally  popularized 
 because  I  made  a  video  that's  now  got 
 like  three  million  views  but  I  talk
[04:11] about  exactly  what  an  aesthetic  body  is 
 and  finally  I  give  you  a  younger  man 
 permission  to  go  to  the  gym  to
[04:16] specifically  build  a  body  that's 
 attractive  that  will  get  you  more 
 results  in  your  dating  life  and  more
[04:21] confidence  when  you  look  at  yourself 
 before  this  video  was  made  you  can  go 
 have  a  look  at  this  three  million  views 
 before  this  video  was  made  all  these
[04:26] guys  online  were  in  this  circle  jerk  to 
 pretend  like  they  didn't  get  you  know 
 like  Sigma  male  stuff  like  I  don't  care 
 about  girls  I  don't  care  about  looking
[04:31] good  like  if  you  think  about  looking 
 good  then  that's  just  shallow  and  I  go 
 to  the  gym  just  because  I  just  want  to 
 feel  the  muscle  and  the  iron  I  came  onto
[04:37] the  scene  with  that  video  from  like 
 three  years  ago  looked  into  the  camera 
 and  said  I  want  to  get  more  girls  this 
 is  how  specifically  going  to  the  gym  to
[04:43] build  an  aesthetic  bodies  what  changed 
 it  all  for  me  I  highly  recommend  you  go 
 and  watch  that  video  because  I  break  it 
 down  in  a  very  interesting  video  format
[04:49] it's  almost  like  a  PowerPoint 
 presentation  I'm  showing  to  you  and  it's 
 helped  a  lot  of  guys  start  their  Journey 
 the  fourth  rule  of  going  from  skinny  to
[04:55] jacked  is  to  do  the  right  kind  of 
 training  now  in  the  previous  step  I  just 
 told  you  you  know  to  build  an  aesthetic 
 body  and  I'll  link  you  to  that  video  the
[05:01] reason  why  is  because  most  guys  who 
 actually  want  to  look  good  who  want  to 
 build  like  you  know  visible  packed  on
[05:06] muscles  so  that  they  look  muscular  most 
 guys  are  actually  doing  the  wrong  kind 
 of  workouts  for  that  goal  you  see  online
[05:11] there's  this  narrative  that  you 
 shouldn't  be  pursuing  bodybuilding  and 
 instead  you  should  pursue  power  lifting
[05:16] this  is  why  every  young  man  who  wants  to 
 look  good  goes  online  to  try  and  find 
 some  advice  and  he's  told  the  exact  same
[05:21] things  that  he  should  get  onto  a 
 strength  training  program  and  he  should 
 lift  heavy  compound  lifts  no  no  you  want 
 to  look  hot  like  you  want  to  look  sexy
[05:27] you  want  to  look  like  the  kind  of  guy 
 the  girls  are  screenshotting  and  you 
 know  like  on  Tick  Tock  there's  all  those 
 boys  who  like  look  really  nice  on
[05:32] Instagram  there's  those  Chad  looking 
 guys  if  you  want  to  look  like  one  of 
 them  you  need  to  train  in  a  different 
 way  than  what  you're  seeing  all  these
[05:37] like  fat  redditors  and  YouTubers  telling 
 you  for  strong  lifts  five  times  five 
 heavy  compound  left  you  don't  need  to  do 
 that  if  anything  actually  going  on  so
[05:42] strength  training  program  will  reduce 
 your  hypertrophic  gains  it  will  reduce 
 your  gains  because  strength  and  muscle
[05:47] are  two  different  things  even  though 
 they  are  quite  heavily  correlated 
 because  of  aggressive  overload  they  are
[05:52] not  the  same  training  for  strength  with 
 some  heavy  compound  left  three  reps  of 
 bench  press  five  reps  of  bench  press 
 will  not  make  you  anywhere  near  the  same
[05:58] amount  of  muscle  as  if  you  did  15  rep 
 incline  dumbbell  bench  press  so  this  is
[06:03] exactly  what  you  need  to  do  you  need  to 
 get  onto  a  workout  routine  that  will 
 actually  build  the  aesthetic  attractive
[06:08] kind  of  muscle  that  will  make  you  look 
 Jack  and  it  is  not  those  strength 
 training  programs  I  made  my  own  routines
[06:13] for  myself  and  I  followed  them  and  I  saw 
 pretty  good  results  and  I've  linked 
 those  workout  routines  for  free  in  the
[06:18] description  of  this  video  finally 
 there's  one  last  rule  that  you  need  to 
 follow  to  go  from  skinny  to  Jack  and 
 that  is  the  trust  the  process  and  to  be
[06:24] patient  you  must  understand  that  if 
 you've  watched  any  of  those  body 
 transformation  videos  that  you've  seen 
 online  if  you've  seen  any  like  progress
[06:29] pictures  usually  the  guys  are  lying 
 honestly  usually  all  the  YouTubers  that 
 you  can  go  in  like  you  know  if  you  go
[06:34] literally  go  into  YouTube  and  search 
 body  transformation  and  just  have  a  look 
 at  the  thumbnail  most  of  those  guys  are 
 actually  lying  to  you  they're  literally
[06:39] messing  up  your  mental  health  because 
 they  want  to  just  perceive  themselves  to 
 be  better  people  trust  me  I  say  that 
 that  three-year  body  transformation
[06:44] video  that  you  saw  on  YouTube  Took  the 
 guy  more  like  five  years  and  he 
 specifically  took  a  bad  picture  to  begin
[06:49] with  yeah  like  chocolate  milk  or 
 something  before  and  so  he  looked  worse 
 took  it  with  like  really  bad  lighting 
 then  afterwards  took  like  the  best
[06:54] picture  Photoshop  did  a  little  bit  and 
 then  she  presented  it  to  you  so  that 
 hopefully  you'll  click  on  it  and  you'll 
 like  it  more  the  truth  is  that  as  a
[07:00] natural  a  guy  who's  not  taking  steroids 
 your  progress  month  to  month  year  to 
 year  it's  not  gonna  be  like  any  of  these
[07:05] guys  you  see  online  you  can  look  through 
 my  own  progress  pictures  which  have  not 
 been  altered  or  photoshopped  or  anything
[07:10] like  that  which  has  been  totally  natural 
 and  you  can  see  that  I  made  quite  a  lot 
 of  gains  in  my  first  like  one  to  two  to 
 three  years  of  training  and  since  then
[07:15] it's  like  yeah  I  look  a  lot  better  and 
 I've  gained  a  good  amount  of  muscle  but 
 you've  got  anything  I've  been  on  this 
 journey  for  around  eight  to  nine  years
[07:20] from  age  17  to  25  I've  been  on  this 
 journey  and  there's  guys  who  are  saying 
 that  they've  built  a  bigger  physique
[07:25] they  meet  in  like  six  months  when  you 
 see  these  guys  like  progress  pictures 
 online  and  they'll  say  oh  yeah  it's 
 natural  by  the  way  and  go  buy  my  program
[07:31] huh  probably  not  there  was  one  mindset 
 one  thought  that  I  kept  in  Mind  through 
 my  early  days  of  going  to  the  gym  that
[07:37] helped  me  and  it's  probably  the  most 
 valuable  part  of  this  video  and  that  was 
 the  mindset  to  understand  that  time  was 
 gonna  pass  anyway  the  month  the  year  was
[07:44] gonna  pass  anyway  and  even  though  this 
 is  such  a  slow  goal  to  make  progress 
 towards  you  know  to  build  that  like 
 jacked  physique  the  time  was  gonna  pass
[07:50] by  anyway  and  so  all  you  were  going  to 
 be  left  with  was  whether  or  not  you  put 
 in  the  work  to  build  that  physique  I
[07:55] specifically  remember  a  few  of  my  old 
 friends  like  I  would  speak  to  them  about 
 this  journey  I  was  going  on  and  I  really
[08:00] wanted  them  to  start  going  to  the  gym 
 with  me  I  literally  remember  one  friend 
 who  looked  me  in  the  eyes  and  said  wait
[08:05] it's  just  gonna  take  too  long  to  see 
 results  and  if  that  baffled  me  because  I 
 literally  tried  to  explain  to  it  but 
 like  the  month  is  going  to  pass  by
[08:10] anyway  and  so  yeah  it's  gonna  take  some 
 time  but  the  month  is  going  to  pass  by 
 so  all  you're  left  with  is  the  gains  if 
 you've  made  them  or  not  and  guess  what
[08:15] happened  the  time  did  pass  by  I  went 
 from  looking  like  a  little  skinny  fat  17 
 year  old  brown  kid  to  the  physique  of  a
[08:20] Chad  if  you  want  to  call  it  that  and  my 
 friend  has  the  physique  of  Jeffrey 
 skinny  fat  drinks  beer  we're  not  even
[08:26] friends  the  time  is  gonna  pass  by  anyway 
 the  month  of  the  years  are  going  to  pass 
 all  that's  going  to  be  left  is  whether
[08:31] or  not  you  built  this  jacked  physique 
 this  aesthetic  physique  for  your  future 
 self  go  get  those  free  workout  routines
