[00:00] perhaps  you  know  a  guy  just  like  Jeffrey 
 or  maybe  you'll  like  him  yourself  you
[00:05] see  Jeffries  are  all  around  the  world 
 and  they  do  everything  wrong  they  keep 
 indulging  in  all  of  the  habits  that  are
[00:11] mentally  destroying  them  just  for  a 
 little  bit  of  pleasure  after  hours  and
[00:16] hours  and  hours  of  sitting  on  his  crusty 
 computer  chair  finally  Jeffrey  gets  up 
 okay  good  he's  gonna  do  something
[00:21] productive  now  no  Jeffrey  oh  he  just 
 laid  down  on  his  bed  and  went  on  his
[00:26] phone 
 honest
[00:31] only  a  select  few  men  on  the  entire 
 planet  are  like  Adonis  disciplined  with
[00:36] a  student  mindset  present  and  grateful 
 and  a  leader  how  do  you  think  he  got 
 this  way  do  you  think  that  Adonis
[00:41] indulged  in  the  same  habits  that  Jeffrey 
 did  of  course  not  now  Adonis  has  made 
 some  mistakes  but  he  overcame  them  once
[00:48] he  knew  that  a  habit  wasn't  good  for  him 
 he  vowed  to  stop  and  that  is  how  he 
 became  so  great  do  you  have  bad  habits
[00:55] in  this  video  we're  gonna  break  down  the 
 worst  ones  that  you  could  have  and  I 
 want  you  to  do  something  I  want  you  to 
 count  how  many  of  the  five  that  we're
[01:00] going  to  discuss  today  that  you 
 currently  are  over  indulging  in  the 
 first  and  worst  habit  by  far  is  porn  now
[01:06] I  don't  want  to  make  this  another  basic 
 self-improvement  video  where  we  just 
 talk  about  poem  but  holy  [ __ ]  it  is 
 literally  the  worst  thing  that  you  can
[01:11] be  doing  as  a  young  man  watching  porn 
 and  masturbating  literally  means  that 
 you're  castrating  yourself  if  you've
[01:16] ever  seen  what  happens  when  a  family 
 buys  a  pet  like  a  cat  or  a  dog  and  that 
 Catholic  really  adventurous  isn't  it  if
[01:22] it's  a  male  it's  like  really  adventurous 
 really  like  Territorial  and  then  what 
 does  that  family  do  once  they  have  this 
 pet  they're  new  to  it  they  castrated  it
[01:29] in  simple  terms  they  chop  off  it  balls 
 it  stops  this  testosterone  production 
 and  suddenly  The  Adventurous  feisty
[01:35] territorial  cat  becomes  docile  weak  lazy 
 lethargic  and  that  is  what  we're  doing
[01:40] to  ourselves  when  we  over  indulge  in 
 things  like  porn  now  you  already  know 
 about  almost  all  of  the  negatives  of
[01:45] porn  so  I  don't  want  to  just  repeat  them 
 but  there  is  a  huge  negative  that  most 
 YouTubers  never  actually  speak  about
[01:50] because  it's  going  to  get  kind  of  like 
 vulgar  and  it's  the  issue  that  watching 
 porn  destroys  your  understanding  and
[01:56] capability  to  actually  sleep  with  a  girl 
 properly  Pawn  gave  me  small  dick  anxiety
[02:01] like  I  started  watching  you  when  I  was 
 13  14  years  old  and  I  hadn't  hit  puberty 
 yet  so  my  dick  it  wasn't  big  you  know
[02:07] did  you  like  essentially  still  a  child 
 at  this  point  you  know  I  hadn't  hit 
 puberty  I  remember  watching  it  with 
 these  big  [ __ ]  like  logs  that  these
[02:13] porn  stars  had  and  I  honestly  yeah  this 
 is  funny  he  like  homes  like  this  was  a 
 while  ago  right  this  was  over  10  years
[02:18] ago  but  honestly  this  isn't  a  funny 
 thing  because  this  [ __ ]  me  this 
 literally  [ __ ]  me  up  mentally  like
[02:23] this  was  one  of  the  worst  problems  that 
 I  had  as  a  teenager  I  was  totally 
 convinced  that  I  had  a  small  dick
[02:28] because  of  what  I  saw  on  these  videos  oh 
 [ __ ]  remember  neurotically  like  Googling 
 this  [ __ ]  like  what's  the  average  penis
[02:33] size  that  goes  well  how  big  should  my 
 penis  be  over  a  small  penis  what  to  do  I 
 remember  one  of  my  friends  got  a 
 girlfriend  and  I  literally  asked  him  oh
[02:39] if  she  wanted  to  like  have  sex  with  you 
 like  suck  your  dick  or  would  you  let  her 
 anyway  like  yeah  of  course  and  I 
 literally  had  this  perception  that  like
[02:44] oh  if  I  got  a  girlfriend  right  now  I 
 would  tell  her  like  no  like  I  don't  want 
 to  have  sex  or  anything  because  I  was  so 
 insecure  about  my  PP  size  and  the  second
[02:50] problem  that  I  had  relating  to  this  was 
 that  watching  so  much  porn  gave  my  mind 
 a  kind  of  false  understanding  of  how  you
[02:57] proceed  you  know  you  escalate  to  sex  so 
 on  point  you  always  watches  the  same 
 routine  the  guy  and  a  girl  start  kissing
[03:02] and  they  start  undressing  then  they  do 
 some  foreplay  then  they  you  know  have 
 like  actual  sex  like  this  fake  like 
 staged  performance  and  so  I  followed  the
[03:09] same  kind  of  routine  when  I  actually 
 like  you  know  became  like  sexually 
 active  and  honestly  I  like  I  didn't  have 
 a  good  time  this  was  the  only  way  that  I
[03:15] knew  right  so  that  you  know  you're  like 
 you  you  do  this  whole  step-by-step 
 routine  like  this  pattern  of  like  okay 
 do  this  like  you  know  pull  up  the
[03:20] trousers  like  the  essentially  I  just 
 became  robotic  when  I  when  it  came  to 
 actually  making  love  for  the  first  time
[03:25] and  I  didn't  actually  have  a  good  time 
 honestly  I  started  having  sex  at  age  19 
 and  I  didn't  enjoy  it  for  almost  a  year
[03:31] streets  because  of  the  [ __ ]  up 
 perception  of  sex  and  like  making  love 
 that  I  saw  and  watching  porn  and  the
[03:36] reason  why  this  perception's  so  messed 
 up you  know  of  like  you  know  you're 
 watching  hundreds  of  episodes  of  like 
 fake  taxi  or  some  [ __ ]  the  reason  why
[03:41] this  perception  is  like  so  messed  up  and 
 you  see  this  kind  of  like  build  up  and 
 this  you  know  this  routine  that  you  keep
[03:46] seeing  okay  you're  supposed  to  go  down 
 on  them  and  then  she's  like  shoot  off 
 and  then  you're  supposed  to  take  her 
 clothes  off  and  you  know  like  your 
 step-by-step  procedure  of  this  routine
[03:51] right  the  reason  why  this  [ __ ]  me  up 
 so  much  is  because  I  was  then  not  even 
 present  when  it  came  to  being  intimate
[03:56] with  a  girl  I  was  so  utterly  in  my  mind 
 overthinking  about  what  the  next  step 
 was  that  I  wasn't  even  having  a  good
[04:02] time  and  guess  what  happens  when  you're 
 not  present  when  you're  about  to  have 
 sex  with  a  girl  my  dick  didn't  get  hard 
 I  suffered  immensely  from  this  for  my
[04:08] first  year  of  being  sexually  active  and 
 I  was  like  I'm  not  gonna  lie  like  I  was 
 a  bit  of  a  [ __ ]  boy  I  was  like  on  Tinder
[04:13] all  the  time  I  was  going  to  clubs  and 
 stuff  right  more  than  10  girls  that  I 
 had  brought  back  to  my  place  I'd  done
[04:18] all  the  hard  work  I  brought  them  here 
 more  than  10  girls  where  I  would 
 literally  pull  my  pants  out  soft  dick
[04:23] unable  to  perform  there's  gonna  be  some 
 heartless  [ __ ]  watching  this 
 like  oh  yeah  that's  kind  of  funny  bro 
 you  don't  realize  how  much  that  [ __ ]
[04:28] your  mind  up  as  a  man  how  much  that 
 mentally  destroys  you  and  why  do  you 
 think  it  happened  it  was  because  I  was
[04:33] watching  porn  for  like  10  years  straight 
 before  this  this  is  why  I've  made  a 
 private  video  going  into  detail  of  like
[04:39] the  mistakes  that  I  made  when  I  first 
 started  like  sleeping  with  girls  I've 
 made  a  private  on  YouTube  because  it's
[04:44] too  like  vulgar  to  speak  in  detail 
 there's  a  link  to  it  in  the  description 
 three  bedroom  mistakes  that  you're 
 making  so  you  can  go  click  on  that  the
[04:50] second  dangerous  habit  that  will  destroy 
 you  is  being  too  emotional  as  a  man  I 
 say  this  in  a  lot  of  videos  but  you  must
[04:56] understand  that  you  know  this  this  new 
 narrative  that  you  keep  hearing  that  men 
 should  open  up  and  be  emotional  and  be
[05:02] in  touch  with  their  feminine  side  it's 
 pure  evil  there's  like  false  message 
 that  you  keep  hearing  that  you  should
[05:08] open  up  your  feminine  side  that  you 
 should  be  emotional  it's  a  trap  it  is  a 
 trap  I'm  not  trying  to  be  toxically
[05:13] masculine  and  tell  you  like  yeah  bottle 
 up  your  feelings  and  eventually  kill 
 yourself  of  course  not  you  know  these 
 people  they  say  that  to  me  like  oh  yeah
[05:18] well  how  the  [ __ ]  am  I  like  the  scene  is 
 the  bad  guy  when  I  tell  guys  like  yeah 
 like  control  your  emotions  research
[05:24] stoicism  emotional  stability  it's  the 
 best  asset  that  you  can  have  I  literally 
 I'm  live  streaming  right  now  I  literally
[05:29] just  told  all  the  boys  what  happened 
 when  our  business  I  suffered  like  this 
 huge  like  problem  we  lost  half  of  our
[05:34] income  instantly  because  of  a  different 
 company  called  skillshare  that  called  us 
 like  toxically  masculine  they  canceled
[05:39] us  25  000  pounds  a  month  they  took  that 
 away  from  us  and  they  wanted  me  to  be 
 emotional  they  wanted  me  to  beg  and
[05:45] plead  like  please  can  I  just  have  the 
 money  please  with  stoicism  with 
 emotional  control  and  navigating  that 
 situation  and  we  prospered  from  that
[05:51] moment  they  don't  want  you  to  be  like 
 this  I  don't  understand  why  I  don't 
 understand  why  your  own  country  and  your
[05:56] own  people  want  you  to  be  weak  emotional 
 men  are  weak  now  this  does  not  mean  you
[06:01] should  bottle  up  your  feelings  that 
 eventually  the  point  that  you  can't  hold 
 anymore  there  is  one  person  that  you  can
[06:06] be  emotional  to  and  that  is  your  chosen 
 brother  I  don't  necessarily  mean  your 
 blood  brother  like  you  know  who  was  born
[06:12] from  your  parents  I  mean  another  man 
 that  you  have  chosen  to  grow  with  who 
 you  utterly  trust  there's  a  metric  like
[06:18] a  question  to  ask  yourself  I  got  from 
 the  YouTuber  and  entrepreneur  Alexa 
 Mosey  to  ask  yourself  if  this  is  a  real
[06:23] friend  it's  a  weird  example  but  and 
 hopefully  it  doesn't  sound  like 
 offensive  but  this  is  what  this 
 entrepreneur  said  if  you  were  Jewish  and
[06:29] this  was  back  in  the  Holocaust  what  did 
 this  guy  that  you  consider  your  friend 
 your  brother  would  he  hide  you  from  the
[06:34] Nazis  knowing  that  he  would  also  be 
 killed  if  he  like  was  found  out  that's 
 the  metric  that  my  best  friend  My
[06:39] Brother  Sam  has  like  asked  himself  about 
 me  like  if  he  was  Jewish  and  the  Nazis 
 were  coming  to  try  and  find  it  would  I
[06:44] hide  him  yes  that's  the  kind  of  metric 
 that  you'll  know  that  oh  [ __ ]  it  this  is 
 like  a  guy  that  I  can  trust  that's  the
[06:49] guy  that  you  can  be  emotional  to  that's 
 the  guy  that  you  can  cry  in  front  of 
 that's  the  guy  that  you  could  open  up 
 with  the  evil  propaganda  that's  being
[06:55] spread  to  young  men  these  days  and 
 telling  you  to  open  up  to  your 
 girlfriends  people  don't  realize  how
[07:00] [ __ ]  evil  that  is  bro  and  I  seem  like 
 a  bad  guy  for  saying  this  I  seem  really 
 toxically  masculine  for  telling  you  not 
 to  open  up  bro  if  you  open  up  to  your
[07:06] girlfriend  her  sexual  attraction  to  you 
 is  going  to  be  lost  because  if  she  is  a 
 feminine  woman  and  we  can't  blame  her
[07:11] for  this  but  if  she  is  feminine  she 
 cannot  be  attracted  to  a  masculine  man 
 who  has  just  suddenly  lost  friend  and
[07:16] become  feminine  if  she's  a  feminine 
 woman  right  if  she's  really  masculine 
 and  she's  very  dominant  to  herself  then 
 she  expects  you  to  be  weak  and  feminine
[07:22] okay  fine  but  if  she's  a  feminine  woman 
 and  you're  a  masculine  man  by  you  losing 
 Friend  by  you  getting  emotional  you  have 
 shown  that  you're  a  weak  feminine  women
[07:28] are  only  attracted  to  men  who  are  like 
 stoic  cold  rocks  even  though  they  don't 
 want  to  admit  this  a  lot  of  women  will
[07:33] tell  you  oh  I'm  not  attracted  to  this  I 
 love  it  when  my  partner  opens  up  that 
 woman's  probably  a  lot  more  masculine 
 and  we  might  not  be  attracted  to  a  girl
[07:38] like  that  there  is  an  agenda  here  you 
 know  the  people  I'm  talking  about  those 
 kinds  of  people  the  skinny  neck  kind  of
[07:43] like  low  testosterone  kind  of  people 
 right  men  and  women  they're  against 
 people  like  us  and  especially  like  me
[07:48] you  know  who's  got  like  this  platform  or 
 for  telling  you  to  not  be  emotional 
 because  they  will  say  that  me  telling 
 you  to  be  stoic  is  toxic  masculinity  and
[07:54] it's  patriarchal  and  it  leads  to 
 suicides  that's  what  they  say  right  but 
 they  don't  realize  that  the  rise  of  this
[08:00] message  of  telling  men  to  open  up 
 perfectly  correlates  with  the  rise  of 
 male  suicides  less  men  killed  themselves
[08:06] when  we  were  masculine  less  men  kill 
 themselves  before  we  were  told  this 
 message  of  opening  up  and  being  feminine
[08:11] you  know  why  so  many  [ __ ]  guys  are 
 killing  themselves  because  they're 
 falling  for  this  this  trap  this  [ __ ]
[08:16] trick  they're  being  convinced  to  not  be 
 masculine  to  be  feminine  and  be  in  touch 
 with  your  emotions  it's  okay  to  be  weak
[08:21] it's  okay  to  be  like  to  cry  and  [ __ ] 
 they're  following  that  advice  and  then 
 realizing  oh  [ __ ]  women  don't  like  me
[08:26] anymore  oh  [ __ ]  I'm  lonely  as  [ __ ]  oh 
 [ __ ]  I'm  broke  as  [ __ ]  I'm  not  making 
 any  money  now  because  I'm  emotional  mind
[08:31] an  emotional  man  don't  make  much  money 
 the  rise  of  this  message  being  spread  to 
 men  perfectly  correlates  with  the  rise
[08:37] of  suicides  people  don't  realize  how 
 [ __ ]  manipulative  and  evil  this  is 
 that  I  am  seen  as  the  bad  guy  for
[08:42] telling  you  to  be  stoic  when  men  were 
 more  stoic  and  more  masculine  back  in 
 the  1900s  suicide  was  less  common  I  want
[08:48] you  to  just  picture  that  male  suicide  is 
 at  an  all-time  high  and  so  is  this 
 message  of  men  being  weak  men  should  be
[08:53] feminine  men  should  be  emotional  they 
 perfectly  correlate  together  and  these 
 evil  people  will  blame  us  and  say  it's
[08:59] the  patriarchy  these  people  are  killing 
 men  you  know  these  like  hip  socialist 
 type  of  like  diversity  type  of  people
[09:05] right  they're  leading  to  men  kill 
 themselves  and  they  will  say  that  the 
 problem  is  us  because  we  want  to
[09:10] research  stoicism  now  I've  just  spent 
 the  last  few  minutes  ranting  and  raving 
 about  how  the  system  and  you  know  most
[09:15] people  are  against  men  like  us  who  want 
 to  become  all  masculine  and  strong  and 
 it's  so  [ __ ]  weird  but  why  look  what
[09:20] I've  just  done  I  was  just  about  to  say 
 it's  so  weird  like  why  are  they  against 
 us  you  know  we  just  want  to  be  muscular 
 so  do  you  know  what  this  third  habit
[09:25] that  we're  going  to  discuss  is  being  a 
 victim  and  complaining  it's  so  easy  for 
 us  right  now  to  think  yeah  the  world
[09:30] against  us  and  like  yes  so  life's  so 
 hard  guys  did  you  want  an  easy  life  bro 
 of  course  you  didn't  because  I  mean  the
[09:36] opportunity  for  an  easy  life  is  right 
 here  isn't  it  go  uh  scroll  on  Tick  Tock 
 bro  if  you're  watching  this  video  you 
 don't  want  an  easy  life  following  on
[09:41] from  that  you  must  understand  that  you 
 can't  have  this  identity  of  a  victim 
 when  some  [ __ ]  happens  to  us  like  What's
[09:46] Happening  Here  I  told  you  about  that 
 story  of  like  the  company  skillshare 
 destroying  like  oh  half  of  our  income
[09:51] and  it's  a  whole  story  like  there's  a 
 community  post  on  our  channel  that  you 
 can  go  and  see  if  you  want  we  could  have
[09:56] been  the  victim  here  we  could  have  seen 
 ourselves  as  like  oh  you  know  poor  us 
 like  woe  is  me  that  wouldn't  have  helped
[10:01] us  this  thing  is  not  only  does  it  help 
 you  but  quite  frankly  yeah  you  could  say 
 this  is  toxically  masculine  but  quite 
 frankly  about  men  who  have  this  victim
[10:07] mentality  they're  [ __ ]  they're  not 
 helpful  at  all  I  sound  [ __ ]  horrible 
 because  this  is  so  against  the  modern 
 day  but  like  bro  men  who  have  this
[10:13] victim  feminine  weak  emotional  mentality 
 there's  no  good  to  having  them  around  as
[10:18] a  man  like  your  only  value  comes  in  your 
 strength  that's  it  that's  it  as  a  woman 
 you  know  like  we  don't  expect  most  women 
 to  be  strong  if  the  women  want  to  be
[10:24] masculine  and  disciplined  and  you  know 
 climb  up  the  career  hierarchy  okay  fine 
 nice  a  weak  woman  isn't  seen  as  a  bad
[10:29] thing  is  it  if  a  woman  is  weak 
 physically  and  you  know  straight  like 
 men  even  mentally  you  know  she  gets 
 emotional  like  we  still  love  her  for  it
[10:34] if  anything  that's  actually  kind  of 
 attractive  like  some  guys  might  not  be 
 because  some  a  lot  of  guys  are  quite 
 feminine  so  they  don't  want  a  feminine
[10:39] woman  but  if  you're  a  masculine  man  and 
 you  have  this  idea  of  like  an  emotional 
 woman  who  always  cries  it's  like  that's 
 why  I  wanted  in  my  life  because  she's 
 emotional  like  that's  that's  the  point  I
[10:45] have  a  [ __ ]  Stone  Cold  like  I 
 have  some  emotions  obviously  but  like  I 
 like  that  my  girl's  emotional  all  the
[10:50] time  I  like  that  every  like  three  days 
 she  feels  sad  like  because  it  just  gives 
 us  some  [ __ ]  to  do  bro  like  so  you  know
[10:55] a  woman  who's  emotional  who's  weak  and 
 who's  a  victim  okay  fine  as  masculine 
 men  will  look  after  her  a  woman  who's
[11:00] strong  sweet  okay  you'll  help  us  carry 
 the  weight  a  man  who's  strong  okay 
 fantastic  that's  the  best  thing  that  we 
 need  for  a  strong  Society  fine  but  a
[11:05] weak  man  a  man  who  sees  himself  as  the 
 victim  a  man  who  has  this  victim 
 mentality  what  good  is  he  honestly  you
[11:11] must  understand  this  as  a  manual  value 
 comes  from  your  strength  and  in  the 
 modern  day  again  another  thing  that's
[11:16] going  to  get  me  canceled  maybe  like  in 
 the  modern  day  bro  there's  so  many  like 
 groups  of  people  who  love  to  act  like
[11:21] they're  oppressed  people  of  of  my  race 
 and  like  this  might  get  me  hated  but  bro 
 you're  not  oppressed  anymore  I  don't
[11:26] know  how  much  I  can  talk  because 
 obviously  like  this  is  like  risk  of 
 getting  canceled  but  essentially  you 
 know  the  minority  kind  of  people  not
[11:31] just  like  the  skin  color  but  just  you 
 know  the  people  who  who  act  like  they're 
 oppressed  the  people  who  act  like 
 everything's  against  them  that  you  know
[11:37] like  oh  everyone's  like  racist 
 everyone's  sexist  everyone  wants  this 
 everyone's  this  everyone's  this  not 
 really  no  one  really  gives  a  [ __ ]  about
[11:42] you  and  I  don't  even  say  that  as  an 
 insult  no  one  really  thinks  about  you 
 everyone's  thinking  about themselves  if 
 you  think  you're  oppressed  by  someone
[11:47] bro  you're  not  this  is  why  I've  got 
 respect  for  men  like  Kanye  he's  actually 
 saying  to  black  people  to  rise  up  and
[11:52] ditch  this  victim  mentality  and  this 
 isn't  me  saying  it  like  you  know  I'm  not 
 part  of  this  race  okay  fine  but  it's 
 nice  seeing  a  man  who's  just  like  yeah
[11:57] take  ownership  like  your  life's  better 
 than  you  actually  realize  and  like  this 
 is  his  words  I'm  not  gonna  [ __ ]  say 
 it  because  oh  yeah  I'm  just  being  racist
[12:03] like  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  we  live  in 
 physically  the  best  time  possible  the 
 only  thing  that's  actually  negative
[12:08] right  now  is  just  our  own  mental  health 
 and  guess  why  your  mental  health  is  [ __ ] 
 it's  because  of  your  own  thoughts  and
[12:13] beliefs  about  what's  happening  to  you 
 you  know  there's  studies  to  prove  that 
 what  you  believe  deeply  changes  what
[12:19] actually  happens  to  you  if  there's  two 
 men  who  are  deeply  stressed  right  now 
 hugely  stressed  but  one  of  them  likes
[12:24] the  stress  like  he  has  this  belief  like 
 yeah  like  stress  stress  is  good  like  it 
 really  helps  me  like  you  know  I  really 
 do  good  work  when  I'm  stressed  and  the
[12:29] other  one's  like  oh  I'm  stress  so 
 stresses  stress  leads  to  early  death  and 
 stress  leads  to  bad  Health  you  do
[12:35] realize  the  effect  of  stress  will 
 actually  change  depending  on  what  these 
 men  believe  about  that  the  effect  of  any
[12:40] kind  of  Oppression  or  problem  that 
 you're  going  through  is  only  based  on 
 your  own  beliefs  about  the  thing  and  no
[12:46] one  will  believe  this  you  choose  if  you 
 want  to  experience  suffering  most  men 
 are  too  emotional  to  have  this  like 
 victim  mindset  where  they  think  that
[12:52] this  is  like  a  toxic  or  some  [ __ ]  you 
 choose  how  you  feel  about  anything  as  a 
 man  that's  one  of  our  greatest  treasures 
 it's  our  greatest  strength  we  can  choose
[12:58] to  feel  angry  if  you're  constantly  over 
 stimulating  yourself  you  don't  have  this 
 superpower  but  when  you  spend  a  week 
 away  from  technology  you  can  choose  what
[13:04] you  want  to  feel  I  can  literally  just 
 turn  on  my  anger  right  now  and  I  can 
 turn  it  off  I  can  choose  what  I  want  to
[13:09] feel  so  why  choose  to  be  a  victim  why 
 choose  to  like  pretend  like  your  power's 
 been  Stripped  Away  from  you  it's  our
[13:14] greatest  superpower  it's  just  choosing 
 your  own  feelings  you  need  to  like 
 there's  some  prerequisites  to  this  you 
 have  to  meditate  for  a  couple  of  weeks
[13:19] okay  fine  it's  like  one  hour  of  time 
 over  a  couple  of  weeks  you  have  to  take 
 a  step  back  from  anything  that's  [ __ ]
[13:24] up  your  attention  span  like  Tick  Tock 
 and  still  getting  fine  but  after  that 
 like  our  superpowers  literally  being 
 able  to  not  be  a  victim  a  man  with  a
[13:30] core  like  masculine  energy  could  be 
 imprisoned  and  like  shut  away  in  solid 
 food  and  still  be  having  like  an  okay
[13:35] time  because  he  didn't  see  himself  as 
 the  victim  in  the  stories  of  this 
 there's  this  one  man  I  don't  know  his
[13:40] name  he  was  a  black  boxer  in  the  1900s 
 in  prison  for  something  that  he  didn't 
 do  he  went  into  the  the  prison  cell
[13:45] whatever  like  get  arrested  essentially 
 like  with  a  [ __ ]  five  thousand  dollar 
 watch  and  everything  I  literally  said  to 
 them  like  you  can  put  me  in  prison  but
[13:50] you  can't  change  what's  in  my  mind  and 
 he  became  the  most  successful  of  his 
 life  while  still  in  prison  he  chose  not
[13:56] to  be  a  victim  about  it  and  nowadays 
 everyone's  oppressed  everyone's  um 
 triggered  the  fourth  dangerous  habit
[14:01] that  will  mentally  destroy  you  literally 
 is  negative  thinking  and  this  is 
 something  that  so  many  young  men
[14:06] struggle  from  because  your  mind  can 
 sometimes  be  your  worst  enemy  especially
[14:11] when  you  aren't  living  the  kind  of  life 
 that  you  know  that  you  should  you  can 
 have  such  deep  dark  negative  thoughts
[14:17] and  this  can  even  go  into  like  this 
 weird  complex  level  where  if  you've 
 started  to  research  more  about
[14:22] meditation  and  everything  and  also  you 
 know  you've  learned  about  positive 
 thinking  negative  thinking  you  start  to 
 have  negative  thoughts  about  your
[14:27] negative  thoughts  and  it  creates  like 
 this  very  [ __ ]  cycle  where  you  just 
 can't  constantly  just  like  being  a  bully
[14:32] in  your  own  mind  and  so  this  is  a  habit 
 because  it  happens  like  just  throughout 
 the  day  and  often  it  happens  when  you
[14:37] know  you  think  about  your  lack  of 
 success  your  lack  of  your  attraction 
 from  girls  or  something  like  that  you 
 think  about  something  negative  and  your
[14:42] mind  just  starts  breaking  you  and  so 
 many  guys  who  experience  this  don't 
 actually  realize  that  you  can  control
[14:47] your  thoughts  a  lot  easier  than  it  seems 
 fighting  your  thoughts  is  a  horrible 
 idea  honestly  I'm  going  to  tell  you  some
[14:52] minor  I've  had  the  thoughts  like  oh 
 maybe  I  should  just  kill  myself  I've  had 
 that  thought  before  not  recently  but
[14:57] like  a  while  ago  a  couple  of  years  ago  I 
 used  to  have  that  thought  quite  often 
 and  I  did  the  wrong  thing  and  I  would 
 fight  that  thought  and  I'd  be  like  well
[15:03] why  did  I  just  say  that  so  [ __ ]  oh  no  I 
 don't  wanna  I  start  fighting  it  and  it 
 just  created  chaos  in  my  own  mind  and  I
[15:08] just  wanted  to  [ __ ]  shut  it  off  and 
 that's  why  I  number  myself  with  weed 
 porn  video  games  and  junk  food  and  you
[15:13] know  I  just  wanted  to  over  indulge  and 
 [ __ ]  to  not  think  about  that  what  I 
 should  have  done  at  the  time  was  more  so
[15:18] just  observe  the  thought  and  realize 
 that  my  thought  wasn't  me  that  me
[15:23] thinking  this  weird  thought  of  like 
 considering  suicide  it  wasn't  me  talking
[15:28] and  just  see  it  more  as  like  a  cloud 
 that  passing  through  the  sky  you  know 
 the  thought's  going  to  appear  and  go
[15:33] away  just  like  a  cloud  is  and  when  you 
 meditate  you  start  to  understand  that 
 like  thoughts  are  not  a  reflection  of
[15:38] who  you  are  there's  simply  like  some 
 just  random  [ __ ]  that  just  like  happens 
 in  your  mind  and  the  skill  of  meditation
[15:44] is  observing  the  thought  and  realizing 
 that  the  thought  is  an  entity  by  itself 
 it's  not  you  you're  the  person  who
[15:50] watches  the  clouds  you're  the  person  who 
 hears  the  thought  you're  not  the  thought 
 the  person  who  hears  the  thoughts  and  so
[15:55] next  time  when  you  get  like  this  kind  of 
 negative  thought  barrage  or  like  this 
 bully  thoughts  in  your  mind  which  just
[16:01] make  you  feel  [ __ ]  about  yourself  don't 
 fight  them  don't  argue  against  those 
 thoughts  don't  try  and  convince  them 
 that  they're  untrue  observe  them  like  a
[16:07] cloud  appearing  and  going  away  and  just 
 think  to  yourself  that  yep  in  this 
 period  of  your  life  a  lot  of  clouds  are
[16:12] going  to  be  shaped  like  this  and  that's 
 okay  because  it  happens  but  if  you  keep 
 staying  on  yourself  improvements  and 
 eventually  you  build  up  so  many  things
[16:17] that  you're  proud  of  you're  gonna 
 realize  that  all  of  the  clouds  that 
 start  to  appear  naturally  in  your  own 
 brain  starts  to  become  so  much  more
[16:23] positive  when  you've  built  so  much  more 
 like  muscle  and  you've  lost  fat  and  you 
 actually  look  physically  good  like  you 
 know  you  look  like  you're  an  athlete  you
[16:29] look  in  shape  you've  been  going  to  the 
 gym  you  can  can't  help  but  like  just  get 
 like  an  awesome  like  almost  a  cringe 
 positive  thought  in  your  mind  like  yeah
[16:34] like  I'm  I'm  a  beast  you  know  it's  kind 
 of  cringe  but  like  it's  a  lot  nicer  to 
 hear  than  yeah  you  should  kill  yourself 
 and  then  you  work  really  really  hard  you
[16:40] study  really  hard  and  you  get  like  an 
 awesome  grade  that  your  parents  are 
 proud  of  and  you're  proud  of  too  well  in 
 your  mind  you're  saying  like  yes  yes
[16:45] amazing  yes  yeah  I'm  so  [ __ ]  sick  yes 
 you  can  control  your  thoughts  with  your 
 actions  and  too  many  guys  just  feel  like
[16:52] the  negative  thoughts  and  they  just  kind 
 of  don't  do  anything  about  it  and  then 
 the  negative  thoughts  just  keep  coming 
 your  thoughts  honestly  are  often  a
[16:58] little  bit  of  a  reflection  of  where  you 
 are  in  life  if  you're  doing  really  [ __ ] 
 right  now  chances  are  your  thoughts  are
[17:03] gonna  be  negative  if  you're  doing 
 awesome  right  now  chances  are  your 
 thoughts  are  going  to  be  positive  and  as 
 long  as  you  know  how  to  control  them  and 
 observe  them  then  it  won't  hurt  you  the
[17:09] same  way  that  it  does  for  everyone  else 
 and  the  fifth  bad  habit  that  will  really 
 mess  you  up  mentally  is  indecisiveness
[17:14] indecisiveness  is  when  you've  got  a 
 decision  to  make  like  should  you  move 
 should  you  break  up  with  this  girl
[17:19] should  you  do  this  should  you  do  that 
 and  you  often  just  keep  playing  around 
 the  options  in  your  mind  without  ever
[17:24] actually  coming  to  a  good  decision  and 
 taking  action  which  means  that  your  mind 
 gets  stuck  in  this  weird  Loop  like  this 
 negative  cycle  which  is  so  many
[17:30] demanding  like  you  probably  know  this  a 
 phrase  called  decision  fatigue  and 
 that's  when  you  know  you've  got  to  make
[17:35] decisions  and  your  mind  just  gets  that 
 kind  of  weakened  by  doing  that  but  when 
 you're  indecisive  you're  getting
[17:40] decision  fatigue  like  around  the  clock 
 and  it's  literally  fatiguing  so  I've  had 
 this  before  previously  I  remember  there
[17:45] was  a  girl  that  I  was  dating  that  I  was 
 indecisive  about  wanting  to  break  up 
 with  it  like  I  wanted  to  but  I  didn't
[17:50] want  to  go  through  the  breakup  feeling 
 and  everything  and  I  carry  that 
 relationship  on  for  years  imagine  years
[17:55] of  indecisiveness  years  of  decision 
 fatigue  where  almost  every  single  day  in
[18:01] your  mind  you're  thinking  should  I  break 
 up  with  her  or  not  worst  period  of  my 
 life  indecisiveness  is  it's  like  a  weird
[18:06] habit  isn't  it  because  you  know  you  were 
 probably  expecting  me  to  just  say  like 
 oh  video  games  and  you  know  like  normal 
 worldly  things  but  this  is  the  one  that
[18:12] I  think  is  quite  unique  and  it's 
 something  that  I've  experienced  myself 
 but  I'm  not  very  good  at  making 
 decisions  generally  like  you  know  I  want
[18:18] to  be  better  with  that  and  so  often  like 
 it's  really  nice  that  I've  got  a  friend 
 who  helps  me  with  this  but 
 indecisiveness  will  kill  your  momentum
[18:24] messes  you  up  mentally  give  you  decision 
 fatigue  and  everything  it's  not  a  good 
 thing  man  so  how  do  you  solve  it  well
[18:29] the  best  strategy  to  make  it  is  to  write 
 it  all  down  and  it's  so  much  better  I
[18:34] know  this  is  going  to  seem  weirdly 
 practical  but  I  promise  you  it's  so  much 
 better  to  write  it  on  paper  with  the  pen 
 than  it  is  to  write  it  on  a  PC  just
[18:40] write  it  on  a  paper  and  writing  all  of 
 the  decisions  and  the  facts  and 
 everything  that's  related  to  the 
 decision  just  makes  it  so  much  clearer
[18:46] and  suddenly  it's  like  you've  made  the 
 problem  so  specific  that  now  you  can 
 actually  choose  the  best  decision  to  go
[18:52] for  usually  when  it's  all  in  your  mind 
 your  brain  and  your  thoughts  is  all 
 muddled  up  that  you  can't  even  make  a 
 good  decision  you  settle  on  one  but  then
[18:58] you  bounce  back  because  your  brain 
 changes  and  you  know  your  feelings 
 dictate  your  decision  making  which  isn't
[19:03] a  good  thing  we  don't  want  to  be  like 
 that  at  all  when  you  write  it  all  out  to 
 paper  and  you  write  down  the  cold  hard 
 logical  analytical  facts  of  the
[19:09] situation  Suddenly  It's  like  you  have  so 
 much  more  ammunition  to  help  you  make 
 this  decision  scroll  down  to  the
[19:14] description  right  now  and  go  click  on 
 that  link  for  the  three  bedroom  mistakes 
 that  you're  making  click  and  watch  this 
 video  right  now  do  the  hard  work
[19:19] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
