[00:00] jeffrey  hates  girls  why  wouldn't  he  they 
 hate  him  too  they  are  the  enemy  guys 
 they're  they're  all  hoes  and  we  should
[00:05] just  [ __ ]  them  and  throw  them  out  to  the 
 streets 
 they  do  the  same  to  you  if  you're  under 
 six  foot  tall  no  it's  not  my  personality
[00:12] i  have  an  awesome  personality  girls 
 don't  like  me  just  because  i'm  not  rich 
 or  six  foot  four  younger  hamza  was  fed
[00:17] up  of  not  having  a  girlfriend  one  of  his 
 friends  had  one  he  wanted  one  too  and  so 
 he  had  the  choice  be  better  or  be  bitter
[00:23] and  he  chose  better  he  started  going  to 
 the  gym  going  out  to  clubs  and  parties 
 and  going  on  tinder  and  instagram  and  he
[00:28] actually  started  getting  more  attention 
 soon  enough  hamza  got  himself  a 
 girlfriend  yay  but  they  broke  up  no  but
[00:34] younger  hamster  became  a  degenerate  and 
 started  getting  more  girls  than  ever  yay 
 he  learns  pickup  and  game  and  went  out
[00:39] to  nightclubs  three  times  a  week  and 
 started  consistently  hooking  up  with 
 girls  but  all  this  effort  all  this  time
[00:44] all  of  the  bad  habits  that  were  coupled 
 with  this  late  night  alcohol  and  drugs 
 and  low  quality  friends  if  only  he  knew
[00:50] that  there  was  a  better  way  adonis 
 adonis  has  no  trouble  attracting  women 
 sure  he's  made  some  mistakes  when  he  was
[00:56] younger  but  he  quickly  learned  that  the 
 best  way  to  get  girls  was  not  by 
 following  the  advice  of  everyone  else
[01:01] adonis  witnessed  the  jeffrey  uprising  he 
 saw  the  masses  spend  their  lives  on 
 social  media  he  looked  in  shame  at  the
[01:06] degenerates  in  the  dirty  nightclubs  he 
 wondered  why  so  few  men  attract  women  in 
 the  right  way  looking  [ __ ]  a  huge  cut
[01:13] porn  has  conditioned  young  men  that  they 
 can  have  it  all  that  you  don't  need  to 
 put  in  the  work  into  your  looks  your 
 money  your  lifestyle  you  can  just  hop  on
[01:19] your  favorite  website  find  millions  of 
 girls  who  want  to  [ __ ]  you  straight  away 
 and  so  we  need  to  recalibrate  our  minds
[01:24] because  you  have  to  understand  as  a 
 young  man  you're  not  really  supposed  to 
 be  attracting  women  right  now  you're 
 young  and  women  date  upwards  and  as  men
[01:30] it's  usually  easier  for  us  to  date  a 
 girl  who's  a  few  years  younger  than  us 
 because  let's  say  when  you're  16  years
[01:35] old  and  there's  a  16  year  old  girl  in 
 your  class  who  you're  attracted  to  well 
 the  chances  are  that  she  likes  a  17  or
[01:40] 18  year  old  guy  why  well  think  about 
 what  our  attractiveness  is  based  on  it's
[01:45] confidence  looks  gym  money  status 
 lifestyle  and  all  of  those  things  come 
 with  time  and  so  the  18  year  old  that
[01:51] your  princess  likes  probably  drives  a 
 car  has  a  better  life  than  you  he's 
 probably  got  more  muscle  from  the  gym 
 than  you  probably  has  more  money  than
[01:56] you  more  social  and  sexual  experiences 
 and  he's  all  around  just  more  confidence 
 and  this  shouldn't  depress  you  it  should
[02:01] give  you  hope  dating  is  supposed  to  take 
 time  for  men  and  so  how  do  you  actually 
 get  girls  do  your  thing  and  let  them
[02:06] come  focus  on  building  your  life  first 
 focus  entirely  on  hitting  these  six 
 milestones  and  you'll  find  that  women
[02:11] will  naturally  enter  your  life  without 
 much  effort  from  you  one  go  to  the  gym 
 lift  weights  build  muscle  okay  you  could
[02:16] be  exercising  for  sport  fantastic  but 
 specifically  you  need  to  be  building  an 
 aesthetic  muscular  body  i've  put  the
[02:21] workout  routines  that  i  recommend  in  the 
 description  for  free  start  a  good  career 
 or  business  now  this  potentially  could
[02:26] mean  studying  and  getting  a  degree  it 
 could  mean  becoming  an  entrepreneur  and 
 trying  some  business  ideas  have  a
[02:31] vibrant  social  circle  and  this  is 
 probably  one  of  the  most  important 
 milestones  for  young  men  to  actually  get 
 some  girls  because  if  you  come  home  from
[02:37] school  and  you  spend  your  entire  time 
 watching  my  videos  and  just  like  sat 
 there  on  across  the  computer  eating  your 
 food  whilst  on  your  computer  you're  not
[02:43] gonna  attract  girls  because  girls  won't 
 want  to  enter  your  life  they  want  to 
 enter  the  life  of  a  man  who's  actually 
 having  fun  of  course  they  do  like  what
[02:48] date  could  you  even  take  her  out  on  if 
 all  you  do  is  come  home  and  go  on  your 
 computer  and  the  vibrant  social  circle
[02:53] is  just  so  important  for  your  own  life 
 and  your  own  development  and  having 
 friends  that  you  can  rely  on  you  can  all
[02:58] like  lift  weights  together  and  go  to 
 parties  together  the  fourth  thing  you 
 should  work  on  is  confidence  and 
 confidence  is  kind  of  like  a  weird
[03:03] concept  that  we  all  want  it  but  we  don't 
 really  know  exactly  what  it  is  or  how  to 
 get  it  it's  literally  a  skill  that  you
[03:08] can  level  up  and  the  way  that  we  level 
 up  skills  is  that  we  literally  just  go 
 search  online  for  books  or  methods  on
[03:14] that  skill  we  read  the  book  we  learn 
 about  how  to  like  improve  your 
 confidence  we  go  out  there  and  practice 
 and  it's  a  bit  awkward  but  we  get  better
[03:19] and  better  over  time  the  confidence  gap 
 is  the  book  that  i'm  reading  the  fifth 
 and  very  important  milestone  to  focus  on
[03:25] instead  of  focusing  on  girls  focus  on 
 this  is  to  make  sure  that  you  have  no 
 mental  health  issues  that's  social 
 anxiety  and  depression  so  many  young
[03:31] guys  have  like  way  bigger  problems  than 
 a  lack  of  girls  in  their  lives  they've 
 literally  got  depression  they've  got 
 anxiety  but  they  focus  on  the  wrong
[03:37] thing  depres  like 
 honestly  it  sounds  horrible  but 
 depression  makes  you  ugly  anxiety  makes
[03:42] you  it's  just  how  it  works  you  could  be 
 like  an  attractive  guy  but  if  you  have 
 anxiety  you're  not  going  to  end  up 
 showing  yourself  to  the  real  world  if
[03:47] you  truly  have  depression  right  now  and 
 you're  not  trying  to  solve  it  in  any  way 
 you're  not  getting  therapy  for  it  or 
 you're  not  at  least  like  doing  some
[03:52] healthy  practices  like  eating  right  and 
 exercise  and  sleeping  more  then  you're 
 gonna  be  literally  just  a  downer  to  be
[03:57] around  and  i  know  that  this  sounds  quite 
 insensitive  but  this  is  coming  from 
 someone  who  had  pretty  severe  anxiety
[04:02] and  i  can't  believe  that  people  wanted 
 to  like  some  people  stayed  around  me  it 
 was  so  common  for  a  girl  and  even  like
[04:07] guys  to  get  around  me  no  it's  not  you 
 know  there's  something  wrong  with  me  i'm 
 anxious  all  the  time  i'm  uncomfortable
[04:12] about  stuff  and  then  they  just  slowly 
 like  start  like  you  know  getting  away 
 from  it  because  you  don't  really  want  to 
 be  around  someone  like  that  and  the  six
[04:18] milestone  to  work  on  is  to  learn  some 
 games  and  pick  up  and  some  red  pill 
 fundamentals  you  can  definitely  overdo
[04:23] it  with  this  one  you  can  become  like  a 
 full-on  red  pill  to  generate  full-on 
 like  pick-up  artist  who  goes  they  gave 
 in  and  [ __ ]  but  just  reading  maybe  a
[04:29] couple  of  the  books  watching  a  couple  of 
 the  youtube  videos  but  like  keep  like  a 
 distance  from  this  community  you  don't 
 want  to  get  like  too  like  drawn  into  it
[04:35] like  i  did  you  don't  want  to  dive  deep 
 into  it  but  if  you  can  understand  some 
 of  the  fundamentals  of  game  and  red  pill 
 for  example  push  and  pull  and
[04:41] demonstrating  high  value  that'll  be  very 
 very  helpful  for  you  these  are  things 
 that  normal  healthy  men  do  just
[04:46] naturally  but  us  cave  dwellers  on  our 
 internet  and  you  know  our  technology  we 
 kind  of  forgotten  how  to  do  it  and  so
[04:51] for  example  the  red  pill  and  some  game 
 stuff  will  teach  you  how  to  stop  being 
 creepy  and  needy  and  in  fact  that's  an
[04:56] article  by  this  guy  i  don't  know  how  you 
 pronounce 
 something  but  i'll  link  it  below  to  like 
 a  [ __ ]  big  ass  article  but  that's
[05:01] like  this  is  a  guy  from  the  red  pill 
 spirit  who's  made  a  fantastic  guide  how 
 to  stop  being  creepy  and  needy  and 
 that's  something  that  you'd  hugely
[05:07] benefit  from  because  you  are  a  [ __ ] 
 creep 
 and  that  right  there  is  the  framework  to 
 actually  get  girls  focus  on  these  six
[05:13] things  and  just  enjoy  the  women  who 
 really  want  to  enter  your  life  the  women 
 who  don't  want  to  enter  your  life  the
[05:18] women  that  you  have  to  run  after  they 
 should  be  invisible  to  you  because 
 instead  of  focusing  on  those  girls 
 you're  going  to  focus  on  these  six
[05:23] milestones  and  you  might  say 
 how  am  i  supposed  to  attract  girls  if 
 i'm  focused  on  something  else  and  that
[05:28] shows  me  that  you  don't  go  outside  much 
 because  girls  who  are  into  you  girls  who 
 are  attracted  to  you  they  make  it 
 obvious  they're  literally  like
[05:34] they'll  look  at  you  you'll  catch  them 
 looking  at  you  like  three  times  they'll 
 smile  they'll  follow  you  on  instagram 
 they'll  start  liking  your  pictures  now
[05:39] the  point  of  the  six  milestones  was  to 
 give  you  something  to  focus  on  above 
 women  and  the  sixth  milestone  teaches
[05:44] you  what  to  do  when  women  show  a  bit  of 
 interest  to  you  attracting  girls  is 
 about  attracting  pull  pull  don't  push
[05:51] don't  go  after  girls  let  them  gravitate 
 towards  you  be  a  magnet  not  a  repellent
[05:56] like  most  young  guys  do  your  thing  and 
 let  them  come  and  to  be  honest  you  do 
 need  to  know  what  to  do  to  you  know  what
[06:01] once  they've  come  to  you  once  they've 
 made  themselves  obvious  they  gave  you  an 
 indicator  of  interest  you  do  need  to
[06:06] know  what  to  do  and  the  thing  is  you 
 know  i  could  break  down  loads  of  things 
 like  you  should  touch  her  this  way  and 
 look  at  it  this  way  one  of  the  things
[06:11] that  no  one  really  tells  young  guys  is 
 that  you  just  kind  of  need  experience 
 every  guy  has  messed  up  so  many  times
[06:16] with  a  bunch  of  girls  like  any  guy  who 
 actually  gets  girls  will  tell  you  that 
 he's  been  rejected  so  many  times  he  says
[06:21] stupid  stuff  before  he  started  before 
 he's  just  like  weirdly  looked  at  a  girl 
 he  felt  like  a  creep  every  guy  will  tell 
 you  that's  what  like  you  just  have  to  go
[06:27] through  the  trials  and  tribulations  you 
 just  need  more  experiences  with  girls 
 but  the  issue  is  that  those  experiences
[06:32] with  girls  for  some  guys  are  so  rare 
 that  when  it's  about  to  come  for  example 
 you've  got  a  date  and  you  haven't  had  a
[06:37] date  in  a  while  then  of  course  you  you 
 place  like  a  a  big  value  you  put  it  on 
 the  pedestal  okay  then  you  know  i've  got
[06:42] to  make  sure  that  the  date  goes  right 
 the  issue  is  by  caring  so  much  you  lower 
 your  chances  of  success  in  the  date  if
[06:48] you  wanted  to  like  do  well  on  the  dates 
 so  before  you  go  on  the  date  or  before 
 you  text  a  girl  back  you  go  onto  youtube
[06:53] for  your  favorite  red  pill  youtuber  and 
 like  watch  three  of  his  videos  first  and 
 so  instead  of  that  instead  of  trying  to
[06:58] reach  for  perfection  not  wanting  to  lose 
 this  opportunity  you  should  have  almost 
 like  a  meta  thought  where  you  kind  of 
 like  think  like  huh  guys  like  you  know
[07:03] i'm  young  right  now  and  it's  not 
 supposed  to  be  good  but  i'm  just  gonna 
 try  and  be  mindful  and  grateful  of  the 
 experience  this  is  the  only  framework  of
[07:10] getting  girls  which  isn't  a  degenerate 
 waste  of  time  going  out  to  approach 
 hundreds  of  girls  constantly  going  to
[07:15] parties  and  nightclubs  and  taking  drugs 
 and  like  staying  up  late  and  constantly 
 just  being  on  tinder  and  [ __ ]  up  your
[07:21] mental  health  and  instagram  honestly  all 
 of  those  are  discussed  in  ways  to  get 
 girls  like  it's  like  a  very  instant
[07:26] gratification-y  way  of  trying  to  get 
 girls  not  only  for  the  habits  that  you 
 get  into  with  that  lifestyle  where
[07:31] you're  staying  up  late  you're  eating 
 like  dirty  food  you're  constantly  just 
 messing  up  your  mental  health  and  you're 
 going  to  clubs  taking  drugs  but  also  for
[07:37] the  tier  of  women  that  you  attract  now 
 you  can  have  physical  intercourse  with  a
[07:42] woman  that  you  like  meet  in  the 
 nightclub  but  did  you  literally  just 
 mess  up  your  entire  sort  of  nighttime
[07:47] routine  give  yourself  sleep  deprivation 
 drink  take  drugs  to  have  x  minutes  of 
 instant  gratification  pleasure  was  it
[07:53] really  like  that  was  like  the  height  of 
 your  night  like  you'd  really  really 
 wanted  this  to  happen  every  three  nights
[07:58] out  four  or  five  nights  out  you  get  to 
 like  sleep  with  a  drone  girl  who  like 
 doesn't  even  like  know  you  or  like  you 
 and  you  don't  even  like  her  you're  just
[08:03] kind  of  using  each  other's  bodies  if 
 you've  ever  found  yourself  focusing  on  a 
 girl  you've  lost  move  on  find  a  girl
[08:08] who's  focusing  on  you  adonis  focuses  on 
 himself  girls  focus  on  adonis  and
[08:13] jeffrey  focuses  on  the  girls  pick  which 
 one  you  want  to  be  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
