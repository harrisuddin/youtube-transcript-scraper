[00:00] geoffrey  is  like  the  male  version  of  the 
 women  who  hates  all  men  he  hates  all 
 women  he  was  given  a  choice  to  be  better
[00:05] or  to  be  bitter  and  he  chose  to  be 
 bitter  jeffrey  jacks  off  to  the  girls 
 who  rejected  him  on  instagram  those
[00:10] [ __ ]  i  hate  them  they  can't  say  no  to 
 me  they  have  to  sleep  with  me  i  don't 
 care  if  that's  someone's  sister  or
[00:16] daughter  i  i  know  i'll  send  her  a  dick 
 pic  that'll  work  it  doesn't  work  jeffrey 
 is  the  type  of  guy  who  constantly  sends
[00:21] abusive  messages  to  your  girlfriend  or 
 your  sister  don't  be  like  jeffrey  when  i 
 was  a  little  younger  i  never  thought
[00:26] about  the  green  or  red  flags  to  look  out 
 for  i'm  not  gonna  lie  i  just  didn't  have
[00:31] standards  i  had  been  quite  unattractive 
 and  awkward  around  girls  that  when  i 
 finally  started  to  attract  some  women  i
[00:36] jumped  straight  in  but  this  is  a  huge 
 problem  that  a  lot  of  guys  face  you  have 
 to  have  respect  for  yourself  i'd
[00:42] literally  fall  in  love  with  girls  that  i 
 just  met  from  nightclubs  and  dirty 
 university  student  parties  let  me
[00:47] describe  these  parties  to  you  these 
 student  parties  just  so  you  know  what 
 kind  of  girl  i  was  meeting  as  well  as
[00:52] what  kind  of  guy  i  was  you  get  to  the 
 student  house  at  10  p.m  and  the  girl  who 
 invited  you  hugs  you  okay  so  far  so  good
[00:58] you  enter  the  kitchen  and  there's  around 
 12  people  here  straight  away  you  see  a 
 white  guy  smelling  his  keys  hmm  i  wonder
[01:04] why  he's  smelling  his  key  is  it  like  a 
 aftershave  thing  oh  there's  a  bunch  of 
 girls  here  and  they're  dressed  pretty
[01:09] [ __ ]  the  music  gets  louder  the  white 
 guys  are  dancing  to  house  music  the  one 
 black  guy  is  your  savior  he  doesn't  fit
[01:14] in  either  every  time  a  new  girl  comes  to 
 the  party  all  the  current  girls  scream 
 in  this  high  pitched  noise  oh  man  oh  my
[01:20] god  sarah  i  haven't  seen  you  since 
 yesterday  oh  did  you  get  the  cat  why  is
[01:25] everyone  smelling  their  keys 
 and  then  you  hear  it  that's  the  sound  of
[01:30] a  balloon  being  filled  up  with  laughing 
 gas  and  you  hear  the  metal  canister  fall 
 to  the  floor  it's  a  stampede  soon
[01:35] everyone  rushes  to  the  person  who's 
 handing  out  balloons  everyone's  his  best 
 friend  for  the  next  two  minutes  just
[01:40] like  everyone  becomes  your  friend  when 
 you  have  chewing  gum  in  school  you  make 
 eye  contact  with  one  of  the  girls  she'll 
 suck  your  dick  for  a  crumb  of  mdma  deal
[01:47] or  no  deal  that's  the  type  of  place  i 
 was  meeting  the  love  of  my  life  from 
 don't  make  the  same  mistake  as  me  bro
[01:53] understand  the  green  flags  of  high 
 quality  women  and  always  be  on  the 
 lookout  for  them  adonis  expects  only  the
[01:58] best  he  has  ultra  high  standards  for  the 
 women  who  enter  his  life  that  makes  him 
 even  more  attractive  but  it  wasn't
[02:04] always  like  that  adonis  thinks  back  to 
 his  early  adult  years  just  like  you  he 
 made  mistakes  he  didn't  have  the
[02:10] experience  or  the  wisdom  to  look  out  for 
 the  right  green  flags  but  over  time 
 adonis  became  a  fine  judge  of  character
[02:16] a  very  important  skill  indeed  knowing 
 what  green  flags  to  look  out  for  can 
 literally  save  you  years  of  your  life
[02:21] from  dating  the  wrong  girl  and  i  imagine 
 you  could  remember  a  bunch  of  these 
 green  flags  in  your  mind  you  could
[02:26] effortlessly  navigate  your  way  through 
 your  day  in  life  you'd  know  what  you 
 want  and  it's  so  important  for  young  men
[02:31] to  have  standards  you  all  seem  so 
 different  whilst  all  the  other  guys 
 ragdolled  themselves  at  girls  please
[02:36] please  please  just  a  crumb  of  [ __ ] 
 you'll  be  evaluating  her  just  like  she 
 is  with  you  you'll  be  taking  your  time
[02:42] you  won't  know  straight  away  whether  you 
 like  her  or  not  and  that  makes  you  so 
 much  more  attractive  to  girls  and  you
[02:47] might  be  thinking  right  now  that  this 
 isn't  that  important  because  you're  not 
 really  ready  to  start  dating  yet  fair 
 enough  focus  on  yourself  but  you  may  as
[02:53] well  keep  these  green  flags  in  mind  just 
 in  cases  you  come  across  any  women  green 
 flag  number  one  she  has  a  great
[02:58] relationship  with  her  father  her 
 relationship  with  her  father  is  almost 
 always  similar  to  her  relationship  with
[03:04] men  in  general  the  way  that  her  father 
 loved  her  as  a  child  is  the  same  type  of 
 love  that  she  craves  as  an  adult  so
[03:11] think  about  it  if  her  father  loved  her 
 in  a  healthy  happy  way  that's  what 
 she'll  want  from  you  but  if  her  father
[03:16] abused  her  or  if  her  father  left  the 
 home  generally  that's  similar  to  the 
 type  of  relationship  that  she  might  get
[03:21] into  as  an  adult  green  flag  number  two 
 her  parents  are  married  and  they're 
 still  in  a  loving  relationship  to  this
[03:27] day  marriage  in  the  modern  day  isn't  so 
 great  almost  like  half  of  marriages  end 
 in  divorce  but  if  her  parents  got
[03:33] together  like  20  years  ago  it's  a  really 
 good  sign  if  they're  still  married  and 
 they're  still  in  a  loving  relationship
[03:39] because  couples  can  stay  together  but 
 not  in  love  and  your  girl's 
 understanding  of  love  and  intimacy  comes
[03:44] from  her  parents  you  want  your  girl  to 
 have  seen  like  a  long  lasting  healthy 
 happy  love  green  flag  number  three  you
[03:50] see  a  lot  of  attractive  feminine  traits 
 in  her  mother  generally  if  you  wouldn't 
 date  her  mother  you  shouldn't  date  her
[03:56] most  people  end  up  very  similar  to  their 
 parents  that's  because  that's  how  they 
 were  raised  and  most  people  don't  go
[04:01] through  a  drastic  self-improvement 
 change  so  she  is  likely  to  end  up  pretty
[04:06] similar  to  how  her  mother  is  today  so 
 ask  yourself  would  you  date  her  mother 
 if  you  were  that  age  is  her  mother
[04:11] attractive  does  she  look  after  herself 
 by  going  to  the  gym  is  her  mother 
 feminine  is  she  intelligent  does  she
[04:16] read  books  and  does  she  grow  and  is  she 
 nice  is  she  a  kind  person  that's  an 
 awesome  sign  or  perhaps  is  her  mother
[04:21] undesirable  that's  not  a  great  sign 
 green  flag  number  four  and  an  obvious 
 one  she  has  a  nice  personality  ask
[04:26] yourself  is  this  a  kind  person  she  might 
 be  nice  to  you  right  now  but  see  how  she 
 interacts  with  other  people  is  she  rude
[04:32] to  some  people  does  she  gossip  about  her 
 friends  and  talk  badly  about  them 
 believe  me  when  i  say  that  she  will  do
[04:38] the  same  thing  to  you  or  does  she  talk 
 nicely  about  people  does  she  treat 
 everyone  with  respect  she'll  do  the  same
[04:43] to  you  green  flag  number  five  she's  had 
 none  or  very  limited  casual  sex
[04:48] experiences  the  number  of  hookups  that  a 
 girl  has  had  is  like  a  symptom  for  how 
 much  of  the  hugo  girl  blue  pill  feminist
[04:54] narrative  has  went  inside  of  her  most 
 men  find  that  unattractive  in  a  serious
[04:59] relationship  and  her  high  body  count 
 literally  increases  her  likelihood  to 
 cheat  on  you  or  to  split  up  if  she's  had
[05:04] a  very  limited  amount  of  casual  sex 
 experiences  like  hookups  and  one  night 
 stands  it  shows  that  she's  good  at
[05:10] delaying  gratification  also  that  she's 
 unlikely  to  have  spent  a  lot  of  time  in 
 like  the  low  quality  like  sex  orientated
[05:16] places  like  tinder  and  nightclubs  all 
 those  student  parties  that  we  just 
 talked  about  generally  if  she  has  a  low
[05:22] amount  of  hookups  she's  probably  come 
 from  a  pretty  good  family  with  great 
 values  green  flag  number  six  she  has
[05:27] high  quality  friends  if  her  friends 
 genuinely  seem  like  good  girls  that's  a
[05:32] huge  benefit  sometimes  you'll  date  a 
 girl  and  it  seems  like  her  friends  are 
 almost  like  a  threat  to  your 
 relationship  because  they're  always
[05:37] trying  to  like  encourage  her  to  do  bad 
 habits  she  of  course  has  to  be  very 
 similar  to  her  friends  to  be  friends
[05:43] with  them  if  her  friends  are  educated 
 with  great  values  that's  an  awesome  sign 
 if  they  seem  like  low-quality  party
[05:48] girls  who  take  a  lot  of  drugs  and  they 
 gossip  and  they're  quite  rude  and  they 
 cheat  on  their  boyfriends  what  does  that
[05:53] say  about  your  girl  not
