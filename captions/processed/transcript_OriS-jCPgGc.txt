[00:00] jeffrey  says  there's  nothing  wrong  with 
 fapping  it's  good  for  you  it  reduces 
 your  risk  of  prostate  cancer  just  trust
[00:05] me  and  watching  porn  increases  your  one 
 rep  max  in  the  gym  but  jeffrey  doesn't 
 even  go  to  the  gym  he  spends  his  days  in
[00:11] a  smelly  bedroom  he  loses  all  of  his 
 masculine  drive  and  now  he  has  no  energy 
 left  to  pursue  his  goals  instead  of
[00:17] putting  in  the  effort  to  work  out 
 jeffrey  levels  up  his  strength  skill  on 
 runescape  and  instead  of  trying  to
[00:22] improve  his  looks  and  his  confidence 
 jeffrey  ruins  it  by  adopting  the 
 self-image  of  being  a  fapper  that's  the
[00:27] life  of  most  men  make  sure  you're  not  in 
 this  group  i  discovered  nofap  around  six
[00:32] to  seven  years  ago  and  it  was  hype 
 everyone  was  telling  me  about  all  the 
 benefits  i'd  get  more  testosterone  woman
[00:37] attraction  mental  clarity  girls  will 
 hold  eye  contact  with  you  but  i  went 
 through  the  same  problem  that  you're 
 probably  going  through  i'd  get  to  day
[00:43] three  or  four  and  relapse  oh  come  on 
 i've  gotta  get  to  day  90  or  at  least  day 
 seven  for  the  testosterone  boost  and
[00:48] again  day  three  or  four  and  relapse  it 
 was  frustrating  i  actually  started  to 
 feel  worse  and  more  annoyed  at  myself  on
[00:55] nofap  than  i  did  before  because  i  was 
 constantly  failing  this  goal  that  seemed 
 so  easy  for  everyone  else  i  wish  i  knew
[01:01] about  the  golden  point  of  nofap  earlier 
 adonis 
 adonis  beats  his  meat  but  not  like  that
[01:07] he's  a  farmer  a  hunter  an  old  school  man 
 adonis  was  the  first  man  to  transmutate
[01:12] sexual  energy  into  productive  goals 
 what's  other  men  are  fapping  adonis's 
 training  he  understands  that  just  as
[01:18] good  nutrition  is  fuel  for  our  bodies 
 sexual  energy  is  fuel  for  our  goals  and 
 dispelling  that  sexual  energy  by  oneself
[01:24] is  a  great  sin  indeed  adonis  tries  not 
 to  judge  but  he  can't  help  but  be  upset 
 at  the  hordes  of  men  willingly
[01:30] castrating  themselves  and  then  adonis 
 notices  the  young  men  of  nofap  here's
[01:35] the  real  benefits  of  nofap  because  most 
 of  the  nofap  videos  on  youtube  over 
 exaggerate  this  just  to  get  more  views
[01:41] number  one  and  most  importantly  it  makes 
 you  feel  like  less  of  a  loser  two  you 
 save  a  solid  few  hours  a  week  that  you
[01:46] can  now  put  into  productive  habits  like 
 sleeping  more  or  reading  three  you  feel 
 like  you  have  more  sexual  energy  that
[01:52] you  can  now  use  as  motivation  for  your 
 self-improvement  goals  four  you  begin  to 
 become  attracted  by  normal  girls  again
[01:58] and  you  stop  needing  those  [ __ ]  up 
 fetishes  and  five  you  start  getting 
 those  rock  hard  erections  easier  and
[02:03] faster  i  remember  when  i  was  a  normal 
 guy  when  i  was  flapping  it  would 
 actually  take  me  a  little  while  to  get 
 an  erection  and  sometimes  with  girls
[02:09] right  in  front  of  me  i  was  about  to  have 
 sex  and  my  dick  would  just  knock  it  hard 
 and  now  on  nofap  i  literally  get  hard
[02:14] from  eye  contact  like  seriously  if 
 there's  a  girl  i  love  who's  making  eye 
 contact  with  me  i  get  an  erection  that's
[02:19] exactly  how  it's  supposed  to  be  i've 
 mentioned  the  golden  point  of  nofap  many 
 times  on  my  channel  and  i  think  this
[02:24] hasn't  been  talked  about  on  any  other 
 youtube  video  this  is  the  hidden  key  to 
 the  success  of  nofap  and  the  reason  why
[02:29] no  nofap  youtubers  have  made  a  video  on 
 this  concept  is  because  once  you 
 understand  the  golden  point  of  nofap  you
[02:35] no  longer  ever  have  to  watch  another 
 nofap  video  that's  why  i  hardly  make  any 
 nofap  videos  on  my  channel  even  though
[02:41] they  get  the  most  views  the  golden  point 
 of  nofap  is  where  you  literally  forget 
 that  fapping  and  porn  even  exist  it's
[02:47] where  you  don't  even  think  about  it 
 getting  obsessed  about  nofap  and 
 constantly  watching  all  of  the  nofap
[02:52] benefits  timeline  videos  it's  bad  for 
 you  because  you  become  obsessed  with  it 
 and  then  it  stays  ingrained  in  your  mind
[02:57] when  you're  obsessed  with  nofap  it 
 starts  to  feel  like  a  full-time  job  like 
 when  am  i  never  next  gonna  fap  don't  fap
[03:02] don't  don't  reset  the  streak  we  want  to 
 get  to  the  golden  point  of  nofap  which 
 is  when  you  get  the  urges  you  don't  even
[03:07] associate  the  sexual  urge  with  fapping 
 anymore  you  get  that  sexual  urge  and  it
[03:12] literally  just  feels  good  to  be  a  man  so 
 how  do  you  get  to  the  golden  point  of 
 nofap  there's  two  things  you've  got  to 
 know  one  you've  got  to  have  realistic
[03:18] expectations  of  nofap  that  don't  help 
 your  mental  health  one  of  the  things 
 that  no  one  tells  you  about  nofap  is
[03:24] that  you're  supposed  to  relapse  many 
 many  many  times  when  you're  first 
 starting  out  stop  expecting  to  get  into
[03:29] nofap  and  then  expecting  it  to  be 
 perfect  straight  away  to  get  to  a  huge 
 streak  you  don't  deserve  that  right  now 
 you  have  been  leveling  up  this  habit  of
[03:35] fapping  and  watching  porn  for  like  10 
 years  it's  gonna  take  some  time  to 
 destroy  this  habit  the  most  important
[03:40] thing  is  just  try  not  to  fap  that  much 
 and  just  know  that  it  will  take  months 
 if  not  even  years  for  some  people  to  get
[03:45] to  the  point  where  they  feel  like  they 
 just  are  completely  on  nofa  and  the 
 second  thing  is  your  self-image  and  this
[03:51] is  the  part  that  a  lot  of  people  forget 
 if  you  say  that  you're  on  nofap  i  know 
 for  a  fact  that  you  will  masturbate
[03:56] again  soon  because  imagine  two  guys  at  a 
 party  one  of  them  says  oh  no  thanks  i'm 
 trying  to  quit  drinking  we  know  for  a
[04:02] fact  that  this  guy  is  gonna  fail  his 
 goal  of  quitting  alcohol  but  guy  number 
 two  says  no  thanks  i  don't  drink  this
[04:07] guy  is  way  less  likely  to  crumble 
 because  it's  ingrained  in  his  self-image 
 don't  see  yourself  as  the  guy  who's  on
[04:13] nofap  as  the  guy  who's  trying  not  to  far 
 see  yourself  as  the  guy  who  simply  just 
 does  not  fap  you're  not  trying  you  just
[04:20] don't  you're  not  on  nofap  it's  just 
 something  that  doesn't  exist  in  your 
 mind  anymore  and  to  do  that  you  have  to
[04:26] take  a  step  back  from  the  community  of 
 nofap  videos  online  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
