[00:00] you're  never  gonna  get  girls  like  that 
 geoffrey  jeffrey  does  it  all  wrong  he  is 
 horny  but  he  doesn't  have  the  right
[00:05] traits  that  actually  makes  him 
 attractive  to  girls  of  course  it's 
 jeffrey  so  he's  missing  some  of  the
[00:10] fundamentals  his  breath  stinks  how  do 
 you  think  you  can  attract  any  women  like 
 that  when  your  breath  stink  geoffrey
[00:15] even  chads  can't  afford  to  have  bad 
 breath  adonis 
 adonis  doesn't  have  green  flags  green
[00:21] flags  haven't  died 
 green  flags  haven't  done  it  a  phenomenal
[00:27] communicator  respectably  honest  insanely 
 attractive  adonis  is  the  world's  best
[00:33] postman  because  he  brings  the  whole 
 package 
 all  right  i  asked  a  bunch  of  my  female
[00:38] friends  for  their  advice  on  dating  i 
 asked  them  what's  the  best  green  flags 
 that  guys  can  have  and  we're  going  to
[00:43] listen  to  their  responses  because  i  got 
 them  to  send  me  voice  notes  so  firstly 
 showing  a  genuine  and  sincere  interest
[00:49] in  your  life  so  someone  that  basically 
 asks  you  questions  about  your  day  and 
 how  works  go  in  and  just  generally  asks
[00:56] about  you  you  know  things  aren't  always 
 just  about  them  all  the  bread  pillars 
 and  the  black  fillers  are  getting 
 annoying  wait  wait  hang  on  what  about
[01:02] being  an  alpha  male  what  about  what 
 about  having  the  perfect  eyelid  shape 
 guys  someone  who  takes  care  of  themself
[01:07] because  i  always  think  if  someone's  able 
 to  take  care  of  themselves  then  they're 
 able  to  take  care  of  you  too  and  by  that
[01:13] it  can  be  anything  from  watching  them 
 trying  to  achieve  the  goals  you  know 
 taking  care  of  their  appearance  or  you
[01:19] know  trying  to  that's  actually 
 interesting  that  she  said  taking  care  of 
 your  goals  and  she  wants  to  see  a  man 
 who's  actually  achieving  things  in  his
[01:24] life  and  this  is  one  of those  things 
 that  i've  never  seen  many  guys  talk 
 about  like  online  everyone  talks  about 
 okay  attractiveness  and  actually  do
[01:29] agree  with  that  i  think  attractiveness 
 is  one  of  the  most  important  parts  but  a 
 huge  part  of  attraction  that  girls  have
[01:34] in  guys  is  that  the  guy  sets  goals  and 
 achieves  them  and  why  why  do  you  think 
 this  is  really  ask  yourself  right  now
[01:39] why  would  a  woman  be  attracted  to  a  guy 
 who  sets  goals  and  achieves  them  because 
 it  shows  ambition  and  it  shows  at  least
[01:44] a  potential  for  future  success  and 
 that's  incredibly  attractive  and  plus  we 
 can  get  a  little  bit  deeper  if  the  woman
[01:49] that  you're  trying  to  attract  is 
 feminine  the  feminine  is  attracted  to 
 the  masculine  you  must  understand  the
[01:54] feminine  and  the  masculine  energy  if  you 
 want  to  have  like  a  sexual  relationship 
 you  want  to  understand  these  the 
 masculine  is  all  about  like  the  mission
[02:00] what's  next  what  goal  are  we  going  to 
 achieve  what  are  we  going  to  conquer  the 
 moment  that  a  masculine  man  achieves  a 
 goal  he  sets  another  one  and  another  one
[02:06] and  another  one  it's  all  about  the 
 pursuit  of  something  whereas  the 
 feminine  energy  is  all  about  like  the
[02:11] flow  of  love  about  laughter  dance 
 communication  if  the  women  that  you're 
 trying  to  attract  are  feminine  they  will
[02:16] be  more  into  you  if  they  see  that  you 
 are  the  masculine  guy  who's  like  focused 
 on  his  goals  his  purpose  his  mission
[02:21] like  that  person  living  a  healthy  and 
 balanced  lifestyle  and  i  think  that  if 
 they're  able  to  do  them  things  for
[02:26] themselves  then  the  chances  are  they're 
 able  to  take  care  of  you  as  well  a  guy 
 who  makes  an  effort  with  your  parents
[02:32] and  siblings  i  think  that  there's 
 nothing  nicer  than  watching  like  a  guy 
 going  well  with  your  parents  and  like
[02:37] your  brothers  and  sisters  or  like  your 
 grandparents  whoever  it  might  be  i  think 
 that  that's  definitely  a  really  nice
[02:42] thing  and  it  shows  that  they  care  about 
 you  and  like  the  people  around  you  and 
 the  people  who  are  important  to  you  as 
 well  that's  a  big  one  for  long-term
[02:48] serious  relationships  you  want  to  get 
 along  with  their  family  but  you  also 
 want  to  make  sure  that  she  gets  along 
 with  yours  if  you're  really  pursuing
[02:54] like  a  serious  relationship  you  want  to 
 be  together  for  years  maybe  for  your 
 life  you  want  to  have  children  together 
 it's  very  important  that  you  fit  in  with
[02:59] her  family  and  she  fits  in  with  yours 
 because  you  can  still  have  a 
 relationship  where  you  don't  fit  in  but 
 the  best  case  scenario  you  don't  have
[03:04] that  level  of  friction  not  to  like  jack 
 my  own  tough  but  i'm  pretty  sick  with 
 going  to  like  a  girl's  family  and  like
[03:10] you  know  communicating  with  her  parents 
 and  like  doing  well  with  them  and  like 
 speaking  to  them  as  if  they're  almost 
 like  friends  and  the  best  advice  i  can
[03:15] give  you  for  that  is  just  social  skills 
 you've  got  to  almost  see  them  as  like 
 people  that  you'll  be  interacting  with
[03:20] in  the  gym  and  you  ask  them  questions 
 you  take  an  interest  you  make  jokes  and 
 everything  and  sometimes  you'll  come 
 across  some  family  members  who  are  like
[03:25] testing  you  and  you  know  it's  like 
 hardcore  like  and  like  i  don't 
 personally  get  along  with  that 
 personality  style  who  like  wants  to
[03:31] challenge  me  but  the  girls  who  i've 
 previously  dated  and  their  parents  who 
 were  like  you  know  nice  people  and  i  got 
 along  with  them  like  i  actually  was  more
[03:37] interested  in  the  girl  because  of  that 
 but  it  starts  with  you  and  your  social 
 skills  to  be  honest  imagine  you're  about 
 to  meet  like  this  girl's  parents  are  you
[03:43] gonna  hold  eye  contact  are  you  gonna  go 
 in  for  a  handshake  or  a  hug  are  you 
 gonna  be  awkward  and  like  not  know  what 
 to  do  and  be  honest  because  it's  really
[03:48] worth  just  kind  of  considering  what  kind 
 of  guy  you  are  when  it  comes  to  like 
 seeing  her  family  someone  who  shows  you
[03:53] that  they  like  you  through  their  actions 
 and  they  don't  just  tell  you  they  like 
 you  so  for  example  they  might  hold  the 
 door  open  for  you  or  text  you  throughout
[03:59] the  day  to  ask  you  how  your  day's  going 
 or  notice  that  you're  struggling  with 
 something  like  they  want  to  help  you
[04:04] overcome  it  or  someone  who  wants  to  help 
 support  you  with  your  goals  and  tries  to 
 put  you  sometimes  like  before  themselves
[04:10] i  think  that  that's  a  real  like  green 
 flag  because  words  are  words  at  the  end 
 of  the  day  actions  are  the  most
[04:15] important  things 
 watch  their  actions  and  not  their  words 
 and  this  is  really  good  advice  for  guys
[04:20] as  well  when  you're  kind  of  evaluating 
 the  girl  that  you're  interested  in  watch 
 her  actions  and  not  what  she  says  to  you 
 and  we  have  now  another  friend  who's
[04:26] answering  the  same  question  hey  i'm  so 
 sorry  i  just  saw  this  um  i  don't  use 
 instagram  that  watches  it  like  once
[04:32] every  week  two  weeks  or  so  so  yes  two 
 main  green  flags  would  be  responsibility
[04:38] and  if  he  shows  compassion  towards  other 
 people  but  most  especially  his  family  if 
 he  takes  care  of  himself  and  then  his
[04:44] immediate  family  that  already  says  a  lot 
 about  who  he  is  and  how  he  would  treat 
 you  in  the  future  so  yeah  hope  it  helped
[04:51] bye  that's  really  nice  so  she  mentioned 
 the  importance  of  responsibility 
 is  kind  of  like  taking  care  of  yourself
[04:57] and  the  things  that  you  should  be  taken 
 care  of  and  then  when  you  reach  a  good 
 enough  level  and  you  have  the  mental 
 capacity  to  do  so  start  taking
[05:03] responsibility  for  more  things  jordan 
 peterson  really  talks  about 
 responsibility  a  lot  so  it's  no  surprise
[05:08] that  she's  just  mentioned  that  number 
 one  they  hype  you  up  he's  he's  your 
 number  one  hype  man  anywhere  anywhere  in
[05:15] the  world  number  two  you  don't  even  have 
 to  ask  for  anything  because  they've  got 
 your  back  like  they  already  know  because
[05:21] they've  studied  you  so  they  know 
 what  you  need  and  when  you  need  it 
 sometimes  even  before  you  know  so  she
[05:27] just  said  that  the  number  one  green  flag 
 is  that  the  guy  like  hypes  her  up  and 
 encourages  her  and  that  the  second  one
[05:32] is  kind  of  like  he  knows  what  her  needs 
 are  number  three  is  like  they're  not
[05:37] looking  for 
 problems  in  you  as  a  person
[05:42] they  understand  that 
 like 
 we're  all  at  different  growth  like
[05:47] growing  levels  and  so  they're  not  trying 
 to  pick  up  what  they  don't  like  about
[05:52] you  they're  actively  trying  to  find  what 
 they  do  like  about  you  all  the  time
[05:58] because  you  can  either  destroy  someone 
 even  with  your  thoughts  and  put  yourself
[06:03] off  them  or  like 
 just  appreciate  someone  if  that  makes
[06:08] sense 
 and  not  hurt  them  i  don't  have  that 
 green  flag  i'll  be  totally  honest  i  um  i
[06:13] have  a  tendency  to  pick  out  negative 
 traits  in  the  women  that  i'm  dating  so  i
[06:19] don't  know  if  it's  like  a  defense 
 mechanism  or  something  but  it's  usually 
 like  i'll  really  like  a  girl  and  things 
 will  be  going  good  but  then  my  brain
[06:24] will  automatically  start  to  like 
 negatively  see  them  like  oh  she  does 
 this  wrong  and  she  could  do  that  you
[06:29] know  like  picking  out  things  so  that 
 maybe  it  kind  of  like  protects  myself  or 
 something  but  one  other  thing  like  she 
 was  just  saying  then  that  instead  of
[06:35] doing  that  instead  of  like  trying  to  see 
 all  the  negatives  and  weigh  them  up  just 
 focus  more  on  the  positives  and  that's 
 what  my  very  very  beautiful  healthy
[06:41] advice  and  i  think  you'll  be  able  to  do 
 that  if  you  implement  more  gratitude  if 
 you  really  think  to  yourself  okay
[06:46] instead  of  being  like  critical  of  this 
 person  think  okay  what  are  you  grateful 
 for  what  good  things  do  they  bring  to 
 the  table  focus  on  them  now  that  being
[06:52] said  it  is  very  important  to  still  take 
 account  of  like  red  flags  but  i  think 
 that  should  be  something  that  you  do
[06:57] like  every  now  and  then  every  like  at 
 the  start  of  a  relationship  you  kind  of 
 weigh  up  like  what  red  flags  do  they 
 have  like  is  there  anything  that  like
[07:03] really  could  be  like  a  problem  but  once 
 you  kind  of  acknowledge  them  and  you 
 kind  of  want  it  to  go  forward  then  don't 
 keep  constantly  bringing  them  up  focus
[07:09] more  on  the  positives  because  it  will 
 really  show  like  she  kind  of  briefly 
 mentioned  it  there  how  you  think  about 
 someone  will  show  in  the  way  that  you
[07:15] interact  with  them  and  you  want  if 
 you've  got  a  partner  if  you've  got  a 
 girl  that  you're  dating  you  want  her  to 
 feel  like  you  only  think  like  positive
[07:21] things  of  her  you  want  her  because  that 
 will  nourish  her  that  will  make  her  feel 
 good  and  that  will  encourage  her  to  be
[07:26] even  better  one  important  piece  of 
 advice  that  i've  learned  previously  is 
 that  you  shouldn't  really  try  to  change 
 your  partner  if  you  want  to  date  this
[07:32] person  you  should  assume  they're  going 
 to  stay  like  as  they  are  you  shouldn't 
 think  oh  yeah  this  person's  life's  but 
 like  if  i  can  save  her  like  a  lot  of
[07:38] young  men  have  this  tendency  like  oh 
 like  you  know  she's  kind  of  nice  and  she 
 likes  me  too  but  like  she's  got  some  bad
[07:43] habits  she's  got  some  of this  she  goes 
 to  the  club  she  takes  like 
 pictures  i  don't  like  that  but  you  know 
 i  can  change  her  but  you  know  i  can
[07:48] maybe  change  her  and  she  won't  be  like 
 that  anymore  you  have  to  kind  of  accept 
 a  person  as  they  are  right  now  otherwise
[07:53] you're  almost  forcing  them  to  be 
 inauthentic  around  you  and  that  kind  of 
 relationship  will  never  work  out  she
[07:58] sent  me  some  text  messages  as  well  she 
 said  number  three  is  the  most  important 
 one  the  last  one  that  she's  just  text  me 
 as  well  is  that  they  believe  you  when
[08:04] you're  telling  them  something  so 
 essentially  that  there's  a  good  level  of 
 trust  in  the  relationship  and  not  taking 
 life  and  themselves  too  seriously
[08:11] i  look  for  personally  is  a  guy  who  is 
 not  afraid  to  show  that  he  is  attracted
[08:18] to  women 
 so  let  me  explain  um  there's  a  lot  of 
 guys  who  think  that  like  simping  is
[08:25] cringe  and  that  you  should  never  let  a 
 woman  know  that  you  like  her  basically
[08:30] and  so  the  way  that  this  manifests  is 
 that  men  refuse  to  give  compliments  men
[08:37] refuse  to  engage  in  non-sexual  physical 
 touch  just  like  little  playful  touching
[08:43] um  and  so  a  green  flag  that  i  look  for 
 is  a  guy  who's  not  afraid  to  let  me  know 
 that  he  finds  me  attractive  that
[08:49] um 
 to  cut  out  there  but  i  do  want  to 
 comment  that  is  100  i've  done  the  wrong
[08:55] thing  here  in  previous  relationships  so 
 i've  mentioned  a  bunch  of  times  on  my 
 videos  that  there  was  a  girl  that  i  used 
 to  live  with  like  we  were  literally
[09:01] dating  we  were  together  for  like  two  or 
 three  years  and  i  was  in  like  this  kind 
 of  red  pill  anti-simp  mode  of  like  you
[09:06] know  never  tell  her  that  i  appreciate  i 
 never  tell  like  never  say  nice  things 
 about  her  and  like  you  know  like  all 
 these  alpha  males
[09:11] and  when  i  look  back  like  i  see  so  much 
 negativity  in  that  kind  of  relationship
[09:16] and  i  feel  like  i  have  so  much  change 
 from  that  when  now  i  do  what  she  says 
 and  like  you've  gotta 
 like  if  you  think  that  this  is  like
[09:22] simply  like  okay  there's  a  girl  that  you 
 like  maybe  it's  a  girl  that  you  date  in 
 to  show  her  that  you  care  about  her  to 
 show  her  that  you  appreciate  her  to  like
[09:27] do  little  things  for  her  to  hold  her 
 hand  to  hug  her  to  kiss  her  at  like  any 
 moment  if  you  think  that's  simply  bro  yo
[09:33] you've  spent  too  much  time  on  the 
 internet  you  literally  like  it  would  be 
 better  for  you  right  now  it'd  be  bad  for
[09:38] my  channel  and  my  youtube  algorithm  but 
 it'd  be  better  for  you  to  turn  this 
 video  off  and  like  just  just  go  stand
[09:43] outside  in  the  rain  and  actually  feel 
 the  real  world  because  too  often  like 
 young  men  are  consumed  by  the  internet 
 by  youtube  by  like  media  and  you  think
[09:49] that  anything  positive  towards  a  woman 
 is  like  simping  and  it's  bad  for  you  and 
 i  i  don't  want  to  be  a  better  male
[09:55] bro  it's  it's  the  more  beta  male  the 
 more  like  weak  male  skinny  neck  thing 
 low  testosterone  thing  to  do  is  to  take
[10:00] date  and  advice  from  like  guys  who  don't 
 even  show  their  face  on  youtube  saying 
 like  oh  we  need  to  stop  simping  shut  up
[10:05] bro  don't  simp  like  don't  be  like  some 
 weird  like  guy  who  donates  money  to  like 
 titty  streamers  on  twitch  but  when  you
[10:11] like  a  girl  and  she  likes  you  too  be 
 totally  like  as  affectionate  as  you  want 
 to  be  so  for  me  personally  bro  i'm  the
[10:17] most  affectionate  person  ever  i'm 
 literally  if  i'm  next  to  someone  even  a 
 male  friend  i'm  touching  them  constantly
[10:22] it's  just  what  i  do  it's  like  how  i  kind 
 of  like  show  love  and  i  always  used  to 
 kind  of  like  turn  that  down  and  so  i  was
[10:27] living  like  an  inauthentic  life  i  was  in 
 inauthentic  relationships  now  it's 
 almost  like  a  test  for  me  because  if 
 there's  someone  who's  unattracted  to
[10:33] that  part  of  me  if  there's  someone  who's 
 like  oh  why  you  touch  it  bro  i'll  never 
 see  them  again  because  we're  clearly 
 incompatible  and  doing  nice  things  for  a
[10:38] girl  again  you  shouldn't  be  doing  it  in 
 some  kind  of  simply  way  like  i'll  donate 
 money  to  her  but  doing  something  nice 
 and  romantic  like  one  of  the  things  i've
[10:44] done  is  i'm  in  the  car  with  a  girl  for 
 driving  and  you  know  there's  a  car 
 behind  us  or  something  and  i  tell  her 
 where  i  pull  over  so  she  thinks  almost
[10:49] like  it's  an  emergency  or  something  she 
 pulls  over  there's  a  car  behind  just 
 like  waiting  what  what  why  they  just
[10:54] blow  it  i  get  out  the  car  like  run 
 across  the  road  pick  out  a  flower  go 
 back  in  the  car  give  it  to  her  and  she's 
 like 
 no  one's  ever  done  oh  god  like  you  know
[11:00] she's  crazy  for  it  that  isn't  me  like 
 being  a  sim  that  isn't  me  like  oh  my  god 
 like  i  hope  she  has  sex  with  me  after
[11:05] this  it's  just  kind  of  like  i  felt  like 
 doing  that  it  stayed  inside  my  memories 
 i  guess  it's  like  a  romantic  thing  that
[11:10] i've  done  that  i'm  actually  like  glad 
 that  i  did  and  then  she  sent  another  one 
 as  well  women  want  to  be  around  men  that
[11:16] make  them  feel  desirable  women  don't 
 want  to  be  around  a  guy  where  they  have
[11:21] to  guess  if  he  finds  them  attractive  if 
 he  wants  to  be  around  them  at  this
[11:26] current  point  in  time 
 because  if  it's  like  if  you're  not 
 expressing  interest  why  am  i  here  i  just
[11:32] want  to  leave  you  know  women  want  to  be 
 around  men  that  make  them  feel  like 
 they're  attractive  and  those  men  are
[11:38] attracted  to  them  really  ask  yourself 
 this  question  is  it  not  the  same  for  you 
 would  you  want  to  be  around  a  woman 
 would  you  want  to  date  a  woman  who  kind
[11:43] of  doesn't  really  show  that  she  even 
 likes  you  like  no  of  course  not  like 
 some  guys  are  kind  of  into  that  where
[11:48] they  said  oh  don't  make  it  too  easy  for 
 me  or  something  but  you  want  like  some 
 kind  of  positive  feedback  loop  from  that
[11:53] you  wouldn't  want  to  date  a  woman  who 
 like  doesn't  show  that  she  actually 
 cares  about  you  and  that  she  actually 
 likes  you  hey  hamza  i  really  appreciate
[11:59] you  reaching  out  to  me  but  yeah  um  for 
 me  my  green  flags  would  probably  be  a
[12:04] guy  who  has  a  morning  and  night  routine 
 someone  who  meditates  who's  into  fitness
[12:11] and  self-improvement  because  that  just 
 shows  that  they  care  about  themselves 
 and  they're  working  towards  becoming
[12:17] better  versions  of  themselves  and 
 they're  prioritizing  themselves  you  know 
 and  yeah  that's  just  really  attractive
[12:23] and  whenever  i  see  and  meet  guys  like 
 that  they  honestly  have  my  respect
[12:28] because  i'm  into  that  stuff  so  yeah 
 that's  nice  so  she's  talking  about  the 
 guy  being  like-minded  to  her  and  he's  on
[12:35] self-improvements  he's  doing  the  good 
 habits  of  course  my  audience  pool  for 
 this  study  is  skewed  it's  biased  towards
[12:40] women  who  are  onto  self-improvement 
 because  i'm  friends  with  them  but 
 probably  like  thoughtfulness  are  like 
 just  the  little  things  so  going  wrong
[12:46] it's  nice  to  receive  flowers  but  i  mean 
 like  say  if  i'm  in  a  rush  like  i've  been 
 at  uni  all  day  for  them  to  be  like  oh
[12:52] just  come  straight  to  the  gym  like  i've 
 got  your  pre-workout  ready  made  you 
 don't  need  to  go  home  and  like  i  don't 
 know  that's  a  very  specific  example  but
[12:57] just  little  things  like  that  she's  such 
 a  gym  girl  but
[13:02] the  best  green  flag  in  a  guy  is  that  he 
 gets  me  pre-workout 
 oh  my  god  i  know  if  they  like  marvel  and
[13:09] they  don't  just  mean  like  oh  yeah  no  i 
 like  iron  man  i  mean  like  if  they  truly 
 understand  the  multiverse  and  like  they
[13:14] understand  how  it  all  interlinks  and 
 they're  always  like  oh  my  god  that's 
 coming  out  and  he's  going  to see  that 
 straight  away  that  is  a  big  dream  flag
[13:20] for  me  because  i  think  i'm  just  such  a 
 little  marvel  nerd  oh  my  god  i've 
 probably  just  exposed  myself
[13:26] so  the  first  one  she  said  is  that  he 
 does  little  things  for  her  like  he's 
 kind  of  thinking  about  her  and  he's  just
[13:31] made  her  life  easier  in  some  sense  and 
 the  second  one  she's  specifically 
 talking  about  like  marvel  like  the  movie
[13:36] company  or  something  but  it's  more  kind 
 of  like  sharing  the  same  enthusiasm  and 
 interest  in  the  things  that  she  likes  as
[13:41] well  the  two  biggest  green  flags  that  i 
 see  in  guys  and  you  also  notice  this
[13:48] when  your  friends  find  a  good  guy  and 
 you  start  seeing  green  flags  the  one
[13:53] thing  is  being  responsive  and  receptive 
 to  emotions  so  understanding  signals
[14:00] understanding  when  the  girl  is  not  okay 
 or  when  she  didn't  like  something  and
[14:05] picking  up  on  it  and  asking  about  it  and 
 the  second  thing 
 is  being  able  to  apologize  like  putting
[14:12] that  part  away  for  like  five  minutes  to 
 have  the  conversation  and  apologize  for
[14:17] something  they  know  has  upset  the  girl 
 so  i  think  that's  the  two  biggest 
 screenshots  for  me  interesting  so  the
[14:23] first  thing  she  said  is  kind  of  like 
 social  intelligence  being  able  to  pick 
 up  cues  so  so  if  you're  dating  a  girl
[14:28] it's  kind  of  like  having  that  sense  that 
 gut  instinct  that  like  something  isn't 
 right  with  her  that  she's  upset  about
[14:33] something  and  it's  kind  of  like  a  true 
 stereotype  that  women  generally  are  more 
 emotional  and  they'll  have  like  the  full
[14:38] spectrum  of  emotions  and  for  a  man  it's 
 like  we're  more  certain  on  something 
 like  today  i  feel  happy  tomorrow  i  feel
[14:44] okay  you  know  i  mean  it's  like  okay 
 we're  consistent  with  that  whereas  a 
 woman  especially  a  feminine  woman  can 
 have  quite  chaotic  mood  so  she  can  be
[14:50] like  anxious  and  insecure  for  one  second 
 and  literally  five  minutes  later  feel 
 like  totally  love  and  secure  so  you  have
[14:55] to  be  able  to  pick  up  on  that  and  the 
 second  thing  she  said  is  a  green  flag  is 
 the  ability  to  apologize  now  this  is
[15:01] where  it  gets  interesting  because  you 
 might  think  oh  no  this  is  all  wrong  and 
 hamster's  getting  blooper  advice  from 
 girls  why  would  you  ask  girls  for  advice
[15:06] and  stuff  but  the  thing  is  i  have  been 
 through  the  spectrum  of  dating  advice 
 and  i  have  been  like  okay  total  virgin
[15:12] then  i've  been  total  red  pill  alpha  male 
 pills  and  you  know  dry  like  dark 
 behaviors  and
[15:17] apologizing  to  a  girl  for  me  is 
 extremely  unnatural  because  i've  for
[15:23] years  i've  like  implemented  more  of  like 
 the  dark  triad  alpha  male  traits  and 
 everything  and  so  there  was  a  girl  that
[15:28] i  apologized  to  a  little  while  ago  even 
 multiple  girls  like  i'm  getting  more 
 into  the  ability  of  being  able  to
[15:33] apologize  and  like  she's  just  said  she 
 used  the  perfect  word  there  it's  being 
 able  to  put  your  pride  away  pride  is  the
[15:38] fuel  for  your  ego  the  opposite  of  that 
 is  humility  and  humility  as  you  may 
 remember  is  adonis's  second  virtue
[15:44] humility  is  being  able  to  see  some  of 
 your  weaknesses 
 like  for  me  probably  the  main  one  is
[15:49] personal  cnn  a  big  one  for  me  is  like 
 interest  like  matching  interest  that's
[15:54] fine  personality  and  matching  interest 
 so  interest  we've  heard  that  a  couple  of
[15:59] times  now  having  the  same  interest  as 
 her  so  that's  all  my  friends  who  replied 
 there  was  a  few  who  like  didn't  really 
 get  the  message  and  they  they  messaged
[16:05] me  back  like  is  the  video  for  men  or  for 
 women  so  those  are  the  best  green  flags 
 that  women  say  that  they're  attracted  to
[16:10] and  it's  up  to  you  to  decide  if  you  do 
 want  to  be  introspective  and  see  if  you 
 bring  these  things  to  the  table  share
[16:15] the  video  with  a  friend  who  it  might 
 help  and  do  the  hard  work  especially 
 when  you  don't  feel  like  it
