[00:00] Jeffrey  slowly  opens  his  crush  the  eyes 
 he  can  already  feel  the  throbbing  pain 
 in  his  head  from  all  the  junk  food  he
[00:06] ate  last  night  he  checks  his  phone  it's 
 three  in  the  afternoon  he's  got 
 assignments  to  hand  in  tomorrow  but  what
[00:12] do  you  think  Jeffrey  does  he  opens  up 
 Tick  Tock  and  starts  scrolling  I'll  just
[00:17] look  at  a  couple  of  videos  and  then  I'll 
 go  brush  my  teeth  thanks  Jeffrey  two 
 hours  later  and  he's  still  scrolling  and
[00:23] by  the  time  that  he  gets  up  there's  only 
 a  couple  hours  left  of  daylight  Adonis
[00:28] Adonis  is  awake  before  the  birds  have 
 even  began  to  sing  he  understands  that 
 for  men  life  is  a  race  and  if  you  want
[00:35] to  win  this  race  you  have  to  start 
 before  everyone  else  Adonis  doesn't 
 check  his  phone  he  doesn't  even  know 
 what  Tick  Tock  is  whilst  Jeffrey  is
[00:41] staggering  home  from  his  night  out 
 Adonis  is  on  his  morning  run  by  the  time 
 Jeffrey  wakes  up  Adonis  has  already  been
[00:46] to  the  gym  and  finished  his  work  for  the 
 day  this  is  how  all  young  men  should
[00:51] live  myself  and  a  lot  of  other  guys  my 
 age  some  25  years  old  are  so  grateful
[00:57] that  we've  never  actually  used  Tick  Tock 
 properly  but  this  video  was  for  those 
 younger  men  who  may  have  a  tick  tock
[01:02] addiction  and  you  know  this  seems  like  a 
 little  wishy-washy  video  just  talking  oh 
 you  know  tick  tock's  about  that  but  as
[01:07] we  get  further  and  further  into  our 
 understanding  of  what  Tick  Tock  actually 
 is  and  how  it  truly  ruins  your  life  you
[01:12] start  to  realize  that  this  is  a  lot  more 
 serious  than  we  think  it  is  because  on 
 the  surface  Tick  Tock  seems  like  a
[01:17] harmless  app  it's  just  you  know  social 
 media  it's  just  a  bit  of  fun  you  can  see 
 videos  of  people  like  dancing  or  doing
[01:22] some  goofy  pranks  yeah  it's  it's  okay 
 isn't  it  but  the  issue  is  that  Tick  Tock 
 has  been  meticulously  designed  to  addict
[01:28] you  deciphon  away  the  most  important 
 thing  that  they  can  take  away  from  you 
 which  is  your  attention  you  open  the  app
[01:34] harmlessly  you  know  just  a  quick  two 
 minutes  of  fun  you  start  scrolling  the 
 videos  are  only  15  seconds  long  so  you
[01:39] surely  can't  spend  too  much  time  on  here 
 right  and  then  hours  pass  by  and  did  you 
 know  that  the  average  Tick-Tock  user  is
[01:45] on  Tick  Tock  five  times  more  than  the 
 average  YouTube  user  uses  YouTube  five
[01:51] times  more  YouTube's  been  around  for 
 more  than  a  decade  and  it's  amassed 
 about  2  billion  users  tick  tock's  been
[01:57] around  for  about  two  years  and  it's  got 
 about  half  that  of 
 is  growing  much  faster  there's  a  key  to
[02:03] tick  tock's  ability  to  hook  your 
 attention  and  just  take  away  hours  per 
 day  and  it's  through  the  use  of
[02:09] unpredictable  rewards  now  you've 
 probably  heard  about  people  talking 
 about  dopamine  recently  haven't  you  like
[02:14] dopamine  detox  and  Andrew  huberman  is 
 like  a  scientist  who  talks  about 
 dopamine  a  lot  more  and  more  people  are
[02:19] talking  about  dopamine  and  I'm  not  like 
 some  scientist  so  I'll  just  give  you  a 
 very  simple  explanation  essentially 
 dopamine  is  kind  of  like  motivation  it's
[02:25] not  so  much  the  enjoyment  of  something 
 it's  more  so  a  pleasurable  feeling  when 
 you're  about  to  get  that  thing  when
[02:30] you're  on  pursuit  of  that  thing  does 
 that  make  sense  so  you  don't  actually 
 get  that  much  dopamine  when  you  eat  the
[02:35] junk  food  you  get  dopamine  when  you  know 
 you're  gonna  eat  the  junk  food  five 
 minutes  from  now  dopamine  is  all  about
[02:40] the  motivation  so  go  and  do  the  thing 
 and  this  is  how  Tech  talk  absolutely 
 hooks  addicts  manipulates  your  dopamine
[02:47] receptors  because  it's  not  about  you 
 just  seeing  the  best  kind  of  video  it's 
 about  the  search  for  the  best  video  it's
[02:53] about  the  search  for  the  next  video  that 
 makes  you  breathe  from  your  nose 
 just  scrolling  and  scrolling  and
[02:58] scrolling  and  your  dopamine's  just 
 hyperactive  because  you  never  know  the 
 next  scroll  might  be  really  really 
 interesting  if  you've  ever  studied
[03:03] psychology  you  might  know  that  there's  a 
 very  famous  experiment  that  found  this
[03:08] out  like  decades  ago  and  this  was  called 
 the  Skinner  rat  box  BF  Skinner  is  a  very 
 famous  psychologist  mostly  because  of
[03:14] this  experiment  BF  Skinner  ran  an 
 experiment  where  he  put  rats  inside  of  a 
 box  Skinner  observed  that  the  animals
[03:19] responded  most  to  random  rewards  the 
 mice  or  rats  or  pigeons  would  press  a
[03:24] lever  and  sometimes  they  get  a  small 
 treat  other  times  a  large  treat  and 
 other  times  nothing  at  all  unlike  the
[03:30] mice  that  received  the  same  treat  every 
 single  time  the  mice  that  receive 
 variable  rewards  seem  to  press  the  lever
[03:35] compulsively  this  is  the  key  to  tiktok's 
 addiction  strategy  you  couple  that
[03:40] strategy  with  the  fact  that  Tinder  has 
 an  endless  scroll  like  you  can't  get  to 
 the  bottom  you  just  keep  scrolling  and
[03:45] scrolling  and  scrolling  it's  almost  like 
 it's  psychological  warfare  because  you 
 see  that  the  creators  of  tiktok  know
[03:51] what  they  were  doing  when  they  created  a 
 platform  like  this  they  know  that  this 
 would  addict  you  severely  and  that
[03:56] there's  such  level  of  friction  to  stop 
 the  pursuit  of  the  next  dopamine-filled 
 Tick  Tock  to  close  the  app  is  actually
[04:02] kind  of  difficult  it's  not  uncommon  for 
 us  to  hear  of  some  young  guys  who  are 
 spending  more  than  one  to  two  to  three
[04:07] hours  per  day  on  Tick  Tock  and  there's 
 literally  some  guys  who  are  more  on  the 
 extreme  side  five  six  seven  eight  hours 
 a  day  I  can  already  sense  that  there
[04:13] might  be  some  people  watching  this  who 
 may  have  fallen  victim  to  like  the 
 Jeffrey  propaganda  that's  come  from
[04:18] these  companies  and  you  might  literally 
 have  like  this  conscious  thought  right 
 now  thinking  oh  but  like  you  know  it's 
 not  that  bad  like  I  only  do  it  a  little
[04:23] bit  I  only  do  it  like  one  hour  a  day  or 
 two  hours  so  you  know  like  everyone  else 
 in  my  school  uses  it  you've  got  to
[04:28] understand  having  a  thought  like  that 
 actually  shows  that  you  don't  have  much 
 respect  for  yourself  because  as  a  young
[04:33] man  you  must  know  this  your  time  your 
 attention  your  ability  to  do  work  is 
 worth  so  much  if  you  expect  to  become
[04:40] successful  in  the  future  which  I  just 
 want  you  to  ask  yourself  right  now  you 
 might  have  never  actually  asked  yourself 
 this  question  so  ask  yourself  totally
[04:45] with  honestly  do  I  expect  to  become 
 successful  in  the  future  more  than  just 
 average  more  than  just  making  thirty
[04:51] thousand  pounds  of  dollars  per  year 
 which  is  like  average  in  these  countries 
 do  I  expect  to  become  very  successful 
 make  70k  100K  200k  per  year  because  if
[04:58] the  answer  is  yes  the  way  that  you  will 
 achieve  that  goal  of  becoming  very 
 successful  is  by  valuing  your  time  and
[05:03] putting  your  time  into  the  things  that 
 would  actually  get  you  to  that  level  of 
 success  isn't  it  because  success  is 
 literally  all  just  have  you  put  in  your
[05:09] time  into  the  right  things  have  you  been 
 learning  have  you  been  implementing  have 
 you  been  trying  businesses  have  you  been 
 experiencing  failure  and  rejection  so
[05:14] that  you  can  grow  more  or  have  you  just 
 been  staying  in  a  state  of  comfort  lying 
 down  sideways  just  getting  more  and  more
[05:19] more more  dopamine  now  everything  we've 
 discussed  in  this  video  is  just  basic 
 it's  kind  of  like  common  sense  now  a
[05:24] bunch  of  people  have  understood  tick 
 tock's  you  know  algorithms  are  really 
 strong  and  you  know  there's  artificial
[05:29] intelligence  and  there's  some  Data 
 Tracking  and  you  know  there's  the 
 dopamine  and  stuff  most  people  know  this 
 don't  we  it  gets  kind  of  deeper  when  you
[05:34] really  research  Tick  Tock  even  more 
 that's  when  the  hairs  on  your  arm  start 
 to  stand  up  and  you  look  around  thinking
[05:40] that  this  could  literally  destroy  the 
 world 
 and  I'm  not  over  exaggerating  when  I  say
[05:45] that  you  see  Tick  Tock  is  created  by  a 
 Chinese  company  called  bite  dance  and
[05:50] bite  dance  is  actually  partnered  with 
 the  CCP  like  the  Chinese  governments  in 
 their  agreements  which  you  can  literally
[05:55] read  in  the  terms  of  service  they  are 
 legally  obligated  to  send  user  data  to
[06:00] the  CCP  which  essentially  means  that  the 
 Chinese  government  has  your  data  they 
 know  what  you're  addicted  to  and  that
[06:06] might  not  seem  too  bad  right  oh  yeah 
 what  do  they  want  with  data  look  it's 
 very  interesting  because  we're  quite 
 young  and  you've  probably  heard  more  and
[06:11] more  over  the  last  few  years  about  data 
 haven't  you  and  you  probably  thought 
 like  you  know  why  do  people  take  that  so
[06:16] seriously  our  data  like  you  know  we  go 
 into  a  new  website  and  it  says  oh  your 
 Data  Tracking  cookies  let  me  just  press 
 accept  like  it  doesn't  make  a  difference 
 right  when  you're  quite  young  and  almost
[06:22] oblivious  to  this  you  don't  really  think 
 anything  about  your  data  you  don't 
 really  think  your  data  is  worth  much  Up 
 Until  you  realize  that  that's  just
[06:28] because  we've  lived  a  very  like 
 comfortable  sheltered  life  here  in  the 
 west  or  you  know  in  some  more  developed
[06:33] countries  like  India  Pakistan  and 
 everything  because  you  see  in  some  parts 
 of  the  world  in  particularly  China  your
[06:38] data  is  used  to  totally  control  you  so 
 here  in  the  west  you  know  our  data  is 
 used  to  like  track  our  shopping  so  they
[06:43] can  sell  us  more  stuff  yeah  fair  enough 
 okay  who  cares  like  oh  yeah  we'll  be 
 showing  more  adverts  okay  fine  who  cares
[06:48] it's  not  that  important  right  but  in 
 China  and  this  is  really  true  like  they 
 already  have  what's  called  like  a  social 
 credit  system  like  they've  essentially
[06:54] got  like  a  score  if  you've  ever  watched 
 that  Black  Mirror  episode  I  think  it's 
 called  nosedive  where  it's  like  everyone
[06:59] has  like  a  five-star  rating  out  of  five 
 stars  of  like  what  you'd  rate  each  other 
 for  you  know  your  social  mannerisms  and
[07:04] everything  in  China  they  have  that  like 
 they  literally  give  you  like  a  social 
 credit  score  and  if  your  score  is  too 
 low  they  literally  restrict  your  freedom
[07:10] you  can't  travel  you  can't  take  buses 
 you  can't  take  trains  and  there's  an 
 article  I  read  which  showed  that  when 
 there  was  like  some  kind  of  protest  in
[07:16] China  they  literally  locked  it  down 
 using  people's  data  like  this  like  they 
 stopped  people  from  being  able  to  like
[07:21] leave  the  process  so  they  could  get 
 arrested  they  stop  people  from  being 
 able  to  enter  the  process  by  stopping 
 like  certain  like  QR  codes  or  something
[07:26] you  know  like  people's  like  data  from 
 being  able  to  buy  trains  and  everything 
 you  don't  realize  how  much  your  data  can
[07:32] control  you  just  because  Yoshi  yet  we 
 haven't  experienced  that  in  the  west  and 
 this  then  coupled  with  the  fact  and  you
[07:39] might  have  heard  this  that  in  China  The 
 Tick  Tock  algorithm  promotes  a  very 
 different  kind  of  content  than  it  does
[07:44] in  the  UK  the  algorithm  in  China  has 
 been  meticulously  designed  to  promote
[07:49] the  kind  of  content  that  will  inspire 
 their  young  people  to  become  hard  and 
 disciplined  what  does  the  algorithm  in
[07:54] the  west  promote  degeneracy  in  their 
 version  of  tick  tock  if  you're  under  14
[07:59] years  old  they  show  you  science 
 experiments  you  can  do  at  home  Museum 
 exhibits  patriotism  videos  and
[08:05] educational  videos  now  they  don't  ship 
 that  version  of  tick  tock  to  the  rest  of 
 the  world  it's  almost  like  they
[08:10] recognize  that  Technologies  influencing 
 kids  development  and  they  make  their 
 domestic  version  a  spinach  version  of
[08:16] tick  tock  while  they  ship  the  Opium 
 version  to  the  rest  of  the  world 
 how  is  this  linked  what  does  this  all
[08:22] mean  so  Tick  Tock  in  the  west  promotes 
 degeneracy  and  you've  known  this  right 
 you've  seen  these  little  Tick-Tock  girls
[08:27] shaking  ass  and  all  this  like  sometimes 
 you  see  like  real  [ __ ]  porn  like  you 
 see  some  like  actual  like  nudity  on  Tick
[08:32] Tock  in  the  west  and  everything  little 
 13  year  old  boys  have  seen  this  stuff 
 this  was  actually  an  interesting  article 
 of  a  13  year  old  boy  typed  only  fans  in
[08:38] Tech  talk  some  [ __ ]  like  that  like  if 
 he's  typed  it  or  searched  or  whatever  he 
 would  be  then  shown  like  a  bunch  of  only
[08:43] fans  like  of  course  I  mean  if  you  search 
 only  fans  or  if  you  like  showing 
 interesting  like  the  only  fans  in  the 
 data  picks  up  no  matter  if  it  even  knows
[08:49] that  your  account  is  owned  by  a  13  year 
 old  it  will  start  to  show  you  literal 
 only  fans  models  that  are  trying  to  tell
[08:54] you  to  like  you  know  subscribe  to  their 
 [ __ ]  only  fans  list  do  you  understand 
 the  severity  of  this  because  many  people
[08:59] won't  at  this  point  this  just  seems  oh 
 well  you  know  like  yeah  yeah  they're 
 just  making  people  here  degenerates  like
[09:04] addicted  to  sex  and  you  know  shaking  ass 
 or  whatever  in  China  making  them 
 productive  it  doesn't  seem  that  bad 
 right  this  will  only  really  make  sense
[09:10] like  the  severity  of  this  will  only  make 
 sense  if  you  know  the  consequences  of  a 
 sexualized  Nation  there's  a  quote  if  you
[09:16] want  to  destroy  Any  Nation  without  War 
 make  adultery  or  news  is  he  calm  woman
[09:21] in  the  Young  Generation  and  this  quote 
 is  becoming  more  and  more  realistic  it's 
 become  more  observable  a  country  Falls
[09:27] when  especially  the  young  people  become 
 too  sexually  free  [ __ ]  this  this  video 
 can  get  really  [ __ ]  deep  I  really
[09:33] hope  you  can  follow  along  with  me  so  far 
 okay  let  me  just  do  a  recap  so  far  we've 
 covered  the  issues  with  tech  talk  it's 
 extremely  addicting  we've  covered  that
[09:39] Tick  Tock  is  made  by  the  company  bite 
 dance  that  reports  literally  to  the  CCP 
 which  means  that  they  share  data  there
[09:44] and  that  tick  tock's  algorithms  promote 
 degeneracy  nudity  adultery  open  sexual
[09:49] revolution  in  the  west  but  then  very 
 restrained  disciplined  in  the  Eastland 
 in  China  first  of  all  we  need  to  answer
[09:55] this  question  why  does  adultery  why  does 
 like  sexual  Freedom  destroy  a  nation 
 because  that  doesn't  seem  like  too
[10:00] obvious  right  now  does  it  why  when  a 
 nation's  young  people  start  to  have  more 
 like  free  sex  outside  of  marriage  why
[10:06] does  that  destroy  the  nation  well  when 
 people  have  too  much  like  you  know 
 sexually  free  sex  like  oh  go  [ __ ] 
 whoever  you  want  the  family  starts  to
[10:12] break  down  when  religion  was  in  control 
 the  only  time  you'd  really  be  having  sex 
 if  you  followed  those  rules  was  at  age
[10:17] 18  you  know  a  man  and  woman  would  get 
 married  and  it  quickly  gonna  be  honest 
 Foxwood  dude  quickly  get  married  you
[10:22] have  sex  you  start  having  children  boom 
 you've  got  a  family  units  you've  got  the 
 nuclear  family  unit  which  was  like 
 literally  like  the  most  core  part  of  a
[10:28] strong  Nation  because  if  that  Nation 
 eventually  went  to  war  if  that  nation 
 was  going  through  some  Great  Depression 
 that  man  would  be  working  hard  because
[10:33] he  had  a  family  he  had  a  wife  and  kids 
 to  fight  for  when  the  family  is  made 
 redundance  and  the  father  is  killed  from
[10:39] the  family  unit  and  replaced  with  the 
 government  and  then  the  young  people  are 
 promoted  to  be  degenerate  and  you  see
[10:44] this  music  and  everything  bro  I  haven't 
 watched  a  music  video  in  a  while  and  my 
 friend  Sammy  and  him  were  on  a  Discord
[10:49] call  and  he  just  like  ended  up  sharing 
 his  screen  and  he  put  on  like  some  rap 
 video  by  um you  know  one  of  those  like
[10:54] black  American  rappers  like  you  know  you 
 always  see  them  wearing  chains  and  [ __ ] 
 I  hadn't  watched  any  music  videos  in  a
[10:59] while  I've  not  seen  any  porn  any  social 
 media  I  don't  have  any  of  that  [ __ ]  have 
 just  seen  this  random  one  where  it's 
 like  they're  all  in  like  the  hood  or
[11:04] something  and  they've  got  like  a  bunch 
 of  like  djen  girls  twerking  around  them 
 the  guys  like  you  know  imitating  sex 
 moves  and  everything  it's  very
[11:09] degenerate  obviously  these  aren't  their 
 [ __ ]  wives  or  anything  to  me  just 
 that  made  me  think  like  [ __ ]  like  that's
[11:15] actually  normal  in  the  west  to  see  this 
 type  of  degenerate  content  you  see  like 
 these  female  artists  getting  try  humped
[11:21] by  their  male  like  dancing  stars  when 
 they  go  on  to  like  stage  or  something 
 you  see  all  these  people  promoting  like
[11:26] this  degeneracy  a  lot  of  people  reply  to 
 this  and  say  oh  you  know  you're  a 
 misogynist  you  don't  want  people  to 
 women's  sexual  freedom  and  stuff  this
[11:32] isn't  about  hating  on  a  particular  sex 
 this  is  about  realizing  that  this  causes 
 weakness  because  the  thing  that  causes
[11:37] the  most  strength  in  a  man  and  therefore 
 the  most  strength  in  a  country  is  family
[11:42] and  so  when  we  destroy  the  family  by 
 showing  people  that  they  can  have  sex 
 and  promoting  them  to  have  sex  outside
[11:48] of  the  family  perhaps  this  can  get  even 
 more  red  pill  because  then  those  same 
 people  especially  the  women  this  gets
[11:54] very  [ __ ]  red  pilled  honestly  like 
 you  start  to  see  all  the  plots  like 
 linking  together  I'll  put  this  all 
 together  soon  but  the  next  thing  we  need
[11:59] to  discuss  is  what  happens  when  sexual 
 freedoms  are  opened  what  happens  when 
 people  young  people  are  allowed  to  like
[12:05] to  just  [ __ ]  it's  just  normal  to  be 
 on  Tinder  and  stuff  men  get  extremely 
 horny  and  so  men  really  want  to  [ __ ] 
 until  Men  start  crowding  and  start
[12:11] wanting  to  [ __ ]  the  same  girls  and  you 
 know  they're  sending  the  messages  and 
 everything  that  means  that  women's 
 self-esteem  and  like  you  know
[12:16] self-identity  starts  to  inflate  because 
 an  average  girl  is  now  getting  the 
 attention  of  like  a  [ __ ]  talking  10  100
[12:21] years  ago  an  average  girl  is  getting 
 hundreds  of  messages  literally  like 
 almost  like  a  rock  star  level  attraction
[12:26] that  she's  getting  and  she's  literally 
 just  like  a  five  or  something  and  I  will 
 say  this  like  disrespect  her  I'm  just 
 saying  like  the  brutal  truth  so  what
[12:31] happens  if  sexual  freedom  is  opened  up 
 men  are  now  allowed  to  like  hold  women 
 and  start  texting  them  all  the  time  and 
 you  know  of  course  like  when  you're
[12:36] allowed  to  just  [ __ ]  as  a  guy  it's  like 
 you  know  you  may  as  well  go  shotgun 
 strategy  and  message  as  many  girls  as 
 possible  women's  self-esteem  is  rising
[12:42] from  that  so  women  start  seeing 
 themselves  better  when  women  see 
 themselves  better  they  only  want  to  [ __ ] 
 guys  who  are  better  than  them  so  this
[12:47] five  now  thinks  that  she's  an  eight 
 because  of  the  hundreds  of  Tinder 
 matches  that  she's  getting  and  now 
 she'll  only  [ __ ]  guys  who  are  eight  nine
[12:52] and  tens  but  these  guys  won't  want  to 
 get  into  a  serious  relationship  with  her 
 which  means  that  she  will  like  this
[12:57] sounds  [ __ ]  gross  and  I  don't  mean  to 
 be  like  sexist  but  she  will  get  ran 
 through  by  the  Chads  that  don't  want  a 
 real  relationship  with  her  because  they
[13:02] still  see  her  as  a  five  even  though  she 
 sees  herself  as  an  eight  you  know  this 
 is  like  the  sort  of  conventional  girl
[13:07] that  you  see  who's  like  oh  you  know  all 
 guys  are  the  same  guys  keep  like  guys 
 only  want  one  thing  and  stuff  like  guess 
 why  she's  saying  that  because  she's
[13:12] ahead  he's  like  instant  sexual 
 experiences  with  guys  who  then  don't 
 want  to  get  into  a  real  relationship
[13:17] with  her  because  her  you  know  her  sort 
 of  image  of  herself  has  been  inflated  by 
 all  the  little  Chomps  messaging  her  then
[13:22] she's  had  so  much  sex  with  so  many 
 different  guys  that  then  that  reduces 
 her  ability  to  even  pair  bond  and  stay
[13:29] true  with  one  guy  in  the  future  this  is 
 where  we  get  controversial  and  like 
 right  now  I'll  be  totally  honest  I  have
[13:34] a  fear  that  I  don't  even  want  to  record 
 the  rest  of  this  video  because  it  might 
 not  be  worth  me  literally  losing  my 
 entire  channel  for  this  video  I  would
[13:40] love  to  get  canceled  for  what  I'm  about 
 to  say  and  I  was  trying  to  say  in  the 
 most  like  uninsalting  way  possible  but 
 this  same  moment  then  who  thinks  of
[13:46] herself  here  even  though  she  is  here  and 
 she's  been  then  sleeping  with  well  she 
 you  know  she  wants  these  guys  and  she'll
[13:51] happen  against  her  relationship  with 
 them  so  you  know  they  end  up  meeting  up 
 going  on  a  date  and  then  they  [ __ ]  her 
 and  then  they  don't  like  reply  because
[13:56] these  guys  want  a  girl  up  there  this 
 girl  has  now  slept  with  10  guys  20  guys
[14:01] and  there's  quite  gut-wrenching  research 
 that  shows  that  when  a  woman  has  slept 
 around  her  ability  to  stay  faithful
[14:07] drastically  decreases  in  fact  it  is 
 research  this  is  not  like  my  sexist 
 opinion  there  is  real  core  research  for
[14:13] this  that  the  number  one  indicator  of  a 
 woman  initiating  a  divorce  and  also
[14:18] getting  into  an  affair  is  her 
 pre-marital  sex  history  the  number  one 
 indicator  that  she  will  divorce  you  or
[14:24] cheat  on  you  is  simply  just  how  many 
 guys  she  has  slept  with  before  you 
 what's  interesting  is  that  it  is  not
[14:29] about  the  number  of  times  that  she  has 
 had  sex  or  woman  could  have  sex  with  her 
 boyfriend  ten  thousand  times  and  that
[14:34] would  actually  like  affect  her  less  than 
 if  she  had  10  hookups  just  one  time  each 
 so  with  the  promotion  of  degeneracy
[14:40] women  essentially  become  corrupted  and 
 that  largely  destroys  their  ability  to 
 be  able  to  like  stay  faithful  with  the
[14:46] guide  they  eventually  want  to  really  get 
 with  and  this  is  the  dynamic  you  see  of 
 like  a  bunch  of  like  you  know  younger
[14:51] girls  who  have  been  really  pushed  to  be 
 like  so  sexually  free  when  they're  16 
 and  17  18  having  sex  since  they  were
[14:56] like  13  years  old  going  to  parties  in 
 the  18  19  20  you  know  just  enjoying 
 themselves  Girls  Just  Want  to  Have  Fun 
 and  Stuff  double  digit  body  counts  and
[15:02] you  know  guys  aren't  like  free  from  the 
 responsibilities  of  this  as  well  I'll 
 discuss  guys  but  I  just  want  to  talk 
 about  what  happens  to  girls  she  gets  the
[15:07] 22  23  24  she  wants  to  start  taking 
 things  a  bit  more  seriously  she  slept 
 with  15  guys  one  of  these  guys  she's  you
[15:12] know  had  a  couple  of  relationships  here 
 and  there  and  eventually  when  she's  29 
 years  old  30  years  old  31  you  know  she's
[15:18] had  like  10  years  working  and  everything 
 and  now  she  really  wants  to  get  marriage 
 got  pressure  from  her  parents  to  get  to 
 have  kids  and  everything  then  she  meets
[15:24] a  chump  like  you  and  you're  a  real  man 
 who'll  take  care  of  her  who  doesn't  just 
 want  her  for  sex  like  all  those  [ __ ]
[15:29] boys  did  yeah  all  those  [ __ ]  that 
 they  just  used  then  she  meets  a  real  man 
 like  you  a  real  man  a  man  who  doesn't
[15:35] really  care  about  her  sexual  history 
 because  he's  so  secure  in  himself  so  she 
 eventually  meets  the  guy  who's  like  the
[15:40] sweetheart  that  she's  always  wanted  and 
 you  know  she  falls  in  love  yeah  he's 
 amazing  and  you  know  he's  so  happy  yeah
[15:45] I've  met  my  princess  and  you  know  her 
 pastel  it's  okay  and  then  her  ability  to 
 actually  stay  faithful  with  this  guy  is
[15:50] just  [ __ ]  like  you  know  the  data 
 shows  that  it's  lowered  but  if  we  think 
 about  it  in  like  an  individual  case  what
[15:55] a  realistic  scenario  might  be  is  that 
 you  know  six  months  they've  been 
 together  one  year  they've  got  a  child
[16:00] two  years  three  years  they've  got  two 
 children  and  you  know  years  of  my  Bible 
 years  she's  had  children  and  everything
[16:05] now  she's  focused  on  the  children  she's 
 maybe  in  work  and  stuff  and  she 
 reminisces  of  like  the  Chad  from  10 
 years  ago  who  like  you  know  used  to
[16:10] pound  the  [ __ ]  out  of  her  and  she  ends 
 up  like  you  know  just  like  being  a 
 little  bit  free  on  a  voice  call  with  one
[16:15] of  her  girlfriends  and  they're  just 
 talking  and  you  know  they  just  like 
 subtly  keep  their  voice  down  like  oh 
 yeah  do  you  remember  Chad  like  he  just
[16:20] came  back  into  this  city  today  and  she's 
 like  oh  my  God  you  know  his  dick  was  so 
 big  and  everything  and  he  slept  with  me 
 so  like  it  was  so  [ __ ]  cool  to
[16:26] completely  like  that  one  time  him  and 
 his  friends  did  you  know  and  then 
 imagine  her  husband's  like  listening  in 
 from  the  door  I  know  this  seems  like
[16:32] weird  as  [ __ ]  like  massaging  it  but  like 
 bro  this  is  real  real  stuff  that  happens 
 for  guys  it's  a  very  interesting  case
[16:37] about  Tick  Tock  well  not  just  Tick  Tock 
 but  you  know  just  the  degeneracy  leads 
 to  this  because  guys  then  you  know  we've
[16:43] already  had  this  natural  impulse  inside 
 of  us  to  like  [ __ ]  a  lot  a  lot  and  so 
 when  we're  then  heavily  promoted  to  do
[16:49] so  and  it's  kind  of  open  to  you're  being 
 sold  sex  more  than  you  realize  like 
 you're  being  castrated  like  all  these
[16:54] porn  websites  Tick  Tock  social  media  you 
 know  like  they  know  that  you're  so 
 addicted  to  sex  so  that  they've  just
[16:59] like  allowed  women  since  you  know 
 presented  themselves  in  this  way  because 
 then  they're  just  hooking  your  attention
[17:04] and  they  make  more  money  from  you  and  so 
 the  majority  of  guys  go  through  life 
 just  totally  just  addicted  and  just
[17:09] distracted  by  like  the  sexual  [ __ ]  they 
 see  on  screens  by  you  know  movies  and 
 music  videos  and  porn  and  everything  and
[17:15] the  top  10  of  the  Chads  you  know  the  top 
 10  percent  of  guys  they're  eligible  to 
 have  sex  and  so  it's  a  really  weird  good
[17:20] Dynamic  where  like  the  literally  the 
 majority  of  guys  have  a  porn  addiction 
 they're  totally  lonely  and  yet  just  a
[17:25] small  percentage  of  men  have  got 
 literally  an  astronomical  body  count 
 like  I've  slept  with  so  many  women  that
[17:30] you  wouldn't  even  believe  you  know 
 there's  men  out  there  who  have  quite 
 literally  slept  with  thousands  of  women 
 and  there's  a  fair  amount  of  guys  who
[17:35] were  slept  with  hundreds  of  women  and 
 yet  there's  millions  billions  of  guys 
 who've  never  even  kissed  the  girl  before
[17:40] so  all  of  these  problems  you  know  stem 
 from  degeneracy  degeneracy  is  promoted 
 by  Tick  Tock  and  all  these  problems  lead
[17:45] to  a  weak  country  it  leads  to  a  country 
 that  doesn't  have  a  strong  family  unit
[17:50] it  leads  to  a  country  that  has  men  who 
 don't  have  children  who  don't  have  wives 
 to  work  hard  for  and  so  those  men  just
[17:56] kind  of  you  know  sleep  away  into  the 
 darkness  and  just  go  to  work  grudgingly 
 come  back  and  just  like  jack  off  and  10
[18:02] years  from  now  that'll  be  the  exact  same 
 routine  but  they'll  come  back  and 
 exchange  0.1  ethereum  for  a  cuddle  in
[18:07] virtual  reality  [ __ ]  metaverse  Tick 
 Tock  isn't  entirely  to  blame  for  this
[18:12] because  degeneracy  has  started  in  these 
 Western  countries  for  a  while  but  how
[18:17] Tick  Tock  comes  into  this  equation  is 
 very  very  interesting  there  is  a  term 
 called  subversion  subversion  is  a  term
[18:24] for  destroying  your  enemy's  culture  from 
 the  inside  it's  like  a  war  tactic  there
[18:30] is  literally  a  war  tactic  that  discusses 
 how  to  destroy  a  nation  without  actually
[18:35] going  to  war  and  it's  by  degrading  their 
 culture  and  the  strength  of  their  men
[18:40] and  there  is  a  war  strategist  a  very 
 famous  Chinese  War  strategist  from  like 
 ages  ago  hundreds  or  maybe  thousands  of
[18:45] years  ago  called  Sun  Tau  and  there's  a 
 book  called  The  Art  of  War  and  in  this
[18:50] Chinese  book  of  like  war  strategy  it 
 says  that  one  of  the  greatest  war 
 strategies  out  there  is  to  destroy  the
[18:56] enemy  country  without  even  fighting  a 
 war  that  they  realize  that  their 
 fightings  essentially  to  like  have  an
[19:01] invisible  war  that  the  enemy  country 
 doesn't  even  realize  that  they're  at  war 
 that  strategy  has  been  used  to  create
[19:07] Tick-Tock  it  is  literally  destroying 
 like  the  culture  the  values  of  other 
 countries  promoting  degeneracy  at  like  a
[19:13] compounding  scale  weakening  the  men 
 there  I  heard  this  I  don't  know  if  this 
 is  true  but  school  kids  in  China  are
[19:18] being  given  the  art  of  water  study  in 
 school  like  that's  like  a  compulsory 
 reading  in  the  UK  we  have  [ __ ]  Biff
[19:24] and  Chip  like  we  have  like  these  books 
 that  we've  been  reading  since  like  you 
 know  like  oh  Biff  kicked  over  the  ball 
 into  his  neighbor's  backyard  and  he's
[19:30] got  to  go  get  it  we've  been  reading  this 
 [ __ ]  so  China's  been  preparing  for  war 
 openly  like  openly  stating  that  they  are
[19:36] going  to  war  and  everyone  here  is  too 
 busy  just  twerking  the  degeneracy  of  the
[19:41] West  is  unfounded  you  know  you've  heard 
 Tate  talk  about  London  being  like  a 
 failed  State  and  I  think  a  lot  of  people
[19:47] agree  without  like  looking  at  London  is 
 like  very  dangerous  and  everything  I'm 
 in  London  right  now  by  the  way  I'm  not 
 from  here  like  I'm  from  like  up  north  in
[19:52] Warrington  Manchester  but  like  this  is 
 my  first  time  really  coming  here  I  was 
 about  to  move  here  get  an  apartment  here
[19:57] and  when  I  heard  this  stuff  like  oh  you 
 know  London's  a  fail  State  it's  really 
 dangerous  there's  a  bunch  of  like 
 stabbings  and  stuff  here  I  was  like  oh
[20:02] you  know  it's  probably  overblown  it's 
 probably  in  like  the  broke  areas 
 London's  like  really  big  so  it's  like 
 it's  in  some  like  broke  ass  little  town
[20:07] close  to  London  or  something  I've  been 
 here  for  a  month  and  there's  been  like 
 four  quite  dangerous  like  instances  that
[20:12] we've  experienced  and  like  me  and  my 
 girl  we're  not  like  that  social  like 
 obviously  with  like  you  know  nice  people 
 and  stuff  like  we've  not  been  out
[20:18] partying  we've  not  been  out  every  single 
 day  I  literally  wake  up  and  just  work 
 all  day  and  we  go  to  the  gym  that's  like 
 the  only  time  that  we're  outside  of  the
[20:23] house  literally  just  yesterday  we  just 
 witnessed  that  guy  getting  robbed  like 
 we  were  here  we're  in  the  bedroom  right
[20:28] now  of  this  apartment  we're  staying  in 
 we're  here  like  screaming  outside  we 
 look  out  this  window  this  window  right
[20:33] [ __ ]  here  we  look  out  and  quite 
 literally  bro  50  meters  away  there's  a 
 delivery  driver  getting  robbed  by  two
[20:38] guys  they're  literally  punching  him 
 they're  looking  through  like  the  Box  you 
 know  like  the  mopeds  like  the  scooter
[20:43] guys  will  come  and  deliver  your  food  and 
 stuff  they've  got  like  a  little  box 
 where  the  food  is  kept  they're  like 
 going  through  that  whilst  I've  beaten
[20:48] the  [ __ ]  out  of  the  delivery  driver  I've 
 called  the  police  and  everything  and  I'm 
 just  watching  it  thinking  like  bro  those 
 guys  are  literally  robbing  this  guy  for
[20:54] like  20  pounds  worth  of  [ __ ]  food  it 
 shook  me  up  I  call  Sam  and  everything  we 
 just  kind  of  like  laugh  yeah  London's
[20:59] failed  and  everything  maybe  this  wasn't 
 a  good  idea  but  after  doing  that  bro  I 
 went  on  to  like  Google  and  everything 
 and  just  started  I  was  like  you  know
[21:04] what  I  actually  need  to  be  a  little  bit 
 more  anxious  because  this  shit's  real 
 and  I've  been  like  too  sheltered  so  I
[21:09] actually  did  what  Tate  recommended  I 
 went  on  to  Google  I  don't  recommend  it  I 
 don't  think  you  should  do  this  but  like 
 if  you're  interested  and  you're  morbidly
[21:14] interested  and  maybe  if  you're  over  18. 
 I  went  on  to  Google  and  I  just  searched 
 London  stabbing  and  I  actually  read  like
[21:19] in  detail  some  of  the  Articles  and  then 
 I'm  not  going  to  tell  you  where  just  in 
 cases  but  like  I  searched  for  the
[21:25] specific  area  that  I'm  in  and  search 
 stabbing  and  started  to  like  you  know 
 see  the  articles  of  people  being  stabbed
[21:30] near  here  and  where  it  would  say  which 
 street  they  were  stabbed  in  you  know 
 when  news  article  was  said  oh  he  was 
 killed  in  the  streets  I'd  copy  and  paste
[21:36] our  street  into  Google  Maps  bro  and  it 
 [ __ ]  shook  me  up  because  they  were 
 literally  literally  less  than  five
[21:42] minutes  walk  from  here  how  is  this 
 related  to  what  we're  talking  about  well 
 when  degeneracy  causes  a  nation  to  start
[21:47] like  you  know  declining  and  the  men 
 become  more  weak  and  the  men  don't  have 
 much  to  work  hard  for  then  the  country
[21:52] starts  like  performing  worse  the  hard 
 financial  time  starts  hitting  then 
 people  are  really  [ __ ]  broke  and  then 
 you  know  there's  no  [ __ ]  father  do
[21:57] you  think  the  people  who  are  stabbing 
 around  here  you  think  those  guys  have 
 got  like  good  quality  father  figures  in 
 the  home  of  course  not  they're
[22:02] generously  leading  to  the  father  being 
 killed  off  away  from  the  home  and  you 
 know  the  single  mother  who's  gonna  raise 
 the  child  and  so  these  guys  who  are  out
[22:07] here  stabbing  these  guys  who  are  out 
 here  [ __ ]  robbing  people  and 
 attacking  people  for  20  pounds  worth  of 
 food  I  can  guarantee  they're  not  gonna
[22:13] go  home  to  like  some  positive  loving 
 father  of  course  they're  not  right  the 
 two  guys  out  here  just  robbing  this  guy 
 for  20  pounds  worth  of  food  they're  not
[22:18] going  home  to  Some  Like  Loving  family 
 are  they  they're  not  going  home  to  some 
 loving  parents  masculine  father  feminine
[22:23] mother  are  they  the  father's  being 
 killed  away  from  the  home  and  when  the 
 father  gets  killed  the  boy  isn't  going
[22:28] to  be  raised  to  be  successful  the  thing 
 is  the  West  does  not  want  to  listen  to 
 these  statistics  I  think  this  video
[22:33] might  get  me  [ __ ]  fully  like  this 
 video  might  get  age  restricted  or 
 something  fine  this  video  might  get 
 demonetized  fine  I  fear  that  this  video
[22:39] would  literally  like  cause  me  to  get 
 silenced  and  I  really  like  I  don't  even 
 know  if  we're  gonna  release  this  video
[22:44] honestly  like  I've  already  had  a  madokas 
 and  it's  my  editor  I'll  get  him  to  do 
 the  first  draft  and  me  and  my  team  all 
 come  together  and  literally  just  see
[22:49] like  is  it  worth  the  risk  the  worst 
 doesn't  want  to  talk  about  this  there 
 are  severe  consequences  to  a  child  being
[22:55] raised  without  a  father  and  that 
 specifically  means  like  I  have  to  say 
 this  that  specifically  means  that  there
[23:00] are  problems  to  a  child  being  raised  by 
 a  single  mother  and  that  stems  from  the 
 degeneracy  that's  happening  it  stems
[23:05] from  this  you  go  girl  attitude  like  you 
 know  this  woman  who's  you  know  slept 
 around  more  and  then  she's  got  a  higher 
 body  count  then  now  she's  got  less  of  a
[23:11] chance  to  pair  bond  with  her  husband  and 
 then  she  eventually  goes  and  cheats  or 
 she  files  a  divorce  and  she  can  raise 
 the  kids  all  by  herself  because  this
[23:17] woman  who  is  a  victim  in  her  own  right 
 has  been  conditioned  and  brainwashed 
 since  five  years  old  to  say  that  yep  you
[23:22] can  do  everything  that  a  mankind  you 
 don't  need  a  man  you're  you  go  girl  yes 
 you  go  girl  you  can  have  a  career 
 children  and  raise  the  children  by
[23:27] yourself  you  don't  need  a  man  the 
 government  will  pay  for  you  men  are 
 being  act  like  exported  out  with  their
[23:32] families  and  this  is  what  the  result  is 
 what  do  you  hear  about  in  London  these 
 loved  and  standings  of  like  these
[23:38] [ __ ]  [ __ ]  up  young  men  who  are 
 going  around  with  knives  with  machetes 
 with  [ __ ]  swords  and  literally
[23:43] killing  innocent  people  that's  happening 
 because  of  only  two  things  it's 
 happening  because  the  father  has  been
[23:48] taken  away  from  the  home  and  the 
 father's  been  taken  away  because  of 
 degeneracy  because  of  tick  tock  and  also 
 what's  happening  because  of  poor  mental
[23:54] health  which  again  has  been  caused  by 
 Tick  Tock  and  Tick  Tock  again  is  not 
 just  the  entire  problem  in  porn  websites
[23:59] other  social  medias  I  told  you  that  this 
 would  get  a  lot  deeper  than  just  oh  it's
[24:04] you  know  it's  a  social  media  website  and 
 that's  not  good  for  us  maybe  you're 
 watching  this  right  now  and  you  think 
 I'm  absolutely  crazy  or  maybe  you're
[24:09] watching  this  with  so  much  [ __ ] 
 interest  because  it's  clicking  in  your 
 brain  you're  thinking  like  [ __ ]  now  the
[24:15] pieces  have  been  put  together 
 I  don't  know  as  like  a  macro  level 
 solution  to  this  I  really  don't  know  but
[24:21] I  know  for  certain  what  will  work  for 
 you 
 is  your  own  self-improvements
[24:26] it's  your  own  journey  of  delaying 
 ratification  of  improving  your  mental 
 health  of  going  to  the  gym  and  becoming
[24:32] a  strong  man  because  you  will  be  needed 
 soon  now  is  this  the  best  time  of  your 
 entire  life  to  become  a  strong  man  and
[24:38] to  start  making  money  and  just  in  cases 
 you  need  to  like  leave  your  country  if 
 you're  in  the  west  if  you're  in  UK  or  us
[24:43] just  in  cases  you  need  to  fly  out  and 
 like  take  your  families  as  like  some 
 other  country  or  something  like  bro  I 
 don't  know  what's  gonna  happen  but  when
[24:49] I  researched  tiktok  as  I  did  for  this 
 video 
 I'm  scared  I'm  literally  not  saying  this
[24:55] to  like  you  know  invoke  your  emotion  and 
 hopefully  get  more  engagement  in  this 
 video  bro  this  is  something  that's  like 
 literally  kept  me  paranoid  for  like  the
[25:01] last  two  weeks  and  I  also  I  know  for  a 
 fact  some  people  are  going  to  reply  to 
 this  video  like  oh  yeah  he's  just 
 paranoid  oh  he's  so  anxious  and  stuff
[25:07] bro  like 
 if  you're  not  paranoid  I  think  that's 
 weird  I  don't  think  I'm  the  weird  one
[25:12] for  being  paranoid  when  we've  been 
 presented  with  this  data  I  think  the 
 people  who  aren't  paranoid  who  are  just
[25:17] still  with  the  same  mindset  oh  you  know 
 it'll  be  okay  like  just  because  we've 
 never  experienced  like  a  first-hand  war
[25:22] in  our  lives  you  know  if  you've  lived  in 
 the  UK  or  something  it  doesn't  mean  that 
 it  one  can't  happen  this  country  is
[25:28] right  now  who  have  literally  like  been 
 invaded  they  weren't  expecting  a  war 
 like  like  one  year  ago  everything  just
[25:33] seemed  kind  of  normal 
 things  can  change  and  if  it  helps  my 
 argument  at  all  every  rich  guy  that  I
[25:39] have  in  my  contact  list  is  preparing  for 
 war  like  they're  preparing  stacking  up 
 more  money  we're  all  literally  speaking
[25:44] about  like  okay  what's  the  plan  of 
 action  right  now  every  rich  guy  bro 
 every  single  guy  that  I  know  who's  in  my
[25:49] contact  list  who's  worth  more  than  one 
 million  every  single  one  of  them  is 
 slightly  paranoid  every  single  one  and
[25:54] in  fact  you  can  even  go  see  like  that 
 social  media  Pages  their  YouTube 
 channels  and  everything  and  they've 
 literally  been  like  subtly  mentioning
[25:59] [ __ ]  like  this  for  like  the  last  two 
 years  and  I  only  just  picked  up  now 
 what's  so  interesting  is  that  all  of
[26:04] like  the  broker  guys  all  like  you  know 
 the  broke  random  guys  out  there  who  you 
 know  just  so  ignorant  to  all  this  stuff
[26:09] they're  the  kind  of  guys  who  are  saying 
 like  oh  well  just  chill  bro  come  on  come 
 to  the  pub  come  come  play  some  video
[26:14] games  bro  distracting  themselves  that's 
 a  lot  to  take  in  so  I  don't  know  what 
 else  to  say  to  you  bro  watch  this  video 
 right  now
[26:19] do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah
