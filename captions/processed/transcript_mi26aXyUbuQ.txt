[00:00] finally  the  end  of  year  bonus  has 
 arrived  and  Jeffrey  is  Overjoyed  he  can 
 finally  afford  the  down  payment  on  the
[00:06] brand  new  Tesla  he's  gonna  show  people 
 how  successful  he  is  the  girls  are  gonna
[00:11] notice  him  now  on  the  other  hand  Adonis 
 was  sent  forth  into  the  World  by  his 
 father  to  fend  for  himself  he  would  have
[00:16] little  to  no  extra  cash  as  he  was 
 constantly  reinvested  into  his  business 
 The  Lads  around  him  would  have  the
[00:22] newest  laptops  and  fancy  cars  not  Adonis 
 Adonis  was  an  Empire  Builder  he  was  a
[00:27] young  lion  who  would  burn  with  passion 
 when  he  worked  on  his  mission  it  was 
 Adonis  that  the  women  always  noticed
[00:32] even  if  he  didn't  have  a  car  even  if  he 
 didn't  have  fancy  expensive  clothes  the 
 women  knew  Adonis  was  going  places  and
[00:38] they  wanted  to  come  along  for  the  ride 
 gather  around  little  bro  I'm  gonna  walk 
 you  through  six  reasons  why  girls  think
[00:43] that  you  are  quite  unattractive  the 
 first  reason  why  women  are  unattracted 
 to  you  is  because  you  are  broke  and  also
[00:50] unambitious  now  here  is  the  truth  that  a 
 lot  of  like  all  these  red  pill 
 successful  guys  won't  ever  tell  you  the 
 thing  is  you  can  still  get  a  lot  of
[00:56] girls  when  you're  broke  I'll  just  be 
 totally  honest  and  I  will  go  with  you 
 bro  I  [ __ ]  a  lot  of  women  when  I  was
[01:01] totally  broke  I'm  just  going  to  be 
 totally  honest  I  was  like  a  degenerate 
 [ __ ]  boy  and  stuff  and  I  was  broke  as 
 [ __ ]  as  well  I  was  like  I  was  just
[01:06] shooting  with  like  maybe  100  pounds  200 
 pounds  in  my  bank  account  bringing  these 
 women  up  to  my  shooting  Flats  you  can  be
[01:11] broke  honestly  you  can  be  broke  and 
 still  be  attracted  to  women  but  you  must 
 be  ambitious  at  the  same  time  now  being
[01:17] broke  and  unambitious  is  totally  and 
 utterly  [ __ ]  unattractive  and 
 repulsive  to  women  women  are  totally
[01:23] unattracted  to  the  guy  who's  broke  and 
 just  seems  okay  with  it  he's  just 
 playing  video  games  he's  just  smoking
[01:28] weed  although  he's  a  loser  but  the  broke 
 guy  who's  very  ambitious  he's  got  a  big 
 stream  to  for  example  build  a  business
[01:33] or  something  women  still  have  a  lot  of 
 Attraction  if  not  even  more  for  a  guy 
 like  that  because  that  seems  so  exciting 
 she  wants  to  see  your  burning  desire  for
[01:40] success  and  there's  a  way  that  we  can  do 
 this  together  go  to  the  description  of

 iman's  doing  as  well  go  to  that  top  Link 
 in  the  description  right  now  click  on  it
[02:01] and  sign  up  the  second  reason  why  girls 
 think  you're  unattractive  and  a  lot  of 
 like  guys  who  are  newer  to  dating  must
[02:06] understand  this  because  this  is 
 something  that  you're  not  really  taught 
 you're  not  mysterious  girls  are  very 
 very  much  attracted  to  guys  that  they
[02:12] don't  totally  know  even  through  marriage 
 let's  say  even  through  a  40-year 
 relationship  you  want  to  have  some
[02:17] elements  of  mystery  about  you  guys  who 
 aren't  good  with  girls  do  the  exact 
 opposite  of  this  they  destroy  all  their
[02:22] Mystery  by  telling  the  girl  up  front 
 like  to  a  face  of  all  of  the  boring 
 stuff  that  they  do  with  their  lives  she
[02:27] asks  like  oh  hey  like  did  you  have  a 
 good  day  what  did  you  do  today  and  the 
 boring  guy  who's  unattractive  to  girls
[02:32] will  answer  her  questions  seriously 
 because  he's  never  been  taught  this  by 
 like  an  older  brother  the  third  reason
[02:37] why  you  may  be  unattractive  to  girls  is 
 that  you're  not  very  present  now  this  is 
 something  that  a  lot  of  girls  don't
[02:42] actually  consciously  think  they  don't 
 think  the  words  in  their  mind  like  oh  he 
 doesn't  meditate  but  subconsciously  it
[02:48] becomes  very  hard  to  like  and  be 
 attracted  to  someone  who  isn't  present 
 now  what  do  I  mean  by  being  present
[02:54] being  present  is  kind  of  like  a  state 
 when  you  aren't  overthinking  about 
 something  now  the  shy  guy  who's  not  very
[03:00] great  with  girls  won't  be  present  when 
 he's  around  a  girl  he'll  be  overthinking 
 of  like  what  to  do  what  to  do  with  his
[03:05] hands  or  like  what  to  say  next  like  as 
 the  girl's  talking  to  him  he'll 
 literally  be  thinking  words  in  his  brain 
 of  like  what  to  say  next  and  that  he
[03:11] just  looks  like  a  little  bit  AFK  like 
 you  know  that  phrase  AFK  away  from 
 keyboard  people  who  aren't  present  look
[03:16] AFK  like  you  literally  see  them  like 
 zone  out  a  little  bit  and  you'll  just 
 see  them  like  their  eyes  will  just  be
[03:21] blank  and  then  they'll  like  say 
 something  because  you  can  see  they've 
 been  deep  in  thoughts  and  when  you're 
 overthinking  like  this  and  you're  not
[03:26] present  and  you're  speaking  to  a  girl 
 the  thing  is  she's  gonna  notice  because 
 she  will  ask  you  a  question  like  that
[03:32] question  we  just  said  like  she'll  ask 
 you  like  oh  you  know  what  did  you  do 
 today  and  because  you're  not  conscious 
 because  you're  not  present  your  brain's
[03:37] just  gonna  quickly  just  like  tell  the 
 truth  and  destroy  all  mystery  to  that 
 kind  of  question  the  fourth  reason  why
[03:42] girls  think  you're  unattractive  and  I'm 
 just  gonna  be  brutally  honest  it's 
 literally  you're  physical  attractiveness
[03:48] like  you're  not  actually  a  physically 
 attractive  guy  and  there's  many  reasons 
 for  this  I'd  say  the  number  one  reason
[03:53] that  you  have  control  over  is  your 
 physique  how  your  body  looks  are  you 
 muscular  are  you  in  shape  are  you  do  you
[03:59] have  a  low  body  fat  percentage  do  you 
 look  athletic  strong  or  sexy  you're 
 going  to  do  something  right  now  and  you 
 might  need  to  pause  the  video  go  in
[04:05] front  of  a  mirror  take  your  shirt  off 
 and  you  know  what  take  your  pants  off 
 literally  I  know  this  is  weird  as  [ __ ] 
 but  literally  just  go  get  naked  in  front
[04:10] of  like  your  bathroom  mirror  and  just 
 look  at  your  body  and  just  ask  yourself 
 this  question  is  this  the  kind  of  body
[04:15] that  women  lust  over  is  this  the  kind  of 
 body  that  women  write  like  erotica 
 novels  about  is  this  the  kind  of  body
[04:22] that  a  girl  may  want  a  screenshot  to 
 send  to  a  friend  in  a  good  way  that  like 
 oh  [ __ ]  look  at  look  how  how  hot  this
[04:28] guy  is  look  how  sexy  he  is  or  is  it  the 
 opposite  way  around  that  girl  would  like 
 screenshot  to  send  to  a  friend  like  oh 
 yeah  this  guy  looks  like  a  little  Trump
[04:33] like  look  oh  like  which  one  is  it  bro 
 now  you  might  be  very  young  and  you 
 don't  need  to  make  this  like  sexual  but
[04:38] just  ask  yourself  is  this  the  kind  of 
 body  that's  attractive  to  girls  because 
 honestly  if  100  of  guys  did  this  over  90
[04:43] of  them  would  have  to  answer  no  and  you 
 they  they  just  sink  their  heads  down
[04:49] towards  like  they're  weirdly  flabby 
 weirdly  skinny  bodies  just  feeling  kind
[04:54] of  sad  about  themselves  now  we  can  be 
 sat  here  and  be  really  sad  honestly  we 
 can  you  know  oh  like  life's  so  hard  you
[05:00] have  the  ability  to  mold  your  body  into 
 the  kind  of  physique  that  you  want  and 
 building  muscle  whilst  keeping  a  low
[05:06] body  fat  percentage  will  do  wonders  for 
 you  perhaps  the  core  reason  why  women
[05:11] think  you're  unattractive  is  just 
 because  you  don't  have  a  good  body  now 
 the  thing  is  your  face  is  different  it's
[05:16] a  lot  harder  to  change  your  face  there's 
 still  things  you  can  do  you  can  grow  a 
 beard  you  can  groom  you  can  like  you 
 know  improve  your  teeth  you  can  Mew  you
[05:22] can  all  you  can  still  do  these  things 
 but  they're  a  lot  like  less  impactful 
 than  literally  just  bulking  the  [ __ ]  up
[05:28] building  a  lot  of  muscle  and  then 
 cutting  down  so  you  have  that  muscle  but 
 now  you're  lean  again  it's  the  single 
 greatest  thing  you  can  do  to  become  more
[05:34] attractive  in  the  description  of  this 
 video  there's  a  link  titled  how  you  can 
 get  girls  you  might  be  interested  in
[05:39] that  the  fifth  reason  why  girls  think 
 you're  unattractive  now  this  is  kind  of 
 like  a  debated  reason  online  a  lot  of
[05:44] people  don't  really  agree  with  that  this 
 is  a  reason  so  I  might  be  wrong  here  but 
 it's  your  personality  now  a  lot  of  guys
[05:49] and  you  know  the  online  space  on  YouTube 
 on  like  red  pill  self-improved  all  this 
 stuff  there's  all  these  debates  of  like
[05:54] what's  the  most  important  is  it  looks  is 
 it  personality  is  it  game  status  money 
 the  thing  is  personality  seems  to  always
[06:01] be  overlooked  people  say  like  it's  not 
 really  important  as  long  as  you're 
 attractive  and  the  thing  is  you  can  be 
 an  [ __ ]  or  an  upstanding  citizen  of
[06:08] you  know  your  society  and  both  of  them 
 are  quite  nice  but  there  is  a  certain 
 kind  of  personality  that  is  inherently
[06:13] unattractive  to  girls  and  it's  not 
 really  spoken  about  online  can  you  guess 
 what  it  is  the  personality  of  a  weirdo
[06:18] the  personality  of  a  guy  who  just 
 doesn't  have  good  social  mannerisms  it's
[06:23] like  the  kind  of  guy  who  just  doesn't 
 get  like  what  is  somewhat  normal  you 
 probably  had  one  in  your  like  high
[06:28] school  or  something  you  know  like  did 
 you  have  like  a  guy  who  like  who  like 
 gallops  through  the  [ __ ]  hallways  or
[06:33] like  the  guy  who  like  makes  cat  noises 
 or  something  even  if  he  was  attractive 
 bro  imagine  that  same  guy  imagine  if  you
[06:38] look  like  a  tick  tock  boy  the  thing  is 
 he  could  be  really  attractive  but  if  he 
 still  did  this  weird  [ __ ]  there's  no
[06:43] girl  thinking  oh  like  I  hope  you  [ __ ] 
 me  they're  like  he'd  instantly  seem
[06:48] unattractive  and  finally  the  sixth  and 
 perhaps  worst  reason  why  girls  think 
 you're  unattractive  and  this  goes  for  a
[06:54] lot  of  young  guys  watching  this 
 especially  you  bro  you  are  needy  you 
 have  the  actions  of  an  needy  guy  who
[07:01] doesn't  have  many  other  options  the 
 majority  please  believe  this  this  is  so 
 easy  for  you  to  right  now  just  think  yep
[07:07] he's  not  really  talking  about  me  bro  I'm 
 talking  to  you  the  overwhelming  majority 
 of  guys  are  needy  when  it  comes  to  sex
[07:13] and  love  and  relationships  because  the 
 thing  is  we  can't  be  blamed  for  this  sex 
 love  and  relationships  are  a  fundamental
[07:19] need  of  like  you  know  they  are  a  need 
 how  interesting  is  that  like  love  is
[07:24] something  that  we  absolutely  need  as 
 human  beings  but  if  you  express  that 
 need  if  you  act  like  you  need  it  you
[07:30] don't  get  it  because  girls  aren't 
 attracted  to  guys  who  are  needy  how  do 
 you  come  across  as  needy  well  you  reply
[07:35] too  fast  to  a  text  messages  you  just 
 care  too  much  about  this  one  particular 
 girl  because  the  thing  is  like  bro  girls
[07:41] know  where  they  stand  honestly  like  a 
 lot  of  guys  say  like  girls  are  very 
 delusional  like  girls  kind  of  know  what
[07:46] their  value  is  and  they  know  that  if 
 you're  kind  of  like  desperately  trying 
 to  get  them  they  know  that  like  it's
[07:52] it's 
 unequal  and  so  it  becomes  really  deeply 
 unattractive  when  you  treat  a  girl  like
[07:57] better  than  you're  supposed  to  and 
 you're  like  you're  you  need  her  more 
 than  she  thinks  that  she's  actually  were
[08:02] and  with  so  many  guys  on  social  media 
 and  Snapchat  and  Tinder  it  becomes  so
[08:07] easy  to  be  that  kind  of  needy  guy 
 because  you  know  it  doesn't  seem  that 
 harmful  for  you  to  just  send  another
[08:13] text  to  the  girl  who's  not  replied  you 
 know  just  just  seeing  like  maybe  she'll 
 reply  to  this  one  now  you  might  have 
 gotten  to  this  far  of  the  video  feeling
[08:18] pretty  upset  with  you  on  the  things  that 
 we've  covered  here  and  just  thinking 
 like  this  feels  a  little  bit  hopeless  I
[08:25] feel  unattractive  how  attractive  you  are 
 to  women  is  actually  very  controllable  I
[08:31] am  certain  of  this  there  are  spaces 
 online  where  like  a  bunch  of  guys  get 
 together  and  literally  like  just  argue
[08:37] this  out  and  say  like  no  like  there's  no 
 way  to  become  more  attractive  to  girls 
 like  however  attractive  you  are  to  girls
[08:42] is  just  fixed  and  the  thing  is  I'm 
 personally  living  proof  that  this  is  not 
 the  case  like  if  you've  seen  pictures  of
[08:48] me  when  I  was  like  16  17  18  years  old 
 bro  like  I  wasn't  attractive  just 
 physically  I  wasn't  horribly  you  know
[08:54] ugly  or  anything  but  I  wasn't  like  a  hot 
 guy  also  just  with  my  personality  and  so 
 literally  I  was  not  getting  any  girls  no
[08:59] attraction  from  girls  whatsoever  if  you 
 followed  my  story  for  the  last  few  years 
 you  know  that  especially  near  the  start
[09:04] of  this  year  in  2022  like  I  don't  want 
 to  sound  like  you're  not  like  a  dick  or 
 like  you  know  [ __ ]  boy  or  something  but 
 like  the  biggest  problem  in  my  life  at
[09:10] the  start  of  this  year  was  that  I  was 
 sleeping  with  too  many  girls  and  it  was 
 actually  like  damaging  me  spiritually 
 and  I  know  there's  so  many  guys  who
[09:16] would  watch  this  and  think  oh  he's 
 boasting  or  he's  lying  it's  like  if  you 
 have  watched  a  bunch  of  my  videos  and 
 you  remember  those  times  when  I  would
[09:21] post  videos  literally  saying  like  I  keep 
 sleeping  with  too  many  girls  it's  become 
 a  problem  now  and  it's  like  it's 
 actually  hurting  my  soul  I  went  from
[09:27] being  that  kind  of  like  little  virgin 
 kissless  guy  who  was  just  weird  around 
 girls  who  no  girl  was  like  really
[09:33] interested  in  to  having  a  problem  like 
 that  all  these  people  online  who  doubt 
 that  a  young  man  can  improve  himself  to
[09:39] get  to  the  point  that  he  has  an 
 abundance  of  women  after  him  I  believe 
 they're  wrong  and  I  think  I'm  living 
 proof  of  that  and  maybe  you  could  be
[09:45] living  proof  of  it  too  do  this  right  now
