[00:00] Jeffrey  wants  to  increase  his 
 testosterone  I  must  have  three  low 
 levels  and  that's  why  I'm  not  seeing  any 
 progress  in  the  gym  that's  a  cope
[00:06] Jeffrey  and  you  know  it  don't  go  for  the 
 second  slice  of  pizza  oh  come  on  Jeffrey
[00:11] with  a  diet  like  that  habits  like  this 
 and  this  kind  of  mindset  well  of  course 
 you're  gonna  have  low  testosterone
[00:17] Jeffrey
[00:22] Adonis  doesn't  need  Fitness  YouTuber 
 juice  his  nuts  produce  all  the 
 testosterone  he  needs  naturally  all  of
[00:28] the  fitness  YouTubers  stare  at  Adonis 
 and  wonder  how  he  does  it  this  is 
 because  Adonis  has  optimized  his
[00:33] lifestyle  for  testosterone  production  he 
 gets  good  sleep  he  eats  clean  he  lifts 
 weights  he  does  all  those  things  but
[00:38] there  are  a  special  three  proven  ways 
 that  no  one  else  does  that  has 
 dramatically  increased  adonis's
[00:43] testosterone  levels  I'm  not  gonna  waste 
 your  time  in  this  video  and  tell  you  the 
 same  advice  that  everyone  else  is  going
[00:48] to  tell  you  oh  sleep  lift  heavy  weight 
 you've  heard  that  advice  50  times  I'm 
 not  gonna  waste  your  time  there's  three 
 other  ways  to  improve  your  testosterone
[00:53] that  you're  probably  not  doing  that 
 you've  probably  never  heard  of  before 
 because  most  people  don't  actually  speak 
 about  these  but  these  ways  are  actually
[00:59] more  effective  at  improving  your 
 testosterone  than  anything  else  you've
[01:04] ever  heard  what  I'm  about  to  tell  you 
 will  improve  your  testosterone  more  than 
 sleeping  will  the  testosterone  reduction
[01:10] of  poor  sleep  is  about  15  every  night  if 
 you've  got  a  testosterone  of  500
[01:15] nanograms  per  deciliter  it'll  go  down  to 
 around  430  with  a  bad  night  of  sleep  I'm 
 gonna  to  show  you  something  that  will
[01:20] have  double  to  Triple  that  impact  and  no 
 one  is  speaking  about  this  we'll  start 
 with  some  words  from  Adonis  on  the
[01:26] importance  of  having  high  testosterone 
 reaching  the  Pinnacle  of  masculinity  is 
 a  locked  door  high  testosterone  levels
[01:32] are  the  key  yet  most  men  never  find  this 
 key  these  three  are  actually  very 
 interesting  and  I'm  so  excited  to  bring
[01:38] this  to  you  the  first  proven  way  to 
 drastically  increase  your  testosterone 
 is  to  drastically  decrease  your  cortisol
[01:44] cortisol  it's  kind  of  like  our  stress 
 hormones  you  know  we  feel  stress  and 
 you've  heard  the  term  stress  before  but
[01:49] there's  a  real  like  scientific  like 
 hormone  thing  inside  of  us  that  goes  up 
 when  we're  stressed  when  that  goes  up
[01:55] testosterone  goes  down  so  what  we  need 
 to  do  is  we  need  to  decrease  cortisol 
 stress  which  then  will  naturally
[02:00] increase  our  testosterone  the  single 
 greatest  way  that  you  can  decrease 
 cortisol  is  through  regulating  your
[02:06] breathing  every  other  thing  that  you've 
 seen  like  supplements  antidepressants 
 therapy  anything  that's  for  you  know 
 stress  it's  all  a  secondary  tactic  that
[02:12] you  can  use  the  primary  tactic  for 
 improving  your  health  and  especially  for 
 lowering  stress  is  to  breathe  correctly
[02:17] most  people  are  [ __ ]  at  breathing  I  will 
 say  this  again  you  are  [ __ ]  at  breathing
[02:22] you  suck  at  breathing  so  much  that  it's 
 decreasing  your  health  and  this  is  one 
 of  the  most  important  things  I  can  tell
[02:27] you  the  correct  way  to  breathe  is  solely 
 through  your  nose  never  through  your 
 mouth  the  modern  world  isn't  set  up  for 
 us  to  breathe  correctly  so  there's  a  lot
[02:33] of  like  public  speaking  like  for  example 
 for  me  I'm  a  public  speaker  in  some 
 sense  and  when  you're  speaking  you  know
[02:38] full  sentences  and  you've  got  like  a 
 speech  to  give  to  someone  you  naturally 
 breathe  from  your  mouth  every  breath
[02:43] that  you  take  from  your  mouth  destroys 
 your  health  more  than  you  realize  you 
 need  to  breathe  from  your  nose  and  you 
 know  what  this  is  a  large  proportion  of
[02:49] people  who  can't  even  breathe  from  their 
 nose  because  it's  always  blocked  if 
 that's  you  this  is  gonna  seem  really 
 weird  but  the  way  to  unblock  your  nose
[02:54] isn't  any  of  the  [ __ ]  oh  do  this  do 
 this  thing  it's  not  any  of  that  the  way
[02:59] to  unblock  your  nose  is  just  to  use  your 
 nose  as  much  as  you  can  without 
 aggressively  fighting  how  blocked  it  is
[03:04] so  don't  be  sat  there  like 
 what  you're  going  to  do  is  just  breathe 
 silently  from  your  nose  as  much  as  you
[03:10] can  however  much  you  can  breathe  from 
 your  nose  it's  kind  of  like  how  much  you 
 should  breathe  from  your  nose  most 
 people  have  breathed  so  much  from  their
[03:16] mouth  or  they've  over  breathed  so  much 
 from  the  nose  and  now  the  nose  is 
 blocked  your  nose  almost  works  like  a 
 muscle  and  the  more  you  use  it  the  more
[03:21] that  you'll  actually  be  able  to  use  it 
 when  I  first  learned  this  my  nose  was 
 always  stuffy  and  I  always  had  like  a
[03:26] runny  nose  and  I  thought  that  was  just 
 me  I  thought  you  know  I  just  constantly 
 had  a  [ __ ]  cold  it  turns  out  that  I 
 just  de-trained  my  nose  to  actually  be
[03:32] able  to  breathe  so  I  prioritizing  nasal 
 breathing  throughout  the  day  and  now 
 it's  improved  significantly  that's  the
[03:37] first  and  major  step  to  improving  your 
 breathing  which  will  then  lower  your 
 cortisol  which  will  then  increase  your 
 testosterone  and  then  the  second  thing
[03:43] you  can  do  is  a  breathing  exercise  what 
 we'd  like  to  do  is  slow  down  and  calm 
 our  breathing  as  much  as  possible  and  we
[03:49] do  this  through  something  called  deep 
 breathing  I  have  a  10  minute  video  which 
 is  a  deep  breathing  follow  along  so  you 
 literally  just  stick  on  the  video  and
[03:54] follow  along  to  what  I  say  it'll  be 
 linked  as  a  card  in  the  description  go 
 follow  that  every  single  morning  and
[03:59] every  single  night  and  you  will  actually 
 feel  a  decrease  in  like  the  stress  that 
 you've  been  carrying  in  your  body  which
[04:04] then  will  increase  your  testosterone  you 
 can  get  get  up  to  a  55  zero  percent
[04:09] increase  in  your  testosterone  with  this 
 deep  breathing  exercise  number  two 
 sunlight  now  you've  probably  heard  of  so
[04:14] many  guys  in  the  testosterone  space  tell 
 you  to  supplement  vitamin  D  and  that's 
 pretty  good  advice  but  the  reason  why  we
[04:19] have  to  supplement  this  this  little  pill 
 is  because  we're  not  getting  enough 
 sunlight  anyway  I'm  very  fortunate  now
[04:24] that  I've  moved  to  UAE  I've  moved  to 
 Dubai  and  it's  literally  sunny  every 
 single  day  the  best  thing  that  you  can
[04:29] do  is  be  out  in  the  sun  for  as  many 
 hours  as  possible  you  can't  really 
 overdo  it  in  the  sun  you  know  all  those
[04:34] shitty  products  about  like  sun  cream  and 
 all  the  sun  cream  just  gives  you  cancer 
 and  I  don't  know  if  that's  a  conspiracy
[04:39] theory  but  like  literally  imagine  Primal 
 natural  humans  were  they  putting  on  sun 
 cream  no  they  were  literally  out  in  the
[04:45] Sun  every  single  day  for  most  of  the  day 
 if  you  imagine  our  hunter-gatherer 
 ancestors  the  true  like  Primal  high
[04:51] testosterone  humans  they  were  out  in  the 
 sun  all  day  every  day  they  weren't 
 wearing  clothes  they  had  direct  sunlight
[04:56] to  their  balls  and  there  was  a  recent 
 study  which  was  so  interesting  literally 
 all  they  did  was  tell  participants  to  go
[05:01] out  into  the  sun  three  times  a  week  for 
 half  an  hour  with  just  wearing  shorts 
 right  so  just  wearing  underwear  just 
 that  three  times  times  a  week  for  half
[05:07] an  hour  of  the  sunlight  not  even  like 
 you  know  in  a  very  hot  country  or 
 anything  but  just  literally  just  going 
 outside  and  just  you  know  staying
[05:12] outside  in  daylight  drastically 
 increased  not  just  testosterone  but
[05:17] romance  this  study  found  that  these 
 people  who  did  this  literally  became 
 more  romantic  and  sex  obsessed  why  do
[05:24] you  think  that  happened  you  might  think 
 wait  sunlight  increases  testosterone 
 that's  what  we  think  isn't  it  that's 
 what  the  title  of this  video  it
[05:29] increases  testosterone  no  no no  no 
 sunlight  doesn't  increase  testosterone  a 
 lack  of  sunlight  kills  it  you  clicked  on
[05:35] this  video  because  you  think  you've  got 
 the  symptoms  of  low  testosterone  you've 
 got  little  man  boobs  your  dick's  kind  of 
 small  your  balls  are  kind  of  small
[05:40] you're  not  very  masculine  you've  got  a 
 high-pitched  little  voice  you're  a 
 little  [ __ ]  you  clicked  on  this  video 
 because  you're  a  little  [ __ ]  and  you
[05:45] don't  want  to  hear  this  advice  to  you 
 you  don't  want  to  be  told  to  go  outside 
 do  you  and  yet  one  of  the  worst  things 
 that's  actually  happening  to  you  is  a
[05:51] lack  of  sunlight  if  you're  a  total 
 Jeffrey  you've  already  started 
 complaining  of  and  you've  already 
 started  coping  but  I'm  in  this  country
[05:56] and  there  isn't  much  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  no 
 no  no  we  don't  cope  around  the  edge 
 coping  is  for  Jeffrey's  we  try  to
[06:01] maximize  as  much  as  we  can  do  to  improve 
 ourselves  so  if  you  start  coping  and 
 you're  like  oh  well  you  know  in  my 
 country  know  getting  sunlight  getting
[06:07] daylight  doesn't  mean  that  the  sun  is 
 right  there  shining  directly  at  you  it 
 means  that  you  are  outside  in  the  middle
[06:13] of  the  day  because  if  you  can  see 
 outside  you  know  if  there's  light 
 outside  that  means  that  there's  sunlight 
 most  people  don't  understand  this  most
[06:18] people  think  sunlight  is  a  direct  sun 
 shining  right  at  you  that's  not  really 
 true  sunlight  is  what  happens  in  most
[06:23] countries  from  6  7  A.M  to  around  5  6  7 
 PM  if  you  can  see  outside  without  the
[06:28] use  of  like  street  lights  it's  daylight 
 so  even  if  you  live  in  the  UK  and  it's 
 like  a  gray  day  you  know  with  clouds  and
[06:34] there's  a  few  guys  there  stabbing  each 
 other  you  can  still  go  out  onto  your 
 garden  or  balcony  at  daytime  even  though
[06:39] there's  not  direct  sun  and  still  even 
 though  it's  a  bit  cold  literally  just 
 sit  there  shirtless  for  half  an  hour  go 
 on  your  phone  read  a  book  or  something
[06:45] and  that  will  still  increase  your 
 testosterone  because  if  you  don't  do 
 that  you  will  have  a  decrease  to  your 
 testosterone  levels  you  right  now  and  me
[06:51] and  every  other  guy  we  don't  even  know 
 how  much  testosterone  we're  supposed  to 
 have  because  we  spent  all  days  indoors 
 and  finally  we  need  to  discuss  the
[06:58] single  biggest  reported  testosterone 
 increase  out  of  every  study  so  far  there
[07:03] is  one  practice  that  has  been  shown  it's 
 a  400  your  testosterone  that  means  that
[07:08] four  times  increase  that  means  if  you 
 have  a  500  nanograms  of  testosterone
[07:13] this  practice  has  been  reported  to 
 increase  it  up  to  2  000.  that  is  a
[07:18] steroid  level  increase  I'm  surprised 
 that  this  hasn't  like  taken  over  the 
 Internet  with  this  study  because  some
[07:23] guys  have  spoke  about  this  but  not  not 
 enough  and  what  is  it  it's  semen 
 retention  but  not  just  semen  retention
[07:29] not  just  Nova  there's  a  very  special  way 
 to  do  this  that  most  people  never  even 
 think  of  that  if  you  did  it  and  it's
[07:34] [ __ ]  hard  but  if  you  could  do  it  you 
 will  get  this  like  steroid  level  boost 
 to  your  testosterone  level  so  first  of
[07:39] all  semen  retention  and  nofap  are  two 
 different  things  I'm  not  sure  if  you 
 actually  know  the  difference  no  fat  is 
 not  watching  porn  anymore  not  jacking
[07:44] off  like  Anonymous  semen  retention  is 
 specifically  not  ejaculating  so  for 
 example  I  was  on  nofap  age  17  to  22  23
[07:52] 24  right  I  was  on  nofap  but  I  was  still 
 having  sex  so  I  was  on  Nova  I  wasn't 
 masturbating  I  wasn't  much  important  but
[07:57] I  was  still  having  sex  and  with  sex  I 
 was  ejaculating  right  sex  and 
 ejaculation  are  usually  mixed  together 
 aren't  they  so  you  have  sex  you  know  you
[08:02] build  up  a  little bit  10  minutes 
 whatever  you  edge  a  little  bit  Go  Down 
 You're  Gonna  Change  positions  okay  we 
 all  know  that  and  Boston  up  right  that's
[08:07] normal  right  you've  always  seen  this 
 important  if  you're  old  enough  you've 
 had  sex  yourself  you  know  how  this  works 
 right  there  was  a  study  that  showed  that
[08:12] if  you  do  semen  retention  but  not  just 
 normal  semen  retention  if  you  do  semen
[08:17] retention  whilst  having  sex  the 
 testosterone  can  go  up  by  400  what  this
[08:22] means  essentially  you  have  sex  you  don't 
 not  you  have  sex  you  don't  ejaculate 
 this  has  been  shown  to  have  a  400 
 increase  in  testosterone  why  really
[08:28] think  all  this  why  the  researchers  can 
 improve  this  because  you  know  they  want 
 to  talk  about  sciencey  [ __ ]  so  they
[08:33] prove  to  us  the  science  right  they  prove 
 to  us  that  you  know  with  scientific 
 terms  if  a  man  and  a  woman  have 
 intercourse  and  the  man  stops
[08:38] preemptively  before  ejaculation  then  his 
 tests  are  shortly  they've  done  the 
 science  [ __ ]  right  but  they  weren't  able
[08:43] to  explain  why  it  skyrocketed  his 
 testosterone  and  I'm  so  glad  that  I've 
 got  my  sort  of  understanding  of
[08:48] psychology  Evolution  and  the  concept  of 
 like  sort  of  caveman  days  you  know  I'm 
 very  aligned  with  like  evolutionary  [ __ ]
[08:54] right  the  reason  why  you  will  get  the 
 biggest  Improvement  to  your  testosterone 
 level  similar  to  taking  steroids  when
[08:59] you  do  semen  retention  whilst  having  sex 
 you  have  sex  or  you  don't  nut  and  you 
 stop  before  you  ejaculate  it's  because
[09:04] something  in  your  primal  brain  realizes 
 that  you  were  so  close  to  achieving  the
[09:09] point  of  life  and  you  stopped  your 
 Primal  caveman  alpha  male  brain  gets
[09:14] turned  on  and  starts  to  think  [ __ ] 
 everything  of  Our  Lives  was  to  get  us  to 
 this  moment  to  ejaculate  or  reproduce
[09:20] that's  the  whole  point  that  is  the 
 mission  of  a  species  why  did  we  stop 
 when  we  were  literally  right  there  maybe 
 there's  enemies  maybe  it's  not  safe
[09:25] there's  got  to  be  a  reason  why  our 
 brains  think  in  this  so  let's  pump  him 
 full  of  testosterone  let's  make  him  four
[09:30] times  as  strong  four  times  as  masculine 
 that  is  the  single  greatest  reported
[09:35] increase  of  testosterone  ever  and  almost 
 no  one's  talking  about  this  I  explain 
 more  about  this  semen  retention  thing  in
[09:41] my  alpha  male  sex  course  it's  linked  in 
 the  description  next  to  the  three 
 bedroom  mistakes  that  you're  making  go

 like  it
