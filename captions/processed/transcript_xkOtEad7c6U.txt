[00:00] for  the  first  time  in  some  weeks  Jeffrey 
 has  left  his  house  and  now  he's  looking 
 for  some  women  to  speak  to  Okay  there
[00:05] she  is 
 I'm  gonna  do  it  Jeffrey  starts  sprinting 
 towards  her  Jessica  notes  him  charging
[00:10] at  her  and  she  starts  to  run  away  why 
 does  no  one  talk  to  me
[00:15] I've  done  it  it  honest  sees  the  whole 
 thing  that  just  happened  to  Jeffrey  let 
 me  ask  you  a  question  young  Jeffrey  do
[00:20] you  think  you're  attractive  to  women 
 Jeffrey  stutters  and  then  puts  his  head 
 down  and  then  Adonis  looks  to  his  left
[00:26] and  right  and  sees  a  whole  generation  of 
 men  who  are  lonely  this  is  a  problem
[00:31] that's  worth  solving  there's  multiple 
 steps  that  you  can  take  to  turn  up  the
[00:36] attraction  that  you  get  from  women  and 
 if  this  was  some  kind  of  Click  bait 
 video  which  wasn't  really  going  to  help 
 you  you  know  this  clickbait  like  number
[00:41] one  do  50  push-ups  in  the  mode  I'd  say 
 something  really  clickbait  to  entertain 
 you  but  the  first  way  to  find  out  if
[00:46] you're  attractive  to  women  or  literally 
 even  Step  Zero  is  something  that  a  lot 
 of  guys  aren't  going  to  understand
[00:51] they're  going  to  click  away  but  if  you 
 can  take  this  seriously  and  literally 
 listen  to  these  words  with  your  full 
 attention  I  promise  this  will  change
[00:56] your  life  forever  because  it  did  for  me 
 it's  around  10  12  years  ago  for  me  age 
 13  15.  I  was  genuinely  convinced  that  no
[01:03] girls  would  be  attracted  to  me  I  truly 
 had  this  belief  in  my  mind  that  I  was 
 literally  ugly  you  know  I  wasn't  like  a
[01:09] really  attractive  guy  but  I  wasn't  like 
 totally  ugly  I  was  in  the  UK  and  I  had 
 this  belief  that  the  girls  there  weren't
[01:14] attracted  to  Brown  guys  I  kind  of  had 
 this  like  anti  like  brown  anti-muslim 
 kind  of  mindset  it's  all  I  really  saw  on
[01:21] TV  was  like  oh  like  the  Muslims  are 
 terrorists  and  look  immigrations  are 
 problems  I  always  felt  like  bad  for 
 being  brown  skin  I  genuinely  believe
[01:27] that  no  girls  would  be  attracted  to  me 
 truly  and  I  know  that  there's  a  lot  of 
 guys  who  feel  this  way  and  one  lucky  day
[01:32] something  just  clicked  in  my  mind  when 
 this  singer  went  really  viral  in  the  UK 
 and  his  name  was  Zayn  Malik  he's  a
[01:38] singer  of  like  One  Direction  or 
 something  isn't  he's  pretty  attractive 
 guy  right  this  was  back  in  like  the 
 Facebook  days  so  I  don't  know  if  you
[01:43] were  like  on  social  media  back  then  but 
 this  was  back  in  Facebook  literally  10 
 years  ago  when  girls  would  share  like 
 just  pictures  of  guys  oh  my  God  he's  so
[01:49] hot  and  girls  started  to  do  this  for 
 Zayn  Malik  I  literally  saw  in  front  of 
 my  own  eyes  the  girls  that  I  had  crushes
[01:54] on  but  never  had  the  confidence  to  speak 
 to  because  I  was  sure  that  they  didn't 
 like  brown  guys  they  were  literally
[01:59] downloading  and  then  uploading  a  photo 
 of  this  Pakistani  guy  onto  their 
 Facebook  page  and  just  suddenly  that  one
[02:05] day  that  belief  in  my  mind  got  destroyed 
 and  I  realized  that  it  wasn't  being 
 brown  skinned  that  was  holding  me  back
[02:10] so  what  was  it  a  bunch  of  things  that  I 
 had  to  fix  I  was  addicted  to  porn  at  the 
 time  I  was  just  playing  video  games
[02:15] genuinely  had  a  look  at  myself  and 
 thought  yeah  to  be  honest  if  I  was  a 
 girl  I  probably  wouldn't  be  attracted  to 
 this  version  of  me  like  I'd  love  if  a
[02:21] girl  was  attracted  to  me  and  she  played 
 video  games  too  and  she  just  wanted  to 
 date  a  loser  but  then  I  can't  really 
 blame  her  if  she  doesn't  it  all  started
[02:27] for  me  with  these  deep  internal  beliefs 
 and  you  can  probably  understand  why  I've 
 gave  you  this  like  disclaimer  just  a  few
[02:32] minutes  ago  that  this  isn't  like  a  very 
 attractive  clickbait  thing  for  us  to 
 talk  about  I'd  just  be  like  number  one
[02:37] make  sure  you  wear  pants  and  then  do  the 
 belt  buckle  like  this  yes  here's 
 something  that  you  can  do  right  now  huh
[02:42] it  goes  deep  into  I  think  for  the 
 majority  of  guys  they  are  held  back  not 
 by  real  world  things  but  simply  by  their
[02:48] beliefs  and  of  course  we  can  understand 
 that  because  the  things  that  are 
 happening  in  the  dating  scene  these  days 
 it's  very  cut  throats  and  so  of  course
[02:54] that  leads  to  negative  thinking  and 
 negative  beliefs  in  the  minds  of  men 
 around  the  world  and  you've  probably  had 
 these  kinds  of  thoughts  too  even  if
[02:59] you've  not  wanted  to  consciously  admit 
 it  you're  thinking  about  those  videos 
 that  you've  watched  where  some  guys  made 
 like  a  profile  on  Tinder  attending  he's
[03:04] a  woman  and  he's  just  pictures  of  like 
 very  unattractive  obese  women  and  they 
 get  400  matches  per  day  and  they
[03:10] literally  get  like  really  attractive 
 successful  guys  messaging  them  being 
 flirty  and  you're  thinking  how  would 
 this  kind  of  woman  no  offense  to  her  but
[03:16] you  know  you  just  got  to  say  it  like 
 this  unattractive  woman  gets  a  hundred 
 times  more  interest  than  I  am  what's
[03:22] happening  in  the  modern  dating  scene  is 
 leading  to  a  lot  of  people  with  very 
 negative  beliefs  about  themselves  and  if
[03:29] I  can  give  you  just  one  piece  of  advice 
 in  terms  of  dating  especially  in  terms 
 of  being  a  man  and  dating  a  woman  and
[03:34] actually  wanting  to  be  the  kind  of  guy 
 that  she  like  totally  is  addicted  to 
 right  because  there's  different  kinds  of
[03:39] Dynamics  and  dating  isn't  there 
 sometimes  the  boyfriend's  a  bit  of  a 
 charm  and  the  girl  kind  of  bosses  him 
 around  and  sometimes  the  girl  cheats  on
[03:44] it  but  then  sometimes  just  sometimes  you 
 might  have  seen  this  or  maybe  you  don't 
 even  believe  it  but  sometimes  there's 
 like  an  absolute  like  Chad  kind  of  guy
[03:50] where  the  girl  is  so  totally  submissive 
 and  addicted  to  him  and  if  you  want  to 
 get  to  this  kind  of  place  I've  said  a
[03:56] lot  of  times  you  know  the  most  important 
 thing  is  building  an  aesthetic  body  or 
 maybe  status  or  money  or  confidence  well 
 all  of  those  things  are  actually  above
[04:02] the  foundation  this  is  the  absolute  core 
 part  the  foundation  and  guess  what  it  is 
 it's  your  beliefs  about  yourself  because
[04:08] you  know  if  you  think  of  that  Chad  guy 
 who  gets  so  many  girls  you  know  we  can 
 say  oh  yeah  he  gets  more  likes  on  his
[04:13] Tinder  pictures  because  he's  really 
 attractive  yeah  sure  but  the  reason  why 
 girls  actually  treat  him  nicely  is
[04:18] because  he  believes  that  he  deserves  it 
 I'm  telling  you  this  is  the  most 
 important  thing  if  you  want  to  find  out 
 if  you're  attractive  to  women  and  also
[04:23] if  you  want  to  become  more  attractive  to 
 women  start  to  observe  and  improve  the 
 thoughts  and  beliefs  that  you  have  about
[04:29] your  dating  life  sometimes  you  have  to 
 in  a  delusional  way  just  trick  yourself 
 into  thinking  yeah  I'm  actually  really
[04:35] really  hard  I'm  an  alpha  male  and  girls 
 really  really  want  me  I  know  that  sounds 
 so  silly  and  I  wouldn't  say  something 
 like  that  which  is  cringe  if  it  didn't
[04:41] work  but  I  promise  you  right  now  the  guy 
 is  that  these  girls  are  actually  really 
 really  into  I'm  telling  you  those  guys
[04:46] are  thinking  this  about  themselves  those 
 guys  they  know  they're  hot  and  sometimes 
 I  see  those  guys  and  sometimes  they're
[04:51] not  even  attractive  sometimes  they're 
 genuinely  like  five  out  of  ten  six  out 
 of  ten  but  the  kind  of  aura  that  he  has
[04:56] the  belief  that  he  has  the  kind  of 
 personality  and  identity  that  he  has  is 
 absolutely  irresistible  imagine  this
[05:02] like  Chad  Dynamic  this  guy  is  an 
 ultimate  Chad  right  but  imagine  he  has  a 
 Jeffrey  mind  about  himself  imagine  he
[05:07] looks  really  attractive  he  gets  a  lot  of 
 Tinder  matches  but  imagine  he  was  like 
 really  really  insecure  and  imagine  he's
[05:12] like  really  clingy  and  really  like  weird 
 with  the  girl  you  know  his  mind  is  just 
 messed  up  but  he's  like  physically 
 attractive  well  if  he's  physically
[05:17] attractive  he'll  get  as  many  matches  on 
 Tinder  and  likes  on  Instagram  right  but 
 I'm  actually  gets  a  girlfriend  and
[05:22] imagine  how  he's  gonna  navigate  that 
 relationship  if  his  beliefs  are  all 
 negative  well  that  relationship  is  going
[05:27] to  be  very  very  toxic  and  negative  and 
 eventually  probably  end  in  heartbreak 
 isn't  it  even  if  he's  a  child  even  if
[05:32] he's  really  really  attractive  this  is 
 like  Step  Zero  it's  good  mental  health 
 about  yourself  because  honestly  no  one
[05:37] wants  to  date  someone  who  doesn't  have 
 good  mental  health  think  about  that  now 
 of  course  someone  might  want  to  date 
 someone  who's  really  attractive  and  and
[05:43] they  don't  have  good  mental  health  but 
 if  you  could  just  change  that  and 
 improve  someone's  mental  health  and  make 
 them  a  little  bit  happier  pretty  much
[05:48] every  single  person  would  say  yes  about 
 their  partner  for  that  of  course  right 
 so  then  why  are  we  walking  around  with 
 such  negative  beliefs  about  ourselves  in
[05:54] our  mind  and  I'm  wondering  why  people 
 treat  us  in  the  same  way  that  we  believe 
 you  know  this  is  getting  a  bit  deep  and
[05:59] weird  to  explain  but  it  seems  so  obvious 
 that  of  course  people  treat  us  in  a 
 certain  way  and  that's  why  we  believe
[06:04] things  about  ourselves  right  but 
 actually  more  and  more  it's  becoming 
 proven  that  it's  actually  the  opposite
[06:09] way  around  it's  not  that  people  see  us 
 and  treat  us  in  a  certain  way  so  we 
 believe  that  thing  about  ourselves  it's
[06:14] actually  that  we  believe  something  about 
 ourselves  and  then  people  treat  us  in 
 that  way  and  to  prove  this  well  you're
[06:20] treated  different  by  different  people 
 aren't  you  sometimes  you  go  to  a  new 
 place  with  so  much  more  confidence 
 because  your  belief  about  yourself  has
[06:25] changed  just  maybe  for  an  hour  and 
 people  treat  you  that  way  don't  they  but 
 then  sometimes  you've  got  the  same 
 beliefs  when  you're  around  the  same
[06:31] people  and  then  they  treat  you  that  way 
 if  how  people  treat  you  can  change  based 
 on  where  you  are  and  how  you  feel  well
[06:36] then  it  probably  is  that  your  beliefs 
 start  the  experience  first  and  then 
 people  react  to  your  beliefs  and  of
[06:42] course  it  still  works  the  other  way 
 around  100  I'm  not  saying  like  how 
 someone  treats  us  they're  never  going  to 
 change  anything  about  us  of  course  it  is
[06:47] but  it's  a  lot  more  positive  and  helpful 
 if  we  think  about  it  first  from  our 
 control  of  the  world  why  don't  we  take
[06:52] some  time  today  and  really  think  a 
 little  bit  more  positive  okay  am  I 
 attractive  to  women  yeah  you  know  what 
 yeah  yes  I  am  I  am  pretty  attractive  to
[06:58] women  look  at  all  these  positive  traits 
 that  I  have  about  myself  I'm  fairly  in 
 shape  I'm  actually  a  pretty  like  good
[07:03] guy  and  yeah  I  know  that  I'm  a  work  in 
 progress  but  that's  actually  kind  of 
 attractive  too  so  if  you  start  to  pick 
 up  on  all  of  these  positive  things  about
[07:09] yourself  and  suddenly  like  you're 
 actually  sitting  up  straight  up  with  a 
 bigger  smile  better  eye  contact  and  that 
 makes  you  more  attractive  the  truth  is
[07:15] that  women  find  anywhere  from  like  50  to 
 80  of  men  unattractive  so  there's  been
[07:20] studies  done  on  dating  apps  and  you  know 
 they  ask  women  okay  what  percentage  of 
 the  profiles  do  you  find  attractive  and
[07:25] the  answer  is  20  and  you  know  what  the 
 word  they  use  wasn't  attractive  it  was 
 actually  average  women  rated  80  of  men
[07:32] below  average  think  about  that  women 
 rated  80  of  men  below  average  that
[07:37] doesn't  mathematically  work  because 
 below  average  should  be  49  right  but 
 because  the  dating  Market  is  so  skewed
[07:42] with  you  know  everyone  can  date  online 
 so  we  see  more  options  and  then  also 
 this  psychological  sort  of  thing  that's 
 happening  to  women  especially  with  like
[07:48] there's  a  lot  of  factors  that 
 essentially  have  shown  women  the  best 
 men  of  the  entire  world  which  means  that 
 80  of  men  they're  seeing  is  below
[07:54] average  because  the  best  guy  that  a  girl 
 can  get  is  no  longer  the  guy  in  her 
 classroom  or  her  hometown  is  it  there's
[07:59] a  guy  in  a  different  country  who's  five 
 times  richer  than  all  of  her  peers  who's 
 messaging  her  if  you're  in  like  a  normal
[08:04] job  like  an  office  space  job  there's  a 
 woman  in  there  right  now  who's  speaking 
 to  a  guy  who's  makes  10  times  more
[08:09] income  per  year  than  any  of  the  guys 
 that  she  works  with  because  he's  in  a 
 different  country  right  now  this  means
[08:14] that  the  day-in  market  is  incredibly 
 competitive  so  competitive  and  a  lot  of
[08:19] guys  see  this  level  of  competition  and 
 just  kind  of  like  break  down  I  think 
 this  is  not  to  be  concerned  but  I  do
[08:24] think  this  is  like  a  symptom  of  low 
 testosterone  a  lot  of  guys  with  low 
 testosterone  see  how  competitive  the 
 dating  Market  is  and  then  just  think  oh
[08:29] no  like  I  don't  want  to  compete  I'm  just 
 going  to  play  video  games  and  watch  porn 
 and  maybe  I'll  consider  getting  like  a 
 flashlight  or  a  doll  or  something  but  if
[08:35] you  relish  this  competition  so  if  you 
 see  how  hard  it  is  for  the  day  in  market 
 for  love  for  sex  but  dating  and  you  want
[08:41] to  run  headphone  first  towards  this 
 competition  with  enough  work  maybe  two 
 years  two  years  of  focus  of  doing  the
[08:47] right  things  that  will  help  you  here  you 
 will  see  incredible  results  you  know 
 this  isn't  some  like  clickbait  lie
[08:53] because  if  it  was  a  tell  you  yeah  just 
 follow  up  with  this  program  and  then  you 
 what  there's  two  days  from  now  let's  go
[08:58] get  you  late  bro  for  most  guys  it's 
 gonna  take  about  two  years  of  hard  work 
 sacrifice  and  a  lot  of  guys  aren't 
 willing  to  take  that  because  they  say
[09:04] the  juice  isn't  worth  the  squeeze  I 
 personally  think  it  absolutely  is  I 
 think  well  I  know  by  looking  at  research
[09:09] and  investigations  and  studies  like 
 relationships  especially  the  Romantic 
 relationships  that  you  have  your  wife
[09:14] the  mother  of  your  children  is  literally 
 one  of  the  most  important  parts  of  your 
 life  so  I  think  of  course  it's  worth  the
[09:19] effort  of  course  it  is  it's  answer  the 
 question  of  the  title  of  this  video  are 
 you  attracted  to  women  it's  as  simple  as
[09:24] just  asking  how  do  women  behave  towards 
 you  I  usually  heavily  disagree  with  the 
 black  pillars  which  is  like  an  online
[09:29] community  of  guys  who  are  very  like 
 hopeless  but  there  is  one  black  pill 
 video  that  I've  watched  which  is  by  a
[09:34] YouTuber  called  wheat  waffles  and  I 
 really  really  thought  that  this  was  a 
 fantastic  way  he  said  that  no  matter
[09:39] what  another  guy  says  about  you  if 
 you're  attractive  or  not  all  what  he 
 rated  you  doesn't  matter  you  know  if  you
[09:44] are  a  sub  5  know  me  or  Chad  based  on  how 
 women  react  towards  you  you  know  some
[09:50] guy  can  rape  me  like  a  six  out  of  ten 
 for  example  this  has  happened  before  a 
 bunch  of  these  black  pillars  have  read 
 me  like  a  four  out  of  ten  which  I  swear
[09:55] I'm  higher  than  that  I  promise  but 
 they've  written  me  like  a  four  out  of 
 ten  five  out  of  ten  six  out  of  ten  but 
 what  actually  matters  is  not  what
[10:00] another  man  says  to  you  what  matters  to 
 see  if  you  are  attractive  to  women  if
[10:05] you  are  very  unattractive  normal  or  like 
 very  attractive  it's  the  C  just  simply 
 how  do  women  treat  you  most  guys  will  be
[10:11] somewhere  in  the  normal  range  which  is 
 that  yeah  they  might  over  a  couple  of 
 years  have  some  level  of  interest  from 
 some  girls  they  might  be  you  know  every
[10:17] now  and  then  texting  a  girl  who's  kind 
 of  reciprocating  it  but  sometimes  she 
 flakes  sometimes  she  like  doesn't  want 
 to  meet  them  they  might  end  up  getting
[10:22] into  like  some  kind  of  relationship  but 
 they  have  some  kind  of  problems  and  the 
 girl  in  the  relationship  with  them  isn't
[10:27] even  like  totally  devoted  to  them  most 
 guys  are  in  that  category  but  you  all 
 know  you're  in  like  the  Chad  like  high
[10:32] tier  category  when  girls  are  not 
 throwing  themselves  at  you  that's  like 
 really  high  status  if  you're  like  a 
 rapper  and  girls  are  throwing  their  bra
[10:37] to  you  I  like  from  a  lot  of  like 
 high-tier  men  it's  like  a  girl  will  walk 
 past  look  at  you  proper  smile  and
[10:42] actually  that's  her  way  of  like  cold 
 approaching  you  it's  obviously  it's 
 still  your  job  to  go  over  and  speak  to 
 her  it'll  be  easy  on  Tinder  or  Instagram
[10:48] to  message  a  girl  and  maybe  using  those 
 apps  once  a  week  or  so  it  would  meet  a 
 girl  easily  for  like  a  date  or  something 
 and  if  you're  on  the  way  or  the  end  of
[10:54] that  can  feel  very  upsetting  and  lonely 
 to  then  feel  like  what  happens  to  these 
 guys  who  are  considered  like  quite
[11:00] unattractive  which  is  that  they'll  get 
 zero  matches  a  day  on  Tinder  they'll  get 
 no  girl  barely  ever  really  smiling  at
[11:06] them  if  they  are  smiling  at  them  it's 
 kind  of  like  you  know  just  being  polite 
 instead  of  out  of  Attraction  no  matter 
 which  kind  of  group  you're  in  if  you
[11:12] just  take  a  moment  to  like  look  back 
 through  some  memories  and  just  consider 
 how  like  women  have  treated  you  have
[11:17] they  almost  avoided  you  have  they  been  a 
 little  bit  indifferent  but  maybe  there 
 are  like  you  know  the  Odd  Girl  Who  seems 
 to  be  kind  of  into  you  but  you  know
[11:23] she's  not  that  attractive  or  anything 
 like  that  or  they've  been  like  so 
 obvious  that  girls  have  been  into  and 
 you  just  know  for  a  factor  in  this  top
[11:28] tier  once  you  know  that  you  kind  of  know 
 okay  are  you  attractive  to  women  or  not 
 dance  is  kind  of  simple  honestly  a  lot
[11:33] of  guys  are  a  little  bit  confused  with 
 this  concept  but  the  answer  is  very 
 simple  once  you  get  hit  with  some  brutal 
 truths  we've  been  told  by  so  many  people
[11:40] the  system  The  Matrix  a  woman's 
 attraction  is  unclear  oh  there's  subtle
[11:45] signs  to  her  attraction  towards  you  no 
 there  was  one  post  on  the  old  red  pill 
 subreddit  that  changed  my  life  forever
[11:51] and  it  was  titled  you  are  not  her  top 
 option  and  maybe  I'll  make  a  whole  video 
 about  this  one  post  because  it  just  it
[11:56] was  so  common  sense  but  I  kind  of  needed 
 to  hear  it  I'll  just  go  very  briefly 
 because  I  think  I'll  make  a  whole  video
[12:01] about  this  and  it  just  said  you  are  not 
 her  top  option  when  you're  there 
 neurotically  checking  your  phone 
 WhatsApp  messages  to  see  okay  she's  not
[12:07] replied  yet  she  was  online  after  I  sent 
 that  message  but  so  she  didn't  click  on 
 the  message  why  she  not  replied  and  you 
 know  you're  overthinking  about  if  she's
[12:13] going  to  reply  or  not  or  your  other 
 thing  and  if  she's  gonna  come  to  the 
 date  or  not  you've  sent  her  the  message 
 like  oh  hey  excited  to  see  you  later  at
[12:18] 7pm  you're  gonna  come  right  and  she's 
 not  replied  just  yet  you're  getting  a 
 bit  paranoid  you're  not  her  top  option
[12:23] because  if  you  are  her  top  option  if  she 
 is  attracted  to  you  bro  trust  me  you 
 will  know  I've  even  seen  online  even  in 
 like  the  sort  of  pickup  communities  that
[12:29] yeah  a  woman's  attraction  is  really 
 subtle  honestly  no  if  she's  into  you  you 
 will  know  you  don't  need  a  video  like
[12:34] this  because  people  have  told  you  that 
 oh  yeah  yeah  you  know  she  might  be  into 
 you  but  she'll  never  show  it  trust  me 
 bro  when  she's  into  a  guy  she  shows  it
[12:40] sometimes  she'll  message  the  guy  first 
 saying  oh  hey  Alexa  what  are  you  doing 
 tonight  whatever  conditioning 
 brainwashing  that  we've  propaganda  that
[12:46] we've  been  through  as  led  us  to  this 
 moments  where  you  need  a  video  to  just 
 walk  through  like  oh  yeah  like  if  she's
[12:51] into  you  you'll  see  her  attraction 
 physically  she'll  hold  eye  contact  with 
 you  a  lot  more  she'll  be  nicer  to  you
[12:56] she'll  smile  when  you're  around  her 
 she'll  touch  you  of  course  those  are 
 symbols  of  her  attraction  towards  you 
 and  like  we've  been  told  like  no  no  that
[13:02] doesn't  mean  she's  attracted  to  you 
 actually  she  could  be  attracted  to  you 
 just  in  an  invisible  way  just  wait  10 
 more  years  and  you'll  find  out  the  guy
[13:07] who  she's  attracted  to  right  now  she's 
 laughing  at  his  joke  that  wasn't  even 
 funny  and  like  touching  his  arm  as  she
[13:12] laughs  if  she's  doing  that  to  you  she's 
 probably  maybe  into  you  she's  not  doing 
 that  to  you  she's  probably  not  into  you
[13:17] I'm  sorry  if  this  hurts  but  sometimes 
 you  need  like  a  little  bit  of  like  a 
 slap  in  the  face  of  reality  because 
 honestly  when  I  was  15  16  like  I  needed
[13:23] this  there  I  am  double  texting  the  same 
 girl  again  she's  giving  me  one  word 
 replies  and  I'm  still  trying  to  think
[13:28] yeah  yeah  obviously  because  she's 
 texting  me  back  she  really  likes  me 
 right  one  little  bonus  thing  I'll  just 
 give  you  one  of  the  things  I've  learned
[13:33] from  like  my  experience  with  women  just 
 because  she  texts  you  or  snapchatts  you
[13:38] or  sends  you  DMS  on  Instagram  just 
 because  she  does  that  does  not  actually 
 mean  that  she's  been  to  you  it's  quite
[13:43] harsh  for  me  to  say  this  but  there  are 
 actually  a  lot  of  women  out  there 
 honestly  I  think  most  women  just  like  to
[13:48] get  notifications  on  their  phone 
 honestly  most  people  I  think  almost  all 
 people  like  to  get  notifications  on
[13:53] their  phone  because  you  know  triggers 
 like  this  dopamine  thing  inside  of  us 
 and  it  feels  good  to  see  like  oh  we  got 
 lots  of  messages  oh  yes  I  am  worthy  of
[13:58] lover  she  likes  getting  texts  on  her 
 phone  and  so  yeah  she'll  reply  to  you 
 and  you'll  be  like  oh  yeah  she  replied
[14:03] oh  oh  she  replied  okay  it  took  her  seven 
 minutes  to  reply  so  I'm  gonna  reply  in 
 for  14  minutes  yeah  I'm  I'm  in  chat  bro
[14:09] she  replies  to  everyone  some  slower  than 
 others  some  faster  than  others  what  I've 
 seen  especially  with  a  bit  of  the
[14:14] younger  girls  I'm  25  so  you  know  what 
 I've  seen  with  like  20  year  olds  or  18 
 year  olds  21  year  olds  is  that  they  will
[14:19] reply  to  guys  they're  not  even 
 interested  in  if  you  ask  them  they'll 
 say  oh  yeah  we're  just  friends  and
[14:24] they'll  just  string  them  along 
 essentially  you  know  they'll  speak  and 
 maybe  that  guy  will  invite  her  to  do
[14:29] something  and  she'll  say  oh  yeah  let's 
 do  it  and  then  the  same  day  or  you  know 
 the  day  that  they've  organized  to  do 
 something  the  guy  will  text  like  hey
[14:35] you're  still  good  for  today  and  she'll 
 be  like  oh  no  sorry  I've  got  to  do 
 something  but  like  oh  let's  do  Friday 
 instead  and  the  guy  said  okay  you  know 
 she  flakes  but  like  Fridays  you  know  she
[14:41] she  said  Friday  so  that's  good  yeah  I'm 
 gonna  see  your  Friday  I'm  gonna  see  on 
 Friday  guys  I'm  gonna  see  you  on  Friday 
 and  then  Friday  rolls  around  hey  hey  so
[14:47] you're  good  for  Friday  at  6pm  and  she's 
 like  oh  my  God  no  I  forgot  about  this 
 thing  my  dad  died
[14:52] I don't  know  fair  enough 
 guys  so  this  Saturday  okay  he's  just 
 getting  stronger  long  strung  along  to
[14:57] live  reach  the  60-day  Snapchat  streak 
 there  was  a  picture  bro  this  is  rental 
 in  Mama  there  was  a  picture  I  took  this
[15:02] girl's  phone  once  right  so  we're  sat  in 
 the  back  of  the  car  at  night  time 
 playing  cards  right  I  took  her  phone  and
[15:07] I  remember  she  was  on  Snapchat  and  there 
 were  so  many  guys  I'm  playing  around 
 with  her  like  wrestling  her  in  the  back
[15:12] of  the  car  whilst  we're  playing  cards 
 and  eventually  I  imagine  you  know  how 
 the  back  of  the  car  looks  right  so  you 
 sit  here  and  there's  kind  of  like  space
[15:17] between  your  legs  to  the  front  shirt  I 
 kind  of  like  throw  her  into  that  space 
 and  she's  like  stuck  a  bit  and  I've  like
[15:22] pushed  it  down  with  my  legs  and  I'm 
 starting  to  like  look  at  how  many  guys 
 she's  been  in  40  days  Snapchat  streaks
[15:27] 50-day  Snapchat  streaks  and  I'm  just 
 thinking  about  like  she's  stringing 
 along  all  these  guys  who  genuinely  think
[15:32] like  they're  so  close  to  being  in  a 
 relationship  with  her  and  maybe  I 
 shouldn't  have  done  this  to  like  hurt 
 those  guys  feelings  but  they  kind  of
[15:37] needed  to  see  this  I  didn't  send  anyone 
 like  a  message  or  anything  but  I  just 
 took  a  picture  and  put  it  onto  her
[15:42] Snapchat  story  of  her  in  the  back  of  the 
 car  down  like  where  your  feet  would 
 normally  be  so  like  press  down  there
[15:47] with  my  foot  on  her  head  with  a  picture 
 like  captured  like  she's  in  timeout  and 
 still  when  those  guys  saw  that  picture
[15:54] with  the  girl  that  they  had  a  40-day 
 Snapchat  streak  with  with  a  brown  like 
 leg  and  a  foot  on  her  head  pushing  her
[16:00] down  with  like  a  funny  caption  saying 
 she's  inside  mouth  still  kept  on 
 speaking  to  her  developing  feelings  for
[16:05] her  a  lot  of  guys  just  are  so  delusional 
 I  imagine  seeing  like  your  crush  post
[16:10] something  like  that  and  when  she  tells 
 you  I  know  it's  just  my  friend  and 
 you're  like  okay  it's  just  her  friend  we
[16:15] weren't  friends  bro  even  if  you  don't 
 want  to  be  a  degenerate  you  know  this 
 was  like  casual  sex  stuff  so  it's  not 
 good  for  you  or  anything  but  even  if  you
[16:20] don't  want  to  be  like  a  degenerate  or 
 anything  like  that  the  thing  is  you  kind 
 of  want  to  be  that  guy  on  the  other  side
[16:25] of  the  phone  like  in  my  position  of  like 
 being  that  guy  who's  got  you  don't  want 
 to  be  the  guy  who's  that  got  his  foot  on
[16:30] her  head  and  that's  kind  of 
 disrespectful  but  you  want  to  be  that 
 guy  who's  on  the  other  side  who  she's 
 meeting  up  well  this  40-day  SnapChat
[16:35] streak  Journey  that  they've  had  together 
 you  want  to  be  the  guy  who  she's  meeting 
 up  and  actually  being  intimate  with  and
[16:40] getting  closer  with  you  do  not  want  to 
 be  the  guy  on  the  other  side  of  the 
 screen  waiting  for  her  to  reply  and 
 opening  up  a  story  kind  of  like  a  late
[16:46] night  thing  of  like  wait  what's 
 happening  here  it's  like  oh  man  she's  oh 
 she's  with  a  guy  no  no  oh  oh  she  said 
 it's  just  friends  oh  okay  okay  when
[16:52] you're  her  top  option  you'll  know  when 
 you're  attracted  to  women  you'll  know  if 
 it  isn't  100  clear  to  you  then  you're
[16:58] not  and  I  know  that  sucks  to  hear  and  I 
 know  that  that  will  hurt  a  lot  of  young 
 men's  feelings  watching  this  like  that
[17:03] pain  that  level  of  like  disgust 
 resentments  annoyance  that  you  feel 
 right  now  can  be  used  so  productively  to
[17:09] eventually  not  quickly  but  eventually 
 get  to  that  point  where  you  are  actually 
 attracted  to  women  and  there's  multiple
[17:14] things  to  do  one  analyze  your  beliefs 
 but  two  be  physically  more  attractive  I 
 have  a  40  minute  Lux  maxing  guide  on  how
[17:20] to  actually  like  literally  physically 
 look  better  and  that's  very  important 
 because  as  much  as  I  like  to  talk  about 
 the  psychological  things  the  truth  is
[17:25] how  you  physically  look  is  going  to 
 determine  how  many  matches  you  get  on 
 Tinder  how  many  DMS  gets  open  on
[17:30] Instagram  or  how  many  like  good  pictures 
 you  can  take  and  you  get  more  likes  and 
 all  this  and  yeah  of  course  all  of  this 
 is  like  online  dating  it's  not  good  for
[17:36] you  but  this  is  the  way  that  a  lot  of 
 girls  do  kind  of  like  look  at  you  these 
 days  they  look  at  you  online  even  then
[17:41] if  you've  lost  Max  you  look  better  in 
 person  anyway  so  maybe  you'll  want  to  go 
 watch  that  full  guide  let's  listen  to 
 some  words  from  Adonis  about  this  the
[17:47] average  man  lacks  ambition  drive  and 
 masculinity  women  simply  aren't 
 attracted  to  that  men  of  old  we're
[17:53] strong  they  dangerous  and  driven  that  is 
 what  women  want  in  a  man  if  you  can
[17:58] watch  this  video  right  now  do  the  hard 
 work  especially  when  you  don't  feel  like 
 it
