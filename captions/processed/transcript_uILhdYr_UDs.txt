[00:00] this  isn't  a  drugged-out  ten  minutes  on 
 15  second  long  video  with  a  three 
 minutes  Dollar  Shave  Club  advertisement
[00:06] in  the  middle  this  is  my  practical  guide 
 for  guys  who  want  real  advice  from 
 someone  who's  been  through  this  journey
[00:11] I  started  weightlifting  about  five  years 
 ago  with  the  same  goals  as  you  I'm  gonna
[00:17] try  and  give  you  the  best  real  advice  I 
 can  in  hopes  of  helping  other  guys  who 
 were  at  my  starting  point  because
[00:23] honestly  it's  unreal  how  much  my  life 
 has  changed  due  to  this  grind  I'm  going
[00:28] to  do  some  assuming  here  you're  a  young 
 male  aged  13  to  mid-20s
[00:34] you  chose  this  video  specifically 
 because  it's  a  guide  on  building  an 
 attractive  body  so  I'm  gonna  assume  that
[00:40] you  want  to  attract  the  opposite  sex  and 
 you  believe  building  a  muscular  body 
 helps  with  this  I'll  just  tell  you  the
[00:47] truth  right  now  he  absolutely  does 
 building  an  attractive  physique  means  to
[00:52] resistance  trade  that  is  weight  lifting 
 this  makes  muscles  while  focusing  on  a
[00:57] progressive  overload  so  that  literally 
 just  means  making  progress  as  you  go 
 along  using  heavier  weights  doing  more
[01:03] reps  longer  workouts  the  usual  guides 
 you'll  see  online  will  have  you  lifting
[01:08] heavy  three  times  a  week  focusing  on 
 compound  movements  this  advice  is  given
[01:13] by  guys  on  reddit  if  you  look  like  this 
 take  this  advice  if  you  do  not  want  to
[01:19] look  attractive  here  is  what  I  call  the 
 hierarchy  of  attractive  muscle  groups
[01:24] just  quickly  I  said  this  was  gonna  be  a 
 no-bullshit  guide  so  I'm  gonna  follow 
 that  I'm  not  gonna  go  in-depth  with  the
[01:30] particular  exercises  you  should  be  using 
 to  grow  these  particular  muscles  there's 
 literally  millions  of  videos  out  there
[01:35] that  will  already  tell  you  this  my 
 advice  is  to  find  a  credible  source  of
[01:40] information  such  as  a  scientific 
 research  based  youtuber  and  look  up
[01:45] their  guides  on  the  particular  muscle 
 you're  looking  into 
 so  starting  from  number  one  ABS  the
[01:53] abdominal  muscles  this  is  what 
 symbolizes  the  Greek  gods  the  importance
[01:58] of  ABS  in  terms  of  attractiveness  is 
 huge  every  single  person  you  meet  will 
 know  what  developed  herbs  look  like
[02:04] every  single  person  watching  this  video 
 is  probably  tried  getting  a  six-pack 
 when  they  were  younger  as  well  a  quick
[02:10] tip  here  do  a  lot  more  focus  on  the 
 lower  abs  the  upper  4-pack  is  generally
[02:16] built  quite  well  through  a  normal  weight 
 lifting  program  but  the  lower  selves
[02:21] underdeveloped  and  that's  the  one  that 
 really  fine  Tunes  the  physique  to  make
[02:26] it  look  more  attractive  number  two  to
[02:35] the  neck  i  bet  you  arnt  trailing  your 
 neck  and  you've  probably  never  even 
 heard  of  neck  training  before  just  makes
[02:40] an  insane  difference  in  your  physique 
 just  trust  me 
 thicker  muscular  neck  wish  you  look  a
[02:46] lot  more  masculine  and  less  like  a 
 little  boy  the  neck  is  a  body  part  but 
 it's  pretty  much  always  visible  no
[02:52] matter  what  type  of  clothing  you  wear  so 
 it's  important  to  develop  this  don't  be 
 like  those  bodybuilders  who  will  train
[02:58] for  years  and  never  do  anything  directly 
 for  the  neck  because  getting  a  developed
[03:04] body  which  is  growing  in  size  and  your 
 neck  is  still  the  same  size  makes  you
[03:09] look  really  strange  so  I'll  place  a 
 picture  here  where  you  can  see  a 
 bodybuilder  who  hasn't  trained  his  neck
[03:14] the  guy  is  jacked  but  if  we  just  can  see 
 his  neck  in  his  face  you'll  look  like  a
[03:19] skinny  boy 
 then  I'll  unwrap  his  body  and  you  can 
 see  how  big  he  is  but  if  you  were  just
[03:25] able  to  see  his  face  you  wouldn't  have 
 realized  that  he  put  in  probably  ten 
 years  into  the  gym  just  because  he
[03:31] didn't  train  neck  you  couldn't  even  see 
 that  dedication 
 it's  crazy  number  three  the  delts  so
[03:39] shoulders  specifically  the  lateral  delts 
 lateral  just  means  side  so  this  Latorre
[03:45] just  means  the  side  of  your  shoulder  you 
 trade  this  by  doing  lateral  raises  with 
 light  weight  and  you'll  see  a  difference
[03:51] in  your  physique  within  seconds  when 
 you've  got  pop  it  really  is  that  simple 
 this  muscle  is  insane  it  makes  you  look
[03:57] wider  and  your  waist  slimmer  in 
 comparison  or  the  parts  of  your  shoulder 
 muscle  like  these  traps  the  front  delts
[04:03] and  the  rear  delts  are  really  important 
 as  well  but  I  believe  the  lateral  delts 
 should  be  a  much  bigger  priority  number
[04:10] for  arms  including  forearms  just  like 
 the  neck  this  is  a  body  part  that  is
[04:15] generally  always  visible  so  any  progress 
 you  make  here  will  be  very  obvious  to 
 others  it  makes  it  quite  valuable  to
[04:22] train  forearms  in  particular  add  that 
 fine  chewing  effect  I  talked  about  with 
 the  lower  abs  if  your  forearms  are
[04:28] undeveloped  it  really  does  make  your 
 physique  look  strange 
 I  don't  even  back  and  legs  I  put  these
[04:35] at  the  lowest  hierarchy  don't  get  me 
 wrong  don't  skip  these  days  and  don't 
 not  train  them  I  still  trim  back  and
[04:41] legs  twice  a  week  and  I  hit  them  hard 
 I  make  progress  on  them  however  I  feel 
 like  these  muscles  generally  round  off
[04:47] your  physique  so  it  doesn't  really  look 
 weird  if  they're  undeveloped  but  there 
 certainly  are  the  muscles  that  should  be
[04:53] much  higher  priority  if  you're  focusing 
 on  aesthetics  building  an  attractive 
 body  no  girl  has  ever  said  that  she's
[04:59] attracted  to  you  because  you've  got 
 massive  quads  or  calves  diets  you  can
[05:05] get  into  this  to  optimize  your 
 performance  in  the  gym  but  generally  a 
 lot  of  people  get  off  poor  due  to  the
[05:11] diet  changes  most  guides  will  tell  you 
 it  will  absolutely  benefit  you  to  track
[05:16] your  micronutrients  and  weigh  out  every 
 single  gram  of  food  that  you  eat  but 
 honestly  the  majority  of  people  will
[05:21] never  do  this  it  is  quite  a  lot  of 
 effort  so  here's  my  quick  advice  that  I 
 think  will  be  valuable  in  this  journey
[05:27] you  want  to  be  building  as  much  muscle 
 as  possible  without  putting  on  too  much
[05:32] fats  so  always  try  to  be  lean 
 that  pretty  much  just  means  to  eat
[05:37] slightly  more  than  you  do  now  the 
 equivalent  of  two  slices  of  toast  on  top
[05:42] of  what  you  generally  eat  will  cause  you 
 to  gain  around  half  a  pound  a  week  the
[05:48] majority  of  that  weight  will  be  muscle 
 if  you're  training  hard  and  you're  quite 
 new  to  the  gym  as  well  you  can  still  eat
[05:53] quite  healthy  with  high  protein  and  it's 
 enjoy  snacks  and  meals  out  whenever  you 
 want  I've  made  a  video  talking  about  my
[05:59] awful  diets  where  through  my  five  year 
 transformation  I  don't  food  pretty  much
[06:04] every  day  but  I  still  made  pretty  good 
 progress  you  can't  out  train  a  bad  diet
[06:10] you  cannot  train  a  bad  diet  I  can  so 
 this  is  how  I've  really  enjoy  food  every
[06:16] single  night  it  really  can't  be  done  so 
 don't  think  that  to  build  an  attractive
[06:21] body  you  need  to  just  eat  chicken  and 
 rice  and  broccoli  and  you  can't  ever 
 have  a  burger  put  it  this  way  I  go  to
[06:27] McDonald's  most  days  and  I'm  pretty 
 muscular  this  food  isn't  going  to  make 
 you  fat  eating  too  much  of  any  food
[06:34] including  healthy  food  like  vegetables 
 will  cause  you  to  gain  fat  even  if  you
[06:39] don't  want  to  get  into  the  diet  too  much 
 you  can't  be  bothered  with  tracking  it 
 away  in  your  food  I'd  still  recommend
[06:44] just  getting  some  knowledge  on  this 
 topic  if  you  can  just  go  and  learn  a  few 
 things  about  this  I  really  do  think
[06:50] it'll  stick  with  you  for  life  just  go 
 and  learn  what  calories  are  how  they 
 work  what  a  calorie  maintenance  level
[06:56] means  what  a  calorie  deficit  and  calorie 
 surplus  means  macronutrients  learn  that
[07:03] all  foods  consist  of  protein  fats  and 
 carbs  this  type  of  knowledge  is  opens  up
[07:08] your  mind  you  learn  there's  no  such 
 thing  as  bad  food  and  that  you  can  eat 
 pretty  much  whatever  you  want  as  long  as
[07:14] you  keep  these  are  macro  nutrient  levels 
 generally  fine
[07:19] all  right  you've  heard  the  advice  you 
 have  the  knowledge  what  if  you  just 
 can't  be  bothered  I'm  a  pretty  lazy  guy
[07:26] myself  and  that's  why  I  always  try  to 
 revolve  my  videos  around  real  average 
 people  because  this  advice  it  is  just
[07:33] useless  if  you  can't  be  asked  going  to 
 the  gym  I  made  a  separate  video  on  how 
 to  go  about  this  journey  if  you're  quite
[07:39] a  lazy  person  like  me  exercise  is  like 
 oatmeal  if  you  don't  like  it  just
[07:44] because  you  haven't  customized  it  to 
 your  liking  it's  actually  got  pretty 
 decent  feedback  as  well  so  I'll  put  a
[07:50] direct  link  to  that  video  at  the  top  of 
 this  description  so  you  can  have  to 
 watch  it  on  my  idea  for  this  is  for  you
[07:55] guys  to  save  this  video  in  your  YouTube 
 watch  later  saved  videos  like  videos
[08:01] whatever  so  you  can  just  come  back  to  it 
 multiple  times  in  the  future  to  refresh
[08:06] your  memory  so  in  terms  of  that  I'm  just 
 gonna  fire  off  a  bunch  of  quick  random 
 tips  I  can  think  of  that  would  be
[08:11] valuable  if  you're  watching  this  in  the 
 future  so  just  quick  sleep  is  very 
 important  get  more  than  eight  hours
[08:17] everyone  will  tell  you  to  get  six  to 
 eight  no  get  eight  to  Ted  if  you're 
 working  out  you  need  longer  there's  no
[08:23] such  things  overtraining  it's  under 
 recovery  so  if  you  can  only  sleep  a
[08:28] certain  amount  of  hours  at  nighttime  and 
 you  have  to  wake  up  at  6  or  7  for  work 
 or  for  school  that's  fine  you'll  only
[08:35] get  6  7  hours  but  when  you  come  back 
 there's  nothing  stopping  you  from  just 
 having  a  half  an  hour  20  minute  nap  and
[08:40] doing  that  twice  and  studies  say  that 
 that's  actually  pretty  healthy  to  you  as 
 well  and  in  terms  of  supplements
[08:47] creatine  protein  powder  vitamin  D  zinc 
 there's  some  other  ones  that  you  can
[08:52] take  a  lot  of  them  know  what  just  waste 
 money  any  kind  of  supplement  you're 
 getting  should  be  very  cheap  couple  of
[08:57] pounds  each  vitamin  D  zinc  multivitamins 
 whatever  that  [ __ ]  you're  gonna  buy 
 literally  search  for  it  on  eBay  don't
[09:04] buy  any  of  those  I  can  deliver  to  your 
 door  and  it's  customized  for  men  or 
 whatever  [ __ ]  get  the  multivitamins
[09:09] that  are  like  99  piane  based  exact  same 
 things 
 miss  Mindy's  a  2-pound  on  eBay  for  like
[09:14] a  pack  of  like  a  thousand  zinc  is  like 
 four  pounds  for  a  pack  of  100  something
[09:19] about  creatine  is  like  10  pounds  in  the 
 last  few  six  months  protein  power 
 there's  a  bit  more  expensive  you'll  buy
[09:24] it 
 about  30  50  pounds  and  it  will  last  for 
 like  six  months  anyway  optimize  the
[09:31] perfect  scenario  so  the  video  that  I've 
 linked  at  the  top  of  the  description  I 
 went  into  this  with  better  detail  but
[09:37] these  are  always  a  perfect  particular 
 scenario  that  you'll  have  a  great 
 exercise  session  in  so  the  scenario  can
[09:44] be  changed  by  the  variables  what  that 
 leshiy  just  means  is  that  there's 
 factors  that  go  into  the  exercise
[09:49] session  like  the  music  you  listen  to  the 
 clothes  you  wear  what  time  you  train
[09:54] what  gym  you  train  if  you  train  by 
 itself  any  random  factor  that  you  think 
 that  could  potentially  affect  your
[10:00] session  just  write  it  down  have  a  little 
 thought  of  our  inputs  spend  some  time  on 
 this  what  is  the  perfect  scenario  for
[10:07] you  do  you  want  to  go  to  the  gym  and 
 train  at  night  time  would  you  train 
 better  in  the  morning  but  then  would  you
[10:13] have  to  wake  up  earlier  for  that  so 
 you'll  have  to  cool  to  sleep  earlier  to 
 figure  all  this  out  and  then  you'll  be 
 able  to  find  the  perfect  scenario  the
[10:20] schedule  that  works  best  for  you  cardio 
 doesn't  really  help  with  building  an
[10:25] attractive  body  but  it  does  have  good 
 health  benefits  plus  it  stops  you  being 
 unattractive  if  you  can't  go  up  some
[10:31] stairs  without  wheezing  like  a  smoker 
 I'm  going  to  end  this  video  with  a  bit 
 of  a  motivational  speech  I've  kept
[10:37] calling  all  this  a  journey  that's 
 exactly  what  it  is  this  is  your  journey
[10:42] you're  writing  the  chapters  of  this  book 
 make  sure  when  you  look  back  you'll  feel
[10:47] proud  of  the  effort  you're  putting  in  we 
 all  wish  we  could  be  teleported  back  in 
 time  and  slap  some  sense  into  our
[10:52] younger  selves  and  tell  them  to  work 
 harder 
 make  sure  your  future  self  isn't  looking
[10:57] back  at  you  today  and  thinking  this  make 
 sure  your  future  self  thanks  you  for  the 
 work  you're  putting  in  today  and  as
[11:03] always  buy  my  premium  snatcher
