[00:00] Jeffrey  was  raised  in  a  feminine  way 
 through  his  time  in  school  his  teachers 
 demonized  masculine  traits  and  rewarded
[00:06] feminine  ones  and  so  Jeffrey  and  the 
 majority  of  men  of  his  generation 
 struggle  with  masculinity  when  he  grows
[00:12] up  Jeffrey  finds  himself  focused  on  love 
 and  relationships  around  the  girl  that 
 he  has  a  crush  on  while  she's  focused  on
[00:18] her  goals  and  her  studies  he  feels  bad 
 he  feels  weak  but  he  doesn't  really  know 
 what  the  issue  is
[00:24] Adonis  is  the  ultimate  masculine  man 
 that  means  that  adonis's  mind  is  always
[00:29] on  his  mission  his  purpose  and  his  work 
 and  honest  things  about  his  mission 
 women  think  about  Adonis  and  Jeffrey
[00:35] thinks  about  women  figure  out  where  you 
 want  to  be  in  this  equation  this  video 
 may  be  like  the  father  that  you  never
[00:40] had  you've  never  been  taught  how  to  be  a 
 man  your  time  in  the  education  system 
 conditions  you  to  be  more  of  a  pushover
[00:45] weak  in  feminine  submissive  always 
 waiting  for  the  authority  figure  to  tell 
 you  what  to  do  perhaps  you've  never  even
[00:50] had  a  father  figure  maybe  he  wasn't  in 
 the  home  or  he  was  always  in  work  and 
 most  certainly  you  have  not  been
[00:55] surrounded  by  a  tribe  of  men  who  have 
 put  you  through  a  rite  of  passage  Rites 
 of  passages  with  how  boys  became  men  and
[01:00] we  do  not  have  those  these  days  what 
 does  all  of  this  lead  to  a  generation  of 
 soft
[01:05] weak  met  we  can't  even  call  them  men 
 guys  a  weak  man  child  who  procrastinates
[01:10] from  his  work  because  he  doesn't  feel 
 like  doing  his  work  or  he  doesn't  feel 
 like  studying  or  he  doesn't  feel  like 
 going  to  the  gym  so  he  simply  doesn't  do
[01:16] those  things  he  masturbates  whilst 
 wishing  that  he  could  just  get  girls  but 
 he's  just  struggling  and  he  feels  lonely

 his  goals  disciplined  and  yet  you  spend 
 most  of  your  time  with  your  feminine

 significant  increase  in  how  much  girls
[03:03] are  attracted  to  you  after  you  follow 
 this  guide  and  the  interesting  thing  is 
 that  it  will  feel  nice  but  you  just
[03:08] won't  care  anywhere  near  as  much  as  you 
 thought  you  would  and  that's  a  powerful 
 place  to  be  that's  abundance  that's  what
[03:14] we  want  it's  time  to  begin  this  guide 
 and  your  journey  to  becoming  a  man  and 
 we  need  to  First  find  out  how  masculine
[03:19] you  are  right  now  I  must  tell  you  that 
 this  is  an  actionable  video  do  not 
 half-ass  this  video  there's  going  to  be 
 times  when  I'm  gonna  ask  you  to  pause
[03:25] the  video  and  do  something  in  real  life 
 to  follow  along  if  you  really  want  this 
 guide  to  help  you  follow  along  to  every
[03:31] step  that  I  say  because  if  you  don't  if 
 you  have  this  [ __ ]  little  [ __ ] 
 excuse  of  like  oh  well  you  know  they'll
[03:36] do  it  in  a  few  minutes  oh  you  know  he's 
 telling  me  to  do  something  but  I'm  a 
 little  bit  tired  I  can't  find  that  thing 
 or  I  can't  do  that  thing  just  yet  so  you
[03:41] know  I'll  keep  watching  the  rest  of  the 
 video  then  maybe  I'll  come  back  no  this 
 video  will  only  change  your  life  if  you
[03:46] follow  along  with  me  with  every  step 
 possible  so  do  this  right  now  go  get  a 
 piece  of  paper  and  a  pen  if  you  don't
[03:52] have  those  things  in  your  house  I  will 
 link  a  whiteboard  service  you  need 
 something  that  you  can  draw  on  so  I  will
[03:57] link  like  a  whiteboard  website  that  you 
 can  like  draw  you  know  on  the  screen  on 
 your  computer  but  best  case  scenario
[04:02] just  go  get  a  piece  of  paper  and  a  pen 
 pause  this  video  up  until  you  go  get 
 that  right  in  front  of  you  right  here 
 right  now  should  be  a  piece  of  paper  and
[04:07] a  pen  or  something  that  you  can  draw  on 
 or  like  some  whiteboard  online  website 
 that  I  will  link  in  the  description  if
[04:12] you  want  to  use  that  now  draw  a  long 
 rectangle  bar  write  the  letter  F  on  the 
 left  side  of  this  bar  and  then  write  the
[04:18] letter  M  on  the  right  side  of  this  bar  F 
 stands  for  feminine  m  stands  for
[04:23] masculine  now  in  a  second  I'm  going  to 
 ask  you  to  draw  a  line  on  where  you 
 think  you  are  in  this  spectrum  between
[04:29] feminine  and  masculine  energy  but  first 
 let  me  just  explain  what  they  are  the 
 more  you  push  over  to  the  F  the  feminine
[04:34] side  the  more  that  you're  obsessed  with 
 love  you'll  be  submissive  thinking  about 
 relationships  or  the  girl  that  you're  in
[04:39] love  with  you'll  fall  in  love  really 
 quickly  you'll  feel  quite  anxious  and 
 almost  neurotically  like  thinking  and
[04:44] checking  up  on  the  person  that  you're 
 currently  in  love  with  and  you'll  have  a 
 desire  to  feel  fulfilled  now  the  more  we
[04:49] push  onto  the  M  side  the  masculine  side 
 the  more  that  you'll  be  obsessed  with 
 work  goals  Mission  purpose  don't  be
[04:55] thinking  about  your  career  or  your 
 studies  what  tasks  to  do  next  you'll 
 literally  be  going  about  your  day 
 whether  you're  having  a  shower  you've
[05:00] just  woken  up  and  you'll  be  thinking 
 about  work  and  studies  you'll  be 
 dominant  and  stoic  and  you'll  have  a
[05:05] desire  to  feel  free  now  first  what  I 
 want  you  to  do  is  look  at  this  bar  on 
 the  left  side  is  feminine  on  the  right
[05:10] side  is  masculine  and  of  course  the  more 
 that  you  push  out  to  the  extreme  ends 
 means  the  more  you  are  that  thing  and
[05:15] the  more  that  you  come  into  the  middle 
 means  that  you're  more  of  like  a  mix  in 
 between  masculine  and  feminine  energy  I
[05:20] want  you  first  to  draw  like  a  little 
 star  on  where  you  want  to  be  in  this
[05:25] spectrum  what  is  your  goal  energy  draw  a 
 star  there  and  then  draw  a  line  of  where
[05:30] you  think  you  are  right  now  it's  very 
 interesting  if  you  imagine  the  results 
 of  this  little  practice  that  we've  just
[05:36] done  with  everyone  who's  watched  this 
 video  on  YouTube  and  all  of  the  young 
 men  who  have  taken  this  practice  imagine 
 you  could  like  fly  up  into  the  air  and
[05:42] see  every  young  man  who's  done  this 
 practice  and  you  could  see  their  pieces 
 of  paper  what  do  you  think  the  results
[05:47] would  be  of  this  you  would  see  an  entire 
 generation  of  men  wishing  that  they 
 could  be  more  masculine  their  style
[05:53] would  be  more  on  the  masculine  side  than 
 their  line  it's  very  interesting  isn't 
 it  it's  almost  a  universal  desire  for
[05:59] God  eyes  to  want  to  become  men  this  is  a 
 huge  problem  but  we're  here  today  to  fix
[06:04] that  first  let  me  tell  you  my  story  with 
 my  own  masculine  and  feminine  energy  now 
 you  can  skip  this  section  if  you  don't
[06:10] want  to  hear  my  story  and  you  want  to  go 
 straight  to  the  practices  and  the 
 education  you  can  do  that  but  I  think  it 
 might  be  valuable  to  just  sit  through
[06:15] hear  my  story  it'll  probably  be  like  a 
 little  bit  enjoyable  and  relatable  and 
 chances  off  you  can  relate  to  my  story 
 you'll  be  able  to  take  the  advice  that  I
[06:21] give  you  later  on  far  more  than  if  you 
 don't  even  know  me  or  trust  me  so  if  we 
 rewind  10  years  I'm  25  right  now  let's
[06:28] say  when  I'm  14  15  years  old  I  now 
 realize  how  feminine  I  was  I  didn't  at 
 the  time  you  know  when  you're  14  years
[06:34] old  it's  not  really  something  you're  sat 
 there  thinking  am  I  masculine  or 
 feminine  but  I  realize  a  lot  of  the 
 issues  that  I  had  came  down  to  me  being
[06:40] so  totally  my  feminine  energy  one  of  the 
 the  huge  problems  which  was  quite 
 chaotic  in  my  household  was  that  I
[06:46] wasn't  performing  well  in  school  I 
 couldn't  focus  and  I  barely  even  wanted 
 to  now  of  course  again  I  want  to  get
[06:51] good  grades  and  everything  but  like  I 
 didn't  even  want  to  do  work  I  wasn't 
 waking  up  thinking  oh  let  me  study  let 
 me  get  good  grades  I  was  waking  up  and
[06:57] what  do  you think  I  was  thinking  about  I 
 was  waking  up  and  the  first  thing  that  I 
 would  think  about  was  the  girl  that  I
[07:02] currently  had  a  crush  on  and  of  course 
 you  know  you  go  through  a  bunch  of 
 crushes  when  you're  young  and  stuff  so 
 I'd  be  obsessing  over  this  one  girl  I'd
[07:07] wake  up  and  think  about  her  straight 
 away  I'd  be  brushing  my  teeth  almost 
 thinking  about  her  or  you  know  every  now 
 and  then  thinking  about  something  else
[07:12] go  to  school  and  if  I  was  in  the  same 
 class  as  her  I'd  just  be  like  awkwardly 
 just  got  in  my  eyes  towards  thinking
[07:17] about  her  instead  of  thinking  about  the 
 lesson  and  what  we're  supposed  to  be 
 studying  right  now  I  was  almost  never  in
[07:22] my  masculine  energy  which  meant  that  I 
 was  never  focused  on  work  and  alongside 
 that  being  in  your  feminine  especially
[07:27] for  guides  it's  deeply  unattractive  here 
 I  am  obsessing  over  this  girl  who 
 doesn't  even  know  that  I  have  a  crush  on
[07:33] her  and  I'm  like  anxiously  just  thinking 
 about  her  checking  her  Facebook  status 
 this  is  when  people  actually  use 
 Facebook  it's  not  attractive  now  a
[07:39] feminine  woman's  anxiousness  you  know 
 she  always  thinks  about  the  guy  that 
 she's  into  that's  quite  attractive  as  a
[07:44] guy  if  you  imagine  this  as  a  man  it  feel 
 kind  of  nice  to  think  that  the  girl  that 
 you're  into  is  thinking  about  you  quite
[07:50] often  that's  kind  of  attractive  but  on 
 the  other  way  around  it's  not  most  women 
 don't  want  to  know  that  you're  thinking
[07:55] about  them  all  day  it's  unattractive  to 
 women  and  so  of  course  when  I'm  in  my 
 feminine  energy  when  I  was  younger  and
[08:00] I'm  like  totally  obsessed  with  this  girl 
 do  you  think  I  ever  attracted  the  girl 
 that  I  had  a  crush  on  and  this  happened
[08:05] Crush  after  Crush  after  Crush  I  remember 
 this  one  particular  girl  in  college  and 
 um I  saw  her  recently  actually  and  um
[08:12] she's  a  nice  girl  and  everything  but  I 
 had  a  crush  on  a  like  a  major  crush  or 
 maybe  I'm  16  17  years  old  and  you  know
[08:18] I'm  thinking  about  her  doing  the  usual 
 ship  checking  on  Facebook  and  everything 
 and  for  months  just  trying  to  like  level
[08:23] things  up  with  her  so  I'd  see  her  in 
 class  and  would  be  sat  next  to  each 
 other  and  you  know  like  she'd  be 
 focusing  on  the  work  we  were  supposed  to
[08:28] be  doing  I'd  be  like  just  kind  of  like 
 looking  at  her  with  my  peripheral  vision 
 thinking  about  her  daydreaming  imagining
[08:34] scenarios  of  me  and  her  together  and 
 everything  and  go  to  sleep  thinking 
 about  her  it's  just  [ __ ]  cringe  and
[08:40] then  one  day 
 I  checked  Facebook  and  all  I  see  is  like
[08:45] her  name  is  in  a  relationship  with  this 
 guy  some  guy  do  you  know  it  was  actually
[08:50] that  moment  where  something  clicked  for 
 me  and  I  thought  okay  clearly  you  know 
 I've  been  doing  this  for  years  of  like
[08:55] having  a  crush  on  a  girl  and  never 
 really  speaking  to  them  and  being  really 
 shy  something  clicked  and  I  was  like  you 
 know  what  this  it's  clearly  not  working
[09:00] it's  never  worked  for  my  entire  life 
 this  this  sort  of  method  that  I  have  to
[09:05] try  and  attract  the  girl  that  I  want 
 which  is  going  to  stay  silent  and 
 silently  observe  them  and  just  be 
 [ __ ]  nervous  around  it  and  anxiously
[09:10] think  about  them  and  so  I  started  taking 
 other  things  more  seriously  instead  of 
 obsessing  over  girls  I  went  through  you
[09:15] know  a  bit  of  that  sort  of  not  hateful 
 energy  but  the  more  of  like  yeah  yeah 
 you  know  [ __ ]  girls  I  don't  even  care
[09:20] about  girls  anyway  I'm  just  gonna  like 
 focus  on  going  to  the  gym  and 
 interestingly  that's  exactly  what  worked
[09:25] when  I  had  other  things  to  focus  on  like 
 for  example  the  gym  making  new  friends 
 partying  I  automatically  started  to
[09:31] attract  more  girls  but  things  weren't 
 better  like  straight  away  so  as  I'm 
 getting  older  term  18  19  20  21  years  old
[09:36] and  I'm  having  sex  and  getting  into 
 relationships  pretty  much  most  of  the 
 relationships  that  I  got  into  two  were
[09:42] quite  depolarized  now  you're  going  to 
 learn  what  the  term  depolarization 
 depolarized  means  but  I'll  give  you  a
[09:47] very  brief  explanation  depolarized  just 
 kind  of  means  that  we  aren't  on  either
[09:52] end  of  the  spectrum  and  instead  we're  in 
 this  like  gray  androgynous  Zone  in  the 
 middle  so  what  we'd  like  to  be  or  at
[09:58] least  for  me  personally  maybe  for  you 
 I'd  like  to  be  way  more  on  the  masculine 
 side  and  then  meet  a  girl  who's  way  more 
 on  the  feminine  side  but  when  you're  way
[10:04] more  near  the  middle  you  bring  some 
 masculine  traits  and  some  feminine 
 traits  and  she's  way  more  near  the 
 middle  you're  depolarized  and  I'll
[10:10] explain  the  very  dire  consequences  of 
 being  in  a  relationship  where  you're 
 both  closer  to  the  middle  rather  than
[10:15] the  extreme  ends  and  trust  me  when  I  say 
 I  would  probably  guess  that  about  1995
[10:20] 99  of  relationships  at  least  in  my 
 country  are  depolarized  chances  are  if
[10:25] you're  in  a  relationship  right  now  it's 
 depolarized  even  though  you  know  it 
 sounds  hateful  chances  are  the  next 
 relationship  you  get  into  will  be
[10:31] depolarized  it  will  be  with  a  woman  who 
 brings  so  much  more  masculine  energy 
 that  she's  closest  to  the  middle  and  you
[10:36] bring  so  much  more  feminine  energy  that 
 you're  closer  to  the  middle  we'll  go 
 over  that  a  lot  more  but  one  of  the  very 
 interesting  things  I  learned  about  this
[10:41] which  it's  got  to  kind  of  upset  you  and 
 make  you  feel  a  little bit  insecure  is 
 that  people  who  are  depolarized  will
[10:47] never  have  an  extremely  feisty  sex  life 
 these  will  never  be  the  couples  who  will
[10:53] for  example  argue  and  then  just  fall  to 
 the  floor  just  [ __ ]  straight  away 
 these  will  never  be  the  couples  who  will
[10:58] [ __ ]  for  literally  an  hour  two  hours 
 straight  absolute  dominance  all  across
[11:03] the  room  that  the  Lampshades  just 
 [ __ ]  falling  off  the  lamp  whilst  You 
 could  argue  well  you  know  this  is  where 
 I  am  and  it's  authentic  for  me  to  be
[11:09] here  chances  are  you  probably  want  a 
 life  that's  more  on  this  side  and  you 
 probably  want  a  woman  who's  more  on  this
[11:15] side  and  so  at  least  for  me  when  I  was 
 18  19  20  years  old  and  getting  into 
 relationships  I  was  just  always  near 
 here  I  had  some  masculine  traits  and  I
[11:22] was  going  to  the  gym  and  eventually  I 
 started  boxing  and  I  was  thinking  about 
 more  of  my  you  know  my  male  friends  and 
 partying  so  I  had  like  some  kind  of
[11:27] mission  objective  but  I  was  bringing  a 
 lot  of  feminine  traits  I  was  also  just 
 obsessively  thinking  about  girls  really
[11:32] valuing  love  and  the  girls  that  I  was 
 with  naturally  because  I  was  in 
 university  for  this  time  were  quite 
 masculine  they  were  quite  like  gold  and
[11:38] study  orientated  now  that  can  of  course 
 be  a  good  thing  but  there's  a  variety  of 
 issues  that  stem  from  this  kind  of
[11:44] depolarized  relationship  but  what's  very 
 interesting  and  this  is  [ __ ]  okay  I  want 
 to  tell  you  something  about  me  I've
[11:50] dated  two  girls  who  have  brought  a  lot 
 of  masculine  energy  so  you  know
[11:56] depolarization  is  like  okay  where  the 
 man  was  supposed  to  be  masculine  but 
 we're  about  here  you  know  still  got  some
[12:01] you  know  masculine  traits  and  stuff  but 
 we're  here  like  we've  got  a  lot  of 
 feminine  traits  as  well  and  you  know  the 
 woman  she's  supposed  to  be  feminine  but
[12:06] she's  about  here  so  you're  here  right 
 I've  been  in  two  sort  of  not  really 
 relationships  you  know  dating  situations
[12:11] where  it's  been  more  like  this  where 
 I've  genuinely  felt  like  she's  actually 
 more  masculine  than  me  she's  actually
[12:17] thinking  more  about  work  and  goals  and 
 everything  than  I  am  and  I'm  thinking 
 more  about  her  and  I'm  like  the  little
[12:22] [ __ ]  at  home  no  you  can  see  I'm  not 
 happy  about  this  situation  and  again  a 
 lot  of  people  can  tell  you  oh  but  it's
[12:27] authentic  no  it's  not  bro  the  majority 
 of  men  don't  want  to  be  in  this 
 situation  let  me  tell  you  from  my
[12:32] personal  experience  the  first  girl  that 
 I  was  in  this  situation  with  who  was 
 more  masculine  than  I  was  she  was  very
[12:37] beautiful  I  hooked  up  with  her  in 
 University  like  I  went  on  a  night  out 
 then  saw  her  and  everything  she  was  so
[12:42] attractive  that  I  had  so  much  like 
 social  validation  for  being  the  guy  that 
 I  was  sleeping  with  literally  if  I  was
[12:47] with  her  the  club  guys  would  come  oh  my 
 God  bro  she's  so  fit  and  everything  it's 
 a  little  bit  disrespectful  of  a  guy
[12:52] coming  to  say  that  but  even  my  friends 
 as  well  will  be  messy  oh  my  God  you  know 
 she's  so  she's  so  attractive  and 
 everything  and  so  I  had  that  level  of
[12:57] social  validation  okay  she  was  by  then 
 the  most  attractive  girl  that  I  had  been 
 with  I'm  just  gonna  tell  you  the  [ __ ]
[13:02] truth  all  right 
 I  struggle  to  get  hard  with  her 
 honestly  imagine  being  with  the  most
[13:09] attractive  girl  of  your  life  by  this 
 point  so  maybe  I'm  20  years  old  and 
 imagine  not  being  able  to  get  hard  with
[13:14] her  and  you  know  at  the  time  I  thought 
 oh  yeah  because  you  know  I  just  feel 
 really  shy  and  stuff  because  she's  so 
 attractive  and  when  I  look  back  now  it's
[13:21] so  weird  that  she  was  a  very  attractive 
 girl  but  after  spending  some  time  with
[13:26] her  and  you  know  the  time  I  would  spend 
 with  her  I  wasn't  attracted  to  her  how 
 interesting  is  that  she  was  the  most
[13:31] attractive  girl  like  you  know  out  of  ten 
 a  7.5  or  an  eight  which  of  course  isn't 
 extremely  high  at  the  time  but  like  when
[13:36] you're  [ __ ]  20  years  old  and  you  know 
 I  mean  it's  pretty  nice  imagine  a  girl 
 who's  like  very  attractive  and  you  just
[13:41] aren't  attracted  to  her  why  because  our 
 energy  was  just  so  [ __ ]  off  and  so
[13:46] there  was  so  many  times  where  I'd  be 
 like  you  know  getting  ready  to  have  sex 
 with  her  and  my  dick  bro  would  be 
 literally  just  [ __ ]  just  pure  soft
[13:53] like  not  even  you  know  like  it's  soft 
 but  it's  got  a  bit  of  length  right  now 
 it's  kind  of  like  it  was  soft  and  it  was
[13:58] just  cold  like  that  kind  of  like  [ __ ] 
 size  bro  I'm  actually  getting  the  most 
 attractive  girl  of  your  life  and  your
[14:03] dick  not  even  getting  hard  for  her  and 
 it  wasn't  because  you  were  just  a  little 
 bit  you  know  insecure  or  shy  and 
 intimidated  it  was  more  that  you  just
[14:09] weren't  attracted  to  her  what's  very 
 interesting  was  that  I  was  never  like 
 truly  you  know  in  a  relationship  with
[14:14] her  we  were  never  exclusive  we  were  just 
 kind  of  like  somewhat  going  on  dates  but 
 mostly  just  hooking  up  until  we  were 
 never  exclusive  and  so  I  was  sleeping
[14:20] with  other  girls  and  I  specifically 
 remember  this  that  there  was  two  other 
 girls  so  I  was  sleeping  with  three  girls 
 like  at  the  same  time  and  there  was  two
[14:26] other  girls  that  I  would  be  sleeping 
 with  who  I  remember  you  know  they  would 
 come  up  to  my  university  flat  my  room
[14:31] and  I  remember  that  by  the  time  they  had 
 walked  into  my  room  and  we  had  maybe 
 just  you  know  just  seen  eye  contact  you
[14:36] know  I'm  standing  up  to  go  like  say 
 hello  to  her  you  know  stop  [ __ ] 
 before  we  had  done  anything  sexual  these
[14:41] two  other  girls  you  know  at  separate 
 times  you  know  I'm  horny  I'm  texting  one 
 bill  then  she  comes  up  on  Friday  you
[14:46] know  I mean  like  I  sound  like  oh  he's  a 
 [ __ ]  boy  and  stuff  like  if  you've 
 watched  my  videos  you  know  like  my  life
[14:51] is  very  different  now  compared  to  how  it 
 was  two  of  the  girls  would  come  up  and 
 quite  literally  bro  just  upon  making  eye 
 contact  with  them  and  also  you  know  the
[14:56] psychological  belief  of  Yahoo  yeah 
 they're  coming  up  to  have  sex  my  dick 
 would  be  rock  hard  and  with  girls  who
[15:01] were  like  weren't  as  attractive  they 
 were  still  you  know  pretty  attractive 
 but  just  not  to  that  same  level  as  the
[15:06] other  the  girl  so  how  interesting  is 
 that  that  with  the  most  attractive  girl 
 of  My  Life  by  then  I  didn't  really  feel 
 a  level  of  attraction  to  her  whereas
[15:12] with  other  girls  I  was  so  attracted  to 
 them  where  like  there  was  such  a  night 
 and  day  difference  between  my  like
[15:18] sexual  capability  and  I  didn't  really 
 know  this  back  then  you  know  I  kind  of 
 thought  oh  yeah  well  you  know  she's
[15:23] really  hot  and  so  I'm  insecure  I'm  you 
 know  that  I'm  a  little  bit  shy  and  stuff 
 but  I  wasn't  actually  shy  when  I  looked
[15:28] back  at  it  I  wasn't  shy  about  this  other 
 girl  I  just  wasn't  attracted  to  that 
 energy  and  so  what  happened  with  that
[15:33] that  you  know  the  the  main  bill  that 
 we're  talking  about  who  was  more 
 masculine  I  can  tell  you  one  night  for 
 example  like  we  stayed  over  we  went  to  a
[15:39] club  or  something  we  stay  over  and  like 
 so  many  times  this  would  happen  we're 
 like  I'd  wake  up  and  she'd  already  be
[15:44] awake  like  working  on  her  little  project 
 like  she  was  doing  some  like  art  class 
 or  some  [ __ ]  she  was  like  working  on  her
[15:49] project  already  and  almost  like  looking 
 at  me  almost  like  I  was  a  little  bit 
 like  lazy  and  you  know  come  on  like 
 she's  busy  like  can  you  go  now  I  was
[15:55] like  that  little  weak  guy  who's  waking 
 up  late  and  almost  disturbing  her  work 
 and  so  you  know  I'd  wake  up  and  you  know
[16:00] she  needs  to  focus  and  stuff  okay  fair 
 enough  so  I'd  go  back  to  my  place  and 
 just  kind  of  like  think  about  her  it's
[16:05] not  a  good  Dynamics  have  been  and  it's 
 not  at  least  in  my  perception  it's  not 
 like  an  attractive  like  relationship
[16:11] with  a  woman  to  have  so  that  was  a  few 
 years  ago  when  I  was  in  university  and 
 when  I  got  a  little  bit  older  age  23  24
[16:17] I  started  dating  you  know  other  girls  I 
 remember  another  girl  who  for  example  I 
 dated  she  wasn't  so  much  in  her
[16:23] masculine  energy  but  I  was  still  quite 
 in  my  feminine  I  was  still  quite  like 
 obsessively  thinking  about  her
[16:28] especially  when  there  was  like  problems 
 in  the  relationship  so  you  might  be  able 
 to  relate  to  this  if  there's  any  kind  of 
 like  problem  in  the  relationship  you've
[16:33] just  had  like  an  argument  or  something 
 you  can't  help  but  to  like  not  focus  on 
 anything  else  you're  in  the  gym  thinking
[16:38] about  her  you're  trying  to  do  work  study 
 whatever  and  you're  thinking  about  her 
 instead  and  like  your  mind's  just  like 
 elsewhere  and  you  know  that's  kind  of
[16:44] normal  it's  the  way  it  thinks  but  it's 
 not  ideal  at  all  when  you  think  about  it 
 so  about  one  year  ago  I  was  pretty
[16:49] successful  already  I  had  about  100  000 
 subscribers  I  was  a  very  fast  growing 
 Channel  at  this  point  what's  interesting
[16:54] is  that  I  had  this  level  of  success  and 
 yeah  I  was  still  obsessing  over  other 
 things  I  was  still  thinking  about  girls
[16:59] and  love  and  it  was  at  this  point  that  I 
 started  putting  in  a  lot  more  intention 
 into  learning  about  masculinity  and
[17:05] feminine  and  I've  spent  about  a  year 
 learning  this  stuff  before  I've  made 
 this  video  so  I  hope  that  there's  going
[17:10] to  be  like  some  life-changing  value  and 
 I  do  believe  that  I  have  a  very  good 
 level  of  understanding  of  this  one  thing
[17:15] which  I  think  is  the  single  best  reward 
 like  you  know  the  benefit  of  this
[17:20] journey  at  least  for  me  was  that  for 
 most  of  my  life  up  until  about  a  year 
 ago  I  was  just  not  really  motivated  to
[17:26] like  do  work  or  be  productive  I  didn't 
 want  to  study  I  didn't  want  to  even  like 
 you  know  business  work  even  on  my
[17:31] YouTube  channel  like  I  didn't  want  to  do 
 the  work  I  was  always  focused  on  other 
 things  and  so  I  always  wanted  to  work  as
[17:36] little  as  possible  now  if  you're 
 watching  this  video  and  you  kind  of  know 
 my  story  already  you'll  know  this 
 already  like  I've  placed  a  big  emphasis
[17:41] on  working  as  little  as  possible  through 
 most  of  my  journey  and  now  when  I  tell 
 you  the  things  are  the  exact  opposite
[17:47] and  I  feel  so  happy  about  it  it's 
 incredible  so  one  year  after  fully
[17:52] committing  myself  into  learning 
 masculine  and  feminine  energy  I  can't 
 work  enough  and  I  know  that  in  the
[17:58] modern  day  a  lot  of  people  you  know  like 
 depolarized  feminine  men  think  that's  a 
 bad  thing  like  oh  well  you  know  working 
 is  not  good  for  you  you  should  like  take
[18:04] time  off  to  enjoy  yourself  and  stop 
 broke  imagine  you  wake  up  up  and  the 
 first  thing  you  think  about  is  creative
[18:09] ideas  for  your  goal  imagine  that  you 
 literally  feel  motivated  every  single
[18:14] day  to  do  your  work  I  can't  wait  this  is 
 the  most  productive  I  have  ever  been  in
[18:20] my  entire  life  the  most  disciplined  I 
 have  ever  been  in  my  entire  life  this  is 
 the  most  like  my  success  in  everything
[18:26] I'm  doing  is  compounding  and  it  feels 
 [ __ ]  incredible  finally  I  feel  proud
[18:31] of  myself  finally  I  feel  like  I  can 
 actually  say  to  myself  to  you  I'm 
 working  very  hard  I  wake  up  at  4  45
[18:38] every  single  morning  and  I  start  writing 
 my  book  so  I'm  writing  a  book  I'm  going 
 to  be  publishing  it  soon  within  one  to
[18:43] two  months  and  I  wake  up  at  4  45  and 
 start  writing  straight  away  straight  to 
 it  I  write  about  a  thousand  words  every
[18:48] single  morning  I  wish  you  could  almost 
 observe  the  life  that  I'm  living  now 
 compared  to  the  life  that  I  was  living
[18:53] just  a  year  ago  two  years  ago  because 
 it's  so  [ __ ]  different  I'm  focused  on 
 my  work  for  95  of  the  day  and  what's
[19:00] very  beautiful  about  this  which  we'll 
 speak  more  about  is  that  my  girl  to  95 
 of  the  day  she's  thinking  about  me  I'm
[19:05] masculine  I'm  focused  from  my  work  she's 
 feminine  she's  focused  on  me  and  that 
 feels  [ __ ]  awesome  I  feel  like  I'm
[19:11] masculine  dominance  I'm  a  leader  I'm 
 guiding  her  it's  so  so  good  honestly  we
[19:17] have  to  discuss  something  now  and  I'm 
 gonna  get  into  a  little  bit  of  a  rant  so 
 maybe  you  can  skip  this  section  if  you 
 want  or  if  you  enjoy  my  run  so  if  you
[19:23] just  want  to  hear  this  guy  like  you  know 
 hate  Society  then  you  can  listen  if  you 
 want  we  have  to  explain  why  you  are  not
[19:28] masculine  already  because  this  is  a  New 
 Concept  for  men  to  be  raised  and  not
[19:33] turn  into  men  legally  you  might  be  a  man 
 but  you're  not  the  majority  of  men  are 
 not  men  that  the  guys  this  isn't  manhood
[19:40] this  is  Guy  hood  for  some  reason  I 
 always  have  this  level  of  hatred  yeah 
 yeah  you  know  guys  are  weak  but  then  I 
 started  to  ask  myself  why  and  I  realize
[19:46] it's  not  necessarily  a  guy's  fault  that 
 he's  weak  and  he's  feminine  now  of 
 course  you  know  as  men  we  should  take
[19:51] responsibility  for  our  actions  but  if 
 you've  been  raised  in  a  certain  way 
 which  has  led  you  to  this  point  is  it
[19:56] really  your  fault  or  is  there  an  enemy 
 at  hand  and  forgive  me  for  sounding 
 crazy  but  there  is  an  enemy  and  there  is
[20:01] a  war  on  masculinity  there  absolutely  is 
 a  war  on  masculinity  and  testosterone
[20:06] from  the  moment  of  birth  you  are 
 conditioned  you  are  conditioned  to  be 
 weak  and  feminine  and  submissive  you
[20:12] enter  the  school  system  as  a  legal 
 requirement  and  what's  very  interesting 
 is  our  perception  of  school  you  know  it
[20:17] has  to  be  a  little  bit  positive  because 
 yeah  education  is  really  important  but 
 you  don't  really  learn  that  much  in
[20:22] school  you  aren't  taught  important 
 things  that  you  actually  need  to  be  a 
 good  functioning  human  being  all  of
[20:28] school  is  just  a  big  Act  of  conditioning 
 for  you  to  be  submissive  and  to  follow
[20:33] the  instructions  of  the  authority  figure 
 so  that  as  soon  as  you  turn  18  or 
 whatever  age  it  is  in  your  country
[20:38] you're  ready  to  enter  the  workforce  as  a 
 submissive  Pawn  in  the  game  of  like  some 
 big  Corporation  you've  got  to  either
[20:44] love  or  hate  what  I'm  saying  here  and 
 whether  you  agree  with  it  or  not  you 
 feel  the  consequences  of  it  you  are  not
[20:50] even  a  quarter  of  the  man  that  your 
 great-grandfather  was  you  have  less  than 
 a  third  of  this  testosterone  when  you
[20:57] want  to  have  children  you  will  struggle 
 your  sperm  count  is  at  an  all-time  low 
 your  testosterone  is  at  an  all-time  low
[21:02] so  many  random  [ __ ]  you  know  the  studies 
 which  literally  show  that  a  man's  hand 
 grip  for  a  handshake  is  at  the  weakest
[21:08] they've  ever  found  through  the  history 
 of  like  them  like  I  don't  know  like  this 
 has  been  like  a  longitudinal  study
[21:13] researchers  have  literally  been  studying 
 the  strength  of  a  man's  like  handshake 
 grip  for  a  long  time  and  this  is  the
[21:19] weakest  handshake  grip  that  we  have 
 little  [ __ ]  limp  limp  handshake 
 [ __ ]  this  is  this  is  what  where
[21:25] we've  been  reduced  to  men  aren't  really 
 needed  anymore  strong  men  aren't  needed 
 we  live  in  times  of  of  abundance  and
[21:31] resource  and  even  in  developing 
 countries  you're  somewhat  relatively 
 safe  now  on  the  other  hand  at  times  of
[21:37] chaos  at  times  of  necessity  strong  men 
 rise  everyone  needs  them  everyone  looks 
 to  them  day  to  day  let's  say  we  go  to
[21:42] like  some  big  Metropolitan  like  liberal 
 I  don't  know  these  words  right  I'm  not 
 into  politics  or  some  [ __ ]  but  you  can
[21:47] imagine  the  kind  of  person  like  the 
 people  I'm  talking  about  who  are  like 
 they've  dyed  their  hair  color  they  say
[21:52] you're  using  the  wrong  pronouns  and 
 stuff  I  mean  if  you  go  to  like  a 
 university  that's  filled  with  these 
 kinds  of  people  and  you're  a  strong  man
[21:58] a  man  with  high  levels  of  testosterone 
 more  like  you  know  like  an  alpha  male 
 kind  of  character  they're  not  gonna 
 respect  you  yeah  yeah  he's  a  misogynist
[22:04] you  know  they'll  say  these  things  about 
 you  like  he's 
 like  let's  cancel  him  and  [ __ ]  right
[22:09] you're  not  needed  let's  just  imagine  a 
 scenario  in  which  you  are  needed  you're 
 in  the  same  situation  the  same 
 environment  an  enemy  walks  in  a  gunman
[22:16] walks  in  a  threat  occurs  who's 
 everyone's  eyes  gonna  dot  to  to  solve 
 the  problem  the  big  strong  man  you  see
[22:22] you  aren't  needed  until  you  are  and  at 
 that  point  well  people  are  expecting  you
[22:27] to  like  do  the  work  and  this  isn't  even 
 to  say  the  raw  subconscious  attraction 
 from  women  now  women  generally  in  like
[22:33] in  Western  countries  they  are  quite 
 depolarized  now  they  bring  in  quite  a 
 lot  of  like  masculine  traits  and  we'll 
 discuss  this  in  detail  soon  they're
[22:38] bringing  muscle  and  traits  because  they 
 have  to  they  push  into  the  education 
 system  just  like  you  are  they  fed  this 
 sort  of  narrative  of  like  you  know  the
[22:44] you  go  girl  boss  girl  mentality  and  so 
 they're  quite  masculine  but  even  then  a 
 woman's  raw  subconscious  Primal  sexual
[22:50] attraction  will  always  be  for  the 
 masculine  man  and  so  whilst  you've  been 
 conditioned  to  be  you  know  not  don't  be
[22:55] masculine  don't  be  strong  don't  be  a 
 misogynist  don't  be  dominant  don't  be 
 you  know  patriarchal  you've  been 
 conditioned  to  be  more  and  more  feminine
[23:01] and  you've  been  told  yeah  this  is  good 
 be  it  be  a  good  boy  be  a  good  boy  the 
 women  that  you  once  a  [ __ ]  a  guy
[23:06] who's  way  over  here  you  failed  this  test 
 do  you  understand  that  this  was  all  a 
 test  do  you  understand
[23:11] that  the  little  boys  who  were  raised 
 with  good  strong  father  figures  these 
 little  boys  who  naturally  just  had
[23:16] higher  levels  of  testosterone  they  were 
 amused  by  this  test  you  could  probably 
 imagine  one  of  those  boys  right  now 
 imagine  a  boy  in  primary  school  or  high
[23:22] school  that  you  know  the  teacher  told 
 them  to  be  more  feminine  you'll  sit  down 
 and  be  quiet  he  almost  like  laughed  at 
 her  and  he  was  quite  disruptive  now  of
[23:28] course  this  boy  is  probably  a  little  bit 
 stupid  and  he's  probably  broke  in  jail 
 or  something  right  now  but  that  was  a
[23:33] boy  a  male  a  man  who  didn't  fail  this 
 test  you  almost  had  to  be  like  this 
 disruptive  boy  who  probably  had  like
[23:38] autism  or  ADHD  you  know  one  of  those 
 like  disruptive  boys  who  always  got  into 
 trouble  and  always  like  laughed  and
[23:43] swore  at  the  teacher  and  stuff  he  didn't 
 succumb  to  the  pressure  of  acting  more 
 feminine  he  found  that  silly  we  listened
[23:49] to  those  words  of  advice  from  perhaps 
 well-meaning  authority  figures  teachers 
 the  media  and  we  fell  for  that  test  we
[23:55] fell  for  the  test  of  giving  up  our 
 masculinity  for  thinking  Yeah  well  yeah 
 everyone's  telling  me  to  be  more
[24:00] feminine  think  about  the  media  think 
 about  the  conditioning  the  brainwashing 
 that  you've  been  into  if  you  think  about
[24:05] the  shows  that  you  used  to  watch  or  the 
 movies  that  you  see  nowadays  what  do  you 
 see  generally  if  it's  like  a  show  or
[24:11] movie  about  like  a  family  generally  the 
 wife  is  like  the  strong  really  strong 
 resourceful  woman  she  not  only  looks
[24:17] after  the  kids  but  she  also  like  works 
 and  she  even  looked  after  the  husband 
 and  the  husband  the  father  is  a  bumbling
[24:23] idiot  this  is  how  men  and  fathers  are 
 portrayed  in  the  media  the  husband  and 
 the  father  is  always  like  an  idiot  he's
[24:28] always  just  feminine  he's  thinking  about 
 the  woman  and  stuff  he  always  keeps 
 making  these  mistakes  and  then  the  super 
 mom  comes  in  and  she'll  fix  the  day  and
[24:34] then  sometimes  just  sometimes  you  could 
 probably  visualize  this  right  now 
 sometimes  the  media  in  movies  and  TV
[24:39] shows  and  cartoons  and  all  this  [ __ ] 
 that's  literally  conditioning  your  brain 
 sometimes  they  will  show  a  strong
[24:44] masculine  father  figure  but  under  what 
 light  will  they  show  him  well  he's 
 patriarchal  and  he's  he's  gross  and  he's
[24:51] too  disciplined  and  he's  too  aggressive 
 and  he's  made  out  to  be  a  bad  guy  who 
 eventually  like  messes  up  and  somewhat
[24:56] embarrasses  himself  so  this  is  that 
 Dynamic  you  see  in  a  movie  where  there's 
 a  strong  man  and  he  messes  up  and  he 
 gets  like  dethroned  by  the  Little  Nerd
[25:02] with  the  skinny  neck  who  ends  up 
 becoming  like  a  superhero  and  like  looks 
 up  to  his  dad  and  says  this  is  the
[25:07] conditioning  that  you've  been  through 
 and  you  may  think  right  now  oh  well 
 that's  just  movies  that's  just  you  know 
 TV  shows  but  everything  that  you  see
[25:13] especially  at  a  young  age  deeply 
 influences  the  kind  of  man  or  guy  that
[25:18] you  become  and  if  you  followed  along 
 with  me  through  this  video  so  far  and 
 you  drew  that  little  bar  that  we  spoke
[25:23] about  and  you  put  your  line  of  where  you 
 are  right  now  closer  to  the  middle  then 
 you  can  see  that  the  results  of
[25:28] everything  that  you  were  raised  for  has 
 led  you  to  a  point  that  you  are  quite 
 depolarizing  you're  not  as  masculine  as
[25:34] you  should  be  because  you  totally 
 understand  this  and  everyone  understands 
 this  we  should  be  far  more  on  the  the 
 right  side  of  the  spectrum  we  should  be
[25:40] far  more  masculine  than  we  actually  are 
 we  haven't  even  spoke  about  the  war  on 
 testosterone  yet  do  you  know  the  average
[25:45] healthy  levels  of  testosterone  in 
 Western  countries  is  from  around  250
[25:51] nanograms  per  deciliter  to  around  950. 
 if  you  are  in  this  range  doctors  will
[25:56] hesitate  heavily  to  prescribe  you 
 testosterone  this  range  is  inherently
[26:02] and  blatantly  sexist  a  young  man  who's 
 22  years  old  and  his  dick  doesn't  work
[26:08] and  he  can't  focus  and  he's  depressed 
 and  he's  lethargic  and  he's  got  brain 
 fog  he  gets  out  of  bed  in  the  morning
[26:13] and  he's  literally  tired  straight  away 
 living  like  the  shell  of  a  life  that  he 
 should  be  with  no  Vitality  inside  of  him
[26:18] that  young  man  has  a  testosterone  score 
 of  260  nanograms  per  deciliter  and  his
[26:23] doctor  looks  to  him  and  said  oh  you're 
 in  the  healthy  range  imagine  having 
 symptoms  of  low  tests  you  don't  you
[26:28] don't  even  need  to  imagine  it  you're 
 living  that  reality  right  now  I  can  say 
 with  certainty  that  the  man  watching
[26:34] this  right  now  like  you  have  low 
 testosterone  now  you  might  fit  into  this 
 healthy  range  this  average  range  but  if
[26:41] you  fit  into  the  average  levels  of  today 
 that  means  that  your  testosterone  levels 
 are  actually  below  average  of  what  they
[26:47] should  be  in  the  history  of  mankind  I 
 said  this  before  and  people  scrutinize 
 me  these  [ __ ]  nerds  oh  well  oh  if
[26:53] you're  in  average  range  then  you're 
 average  no  because  the  average  range  is 
 like  a  modern  day  societal  construct  if
[26:59] you're  in  the  average  that's  in  the 
 right  middle  500  nanograms  per  deciliter 
 your  great-grandfather  had  two  to  three
[27:04] times  that  if  we  put  you  alongside  one 
 of  those  men  they  would  look  like  a 
 different  species  so  by  now  after  just
[27:10] watching  me  around  for  a  few  minutes  you 
 either  think  I'm  totally  crazy  and  I'm 
 delusional  and  I'm  dangerous  to  society
[27:16] or  maybe  just  maybe  you're  starting  to 
 realize  that  oh  yeah  it  does  sound 
 really  crazy  it  does  sound  kind  of 
 dangerous  and  you  know  he's  kind  of
[27:21] weird  but  he's  got  a  nice  beard  and  he's 
 wearing  a  bathrobe  so  I  can  trust  it 
 you're  probably  by  now  thinking  like 
 [ __ ]  there  seems  to  be  some  truth  into
[27:27] what  this  guy  on  YouTube  is  saying  you 
 already  knew  okay  you  know  my 
 testosterone  is  going  to  be  lower  than
[27:32] what  it  should  be  you  already  knew  like 
 yeah  I'm  not  that  extremely  masculine 
 and  stuff  but  when  we  ask  the  question 
 why  which  is  always  important  ask  why  it
[27:38] starts  to  sound  quite  like  a  conspiracy 
 theory  like  a  crazy  guy  would  be  talking 
 about  you  know  there's  a  war  on
[27:43] testosterone  you  know  like  the  [ __ ] 
 Dooms  there  with  like  the  big  billboard 
 like  oh  you  know  they're  trying  to  kill 
 our  sperm  cells  it  sounds  [ __ ]  crazy
[27:50] what  I'm  saying  can  you  think  of  it 
 another  explanation  honestly  like  if  you 
 can  think  of  another  explanation  please
[27:55] like  I'm  not  saying  this  at  all  like  uh 
 Farm  the  algorithm  or  something  but 
 leave  a  comment  and  like  start  a 
 discussion  because  I'd  love  to  hear  it
[28:01] I'm  quite  open  to  this  maybe  I'm  wrong 
 but  I  can't  think  of  a  better 
 explanation  of  why  men  are  so
[28:06] depolarized  lacking  masculinity  lacking 
 testosterone  than  just  a  war  on 
 masculinity  conditioning  from  a  very
[28:12] early  age  that  men  the  fathers  the 
 masculinity  the  strong  men  that
[28:18] testosterone  is  bad  for  us  that's  bad 
 for  society  and  this  is  even  again  to 
 talk  about  the  issue  of  a  lack  of  Father
[28:24] figures  in  the  home  fatherlessness  is  a 
 huge  huge  problem  in  the  modern  day 
 especially  in  Western  countries  honestly
[28:30] I'd  seen  like  some  crazy  misogynist  if  I 
 went  into  this  run  and  so  [ __ ]  it  I'm 
 gonna  do  it  there  is  an  incredible  level
[28:36] of  support  for  a  woman  who  does  not  want 
 to  stay  with  the  father  of  her  children 
 it's  a  smart  financial  decision  for  a
[28:42] woman  to  divorce  it's  actually  a  smart 
 financial  decision  think  about  that  it's 
 so  rewarded  in  my  country  in  the  UK  for
[28:50] a  woman  to  just  think  oh  well  you  know 
 he's  not  really  uh  he's  a  he's  kind  of 
 lazy  now  and  he  doesn't  treat  me  right
[28:55] and  stuff  so  I  can  just  leave  and  I'll 
 handle  the  kids  because  all  she's  grown 
 up  with  or  for  the  last  20  years  is  the
[29:00] you  go  girl  Super  Mom  you  can  do  it  all 
 yourself  you  know  women  can  do  anything 
 to  me  you  can  be  a  single  mom  you  career
[29:06] Mom  you  can  do  it  sounds  horrible  but 
 like  honestly  just  because  you  can 
 manage  it  doesn't  mean  that  you  can  or
[29:12] you  should  90  over  90  of  teenage 
 suicides  are  in  a  fatherless  home  over
[29:17] ninety  percent  of  teenage  criminality  of 
 asbos  anti-social  Behavior  orders  are  in 
 Father's  homes  over  90  of  drug  abuse  of
[29:24] teenagers  is  in  fatherless  homes  over  90 
 of  teenagers  who  go  on  to  be  homeless  or 
 from  fatherless  homes  if  you  can  think
[29:30] of  some  random  problem  that  teenagers 
 will  have  I  guarantee  they  are  multitude
[29:36] times  more  likely  to  happen  in  a 
 fatherless  home  you  can  literally  just 
 go  and  Google  this  [ __ ]  and  it's  [ __ ]
[29:41] where  I've  learned  everything  from  I'll 
 excite  it  if  you  want  but  where  I've 
 learned  all  these  like  facts  obviously
[29:46] I'm  not  totally  accurate  it's  not  19 
 maybe  it's  89  or  maybe  it's  not  you  know 
 I  mean  there's  a  book  called  The  Boy
[29:51] crisis  and  it  goes  over  this  issue  of 
 just  boys  being  raised  in  fatherless
[29:56] homes  by  single  mothers  and  you  know 
 with  this  attitude  like  oh  well  a  single 
 mom  is  a  superherence  you  can  do 
 anything  no  no  she  can't  she  cannot  a
[30:02] single  mom  cannot  raise  you  in  the  same 
 way  that  a  mother  and  a  father  who  are 
 loving  can  now  of  course  then  you  know
[30:08] there's  other  arguments  oh  well  what  if 
 the  father  is  abusive  and  you  know 
 should  he  be  taken  out  this  gets
[30:13] complicated  but  it's  not  that  caveat 
 that  you  really  see  in  modern 
 conditioning  is  it  when  you  think  about 
 the  movies  and  TV  shows  and  the  general
[30:19] belief  of  your  Society  chances  are  like 
 there's  this  empowering  thing  for  like 
 women  well  you  don't  need  a  man  you  go
[30:25] girl  fathers  are  being  taken  out  of  the 
 home  it's  been  supported  by  the 
 government  and  so  what  happens  to  a
[30:30] little  boy  who  grows  up  in  a  fatherless 
 home  chances  are  that  his  mother  his 
 single  mother  will  reward  and  praise  him
[30:37] and  positively  reinforce  him  when  he 
 acts  in  a  feminine  way  think  about  this 
 a  boy
[30:42] is  raised  in  a  household  with  a  single 
 mother  perhaps  just  perhaps  there's  a 
 small  amount  of  single  mothers  out  there
[30:48] in  the  world  that  can  take  a  step  back 
 from  their  own  shoes  and  understand  that 
 they  need  to  reward  this  boy  when  he
[30:54] does  things  that  actually  is  unnatural 
 for  her  perhaps  that's  a  small  caveat 
 right  but  for  the  majority  of  this  this
[31:00] household  Dynamic  of  a  boy  without  a 
 father  figure  with  a  single  mother  she's 
 gonna  have  her  own  biases  and  opinions
[31:05] and  feelings  and  beliefs  of  course 
 you're  right  and  so  she  is  going  to 
 respond  to  this  boy  with  those  biases
[31:10] opinions  and  beliefs  and  so  she's  going 
 to  positively  reinforce  and  praise  him
[31:15] for  the  times  that  he  acts  in  accordance 
 to  her  beliefs  and  emotions  and  feelings
[31:20] if  this  boy  acts  in  quite  a  masculine 
 adventurous  way  well  that's  not  very 
 natural  for  her  is  it  and  so  she'll  be
[31:26] like  no  no  come  back  you're  going  too 
 far  but  then  if  he  sits  quietly  and 
 Crosses  his  legs  and  plays  silently  and
[31:32] he  shares  well  well  you  know  she's  gonna 
 like  that  she's  gonna  like  those 
 feminine  traits  and  so  she's  gonna
[31:37] praise  him  for  oh  you're  such  a 
 well-behaved  boy  and  you've  got  to 
 understand  that  a  parent's  praise  is  is
[31:43] that's  how  you  became  the  person  you  are 
 today  so  if  you  think  back  to  that  that 
 bar  and  the  line  that  you  drew  and  you
[31:49] see  where  that  line  is  that  line  is 
 exactly  where  you  put  it  because  you 
 were  praised  to  act  like  this  you  were
[31:55] praised  to  act  more  feminine  if  you  had 
 a  strong  father  figure  in  the  house  he
[32:00] would  have  praised  you  only  when  you 
 acted  strong  and  masculine  so  you  go  out 
 on  your  on  your  bikes  and  you're  being
[32:05] competitive  with  your  friends  and  you 
 fall  over  your  dad  would  have  said  like 
 oh  that  you  know  you  went  too  fast 
 what's  your  mom  gonna  say  what's  your
[32:10] single  mom  she's  gonna  run  oh  my  God 
 you're  bleeding  never  do  that  again 
 never  go  that  fast  again  and  that's  just 
 a  very  simple  fast  example  that  a  guy  in
[32:16] a  bathroom  can  come  up  with  and  I  want 
 you  to  imagine  that  the  very  vast  huge
[32:21] amount  of  opportunities  for  praising  or 
 punishing  behaviors  that  would  go  on  in
[32:26] in  a  child's  life  over  years  and  years 
 and  years  and  then  imagine  well  he's 
 raising  a  single  mother  household  he's
[32:32] going  to  be  punished  when  he  acts  in  a 
 way  that  she  doesn't  like  which 
 potentially  would  be  in  masculine  ways
[32:37] and  he's  going  to  be  praised  and 
 rewarded  when  he  does  act  in  ways  that 
 she  likes  which  probably  would  be  in
[32:42] feminine  ways  you've  been  conditioned  in 
 your  own  home  you've  been  conditioned  in 
 school  you've  been  conditioned  when  you 
 watch  movies  and  TV  shows  you've  been
[32:47] conditioned  everywhere  to  be  more 
 feminine  than  you  should  be  am  I  crazy 
 maybe  but  again  if  there  is  someone  with
[32:54] a  better  argument  than  this  I  would  love 
 to  hear  it  but  I  I  can't  think  of  any 
 other  reason  why  we  are  struggling  with
[32:59] masculinity  today  so  we  understand  what 
 we  are  at  an  uphill  battle  you  and  I 
 because  we're  going  up  against  what  20
[33:05] years  30  years  or  however  old  you  are 
 conditioning  that's  a  lot  what's 
 interesting  and  what  gives  us  hope  is
[33:11] that  aligning  yourself  to  the  Natural 
 Energy  that  you  should  have  and  being 
 more  authentic  you  know  you're  just
[33:17] you're  supposed  to  be  all  masculine  so 
 we're  gonna  make  you  more  masculine  it 
 actually  counteracts  years  of  the
[33:23] inauthentic  living  that  you've  had  so 
 far  how  interesting  is  that  let's  say 
 you  could  be  feminine  little  little 
 [ __ ]  boy  for  20  years  of  your  life
[33:29] we're  just  about  one  year  maybe  six 
 months  of  training  to  be  more  masculine 
 you'll  counteract  most  of  that  think
[33:35] about  that  just  for  a  second  of  how 
 could  this  work  how  could  you  counteract 
 so  many  years  of  your  life  with  such  a
[33:41] short  period  of  self-improvement  or 
 focusing  not  being  more  masculine 
 because  this  is  how  you're  supposed  to
[33:46] be  for  all  of  your  life  you've  been 
 swimming  Upstream  being  pushed  but  just 
 constantly  swimming  Upstream  with  so
[33:51] much  friction  but  finally  I'm  gonna  turn 
 you  around  and  make  you  swim  alongside 
 the  stream  and  you're  gonna  find  that  it
[33:56] just  feels  so  natural  so  right  the  fact 
 that  you  sat  through  and  listened  to  all 
 of  this  demonstrates  you're  at  least
[34:01] your  interest  in  the  things  that  I'm 
 saying  and  you're  probably  relating  to  a 
 lot  of  the  things  that  we  spoke  about  so 
 far  inside  of  you  right  now  if  there  is
[34:07] a  feeling  of  Injustice  if  there  is  a 
 feeling  of  like  this  gut  pain  that 
 you've  been  wrong  that  your  life  would
[34:12] should  have  been  so  different  than  what 
 it  is  today  then  you  know  that  you've 
 clicked  on  the  Right  video  so  let's  now
[34:17] discuss  how  you  can  become  more 
 masculine  and  the  most  practical  no  BS 
 way  to  do  this  is  to  First  find  and
[34:23] discover  your  purpose  and  Mission  and 
 then  set  goals  and  obsess  over  those 
 goals  and  we're  going  to  break  this  down
[34:29] I'm  going  to  walk  you  along  the  process 
 with  me  and  there's  going  to  be  an 
 actionable  step  in  this  section  of  this 
 guide  so  do  this  right  now  in  the
[34:35] description  of  this  video  on  YouTube 
 I've  linked  a  notion  template  which  you 
 can  use  to  set  your  goals  scroll  down  to
[34:41] that  link  and  click  on  it  right  now  and 
 then  come  to  this  video  when  you  click 
 on  that  link  you  should  see  a  page  just
[34:46] like  this  and  I'm  going  to  walk  you 
 through  the  exact  process  that  I 
 personally  use  to  set  and  obsess  over
[34:51] gold  and  this  process  not  only  has  it 
 created  massive  amounts  of  success  for 
 me  personally  in  my  own  life  but  it's
[34:57] also  just  made  me  so  much  more  masculine 
 I'm  just  going  to  explain  to  you  why 
 goal  setting  makes  you  more  masculine
[35:02] it's  the  single  most  practical  thing 
 that  you  have  complete  control  over  that 
 will  make  you  more  masculine  why  because
[35:08] like  we  said  the  masculine  energy  is  all 
 about  making  progress  inside  of  you  is 
 this  natural  desire  to  make  progress
[35:15] either  to  ejaculation  to  impregnate  a 
 woman  or  to  develop  yourself  to  get  to
[35:20] the  point  where  you  can  do  that  we  have 
 inside  of  us  a  core  desire  which  is  to 
 make  progress  to  some  kind  of  meaningful
[35:27] work  and  so  you  need  to  figure  out  what 
 is  this  meaningful  work  this  Mission 
 this  purpose  for  yourself  and  so  I  have
[35:33] some  journaling  prompts  that  you  can  do 
 right  now  as  an  actionable  step  that 
 will  help  you  to  discover  things  like 
 your  mission  your  purpose  and  then  your
[35:39] goals  and  then  very  shortly  we'll 
 actually  go  through  the  goal  setting 
 procedure  okay  so  here  are  three 
 journaling  prompts  that  you  should  do
[35:45] right  away  so  you  should  ask  yourself 
 these  questions  and  journal  the  answer 
 either  on  a  piece  of  paper  or  on  some
[35:50] document  on  your  computer  number  one 
 what  stage  of  the  Maslow's  hierarchy  of
[35:55] needs  do  I  need  to  fulfill  the  hierarchy 
 of  needs  is  a  pyramid  it's  a  concept 
 made  by  the  psychologist  Abraham  Maslow
[36:02] and  it's  all  about  the  fundamental 
 desires  that  we  have  as  humans  and  I 
 think  it's  incredibly  important  to
[36:08] figuring  out  where  you  are  in  life  the 
 bottom  level  of  this  pyramid  are  all  the 
 essential  things  that  we  need  to  survive
[36:13] like  breathing  drinking  water  eating 
 food  excreting  every  level  above  that  is 
 another  desire  that  creates  a  well
[36:20] meaningful  fulfilling  life  for  us  what's 
 very  interesting  that  I've  noticed  which 
 might  help  you  with  your  answer  to  this
[36:25] question  is  that  your  mind  will  ruminate 
 on  the  need  that  you're  currently  stuck
[36:30] on  so  let's  say  for  example  you're 
 extremely  thirsty  your  thoughts  are 
 going  to  be  based  on  drinking  water  but
[36:36] of  course  let's  say  if  all  your 
 essential  survival  Necessities  are  taken 
 care  of  for  the  majority  of  men  even
[36:41] though  the  majority  of  guys  don't  want 
 to  admit  this  the  need  the  desire  that 
 they're  stuck  on  is  that  of  sex  and  love
[36:48] their  mind  ruminates  on  sex  and  love 
 that's  the  desire  that  they  need  right 
 now  it's  very  important  for  you  to  be 
 totally  authentic  and  honest  with  this
[36:54] journaling  prompt  that  you  should  do 
 right  now  which  stage  of  Maslow's 
 hierarchy  of  need  do  I  currently  need  to
[36:59] fulfill  what  does  your  mind  ruminate  on 
 and  just  write  down  the  answer  and  it 
 just  be  very  interesting  because  I  think
[37:04] the  majority  of  guys  who  answer  this 
 question  truthfully  would  say  sex  and  I
[37:09] think  a  fair  amount  of  guys  would  also 
 say  social  connection  these  are 
 fundamental  desires  and  sure  you  can 
 with  a  sense  of  motivation  and
[37:15] discipline  look  past  them  to  you  know 
 focus  on  something  else  and  you  know 
 this  sort  of  modern  day  oh  I  don't  need 
 girls  oh  you  focused  on  yourself  King
[37:21] you  feel  a  lot  more  free  when  you've 
 fulfilled  a  desire  a  need  on  this
[37:26] pyramid  and  so  it's  just  very 
 interesting  to  figure  out  where  you  are 
 because  this  will  really  help  you  with 
 your  goal  setting  because  I  could  rant
[37:32] about  this  separately  man  but  like  I  I 
 am  a  big  advocate  of  just  being  totally
[37:37] open  and  authentic  and  just  saying  like 
 yep  I  want  a  girlfriend  yep  I'm  going  to 
 set  some  goals  based  on  being  able  to
[37:42] have  sex  because  something  that  my  mind 
 is  ruminating  on  and  it's  something  that 
 would  fulfill  me  a  lot  of  people
[37:47] disagree  with  this  and  there's  a  whole 
 modern  Narrative  of  like  oh  yeah  we 
 don't  need  women  or  women  uh  and  then
[37:53] women  say  this  as  well  we  don't  need  men 
 both  groups  are  just  lonely  as  [ __ ]  so 
 you  can  choose  but  I  personally  think
[37:58] that  if  your  mind  is  ruminating  on  a 
 need  in  this  pyramid  it  would  be  of  your 
 best  interest  to  fulfill  that  need  and
[38:04] to  set  a  goal  based  on  that  the  second 
 journaling  prompts  to  ask  yourself  and 
 to  answer  right  now  is  what  is  some  work
[38:09] that  I  can  do  that  will  help  my  tribe  an 
 answer  to  this  question  may  help  you 
 find  your  purpose  what  is  some  work  that
[38:15] you  can  do  to  help  other  people  that  you 
 care  about  a  group  that  you  care  about 
 first  you  need  to  kind  of  figure  out  who
[38:21] is  even  in  your  tribe  is  it  just  your 
 family  and  your  friends  is  it  some  kind 
 of  community  that  you're  a  part  of  have 
 you  created  almost  like  a  social
[38:27] movement  like  you  see  before  you  right 
 now  who  is  in  your  tribe  and  what  can 
 you  do  to  help  them  you've  seen  the
[38:32] modern  day  so  many  men  are  lacking 
 masculinity  in  this  sense  of  like  being 
 connected  with  our  tribe  that  we  only
[38:37] think  about  ourselves  one  of  the  best 
 things  that  you  can  do  is  to  have  a 
 self-transcending  purpose  and  that
[38:42] simply  just  means  to  have  like  a  reason 
 why  you're  doing  something  which  is 
 bigger  than  you  self-transcending  means
[38:48] bigger  than  you  and  purpose  is  kind  of 
 like  the  reason  that  because  of  the 
 action  that  you're  taking  what  is  the
[38:54] purpose  of  your  life  why  do  you  do  what 
 you  do  why  is  your  life  important  how 
 can  your  life  how  can  the  work  that  you
[39:00] do  help  someone  that  you  care  about 
 because  in  the  end  that's  really  the 
 only  important  thing  it's  not  even  about
[39:05] the  money  the  rewards  the  girls  anything 
 like  this  in  the  end  it  all  just  comes 
 down  to  were  you  a  good  member  in  your
[39:11] tribe  it's  very  important  for  you  to 
 just  take  a  minute  right  now  and  first 
 answer  the  initial  question  who  is  in  my
[39:16] tribe  what  is  my  tribe  and  then  to  ask 
 yourself  okay  what  is  work  that  I  could 
 do  to  help  them  for  me  My  Tribe  even  in
[39:22] high  school  it  always  felt  like  my  tribe 
 was  other  guys  who  were  struggling  with 
 the  same  problems  as  me  my  mind  would
[39:28] almost  automatically  teach  what  I  had 
 just  learned  to  like  an  imaginary  young
[39:33] man  in  my  own  mind  does  that  make  sense 
 so  I  would  learn  something  let's  say 
 about  Fitness  or  about  dieting  and  it's 
 like  my  mind  would  just  be  like  teaching
[39:39] it  to  itself  pretending  itself  was  like 
 a  separate  guy  and  so  you  can  see  that 
 YouTube  like  the  perfect  work  for  me  to
[39:45] get  into  and  now  my  tribe  that  I'm 
 trying  to  help  with  the 
 self-transcending  purpose  is  young  men 
 around  the  world  who  are  tuning  in  who
[39:51] want  to  improve  themselves  a  purpose  is 
 so  so  important  purpose  I  want  to
[39:56] explain  this  so  clearly  because  for  so 
 long  I  didn't  understand  what  purpose 
 meant  you  know  so  many  people  talk  about
[40:01] it  online  purpose  is  just  the  reason  why 
 it's  that  because  of  your  action  of  your 
 mission  my  mission  is  to  help  young  men
[40:07] improve  themselves  and  my  purpose  the 
 why  that  because  of  that  mission  why  do 
 I  want  to  help  young  men  improve
[40:13] themselves  because  I've  done  it  for 
 myself  because  I've  lived  that  life  I've 
 lived  the  life  of  like  total  Indulgence 
 and  pleasure  of  that  modern  day  like  bad
[40:19] habits  and  I  hated  my  life  then  I  was  so 
 depressed  and  I  feel  like  I  have  the 
 answers  in  my  brain  and  so  I  work
[40:25] relentlessly  to  try  and  just  help  people 
 around  the  world  because  I  think  that  I 
 counted  some  good  work  that  I  can  do  and
[40:32] the  third  journaling  prompt  to  ask  right 
 now  is  what  do  I  want  my  life  to  be  like 
 in  10  years  time  to  help  you  with  this
[40:38] question  I  want  to  just  give  you  one 
 piece  of  advice  think  big  there  is  Magic 
 in  thinking  big  don't  settle  for  me  T
[40:44] ambition  especially  thinking  big  and 
 setting  a  very  very  authentic  desirable
[40:50] future  for  yourself  is  an  incredible 
 thing  and  if  you  work  hard  and  obsess 
 over  a  goal  like  that  you  know  you
[40:55] really  think  yourself  okay  I'm  22  right 
 now  what  would  be  the  best  life  that  I
[41:00] could  have  at  32  years  old  and  you  start 
 to  write  that  down  and  you  start  to 
 visualize  it  and  you  start  to  like  work
[41:06] towards  it  and  you  know  we'll  set  some 
 goals  regarding  this  together  you  make 
 some  incredible  progress  and  it's  all
[41:11] about  where  you  set  that  goal  you  know 
 for  the  majority  of  goals  that  I've  set 
 I've  had  people  say  nope  that's  crazy
[41:16] it's  impossible  and  yet  I'm  here  it's  so 
 easy  for  your  own  brain  to  be  like  the 
 naysayer  in  this  and  so  this  is  a  very
[41:22] important  question  to  ask  yourself  how 
 far  does  your  own  mind  think  that  you 
 can  go  how  big  is  your  brain  thinking
[41:27] when  it  thought  about  this  journaling 
 prompt  of  like  where  do  you  want  to  be 
 in  10  years  from  now  and  also  take  some
[41:32] time  to  really  consider  some  very 
 important  things  do  you  want  to  be  a 
 father  10  years  from  now  chances  are  if
[41:37] you're  watching  this  10  years  from  now 
 you  probably  will  be  and  so  what  do  you 
 want  life  to  be  like  then  I  can't  really
[41:42] give  you  advice  on  this  because  this  is 
 all  based  on  you  know  your  own  desires 
 the  kind  of  life  that  you  want  the  life
[41:47] that  you  think  is  best  for  your  future 
 children  and  your  family  but  the 
 majority  of  men  don't  really  think  about
[41:52] a  question  like  this  they  just  kind  of 
 think  what  they're  going  to  eat  for 
 dinner  today  that's  as  far  as  their 
 thinking  really  goes  but  a  man  who
[41:58] thinks  in  decades  is  dangerous  and 
 that's  a  quote  from  a  man  that  I  really 
 respect  Chris  stermsley  otherwise  known
[42:03] as  first  man  men  who  think  in  decades 
 are  dangerous  so  those  three  journaling 
 prompts  should  give  you  some  kind  of
[42:08] idea  on  the  goals  that  you  should  set  so 
 now  if  you  look  back  to  that  goal 
 setting  template  that  I  got  you  to  click
[42:13] on  start  to  fill  out  some  of  those  boxes 
 what  is  a  goal  that  you  want  to  achieve 
 10  years  from  now  I've  already  put  some
[42:19] templates  and  examples  of  the  kind  of 
 goals  that  I  set  for  myself  so  you  can 
 just  kind  of  alter  them  to  fit  your  own
[42:24] desires  a  very  important  thing  that  you 
 should  do  right  now  is  to  start  off  with 
 the  longer  term  goals  the  10-year
[42:29] five-year  and  one  year  goals  and  then 
 the  monthly  Milestones  so  you  see  that
[42:34] there's  a  column  for  every  month  going 
 toward  the  next  year  those  goals  for  the 
 month  you  should  see  more  like
[42:40] Milestones  to  achieve  the  big  goals  once 
 you  have  a  document  like  this  and  your 
 goals  are  really  organized  that  becomes
[42:46] so  helpful  and  the  way  to  use  this 
 practically  in  your  normal  day-to-day 
 life  is  to  base  all  decisions  of  the
[42:52] long  term  the  one  five  ten  year  goals 
 that  you've  set  visualize  and  make 
 decisions  based  on  these  big  long-term
[42:58] goals  but  then  obsessively  focus  and 
 work  on  the  short-term  Milestones
[43:03] because  it's  these  short-term  monthly 
 Milestones  that  cause  you  to  kind  of 
 push  forward  a  bit  but  the  monthly
[43:08] milestone  for  me  kind  of  reminded  me  of 
 like  setting  a  rep  or  a  weight  goal  in 
 the  gym  it's  something  okay  I'm  focused
[43:14] on  right  here  right  now  but  the  bigger 
 thing  to  kind  of  you  know  wake  up  and 
 sort  of  make  big  decisions  about  and  to 
 visualize  is  like  the  end  of  your  goal
[43:20] five  years  from  now  so  it's  very 
 important  that  you  have  this  divide 
 between  monthly  Milestone  goals  which
[43:25] you  obsessively  work  towards  and  then 
 these  long-term  yearly  goals  which  you 
 make  decisions  based  on  once  you  finish
[43:30] this  goal  page  and  you've  added  in  all 
 the  details  that  you  want  and  you  feel 
 like  you  need  obsess  over  it  this  is  one
[43:36] of  the  most  important  things  that  I  do 
 and  if  you  want  to  take  something  from 
 me  make  it  this  obsess  over  this
[43:41] singular  practical  page  that  you  have 
 here  is  the  first  thing  that's  open  on 
 my  laptop  I  look  at  it  on  my  phone 
 anytime  you  know  you're  like  you're
[43:47] wasting  time  five  minutes  here  10 
 minutes  there  you're  waiting  in  line  for 
 something  you're  walking  somewhere  and 
 you  know  you're  just  flicking  on  your
[43:52] phone  and  of  course  you  should  try  and 
 be  more  Mindful  and  stuff  but  like 
 anytime  I'm  just  randomly  on  my  phone  I 
 don't  have  social  media  anymore  because
[43:57] I  literally  just  look  at  this  one  page 
 and  it  just  the  amount  of  intention  that 
 and  ideas  that  you  get  from  just
[44:03] obsessing  over  this  one  page  that 
 reminds  you  constantly  okay  this  is  what 
 you  said  you  would  achieve  this  month
[44:08] it's  so  valuable  because  goal  setting 
 and  goal  obsessing  is  the  single
[44:13] greatest  way  to  become  more  masculine 
 because  it  just  makes  you  so  aligned 
 with  your  work  and  your  desires  and  this
[44:19] this  feeling  this  crave  of  progress 
 because  you  see  these  goals  that  you've 
 set  out  what  they  symbolize  is  progress
[44:26] to  your  mission  and  to  your  purpose  so 
 the  total  level  the  thing  that  you  know 
 really  fulfills  men  is  having  this  huge
[44:31] Mission  this  huge  purpose  but  the  way  to 
 make  the  most  progress  to  these  things
[44:36] is  by  obsessing  over  the  goals  but  then 
 to  actually  make  progress  in  these  goals
[44:41] you  need  discipline  and  mental  health  so 
 you  want  to  be  more  masculine  and 
 relentlessly  work  towards  your  goals  and
[44:47] your  purpose  that's  where  discipline  and 
 mental  health  come  from  discipline  and 
 good  mental  health  determine  your  work
[44:52] rate  and  your  productivity  mental  health 
 especially  is  overlooked  for  a  lot  of 
 men  it's  something  that  you  know  we're
[44:57] beginning  to  talk  a  lot  about  I've 
 personally  found  that  improving  your 
 mental  health  is  the  single  best  thing 
 that  you  can  do  to  increase  your
[45:02] productive  work  output  you  know  all 
 those  productivity  tactics  you've  ever 
 heard  of  the  Pomodoro  Technique  and  all
[45:08] of  these  things  improving  your  mental 
 health  through  things  like  journaling 
 and  meditation  actually  increases  your
[45:13] output  your  productivity  more  than  all 
 of  those  things  I  made  a  two  hour  full 
 guide  that  you  can  watch  for  free  on
[45:19] improving  your  mental  health  I'll  have 
 like  a  little  card  pop  up  on  screen  and 
 I'll  have  it  linked  in  the  description 
 as  well  I  highly  recommend  you  have  a
[45:25] look  at  that  I  know  mental  health 
 doesn't  seem  like  a  very  fun  video  or 
 concept  to  like  learn  about  but  I
[45:30] promise  you  that  it  will  have  some  of 
 the  highest  return  on  investment  that 
 you  can  find  your  ability  to  just  keep 
 your  brain  operating  well  well  that's
[45:37] how  you  accomplish  anything  else 
 discipline  is  a  mindset  just  like  good 
 mental  health  it  drastically  improves
[45:43] your  work  rates  and  improving  your  work 
 rates  improves  the  progress  that  you 
 make  to  your  goals  improving  the 
 progress  that  you  make  to  your  goals
[45:49] fulfills  your  mission  and  purpose  which 
 makes  you  more  masculine  so  you  see  how 
 all  this  links  up  and  so  discipline  is 
 an  absolute  Cornerstone  virtue  and  treat
[45:57] in  masculinity  discipline  is  the  skill 
 of  doing  the  hard  work  especially  when
[46:02] you  don't  feel  like  it  I'm  gonna  say 
 something  controversial  but  in  the 
 modern  day  you've  been  conditioned  to  be
[46:07] so  in  touch  with  your  emotions  you  are 
 the  most  emotional  guy  in  touch  with 
 your  feelings  than  any  man  in  your
[46:13] bloodline  before  this  now  I  think  it's 
 fantastic  to  be  aware  of  your  emotions
[46:18] because  that's  a  practice  of  mindfulness 
 that  comes  from  like  meditation  and 
 everything  but  to  be  emotional  to  be  in
[46:23] your  feelings  well  feelings  are  fickle 
 and  this  is  why  you  see  so  many  guys 
 that  aren't  disciplined  because  they
[46:28] don't  feel  like  doing  the  hard  work 
 right  now  and  you  can  probably  relate  to 
 this  you  know  we're  not  talking  about
[46:33] any  other  guys  we're  talking  about  you 
 you  don't  feel  like  doing  some 
 productive  tasks  right  now  so  you  don't 
 do  it  you  procrastinate  you  know  that's
[46:39] kind  of  like  a  new  invention 
 procrastination  do  you  really  think  the 
 men  in  your  blood  procrastinated  they
[46:45] couldn't  there  was  a  necessity  for  them 
 to  go  to  work  into  the  factories  out  on
[46:50] the  hunt  even  when  they  didn't  feel  like 
 it  because  they  had  to  there  was  no  one 
 telling  them  oh  you  know  we'll  just  be
[46:55] in  touch  with  your  emotions  take  a 
 self-care  day  what  I'm  saying  seems  kind 
 of  backwards  it  seems  against  all  the 
 mental  health  kind  of  advice  that  you've
[47:01] heard  but  the  thing  is  it's  absolutely 
 important  to  prioritize  your  mental 
 health  but  you  need  to  learn  to  just  go
[47:07] and  do  hard  work  even  when  your  brain 
 says  like  oh  but  I  don't  feel  like  it 
 I'm  not  ready  for  it  this  is  what  my
[47:12] physique  looks  like  after  years  and 
 years  of  going  to  the  gym  and  please 
 believe  me  like  bro  going  to  the  gym  is
[47:17] one  of  the  most  fun  things  that  I  do  I 
 honestly  love  it  but  I  would  have  missed 
 more  than  half  of  my  workouts  over  the
[47:23] years  that  I've  been  training  if  I  only 
 went  to  the  gym  when  I  really  felt  like 
 it  some  days  it's  a  total  slog  I  really
[47:29] don't  want  to  go  but  you  know  what  I  do 
 I  convince  myself  that  all  I  need  to  do 
 is  just  take  the  next  step  I  don't  need
[47:34] to  think  about  the  height  of  the 
 discomfort  you  know  the  the  challenge 
 the  pain  the  fear  of  the  top  set  of
[47:39] squats  which  are  gonna  exhaust  my  body  I 
 don't  need  to  think  about  that  right  now 
 I'm  sat  here  with  my  bathrobe  all  I  have 
 to  do  is  just  change  right  now  all  I
[47:45] have  to  do  is  just  put  my  shoes  on  right 
 now  all  I  have  to  do  is  just  fill  up  my 
 water  bottle  all  I  have  to  do  is  just 
 walk  out  with  the  door  that's  all  I  tell
[47:50] myself  okay  come  on  just  walk  out  the 
 door  that's  all  you  can  do  you  you  can 
 walk  out  your  door  right  now  can't  you 
 okay  come  on  let's  walk  downstairs  you
[47:55] can  do  that  right  now  can't  you  okay 
 good  put  your  music  in  okay  let's  walk 
 to  the  gym  you  can  do  that  yeah  of 
 course  you  can  just  step  by  step  by  step
[48:00] by  step  by  step  and  suddenly  I'm  warming 
 up  I  feel  good  [ __ ]  it  let  me  attempt 
 that  PR  on  squats  this  is  discipline
[48:05] discipline  is  the  skill  of  just 
 overlooking  your  emotions  because  there 
 is  some  important  valuable  work  that  you
[48:11] said  you  would  do  you  made  a  promise  to 
 yourself  that  you  would  do  some 
 important  work  and  so  it  is  of  utmost
[48:16] importance  for  the  sake  of  your 
 masculinity  that  you  do  that  work  the 
 reason  why  I'm  getting  quite  vexed  right
[48:21] now  is  because  discipline  it's  such  an 
 important  skill  and  trait  that  I  see 
 lacking  in  so  many  young  men  so  many
[48:27] young  men  because  we  spoke  so  far  that 
 if  you  want  to  be  more  masculine  you 
 need  you  know  a  big  mission  to  work 
 towards  the  progress  towards  and  to  note
[48:33] your  progress  to  this  Mission  we  set 
 goals  and  Milestones  and  to  make 
 progress  to  them  well  you  need  to  work
[48:38] hard  and  you  need  to  especially  work 
 hard  even  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 because  that's  really  when  we  show  the
[48:43] greatest  level  of  progress  if  you  only 
 work  hard  when  you  kind  of  feel 
 motivated  to  do  so  then  you  haven't
[48:48] really  developed  yourself  as  a  man  have 
 you  so  this  is  how  you  level  up  your 
 discipline  skill  and  interestingly  it's
[48:53] the  exact  same  way  that  you  level  up  in 
 weightlifting  it's  all  about  the  concept 
 of  progressive  overload  Progressive
[49:00] overload  is  this  concept  this  kind  of 
 training  method  in  weightlifting  which 
 is  that  we  start  off  at  like  a  light
[49:05] weight  and  over  weeks  and  months  and 
 years  we  just  slowly  incrementally  add
[49:10] on  a  little  bit  of  weight  every  single 
 time  when  a  beginner  goes  to  the  gym  he 
 doesn't  think  oh  I'm  gonna  go  bench
[49:15] press  seven  plates  the  clever 
 intelligent  beginner  says  okay  I'm  gonna 
 go  and  just  start  with  the  empty  bar  and
[49:20] just  see  how  that  is  and  two  weeks  from 
 now  I  might  add  on  5kg  either  side  of 
 the  bar  maybe  10  kg  six  months  from  now
[49:26] a  year  from  now  I  might  even  have  20  kg 
 either  side  of  the  bar  and  three  years 
 from  now  it  might  even  be  40  kg  either
[49:33] side  of  the  bar  that's  100  kg  for  the 
 total  weight  we  increase  whatever  we  do 
 incrementally  that's  Progressive
[49:38] overload  and  discipline  is  the  exact 
 same  thing  you  need  to  progressively 
 overload  your  discipline  what's  very 
 interesting  about  discipline  is  that
[49:43] discipline  actually  cures  and  this  is 
 controversial  as  [ __ ]  but  discipline 
 cures  depression  depression  is  simply
[49:48] just  a  reduction  in  your  Progressive 
 overload  of  Life  you've  just  reduced  how 
 much  you're  able  to  do  of  life  you  used
[49:54] to  be  able  to  you  know  go  out  and  go  to 
 work  and  study  and  just  be  a  normal 
 person  and  now  you  fuel  like  that's  just
[49:59] too  hard  to  do  you  just  reset  your 
 Progressive  overload  and  also  all  you've 
 got  to  do  is  just  progressively  overload
[50:04] back  up  so  it's  a  struggle  doing 
 anything  more  than  just  you  know  lying 
 on  your  bed  watching  some  [ __ ] 
 YouTube  on  your  phone  so  progressively
[50:10] overload  today  get  out  of  your  bed  and 
 brush  your  teeth  that's  a  big  jump  for 
 some  people  what  are  you  up  to  in  life
[50:15] right  now  especially  in  terms  of  the 
 work  and  the  progress  that  you're  making 
 to  your  goals  and  then  figure  out  the 
 next  Progressive  overload  step  to  that
[50:21] what  is  one  step  further  that  you  can 
 take  today  tomorrow  next  week  and  then
[50:26] ask  yourself  this  every  single  day  you 
 just  constantly  want  to  be  progressively 
 overloading  your  discipline  the
[50:31] sacrifices  that  you  make  the  hard 
 choices  that  you  make  just  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  and  you  know  what  that's
[50:38] that's  really  bringing  something  that 
 you  know  a  lot  of  people  don't  really 
 talk  about  and  you  know  we  speak  about
[50:43] discipline  and  masculinity  and  goals  and 
 everything  or  you  know  online  and  you've 
 seen  this  before  you  know  like  oh  yeah 
 making  money  you  know  all  these
[50:48] productive  things  that  you've  seen 
 online  one  of  the  things  that  many  other 
 creators  don't  really  talk  about  I'm
[50:53] kind  of  going  on  around  here  but  I  think 
 this  might  be  available  for  you  it's 
 that  you  really  have  to  sacrifice  you
[50:58] have  to  sacrifice  if  you  want  to  become 
 more  masculine  you  have  to  sacrifice  a 
 lot  of  things  if  you  want  to  become  more 
 disciplined  think  about  what  you  have  to
[51:03] sacrifice  discipline  is  inherently  a 
 sacrifice  of  comfort  and  you've  been
[51:08] bred  to  stay  in  Comfort  to  just  keep 
 sucking  on  like  mommy's  nipple  I  know 
 that  sounds  weird  but  that's  literally
[51:13] the  life  of  the  majority  of  males  and  I 
 won't  even  say  men  the  majority  of  guys 
 are  males  not  men  you've  been  bred  to
[51:19] just  stay  in  a  state  of  comfort  because 
 you're  not  used  to  making  sacrifices 
 everything  that  I've  discussed  in  this
[51:24] guide  and  pretty  much  everything  I 
 discuss  on  my  Channel  all  the  work  that 
 I  do  is  based  on  sacrificing  these
[51:29] momentary  small  short  Pleasures  that 
 don't  fulfill  us  that  don't  free  us  they 
 don't  actually  just  give  us  anything
[51:34] more  than  a  fleeting  sense  of  comfort 
 but  will  always  have  that  thought  in  our 
 minds  that  we  Jeffries  you  need  to
[51:40] sacrifice  comfort  you  need  a  sacrifice 
 to  become  more  masculine  to  become 
 successful  to  become  healthy  and  you
[51:45] know  I  just  spoke  about  the  concept  of 
 progressive  overload  there  is  a  phrase 
 that  I've  said  before  that  really  helped
[51:50] me  and  the  phrase  was  sacrifice  must  be 
 progressively  overloaded  whatever  you've 
 sacrificed  so  far  to  make  progress  in
[51:57] some  disciplined  goal  like  Fitness  or 
 work  fantastic  but  you  need  to  keep 
 sacrificing  so  you  know  at  first  for
[52:02] example  for  a  beginner  to  make  progress 
 in  the  gym  he's  feeling  really 
 disciplined  yeah  he's  gonna  go  to  the 
 gym  you  know  I  don't  feel  like  going  to
[52:07] the  gym  but  [ __ ]  it  I'm  gonna  go  anyway 
 the  sacrifice  you  need  to  make  is  like 
 two  hours  per  week  three  hours  per  week
[52:12] for  the  workout  and  he's  gonna  make  some 
 gains  but  a  year  from  then  his  gains 
 slow  down  and  now  he's  gonna  need  to 
 sacrifice  for  five  hours  per  week  and
[52:19] now  he's  gonna  actually  need  to  really 
 change  up  some  of  his  meals  if  he  still 
 wants  to  continue  making  progress  now 
 two  years  from  then  five  years  from  then
[52:25] he  needs  to  sacrifice  so  much  more  he 
 needs  to  sacrifice  late  nights  alcohol 
 shitty  food  he  needs  to  be  on  an
[52:31] optimized  workout  routine  the  sacrifices 
 that  you  make  to  progress  to  your  goals 
 must  be  progressively  overloaded  over
[52:37] time  if  you  haven't  recently  Lee  added 
 more  sacrifice  to  your  life  in  the  last 
 month  I  guarantee  your  complacent  and  so
[52:43] I  have  another  journaling  prompt  for  you 
 to  do  right  now  as  another  actionable 
 step  of  this  full  guide  answer  this
[52:48] question  right  now  what  is  another 
 sacrifice  that  I  can  make  to  make  even 
 more  progress  to  my  goals  upon  thinking
[52:54] about  the  answer  to  this  question 
 there's  something  very  interesting 
 that's  going  to  happen  to  you  and  this 
 is  going  to  be  so  like  literally  10  out
[53:00] of  10  interesting  for  you  to  follow 
 along  to  right  now  be  extremely  aware  of 
 your  mind  trying  to  [ __ ]  you  there
[53:06] will  be  a  potential  sacrifice  that  you 
 could  make  to  be  more  disciplined  to 
 make  more  progress  in  your  goals  which
[53:11] will  then  make  you  more  masculine  and 
 your  brain  will  not  want  to  acknowledge 
 it  because  you're  asking  your  brain  to
[53:16] come  up  with  ideas  to  sacrifice  comfort 
 your  brain  will  not  want  to  acknowledge 
 it  but  you're  just  about  if  you  really
[53:21] pay  attention  and  you  stay  authentic  and 
 honest  you'll  just  about  know  what  it  is 
 you'll  just  about  think  of  a  sacrifice
[53:27] that  you  could  make  and  the  Jeffrey  part 
 of  your  brain  will  want  to  push  it  away 
 stay  so  aware  of  this  right  now  you  know
[53:32] what  I'm  gonna  do  in  front  of  you  right 
 now  what  is  another  sacrifice  that  I 
 could  make  to  make  even  more  progress  to
[53:37] my  goals  the  goal  goals  that  I'm  talking 
 about  I'll  make  it  based  on  on  YouTube 
 specifically  like  work  what  is  another
[53:43] sacrifice  that  I  can  make 
 I  need  to  record  more  I  don't  record
[53:48] that  often  and  that's  actually  slowing 
 down  the  growth  of  like  our  output  and 
 the  growth  of  the  channel  and  the  video
[53:53] editor  who's  editing  this  video  right 
 now  will  even  tell  you  he's  been  waiting 
 like  a  day  two  days  for  me  to  send  him
[53:58] over  this  clip  I  don't  prioritize 
 recording  because  honestly  it's  just 
 it's  so  much  friction  it's  so  stressful 
 having  to  sit  here  it's  exhausting  to
[54:04] sit  here  and  talk  for  like  an  hour  and 
 to  think  of  things  to  say  you  know  of 
 course  I've  got  like  bullet  points  here
[54:09] on  my  laptop  but  it's  it's  the  hardest 
 part  of  my  job  is  literally  recording 
 the  videos  another  sacrifice  that  I  can
[54:14] make  to  level  up  in  my  goals  even  more 
 is  to  just  record  more  I  didn't  even
[54:19] want  to  answer  that  question  honest  I 
 didn't  want  to  like  say  to  you  you  know 
 my  brains  like  [ __ ]  and  it  was  like 
 honorable  you  know
[54:25] um  if  you  record  less  the  quality  might 
 be  higher  if  you  if  you  don't  answer 
 this  question  with  you  know  the  answer
[54:31] of  recording  then  you  can  just  not 
 record  as  often  and  focus  on  other 
 things  the  real  answer  to  this  question
[54:36] was  me  telling  you  yeah  what's  a 
 sacrifice  I  can  make  I  can  just  shut  the 
 [ __ ]  up  and  record  more  often  the 
 Forefront  of  my  mind  the  answer  that  my
[54:43] Jeffrey  brain  wanted  me  to  answer  with 
 interestingly  it  was  like  oh  yeah  do 
 more  podcast  us  and  do  more  like  easy 
 work  spend  more  time  doing  that  kind  of
[54:49] like  laptop  kind  of  work  but  the  real 
 sacrifice  would  be  for  me  to  do 
 something  that  I  don't  actually  want  to
[54:54] do  which  there's  more  friction  to  which 
 requires  more  discipline  which  is 
 recording  it's  the  harder  thing  to  do
[54:59] what  is  your  answer  to  this  question 
 okay  so  so  far  of  this  full  guide  you've 
 learned  a  lot  about  masculine  traits  how
[55:05] to  become  more  masculine  you've  learned 
 about  polarization  you've  heard  my  story 
 we've  even  talked  about  discipline  and
[55:10] goal  setting  now  for  the  rest  of  this 
 full  guide  I  want  to  just  fire  off  a 
 bunch  of  random  things  that  I  think  will
[55:15] help  you  in  your  journey  to  become  more 
 masculine  and  these  are  going  to  be 
 really  interesting  and  really  practical 
 and  the  first  part  of  this  section  which
[55:20] I  think  is  very  very  valuable  is  semen 
 retention  I  thought  for  a  long  time  I
[55:26] thought  things  like  nofap  and  human 
 retention  were  kind  of  overrated  because 
 I've  been  on  nofap  since  age  18  and  you
[55:32] know  it  did  change  my  life  quite 
 practically  because  I  just  wasn't 
 spending  hours  watching  porn  you  know  I
[55:37] used  to  be  like  a  normal  15  year  old 
 like  masturbating  three  times  a  day  and 
 it's  been  a  while  since  I've  been  a
[55:42] wanker  so  I  can't  really  relate  anymore 
 so  nofap  is  okay  just  no  masturbation  no
[55:47] porn  right  but  then  I've  always  done 
 nofap  but  while  still  having  sex  semen
[55:52] retention  is  the  next  level  where  of 
 course  you're  on  nofap  but  you  also 
 either  don't  have  sex  or  if  you  do  have
[55:57] sex  this  is  the  hardest  thing  right  the 
 hardest  thing  is  having  sex  but  then  not
[56:02] busting  I  don't  want  to  make  this  like 
 too  graphically  detailed  and  you  know  to 
 get  demonetized  on  YouTube  or  anything  I
[56:08] am  gonna  release  a  sex  course  sometime 
 in  the  future  which  I  think  you  might 
 find  very  interesting  where  I'm  gonna
[56:13] speak  totally  unfiltered  and  like  in 
 Practical  details  of  how  I've  been  able 
 to  like  use  self-improvements  and  you
[56:18] know  improve  my  sex  life  and  a  big  part 
 of  that  is  SEMA  retention  and  the  act  of 
 like  having  sex  but  not  coming  and  like
[56:24] being  able  to  last  way  longer  being  able 
 to  have  sex  way  way  more  times  per  day 
 something  that  I've  been  practicing  more
[56:29] recently  and  it's  amazing  how  much  more 
 masculine  energy  I  feel  when  it's  been
[56:34] days  or  a  week  since  I've  ejaculated 
 there  was  an  article  I  read  and  it  was
[56:39] sent  to  me  by  another  YouTuber  his 
 YouTube  name  is  masculine  Theory  his 
 name  is  Joseph  and  he's  very  clued  up
[56:44] and  very  intelligent  about  things  like 
 retention  and  speaks  about  it  a  lot  on 
 his  channel  and  this  article  that  I'll 
 link  in  the  description  said  that  your
[56:50] masculine  seed  is  like  an  extremely 
 valuable  Life  Source  that  you  don't  want
[56:55] to  waste  it  was  quoted  in  this  article 
 I'm  not  sure  if  this  is  really 
 scientifically  you  know  correct  but  it
[57:00] does  make  for  a  really  good  example  that 
 one  drop  of  semen  is  the  equivalent  of
[57:05] 40  drops  of  blood  now  I  want  to  speak  in 
 a  very  practical  terms  about  retention 
 when  I'm  on  retention  even  when  having
[57:11] sex  my  level  of  masculinity  goes  through 
 the  roof  it  seems  very  normal  to  you 
 know  be  on  nofap  and  then  when  you're
[57:16] having  sex  to  just  have  sex  and  you  know 
 like  just  you  know  try  and  Edge  a  little 
 bit  they're  trying  to  last  as  long  as
[57:21] you  can  and  then  eventually  like  not 
 yeah  that's  normal  right  what  I've  found 
 is  that  if  you  have  sex  and  you  don't
[57:26] finish  or  just  in  general  if  you're  not 
 having  sex  if  you're  not  busting  any 
 nuts  you're  literally  just  retaining 
 completely  your  ability  to  focus  your
[57:32] ability  to  work  hard  goes  through  the 
 roof  and  I  think  why  this  is  is  because 
 your  brain  kind  of  understands  that  one
[57:38] he's  not  ejaculating  so  he  doesn't  you 
 know  there's  no  woman  that  he's  sleeping 
 with  and  so  two  since  he's  not  doing
[57:43] what's  essentially  a  very  important  part 
 of  of  manhood  we  need  to  pump  him  full
[57:48] of  drive  and  masculinity  and  motivation 
 and  desire  so  that  he  can  improve
[57:53] himself  to  level  up  the  the  social 
 hierarchy  so  that  then  he  can  become 
 eligible  to  mates  what  I  found  is  that
[57:58] after  just  three  to  five  days  of  not 
 busting  any  nuts  my  drive  my  masculinity
[58:03] goes  through  the  [ __ ]  roof  my  work 
 rate  goes  through  the  roof  perhaps 
 you're  watching  this  video  the  full
[58:08] guide  to  masculinity  sometime  in  the 
 future  and  I  already  have  a  full  sex 
 course  released  this  thing  there's  more
[58:14] like  details  that  I  want  to  go  into  but 
 you  don't  know  who's  going  to  be 
 watching  this  video  and  everything  and 
 so  you  can't  say  too  many  details  about
[58:19] like  sexual  stuff  on  YouTube  that's  why 
 I'm  gonna  have  like  a  full  sex  course 
 released  perhaps  I'll  have  a  card  pop-up
[58:24] or  a  link  in  the  description  that  you 
 can  go  and  look  for  right  now  if  you're 
 interested  in  that  let's  now  talk  about
[58:29] achieving  Freedom  which  is  a  masculine 
 man's  biggest  desire  masculine  men 
 desire  Freedom  feminine  women  desire
[58:35] fulfillment  We  crave  freedom  from 
 constraints  even  the  way  that  we  have 
 sex  is  all  about  freeing  ourselves
[58:40] whereas  for  a  woman  it's  all  about  being 
 filled  up  but  even  in  the  rest  of  our 
 lives  you  can  only  feel  totally  happy
[58:46] and  content  if  you  have  a  great  level  of 
 freedom  in  which  you  aren't  placed  on 
 the  constraints  by  someone  like  your
[58:52] boss  or  Society  there's  three  kinds  of 
 Freedom  which  we're  going  to  practically 
 discuss  and  you  need  to  make  progress  to
[58:58] these  three  kinds  and  every  step  that 
 you  take  in  the  right  direction  you  will 
 literally  feel  good  the  three  kinds  of
[59:05] Freedom  are  Financial  Freedom  time 
 freedom  and  location  Freedom  each  one  of
[59:10] these  could  be  a  whole  video  by  itself 
 of  how  to  achieve  Financial  Freedom  how 
 to  beat  location  Independence  and  so  I'm 
 just  going  to  give  you  some  practical  no
[59:16] BS  advice  and  I'm  gonna  try  and  make  it 
 the  kind  of  advice  that  you  might  not 
 have  heard  of  anywhere  else  for 
 Financial  Freedom  the  only  way  that  you
[59:22] can  achieve  this  when  you're  young  is 
 with  some  kind  of  business  you  can't  get 
 financially  free  in  even  the  most  high
[59:27] level  careers  which  take  20  years  to  get 
 to  and  so  it  has  to  be  with  a  business
[59:32] any  20  year  old  millionaire  that  you  do 
 see  or  hear  off  on  YouTube  it's  always 
 through  business  and  then  mediums  are
[59:38] high  risk  Investments  and  so  you  can  go 
 down  the  entire  rabbit  hole  if  you  want 
 to  but  the  two-step  process  to  achieving
[59:43] Financial  Freedom  when  you're  still 
 young  is  one  create  a  success  successful 
 business  and  this  in  itself  can  take
[59:48] years  and  you  need  to  work  extremely 
 hard  you  need  to  sacrifice  there's  an 
 element  of  luck  involved  and  number  two
[59:53] invest  the  income  that  you  make  from 
 that  business  into  things  like  crypto 
 which  are  a  lot  higher  yielding  like
[59:58] they  give  you  more  money  in  return  than 
 things  like  index  funds  and  all  the  soft 
 passive  stuff  one  thing  to  know  about
[60:03] achieving  Financial  Freedom  that  your 
 parents  are  wrong  with  that  any  of  these 
 Financial  gurus  that  write  like
[60:08] Financial  books  they'll  always  tell  you 
 that  saving  and  investing  is  like  the 
 best  route  to  Financial  Freedom  that's
[60:13] the  old  script  anyone  who  tells  you  that 
 saving  money  like  oh  yeah  go  and  get  a 
 really  good  job  and  then  save  as  much 
 money  as  possible  and  then  put  that
[60:19] money  into  the  index  funds  and  they  want 
 to  give  you  that  advice  as  following  the 
 old  script  the  new  script  is  all  about 
 business  time  Freedom  means  that  you
[60:25] have  control  and  power  over  your  own 
 time  and  you  can't  really  say  that  you 
 have  this  if  you  can't  choose  exactly
[60:31] what  time  you  want  to  work  go  to  the  gym 
 or  do  anything  else  with  your  day  the 
 majority  of  people  who  work  nine  to  five
[60:36] or  who  are  still  in  the  education  system 
 don't  have  this  and  this  is  why  you 
 quite  frequently  get  this  like
[60:41] irritation  feeling  when  you  need  to  go 
 to  work  or  you  need  to  go  to  school  when 
 you  don't  really  want  to  to  to  achieve
[60:47] time  Freedom  you  should  read  the  book 
 the  four  hour  work  week  and  also 
 implement  the  principles  from  the  book
[60:52] deep  work  I  have  a  full  guide  explaining 
 the  Deep  workbook  and  I'll  have  like  a 
 card  pop  up  on  screen  or  a  link  in  the
[60:58] description  so  you  can  go  and  find  that 
 and  finally  location  Freedom  means  that 
 you  can  go  anywhere  in  the  world  that
[61:03] you  want  and  still  be  okay  for  location 
 Freedom  it's  all  about  making  online 
 income  and  there's  a  famous  young
[61:08] entrepreneur  named  Iman  gazi  and  he  held 
 this  like  YouTube  event  where  he  taught 
 people  how  to  achieve  location  Freedom
[61:14] through  making  online  businesses  if  you 
 can  cultivate  all  three  freedoms  into 
 your  life  you  get  to  live  like  the  top
[61:21] one  percent  I've  just  mentioned  Eman 
 that  online  entrepreneur  that  we  spoke 
 about  he  has  a  free  event  coming  up
[61:26] where  he's  going  to  teach  people 
 together  three  freedoms  and  I'm  gonna 
 appear  as  a  guest  speaker  I'm  gonna  like 
 teach  my  own  section  in  this  to  learn
[61:32] more  scroll  down  to  the  description  of 
 this  video  and  click  on  the  Iman  Gotti 
 link  and  you'll  be  able  to  sign  up  in
[61:37] advance  and  you'll  learn  so  much  more 
 about  Financial  Freedom  time  freedom  and 
 location  Freedom  men  need  tribes
[61:43] especially  masculine  men  and  I'm  gonna 
 go  into  another  Ransom  kill  your  seat 
 belts  bro  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a
[61:48] conspiracy  theory  or  not  but  male  spaces 
 are  being  abolished  male  locker  room 
 talk  is  demonized  and  any  space  that  men
[61:54] gather  is  now  seen  as  like  potentially 
 dangerous  or  hostile  or  full  of  incels 
 you  single  a  man  away  from  his  tribe  he
[62:01] loses  most  of  his  strength  what's  very 
 interesting  is  that  you've  lived  your 
 life  as  kind  of  like  an  individual  man
[62:06] you've  probably  never  had  like  a  full-on 
 real  kind  of  tribe  that  your  ancestors 
 would  have  had  and  so  any  level  of
[62:12] success  and  strength  that  you  feel  like 
 you  have  think  about  this  you've 
 literally  not  even  experienced  the  life
[62:17] that  like  your  ancestors  would  have 
 imagine  your  ancestors  like  the  tribes 
 men  would  have  lived  in  tribes  of  150
[62:22] and  there's  like  20  30  men  of  like 
 Warrior  Hunter  age  all  keeping  each
[62:27] other  accountable  you  can't  be  a  little 
 [ __ ]  you  can't  skip  out  on  the  hunt 
 today  because  you'll  get  called  out  so 
 that  now  come  with  us  the  village  Elders
[62:33] the  male  Elders  would  have  put  you 
 through  a  rite  of  passage  that  would 
 have  turned  you  officially  into  a  man
[62:38] you  don't  even  grasp  how  important  this 
 is  for  male  life  because  we've  never
[62:43] experienced  it  before  [ __ ]  man  I  hope 
 you  can  take  a  few  seconds  to  just  kind 
 of  think  about  how  much  we're  missing
[62:48] out  on  because  we  don't  have  like  a  real 
 real  tribe  of  men  around  us  we're  just
[62:53] also  individual  and  you're  being 
 convinced  that  like  oh  yeah  be  friends 
 with  girls  men  can  be
[62:59] that's  sad  man  and  I  think  you  know  one 
 of  the  reasons  why  my  channel  has  become 
 so  successful  is  because  this  has  been
[63:05] and  is  and  will  always  be  a  space  for 
 men  you  know  how  easy  it  would  have  been 
 for  me  to  sell  out  and  start  like
[63:11] becoming  more  modern  and  accepting  of 
 women  and  like  oh  you  know  I  like  oh  I 
 don't  know  you  know  like  to  be  more
[63:16] androgynous  and  to  start  making  more 
 videos  for  women  because  they  need 
 self-improvement  too  and  all  this  [ __ ] 
 you  know  I  could  have  done  that  and
[63:21] maybe  increased  our  audience  count  by  50 
 but  I  won't  this  is  a  space  for  men
[63:26] because  we  desperately  need  it  because 
 male  spaces  are  being  taken  away  from  us 
 what  you  see  on  this  channel  in  the
[63:32] comments  below  and  especially  in  our 
 Discord  server  is  a  space  for  men  where
[63:37] you  can  cultivate  a  tribe  of  your  own  I 
 have  my  Discord  server  Linked  In  the 
 description  I  think  there's  like  60  70
[63:42] 000  young  men  who  are  in  that  server 
 we've  seen  so  many  pictures  you  know 
 people  will  literally  meet  up  other
[63:47] people  in  the  Discord  server  of  my 
 Discord  server  they'll  meet  each  other 
 you  know  oh  like  I'm  in  I'm  in
[63:52] Netherlands  it's  all  someone  else  is  in 
 Netherlands  oh  bro  let's  go  do  a  gym 
 workout  and  we've  seen  so  many  pictures
[63:57] of  people  like  yo  like  we  literally  met 
 from  this  so  over  there's  now  another 
 website  that  a  mod  and  like  his  group
[64:03] have  made  from  my  server  which  makes  it 
 very  easy  for  you  to  actually  find 
 people  in  your  country  so  that  you  can
[64:08] organize  meetups  I'll  have  that  Linked 
 In  the  description  of  this  video  but 
 there's  no  like  money  to  be  made  or 
 anything  like  this  you  literally  just
[64:13] click  on  the  link  and  it  finds  out  what 
 country  you're  in  and  then  it  invites 
 you  to  join  a  Discord  server  that's
[64:18] based  on  your  country  and  also  like 
 self-improvement  mixed  together  so 
 you'll  literally  find  like  a  like-minded 
 guys  who  want  to  become  more  masculine
[64:24] more  successful  more  disciplined  all 
 congregating  in  this  one  Discord  server 
 where  you  can  then  utilize  that  to  meet
[64:30] people  online  and  this  is  all  totally 
 for  free  I'll  have  all  this  stuff  Linked 
 In  the  description  below  under  like  make 
 friends  on  self-improvements  because
[64:35] this  is  so  important  I  would  not  be  half 
 the  man  that  I  am  today  if  I  did  not
[64:40] have  other  men  in  my  life  and  it  saddens 
 me  to  see  young  men  who  don't  have  that 
 perhaps  you're  new  to  this  Channel  and
[64:46] discovering  me  but  these  videos  that  I 
 produce  here  and  like  me  teaching  you 
 what  I  know  and  I've  learned  myself  it
[64:52] could  potentially  change  your  life  what 
 you  see  on  this  YouTube  channel  is  kind 
 of  like  a  movement  of  younger  men  who
[64:57] are  all  trying  to  improve  ourselves  and 
 this  can  be  a  part  of  your  tribe  you  and 
 I  let's  be  honest  we're  not  technically
[65:02] friends  you  know  a  lot  of  YouTubers  will 
 try  and  manipulate  you  and  say  like  oh 
 yeah  we're  friends  hey  hey  friends  like 
 you  know  they'll  try  and  do  that  [ __ ]
[65:07] I'll  never  look  at  you  like  through  the 
 camera  like  oh  me  and  you  are  best 
 friends  or  something  but  the  truth  is 
 you  know  that  quote  like  you  are  the
[65:13] average  of  The  Five  People  You  spend 
 time  with  which  is  very  very  true  well 
 it's  more  accurate  now  to  say  that  you 
 are  the  average  of  the  five  people  whose
[65:20] content  you  consume  if  you  consume  my 
 content  you'll  become  more  like  me  it 
 sounds  cringe  as  [ __ ]  but  for  that
[65:25] reason  make  sure  like  you  subscribe  to 
 this  Channel  and  click  on  the  post 
 notifications  and  click  the  like  button
[65:30] and  you  know  support  the  videos  and 
 stuff  and  like  you  know  be  active  in 
 this  community  because  the  amount  of 
 guys  who  have  told  me  that  this  stuff
[65:35] has  changed  their  life  is  amazing  we've 
 just  spoke  about  cultivating  a  tribe  of
[65:40] masculine  men  that  you  can  grow 
 alongside  but  there  is  a  part  of  having 
 other  men  in  your  life  that  you  probably
[65:46] aren't  really  just  capable  of  right  now 
 and  that  is  to  enjoy  your  friend's
[65:51] criticism  masculine  men  criticize  each 
 other  this  is  so  interesting  you're 
 gonna  find  this  interesting  as  [ __ ]
[65:56] masculine  men  criticize  each  other  to 
 each  other's  pieces  if  me  and  my  friend 
 Sam  are  here  and  I  spot  some  kind  of
[66:02] weakness  in  him  I'll  look  at  him  and 
 tell  him  imagine  why  we  do  that  it's 
 kind  of  like  okay  well  he's  in  my  tribe
[66:07] I  can  see  this  weakness  I'm  gonna  tell 
 him  and  hopefully  he  can  take  it  well  so 
 that  he  can  improve  on  that  weakness  so 
 that  the  tribe  strengthens  and  my  chance
[66:13] of  survival  increases  you  know  what's 
 really  interesting  feminine  women  don't 
 do  this  they  criticize  but  not  to  each
[66:18] other's  faces  because  for  them  their 
 survival  mechanism  is  not  based  on  this 
 other  woman  being  healthy  and  you  know
[66:25] improving  her  weaknesses  if  anything  a 
 feminine  woman's  survival  comes  from 
 other  women  not  doing  so  well  it's  a
[66:31] very  interesting  Dynamic  and  of  course 
 you  know  people  say  oh  this  is  sexist 
 girls  don't  gossip  and  you  know  whatever 
 but  generally  you've  always  heard  that
[66:36] kind  of  stereotype  maybe  you've  seen  it 
 in  your  own  life  with  the  women  in  your 
 family  or  your  friends  and  the  male 
 friends  there's  a  chance  that  some  of
[66:41] your  male  friends  that  you  thought  were 
 like  bullies  or  some  of  your  male  family 
 members  perhaps  your  father  have
[66:46] criticized  you  to  your  face  and  said 
 like  no  no  you  don't  look  good  in  that 
 why  so  weak  why  are  you  such  a  pushover 
 why  you  so  lazy  you  know  they've  said
[66:52] this  to  you  and  all  this  time  because 
 we've  been  raised  in  this  like  little 
 [ __ ]  feminine  way  we've  been  thinking 
 like  oh  well  that's  so  offensive  and  for
[66:58] me  personally  holy  [ __ ]  bro  oh  my  dad 
 has  done  this  since  I  was  a  child  and  I 
 always  hated  him  for  it  where  he  would
[67:03] point  out  my  weaknesses  he  would 
 criticize  my  weaknesses  and  I  thought 
 that  was  a  bad  trait  in  him  I  was  so
[67:08] certain  it  was  a  bad  trait  well  I  think 
 about  it  it  seems  weird  that  I'm  kind  of 
 insinuating  that  it's  not  about  trait  it
[67:13] might  even  be  in  your  mind  right  now  no 
 it  is  a  back  trade  it  is  like  why  would 
 someone  criticize  that's  not  nice  we
[67:18] have  such  a  deep  rooted  feminine 
 upbringing  that  we  don't  even  understand 
 a  core  component  of  masculinity  is
[67:24] criticizing  and  highlighting  the 
 weaknesses  of  the  men  in  your  tribe 
 because  since  school  you've  been  raised
[67:29] to  like  be  nice  and  not  say  anything 
 like  negative  towards  the  other  person 
 because  if  you  do  call  out  someone  else
[67:34] for  their  weakness  in  this  modern  day 
 it's  extremely  offensive  and  they'll 
 start  crying  and  they'll  be  you  know 
 you'll  offend  them  and  they'll  hurt
[67:39] their  feelings  and  so  if  you  hurt 
 someone's  feelings  in  this  modern  day 
 then  you're  wrong  right  if  you  start  to 
 make  friends  with  more  masculine  men
[67:45] understand  and  be  ready  for  this  concept 
 that  they  will  begin  to  criticize  you
[67:50] like  the  real  men  who  actually  really 
 really  love  you  and  who  are  masculine 
 will  criticize  you  they'll  just  bring  up
[67:55] something  like  oh  bro  that  doesn't  look 
 so  good  on  you  or  like  Yay  push  harder 
 like  why  are  you  doing  that  thing 
 they'll  bring  help  stuff  like  this  and
[68:00] you  really  want  to  cultivate  a 
 Brotherhood  of  men  a  couple  of  guys  who
[68:05] can  speak  to  you  so  openly  they'll  just 
 look  you  in  the  eyes  and  tell  you  here's 
 something  that's  wrong  with  you  with  the
[68:10] attempt  to  help  you  to  improve  it  and  so 
 when  you  do  experience  some  kind  of 
 masculine  criticism  from  like  a  man  in
[68:15] your  tribe  don't  be  offended  don't  get 
 emotional  get  to  work  now  if  you  want  to 
 level  this  up  you  will  get  my  respect
[68:20] for  this  because  this  is  difficult 
 actively  seek  out  that  criticism  go 
 where  you  can  get  criticized  start  a
[68:27] YouTube  channel  and  talk  about  your 
 self-improvement  journey  like  I've  done 
 bro  you  don't  even  realize  the  amount  of 
 criticism  that  I've  received  over  the
[68:33] last  two  years  it's  [ __ ]  incredible 
 imagine  the  audience  size  that  I  have 
 brought  I'm  one  man  look  how  many  people
[68:39] watch  my  videos  of  course  like  you  know 
 my  team  of  help  but  in  terms  of  like 
 just  you  know  be  getting  criticism  it's 
 me  on  the  camera  right  imagine  how  many
[68:45] negative  comments  I've  had  and  not  just 
 from  trolls  who  are  just  swearing  or 
 something  but  from  like  intelligent
[68:50] people  who  have  pointed  out  a  weakness 
 and  means  I  know  Hamza  you've  done 
 something  wrong  here  and  of  course  it 
 hurts  of  course  I  feel  bad  about  it  but
[68:55] I've  tried  my  absolute  best  to  hear  that 
 criticism  and  to  take  it  on  board  and 
 you  can  see  if  you've  been  a  fan  of  mine
[69:01] for  a  long  time  you  can  see  the  times 
 where  I've  like  I've  received  quite  a 
 lot  of  criticism  for  something  and  I've
[69:06] corrected  course  each  and  every  time  to 
 the  point  that  my  journey  is  extremely 
 extremely  special  the  amount  of
[69:12] development  that  I've  been  through  and 
 this  could  be  the  same  for  you  if  you 
 put  yourself  in  an  area  where  you  can 
 get  criticized  you  will  grow  so  much
[69:18] snigo  said  this  to  me  on  a  live  stream 
 that  live  streaming  for  him  was  a  place 
 that  he  was  getting  so  much  criticism
[69:23] but  that  after  a  little  while  it  kind  of 
 mentally  fortituded  him  it  makes  you 
 strong  by  pointing  out  your  weaknesses
[69:29] we  as  modern  young  men  we  don't  really 
 have  this  in  our  lives  I  didn't  for  so 
 long  I  would  we  stay  like  sheltered  and
[69:36] safe  safe  from  criticism  safe  from  being 
 offended  that  just  leaves  you  blind  you 
 need  the  kind  of  men  who  confidently  but
[69:43] in  more  of  a  loving  way  will  call  you 
 out  on  your  [ __ ]  now  and  only  now
[69:48] after  we've  covered  every  other  part  of 
 masculinity  and  friendship  and 
 self-improvement  do  I  want  to  speak
[69:53] about  being  masculine  in  a  relationship 
 because  it's  in  my  belief  that  you 
 should  probably  wait  to  get  into  like  a
[69:58] real  serious  relationship  up  until 
 you're  truly  ready  and  I  think  you'll 
 only  really  be  ready  when  you've  already
[70:03] cultivated  a  bunch  of  male  friends 
 you've  worked  on  your  purpose  your  goals 
 your  self-improvements  there  are  two
[70:08] dynamics  that  you  could  have  in  a 
 relationship  with  a  woman  the  first 
 Dynamic  is  the  incorrect  Dynamic  and  it
[70:14] might  be  the  one  that  you've  already  had 
 previously  this  is  the  mother  son 
 Dynamic  where  she  acts  and  thinks  and
[70:20] behaves  like  the  mother  and  you  act  and 
 think  and  behave  like  the  sun  the  second 
 Dynamic  that  you  can  have  in  a
[70:25] relationship  is  in  my  opinion  the  right 
 one  and  that  is  the  father-daughter 
 dynamic  that's  where  you  act  think  and
[70:30] behave  like  the  father  and  she  acts 
 thinks  and  behaves  like  the  daughter  the 
 overwhelming  majority  of  couples  that  I
[70:37] see  have  the  wrong  Dynamic  she's  more  of 
 the  Mummy  he's  more  of  the  sun  she  walks 
 in  through  the  door  and  she  goes  to  the
[70:42] waiter  and  she  orders  the  meal  and  then 
 he  kind  of  stands  behind  her  like  really 
 really  like  you  know  just  like  a  little
[70:47] chump  and  it's  almost  like  she  she  kind 
 of  tells  us  like  come  on  come  on  Timmy 
 or  order  your  lunch  Timmy  don't  worry
[70:52] I'll  pay  once  you  keep  these  two 
 Dynamics  in  mind  it  is  so  much  easier  to
[70:57] navigate  the  right  kind  of  Sexual  Energy 
 Mass  clean  feminine  polarized 
 relationship  than  just  how  the  majority
[71:02] of  people  do  where  they  just  kind  of 
 like  get  into  a  relationship  without 
 thinking  about  these  things  think  back 
 to  the  relationships  that  you've  had  or
[71:07] the  girls  that  you've  had  a  crush  on  has 
 it  been  the  father-daughter  dynamic 
 where  you  kind  of  act  like  more  like  the
[71:12] Father  the  leader  the  strong  person  and 
 she's  the  daughter  who  you're  kind  of 
 bringing  and  showing  to  the  world  that
[71:17] you  take  care  of  her  you  are  responsible 
 for  her  or  is  it  the  other  way  around  is 
 it  that  she's  kind  of  looking  after  you
[71:22] and  she  plans  things  and  she  tells  you 
 what  to  do  and  you're  just  a  good  little 
 boy  who  you  know  gets  loud  every  now  and
[71:27] then  and  pretends  he's  in  charge  but 
 really  it's  her  be  totally  honest 
 because  it  is  uncomfortable  as  [ __ ]  to 
 admit  this  and  I  don't  think  the
[71:32] majority  of  men  could  admit  this  but  you 
 know  what  I've  had  the  wrong  dynamic  in 
 multiple  relationships  I've  had  the
[71:37] mother-son  dynamic  in  multiple 
 relationships  and  [ __ ]  me  is  it  wrong
[71:42] bro  holy  so  how  does  the  father  behave 
 well  he's  the  leader  he  makes  the
[71:47] decisions  and  the  choices  that  doesn't 
 mean  that  he'll  never  ask  his  girl  what 
 she  wants  to  do  he'll  he'll  ask  for  her
[71:52] inputs  but  in  the  end  it's  gonna  be  him 
 that  makes  the  decision  the  father 
 provides  you  should  have  this  it's  kind
[71:57] of  cringe  but  you  should  have  just  like 
 Daddy  the  energy  you  should  have  this 
 father  kind  of  energy  where  you're  the
[72:02] leader  you're  the  one  who's  taking 
 charge  you  don't  say  to  her  like  oh 
 Mommy  what  do  you  want  to  eat  or
[72:07] whatever  you  want  you  just  say  come  on 
 get  ready  we're  going  to  this  place  a 
 lot  of  women  who  are  watching  this  right 
 now  may  say  that  what  I'm  saying  is  like
[72:13] weird  and  they'll  be  like  oh  no  I  don't 
 want  like  a  father  a  daughter  thing  but 
 the  overwhelming  majority  of  women  would
[72:18] prefer  to  be  led  in  a  relationship  and 
 the  women  who  don't  want  to  be  led  who 
 want  to  lead  chances  are  you  probably
[72:24] don't  want  to  date  them  anyway  whenever 
 you  find  yourself  getting  closer  and 
 closer  to  a  girl  just  ask  yourself  that 
 question  is  this  the  father-daughter
[72:30] dynamic  I  don't  think  I  need  to  explain 
 it  much  more  than  that  for  some  reason 
 just  those  two  words  father  daughter
[72:35] just  instantly  it's  like  we  all  know 
 what  that  kind  of  would  look  like  in  a 
 male  female  relationship  it's  got  that
[72:41] kind  of  polarized  relationship  where 
 she's  thinking  about  you  all  the  time 
 and  you're  the  most  important  person  in
[72:46] her  life  you  know  that's  the  kind  of 
 dynamic  that  it  always  has  for  all  of 
 humanity  up  until  the  last  50  years  if
[72:51] you  want  that  kind  of  relationship 
 there's  some  other  things  you're  gonna 
 have  to  do  which  a  lot  of  guys  now  when
[72:57] there's  more  requirements  of  you  we'll 
 disagree  with  this  video  you're  gonna 
 have  to  provide  and  you've  always  heard
[73:02] that  mild  masculinity  is  about  providing 
 you  always  heard  that  but  you  want  to 
 know  the  real  practical  explanation  of
[73:07] providing  it  means  that  you  work  so  hard 
 and  you  become  so  successful  and  Wealthy 
 that  she  doesn't  need  to  work  that  you
[73:12] pay  for  everything  I'm  not  talking  50 
 50.  I'm  talking  you  pay  for  everything 
 she  doesn't  make  her  own  money  this  is
[73:19] where  all  the  little  fakers  who've  been 
 maybe  watching  this  far  of  the  video 
 thinking  oh  yeah  masculinity  sounds
[73:24] amazing  this  is  the  sacrifice  that  you 
 have  to  make  and  so  many  guys  will  now 
 say  oh  well  that's  the  other  that's
[73:29] disgusting  that's  something  this  is  how 
 relationships  have  always  been  and  for 
 the  modern  man  with  his  low  testosterone
[73:35] in  his  [ __ ]  weak  limp  handshake  to 
 say  that  this  is  simping  if  you  imagine 
 like  a  hundred  years  ago  of  a  man
[73:40] wearing  like  a  suit  and  a  top  hat  taking 
 his  lady  out  for  dinner  do  you  think 
 he's  simping  when  he  pays  for  her  now
[73:45] you  may  say  oh  well  actually  you  know  he 
 had  to  back  then  because  she  couldn't 
 work  because  you  know  girls  weren't
[73:50] getting  jobs  but  like  now  they  can  work 
 okay  fine  but  if  you  wanted  to  date  like 
 a  modern  masculine  woman  you  wouldn't  be
[73:55] watching  this  video  if  you  want  to  be 
 more  masculine  you  want  to  date  a  truly 
 feminine  woman  well  then  you  don't  want 
 to  go  out  and  working  for  someone  else
[74:01] I'm  going  to  say  something  right  now 
 that  you  may  have  never  heard  of  before 
 a  woman  is  always  submitting  to  a  man
[74:07] she  is  always  submitting  to  a  man  and 
 guess  what  this  great  movement  of 
 feminism  has  done  that  even  some  a  lot
[74:12] of  guys  are  now  backing  you  know  saying 
 like  oh  well  she  makes  her  own  money  so 
 I'm  not  going  to  pay  for  everything 
 she's  always  submitting  to  a  man  it  used
[74:18] to  be  that  your  woman  would  submit  to 
 you  100  now  guess  what  for  the  majority 
 of  women  in  these  little  weak  men  who
[74:23] who  say  that  they  won't  pay  for  their 
 woman  well  now  she's  submitting  to  her 
 boss  so  I  know  that  this  seems
[74:28] incredibly  ambitious  for  me  to  say  like 
 you  should  pay  for  everything  and  she 
 should  pay  for  nothing  and  this  is  going
[74:33] to  be  so  controversial  and  this  is  not 
 an  easy  goal  to  like  you  know  achieve 
 for  yourself  Perhaps  it  is  a  goal  that
[74:38] you  should  set  like  a  big  ideal  for  you 
 to  reach  to  so  think  you  know  what  the 
 best  case  scenario  is  that  I  am  so
[74:44] successful  that  I  don't  need  her  to  work 
 that  I  don't  need  her  to  bring  her  own 
 money  because  if  she  does  if  she  does
[74:49] work  if  she  does  bring  her  own  money  for 
 eight  hours  of  the  day  she's  submitting 
 to  a  different  male  unacceptable  you've
[74:54] watched  this  far  of  this  video  of 
 wanting  to  become  more  masculine  you're 
 on  self-improvement  you're  working  hard 
 set  your  goal  high  and  think  [ __ ]  it
[75:00] yeah  I  want  to  be  so  successful  and  so 
 wealthy  that  like  paying  for  her  for 
 dinner  or  for  lunch  or  something  an
[75:06] extra  20  a  day  or  something  I  want  to  be 
 able  to  afford  that  this  is  like  the 
 secret  sauce  to  a  polarized  relationship
[75:11] perhaps  you've  never  really  experienced 
 real  feminine  energy  in  women  before  you
[75:16] know  you're  like  the  women  I've 
 described  and  you  don't  really  relate  to 
 the  girls  that  you've  had  in  your  life 
 are  always  really  focused  on  their
[75:21] studies  and  their  work  and  stuff  and 
 like  you  know  but  at  least  they  pay  for 
 half  the  bill  perhaps  you've  only  ever 
 had  them  because  you  just  aren't  the
[75:26] level  of  man  just  yet  where  you  can  pay 
 for  everything  bro  you  will  experience 
 the  true  feminine  energy  inside  of  women
[75:31] when  they  just  know  that  you  could 
 essentially  retire  them  that  they  don't 
 need  to  work  think  about  it  a  woman  only
[75:36] gets  into  a  masculine  energy  out  of 
 necessity  because  it  is  unnatural  for 
 her  to  be  masculine  so  she  becomes
[75:41] masculine  because  she  needs  to  go  out 
 into  the  workforce  but  if  she  kind  of 
 sees  like  oh  [ __ ]  you  are  so  productive
[75:46] you  are  so  successful  you  are  so  wealthy 
 she  can  start  to  cultivate  way  more  of  a 
 feminine  energy  and  give  up  the
[75:51] masculine  energy  that  she's  had  to 
 develop  through  the  modern  conditioning 
 with  my  woman  I  see  such  beautiful
[75:57] feminine  energy  inside  of  her  because 
 she  no  longer  longer  needs  to  be 
 masculine  and  that's  really  what  I  hope 
 for  you  and  I  know  this  part  of  the
[76:02] video  is  going  to  piss  off  so  many  guys 
 because  I'm  literally  saying  yeah  become 
 successful  become  so  rich  that  you  don't
[76:08] need  to  like  get  your  girl  to  make  money 
 alongside  you  you  know  it  is  hard  of 
 course  it  is  it's  not  easy  you  have  to
[76:13] dedicate  your  life  to  this  [ __ ]  you  have 
 to  wake  up  thinking  about  like  work  and 
 productivity  of  course  but  this  is  the
[76:18] better  life  overall  let's  conclude  this 
 full  guide  to  masculinity  you've  been 
 with  me  now  this  video  is  probably  what
[76:23] an  hour  and  a  half  one  hour  and  57 
 minutes  am  I  closer  you've  learned  that
[76:28] masculine  energy  is  all  about  leadership 
 and  dominance  and  providing  and  you've 
 just  now  learned  that  there  are
[76:33] sacrifices  that  you  have  to  make  to 
 become  more  masculine  if  you  want  these 
 rewards  of  life  if  you  want  to  attract 
 more  feminine  women  then  you  need  to
[76:39] work  harder  than  everyone  else  around 
 you  you  now  have  a  great  understanding 
 of  masculine  and  feminine  energy  and
[76:44] you've  learned  so  many  random  things 
 like  the  need  to  cultivate  a  tribe  and 
 to  enjoy  your  friend's  criticism  and  the
[76:50] three  kinds  of  Freedom  that  you  can 
 achieve  that  will  make  you  feel  so  much 
 better  as  a  man  this  journey  that  you're 
 on  is  one  of  the  most  important  of  your
[76:56] entire  life  it  is  the  Journey  of 
 becoming  a  man  it's  so  sad  but  in  the 
 modern  day  we  don't  have  rights  of 
 passages  anymore  that's  been  taken  away
[77:02] from  us  we  should  have  went  through  some 
 kind  of  process  to  be  acknowledged  as 
 men  to  the  world  and  now  that's  just
[77:07] based  on  like  turning  age  18  and  you're 
 technically  a  man  but  we  know  we're  not
