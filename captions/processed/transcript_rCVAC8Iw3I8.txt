[00:00] Jeffrey  thinks  he's  a  nice  guy  but  why 
 aren't  girls  interested  in  him 
 he's  so  nice  to  them  he  manipulatively
[00:06] compliments  them  all  the  time  Jeffrey  is 
 a  nice  guy  he's  not  nice  but  he's  a  nice
[00:11] guy  that's  a  term  used  for  weak  men  like 
 Jeffrey  who  think  that  being  nice  to  a 
 girl  will  get  him  into  her  pants  tough
[00:17] luck  Jeffrey  it  takes  more  than  that 
 Adonis
[00:22] Adonis  is  a  nice  guy  but  not  with  those 
 quotes  he  is  a  man  who  is  nice  who  is
[00:27] kind  who  is  generous  he's  the  tribe 
 leader  the  most  successful  one  of  all 
 but  along  with  being  nice  adonis's
[00:34] dominant  masculine  and  attractive  that's 
 why  women  are  interested  in  him  I  took 
 my  brother's  advice  once  with  dating  and
[00:40] texting  a  girl  there  was  a  girl  that  I 
 had  a  crush  on  for  like  months  and 
 months  and  months  and  I've  been  on  a
[00:45] couple  of  dates  with  her  I  never  even 
 had  kissed  there  bro  three  four  five 
 dates  I  took  her  to  like  a  nearby  cafe 
 and  we  got  like  some  frozen  drink  and
[00:51] just  kind  of  talk  and  everything  and  I 
 had  like  a  major  crush  on  it  even  though 
 I  hadn't  even  kissed  her  once  and  then  I
[00:56] didn't  speak  to  her  for  a  while  you  know 
 she  started  sort  of  like  ignoring  my 
 requests  to  like  meet  up  for  dates  and 
 stuff  months  go  by  I'm  still  kind  of
[01:01] thinking  about  her  but  also  gonna  try  to 
 move  on  thinking  about  other  girls  and 
 I'm  invited  to  this  party  at  the
[01:06] University  that  I'm  going  to  and  my 
 brother  gives  me  the  idea  that  I  should 
 invite  her  now  bear  in  mind  that  we
[01:11] hadn't  spoke  for  like  two  three  four 
 months  with  my  brother's  advice  this 
 shitty  ass  advice  he  tells  me  what  to
[01:16] text  her  and  I  text  her  the  most  like 
 Fruity  blue  pill  [ __ ]  like  hey  like  you
[01:21] know  there's  a  party  tonight  and  I  only 
 want  to  go  with  you  so  if  you  really 
 like  to  come  with  me  it'd  be  such  a  good 
 time  and  yeah  so  I  sounded  like  this
[01:27] like  cute  ass  little  paragraph  bro  like 
 oh  you  should  come  at  this  point  and  she 
 literally  replies  this  has  got  to  be  a
[01:34] joke  that  [ __ ]  hurt  but  even  then  me 
 and  my  brother  I  think  okay  what  more 
 can  we  text  her  and  I  text  her  more  like
[01:39] my  [ __ ]  like  you  know  you  you've  always 
 been  in  my  mind  and  I  miss  you  like  we 
 used  to  go  on  dates  and  it  was  so  good 
 you're  so  cute  and  everything  and  you're
[01:44] the  only  girl  I'm  interested  in  bro  and 
 she  literally  says  this  is  definitely
[01:49] one  of  your  friends  texting  this  haha  me 
 and  my  brother  look  at  each  other  with 
 this  sense  of  like  yeah  Mission  failed 
 we'll  get  them  next  time  and  I'm  pretty
[01:55] sure  I  ended  up  texting  I'm  like  yeah  my 
 friend  stole  my  phone  huh 
 so  this  is  what  you  do  to  avoid  a
[02:02] situation  like  that  don't  be  an  [ __ ] 
 but  also  don't  be  a  nice  guy  we  don't
[02:07] want  to  be  a  nice  guy  we  don't  want  to 
 be  like  overly  nice  for  no  reason  but 
 also  we  don't  want  to  go  too  extreme  and
[02:12] be  an  [ __ ]  we  want  to  be  somewhere 
 around  the  middle  and  this  is  where 
 Adonis  is  at  Adonis  is  the  ultimate  meal
[02:17] the  kind  of  man  that  we  aspire  to  be  now 
 he  isn't  a  nice  guy  he  isn't  like  one  of 
 those  guys  who  slyly  tries  to  be  like
[02:23] nice  to  try  and  like  you  know  attract  a 
 girl  he  doesn't  overly  nice  but  he  is  a 
 kind  loving  warm  man  now  at  the  same
[02:29] time  of  course  Adonis  is  not  an  [ __ ] 
 but  he  has  some  traits  of  like 
 disagreeableness  if  he  disagrees  with  a
[02:35] girl  he'll  say  it  he  won't  just  agree 
 with  everything  that  she  says  and  we 
 need  to  adopt  this  because  too  many 
 young  guys  like  yourself  Place  girls  on
[02:41] such  a  high  pedestal  that  you  kind  of 
 act  like  she  can't  do  anything  wrong 
 like  you  view  her  so  highly  that  even  if
[02:46] you  kind  of  know  that  she's  maybe  a  bit 
 of  a  loser  that  you  know  she's  not  on 
 self-improvements  that  she  just  spends 
 her  time  watching  TV  scrolling  on  Tick
[02:52] Tock  and  watching  Netflix  eating  junk 
 food  and  we're  like  oh  well  you  know 
 she's  a  princess  I  know  she's  not  broke 
 now  you  shouldn't  be  insulting  towards
[02:58] her  or  disrespectful  because  you  know 
 she's  a  girl  some  guys  are  like  this 
 they're  literally  like  disrespectful 
 just  to  girls  for  no  reason  but  at  the
[03:04] same  time  you  shouldn't  be  overly  nice 
 to  it  just  because  she's  female  I'm 
 gonna  tell  you  the  truth  that  not  a  lot
[03:09] of  people  say  and  it's  gonna  sound  kind 
 of  sexist  but  honestly  bro  some  women 
 don't  deserve  your  nice  side  and 
 honestly  some  guys  don't  either  you
[03:15] might  be  thinking  but  we'll  wear  Hamza 
 like  I  am  actually  a  nice  guy  though  and 
 you  probably  are  and  that's  a  good  thing 
 it's  good  to  be  a  guy  who's  nice  it's
[03:21] got  to  be  nice  like  nice  it's  like  a 
 good  personality  trait  you  know  so  many 
 guys  say  like  oh  I  don't  want  to  be  a 
 nice  guy  and  I  just  think  that  they
[03:27] probably  don't  know  what  they're 
 actually  saying  because  I  only  hang 
 around  with  nice  people  if  you're  not 
 nice  I  wouldn't  ever  be  friends  with  you
[03:32] we  want  to  be  nice  of  course  we  do  we 
 want  to  be  nice  kind  warm  to  the  people 
 who  are  in  our  tribe  to  our  families  who
[03:37] are  friends  but  being  a  nice  guy  like 
 nice  guy  is  kind  of  like  a  quote  like  a 
 term  by  itself  these  days  it  doesn't
[03:42] just  necessarily  mean  a  guy  who's  nice 
 it  means  like  this  kind  of  guy  who  uses 
 fake  nicety  to  try  and  get  like  attract
[03:48] a  girl  and  that's  not  attractive  it's 
 the  kind  of  guy  who  never  wants  to 
 disagree  with  a  girl  because  he's  just
[03:53] trying  to  be  nice  and  you  know  he's  just 
 overly  like  he's  just  buying  the  things 
 this  is  simply  and  everything  it's  not 
 attractive  but  to  be  a  guy  I'm  man  who
[04:00] does  have  nice  Parts  about  him  well 
 that's  the  best  of  both  worlds  how  do 
 you  stop  being  a  nice  guy  you  kind  of
[04:05] just  need  exposure  to  men  who  are  like 
 good  with  women  and  see  how  they 
 navigate  if  you  watch  a  movie  of  James
[04:11] Bond  you  wouldn't  think  oh  he's  a  nice 
 guy  you  might  think  like  oh  yeah  he's 
 professional  he's  attractive  he's  sexy
[04:16] he's  Charming  but  he's  not  a  nice  guy 
 he's  not  overly  nice  to  these  girls  for 
 no  reason  and  he  actually  calls  them  out
[04:22] on  their  [ __ ]  just  like  he  would 
 call  out  guys  this  is  harder  said  than 
 done  but  you  need  to  see  some  guys 
 navigate  their  relations  with  women  but
[04:29] not  in  like  a  nice  guy  a  modern  dynamic 
 kind  of  way  and  this  is  hard  because  the 
 majority  of  relationships  that  you  see
[04:34] of  the  guys  that  you  see  who  are  dating 
 girls  the  majority  of  guys  are  quite 
 like  nice  guys  like  they  might  be
[04:39] attractive  they  might  get  girls  but  a 
 lot  of  guys  are  quite  like  weak  feminine 
 submissive  docile  you  know  the  the  kind
[04:44] of  guys  who  would  never  even  call  a  girl 
 out  if  she  does  something  wrong  and  have 
 some  more  extremely  controversial  advice
[04:49] but  this  is  what  works  for  me  I  kind  of 
 think  that  a  certain  amount  of  guys  need 
 to  just  transition  from  being  a  nice  guy
[04:56] you  know  overly  nice  to  actually  going 
 through  a  phase  of  being  overly  hostile 
 and  hateful  towards  women  to  eventually
[05:03] get  closer  to  being  like  Adonis  some 
 guys  can  avoid  that  sort  of  hating  women 
 face  and  they  can  just  go  from  being
[05:08] like  a  nice  guy  you  know  who's  overly 
 nice  and  everything  to  just  acting  more 
 like  Adonis  being  like  a  gentleman  who's
[05:13] warm  but  also  respects  himself  some  guys 
 can  escape  this  middle  period  but  some 
 guys  have  to  go  through  a  period  from
[05:18] being  nice  to  then  being  kind  of  like 
 negative  towards  women  and  I  honestly 
 had  to  do  this  this  is  probably  stuff
[05:23] you've  never  heard  of  before  someone 
 openly  admitting  this  but  I  had  to  go 
 through  a  phase  of  almost  like  hating 
 women  and  you're  thinking  kind  of
[05:29] negative  thoughts  again  a  stupid  [ __ ] 
 and  yeah  these  [ __ ]  are  so  stupid  you 
 know  all  this  kind  of  negative  thought 
 which  is  so  toxic  man  but  I  had  to  go
[05:35] through  that  to  get  to  where  I  am  now  I 
 had  to  this  is  what  the  modern  world 
 really  doesn't  want  you  to  experience
[05:41] but  the  thing  is  if  you've  been  sold 
 this  lie  that  you  should  be  this  nice 
 little  good  boy  and  you've  fallen  for 
 this  lie  you  need  to  go  through  some
[05:46] level  of  like  aggression  to  get  pissed 
 off  at  the  world  and  pissed  off  at  women 
 for  like  thinking  that  you've  fallen  for
[05:51] this  lie  and  of  course  don't  do  that  in 
 some  kind  of  like  violent  way  don't  do 
 that  in  a  way  that  will  insult  or 
 disrespect  anyone  but  you  might  find
[05:57] some  progress  in  almost  turning  on  your 
 male  aggression  and  having  a  sense  of 
 hatred  against  the  world  and  sometimes
[06:02] against  women  to  think  like  yeah  like 
 I've  been  sold  this  lie  like  women 
 aren't  even  that  great  anyway  I've  put
[06:07] them  on  such  a  high  pedestal  they're  not 
 even  that  special  they're  just  human 
 beings  and  you  almost  have  like  this 
 energy  of  hatred  that  eventually  leaves
[06:12] you  because  you're  finally  acting  like  a 
 [ __ ]  man  with  anger  and  aggression 
 which  is  normal  for  men  and  then  it's
[06:17] almost  like  you're  left  with  nothing  but 
 like  just  positive  feelings  about  women 
 some  guys  need  to  go  through  that
[06:22] transition  and  I  did  that  being  said 
 that  I  want  to  remind  you  to  put  in  so 
 much  intention  to  make  sure  that  you 
 don't  get  stuck  in  either  of  these
[06:28] sections  don't  get  stuck  just  being  nice 
 for  no  reasons  especially  to  women  who 
 don't  deserve  it  and  don't  get  stuck  in 
 this  sort  of  like  hateful  phase  where
[06:34] you  kind  of  hate  the  world  of  alliancy 
 because  so  many  guys  especially  the  guys 
 that  you  see  on  YouTube  are  stuck  here
[06:39] and  they  are  lesser  men  transition  as 
 fast  as  you  can  over  to  where  Adonis  is 
 where  you  begin  to  just  see  women  for
[06:45] what  they  are  people  you  take  women  off 
 this  pedestal  which  you've  put  them  on 
 and  you  realize  that  you  know  if  a  girl
[06:51] does  something  to  piss  you  off  you'll 
 respond  in  the  exact  same  way  that  you 
 would  have  a  guided  you'd  respond  to  a 
 girl  that  you're  dating  if  you  turned  up
[06:57] late  to  a  date  in  the  same  way  that  you 
 would  if  you're  male  friend  did  you'd 
 show  a  girl  with  a  certain  kind  of
[07:02] characteristics  and  hobbies  and  traits 
 the  same  level  of  interest  that  you 
 would  in  a  guy  and  this  is  a  very
[07:07] interesting  transition  because  you  start 
 to  realize  like  how  much  you've  put 
 women  in  a  pedestal  and  that's  why
[07:12] you've  been  so  nice  because  you  value 
 like  girls  so  highly  and  then  one  day 
 you  kind  of  click  and  you're  like  wait 
 the  girl  I'm  interested  in  is  a  loser  I
[07:18] wouldn't  be  friends  with  a  guy  if  he  was 
 like  that  like  all  she  does  is  just 
 scroll  on  Tick  Tock  that's  [ __ ] 
 that's  repulsive  why  am  I  being  so  nice
[07:24] to  her  why  am  I  like  paying  for  [ __ ] 
 like  she's  not  a  nice  girl  to  be  around 
 she's  not  even  like  polite  or  anything 
 you  need  to  stop  giving  points  of
[07:30] admiration  to  someone  who's  a  low 
 quality  person  and  start  to  respect 
 yourself  enough  to  think  that  you  don't
[07:35] need  to  present  this  like  fake  positive 
 you  know  really  happy  nice  attitude  to
[07:40] people  who  don't  really  deserve  it  most 
 importantly  you  need  permission  for  this 
 because  if  you  add  like  a  strong 
 masculine  father  figure  you  would  have
[07:46] seen  him  and  imitated  the  way  that  he 
 navigated  his  relationship  with  your 
 loving  feminine  mother  but  the  majority
[07:51] of  us  haven't  had  that  kind  of  Parental 
 Dynamic  that  we've  been  able  to  observe 
 so  we've  never  really  been  able  to  learn
[07:56] about  the  correct  sort  of  relationship 
 Dynamic  and  it's  such  a  shame  that  you 
 didn't  get  to  benefit  from  that  because
[08:01] if  you  did  see  like  a  positively  loving 
 strong  masculine  father  figure  you  would 
 have  seen  him  respect  himself  and  not  be
[08:07] overly  nice  to  people  who  didn't  deserve 
 that 
 what  you  see  before  you  is  an  absolutely
[08:13] massive  movement  of  young  men  who  are 
 taking  self-improvement  seriously  we 
 didn't  start  off  in  the  best  place  with
[08:19] the  best  parents  or  the  best  genetics 
 but  we're  doing  the  best  that  we  can 
 with  the  things  that  we  can  improve  in 
 our  lives  and  our  relationships  with
[08:24] women  is  a  big  part  of  that  you  can  join 
 this  movement  of  men  who  are 
 relentlessly  improving  themselves  and
