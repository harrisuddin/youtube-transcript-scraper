[00:03] your  audio  is  not  switched  on 
 we're  having  some  technical  difficulties
[00:09] there  we  go 
 okay  hi  hi  how  you  doing  hi
[00:17] this  is  [ __ ]  weird 
 you  really  really  win  but  yeah  i'm  good
[00:24] it's  nice  to  see  you  peter
[00:30] good  for  them  it's  going  good
[00:35] i'm  a little  bit  nervous  i'm  all  like 
 yeah  me  too  look
[00:42] very  weird  all  right  so 
 i  think  boys  you  know  eve  she's  showing
[00:49] up  in  a  couple  other  videos 
 about  a  month  ago  and  we're  going  to
[00:54] talk  about  our  relationship  and  we're 
 going  to  talk  about 
 some  advice  and  we'll  see  how  it  goes
[01:01] do  you want  to  introduce  yourself 
 yeah  i'm  eve  um
[01:08] i'm  hansen's  ex-girlfriend
[01:23] what  was  it  like  dating  me
[01:28] when  it  was  good  it  was  really  good  but 
 when  it  was  bad  it  was  really  bad
[01:33] as  a  summary  basically  can  you  expand  on 
 that
[01:39] um  yeah  like  obviously  we  got  on 
 really  well  like  we  have  like  a  really
[01:45] good  connection  and  stuff  but 
 i  think  you  have  a  lot  of  toxic  traits
[01:50] like  a  lot  of  toxic  traits 
 um  which  i  don't  think  you'd  call  as
[01:56] toxic  but  they  are  toxic 
 um  and  ultimately  in  my  opinion  that's
[02:01] why  we  ended 
 um  but  dating  like  it  was  good  like  i'm
[02:06] saying  this  is  if  our  relationship  was 
 bad  like 
 the  most  part  of  our  relationship  was 
 good  it  was  just  the  end  was
[02:11] [ __ ]  and  what  were  the  toxic  traits
[02:18] um  controlling 
 manipulative  like  borderline  abusive
[02:26] emotionally  not  physically 
 emotionally  not  verbally
[02:33] but  just  i  don't  know  i  feel  like  you 
 played  mind  games  quite  a  lot 
 um  let's  go  through  them
[02:39] so  why  would  you  say  controlling
[02:45] why  do  you  think  i'd  say  controlling  to 
 start  with 
 you  tell  me  if  that's  that's  one  of  my
[02:50] tricks  that  you  saw  in  me 
 um  telling
[02:56] your  girlfriend  if  you  go  to  a  nightclub 
 without  me  i  break  up  with  you
[03:01] it's  just  it's  just  a  little  bit 
 controlling 
 um  just  like  all  the  things  at  the  end
[03:07] of  our  relationship  like 
 telling  me  the  first  like  going  to 
 nightclubs
[03:12] like  oh  what  i  could  post  on  instagram 
 or  not  i  mean  i 
 never  posted  the  kinds  of  things  that
[03:18] you  were  on  about  but  um 
 like  not  moving  to  liverpool  likes  when 
 you  said  to  me  if  i  went  and  moved  to
[03:23] liverpool  you  break  up  with  me  like 
 that's  controlling 
 like  that's  using  like  you  used  my  fear
[03:30] of 
 abandonment  and  fear  of  rejection  which 
 like 
 i've  had  for  all  my  life  like  from  my
[03:36] childhood  and  like  stuff  in  my  dad  and 
 stuff 
 like  you  really  did  use  that  against  me
[03:41] a  lot 
 so  you  thought  that  was  a  like  a 
 calculated
[03:47] attack  that  i  made  on  you  no  i  think  it 
 was  calculated
[03:52] um  yeah
[03:57] i  don't  think  it  calculated  i  just  think 
 it's  the  way  that  you  are
[04:04] joe  it's  interesting  how 
 we  have  very  very  different 
 interpretations  of  the  same  thing
[04:11] because  you  see  this  is  controlling 
 and  i  would  honestly  see  this  as  healthy 
 boundaries  and
[04:17] the  way  that  you  said  it  as  well  is 
 almost  like 
 like  you  maybe  could  even  remember  a
[04:23] false  moment  in  your  mind  of  me  saying 
 okay 
 if  you  do  this  i  will  break  up  with  you 
 but  i  don't  ever  speak  like  that  it  was
[04:29] more 
 i  am  not  a  girlfriend  no
[04:36] i  was  literally  sat  here  i  remember  the 
 conversation 
 so  you  kind can  genuinely  believe  i  said
[04:42] if  you  do  this 
 i  will  break  up  with  you  i  threatened 
 you
[04:48] does  that  sound  like  that 
 yeah  well  no  but  yeah  towards  the  end
[04:56] do  you  not  remember  like  when  i  was  here 
 i  came  back  to  uni  for  six  days 
 and  then  you  broke  up  with  me  i  came
[05:02] home  um 
 and  then  when  we  had  that  conversation
[05:07] in  the  car  when  we  got  back  together 
 that's  when  you  laid  out  these 
 boundaries  about  nightclubs  and
[05:13] liverpool  and 
 i  did  not  feel  like  that  was  a  good
[05:19] discussion  to  have 
 um  boundaries  of  course  but  not  the
[05:24] boundaries  that  you  set 
 healthy  boundaries  are  i  need 
 i  need  x  amount  of  free  time  to  spend
[05:30] time  with  my  friends  or  i  need  x  amount 
 of  time 
 to  spend  and  focus  on  my  work  like 
 they're  healthy  boundaries
[05:35] or  oh  i  don't  feel  comfortable  like  say 
 oh  how  healthy  boundaries  are  that  you
[05:41] do  have  some  healthy  boundaries  like 
 not  posting  like  [ __ ]  pictures  to
[05:46] instagram  because  obviously  you  don't  do 
 that  if  you're  in  a  relationship 
 um  like  that  is  a  healthy  boundary  i
[05:51] think  but 
 the  boundaries  that  you  set  weren't
[05:56] necessarily  the  healthiest 
 i  disagree  i'd  say
[06:03] it  shouldn't  really  need  to  be  said  that 
 type  of  boundary 
 because  when  you're  in  a  good  committed
[06:11] relationship 
 you  don't  do  certain  things  anymore  and 
 that
[06:16] is  you  can  see  it  as  controlling  if  for 
 example  you  want  to  take  a  negative  view 
 of  the  person  who  says  that  and  if
[06:21] you've  already  kind  of  you  know  you  want 
 to  like  say  something  towards  them  but
[06:26] that  that  single  people  stuff  going  to  a 
 nightclub  going  to  like  move  into  a 
 place  which  is
[06:31] which  in  this  house  where  there's  going 
 to  be  a lot  of  parties  and  there's  going 
 to  be  a lot  of  like 
 people  interacting  with  each  other
[06:36] that's  like  single  people  stuff  and 
 if  we  weren't  in  a  serious  relationship 
 if  we  were  just  kind  of  casually  dating
[06:42] fair  enough  i  would  say  that's  control 
 and  i'd  agree  with  you 
 but  when  we're  genuinely  planning  our 
 life  together  and  we  were  like  talking
[06:47] about  kids  and  everything 
 and  then  we're  saying  this  stuff  and  you 
 know  then  you're  like  oh  yeah  let  me
[06:53] uh  next  week  i'm  gonna  go  to  this 
 nightclub  like  that's 
 the  two  things  don't  match  you  you  don't
[06:58] if  you  were  being  honest  with  the  plans 
 that  we  made 
 you  don't  also  believe  that  whilst
[07:04] thinking  oh  yeah  let  me  go  live 
 my  normal  single  life  like  enjoy  my  hot 
 girl  summer
[07:10] i  i  understand  why  you  think  that  a
[07:15] hundred  percent 
 like  i've  actually  made  like  i've  made  a 
 few  notes  of  things  i  want  to  say  this
[07:20] was  actually 
 [Laughter]
[07:27] hello 
 um  before  we  begin
[07:33] before  it  starts  maybe  getting  hurtful 
 or  some  [ __ ] 
 i  didn't  do  this  but  i  did  plan  to
[07:39] so  we'll  do  like  a  real  life  journaling 
 session
[07:44] where  we'll  say  three  things  that  we 
 were  grateful 
 for  each  other  first  before  we  like  have
[07:50] you  ruined  my  life  and  i  hate  you 
 i'll  go  first  yeah  okay
[07:57] i'm  grateful  for  your  laugh  i  found  that 
 really  really  cute
[08:02] i'm  grateful  for  the  time  that  we  went 
 to  liverpool  and 
 we  saw  my  old  house  that  i  used  to  live
[08:07] at  and  then  we  went  to  that 
 spot  that  i  knew  that  we  would  go  to  one 
 time  and  we  did  the
[08:13] like  we  were  just  running  on  the  side  of 
 the  wall  i  think  that  was 
 such  a  very  very  cute  day
[08:19] and  i'm  grateful  for  the  vibe  that  we've 
 had  all  this  time
[08:24] that  we  would  meet  in  the  car  and  it 
 would  be  night  and 
 we'd  just  be  listening  to  music  and  like
[08:30] all  the  songs  we  used  to  listen  to 
 i  try  not  to  listen  to  them  anymore 
 because  it's  like
[08:37] by  association  i'm  instantly  thinking 
 about  you  and 
 yeah  i'm  grateful  for  that
[08:46] thank  you  um  i'm  grateful
[08:51] for  i  mean  i  said  this  to  you  like  all 
 throughout  our  relationship  even  though 
 things  have  ended  in  like  quite  a  bad
[08:56] way  and  like  i 
 like  yeah  things  have  ended  in  a  [ __ ]
[09:01] horrible  way 
 but  i  am  grateful  because  i  do  feel  like 
 despite  everything  you  did  have  a  very
[09:06] positive  influence  on  me 
 um  which  i  mean  i  said  that  to  you  like 
 all  throughout  our  relationship  so  you
[09:12] know  that  of  course  but  um 
 i'm  grateful  for
[09:17] all  the  time  we  spent  together  i  think 
 like  when  i  think  back  to  things 
 like  the  main  ones  like  delamere  forest
[09:23] and  like  the  pete  district 
 there's  like  two  of  my  favorites  and
[09:29] and  the  same  i'm  grateful  for  like  the 
 vibe  we  always  had  i  feel  like  we  always 
 just  got  on  really  well
[09:42] [Laughter]
[09:59] what  were  you  talking  about  just  before 
 though
[10:13] i  can't  remember  exactly  what  i  was 
 saying 
 um  oh  yeah  um
[10:20] like  i  do  believe  that  in  terms  of  stuff 
 like  this  you  are  quite  close-minded
[10:26] because  even  though  i  obviously  disagree 
 with  what  you  have  to  say  because 
 for  me  this  is  the  reason  why  we  broke
[10:32] up  i  feel  like  we  both  have  like  we'll 
 get  into  it  later  i'm  sure  but 
 that  we  both  have  very  different  ideas 
 of  why  we  actually  broken  up  with  them
[10:39] yeah  because  i  mean  we've  never 
 discussed  it  i  guess 
 um  but  although  like  i
[10:46] do  completely  disagree  with  your 
 belief  about  how  old  you  don't  go  to
[10:51] nightclubs  in  a  relationship  which 
 yeah  obviously  if  you're  in  a 
 relationship  you  shouldn't  be  going  to
[10:56] nightclubs  with  your  friends  every 
 weekend  but  that's  a  given  like  that's 
 just  not  going gonna  happen  and  if  it  is 
 then  you  shouldn't  be  in  a  relationship
[11:01] to  start  with 
 that  would  have  never  been  me  and  you 
 knew  that  um
[11:06] but  i  can  still  understand  why  you 
 believe  those  things  like  i  can 
 understand  like  oh  yeah  you  don't  put
[11:11] yourself 
 in  a  position  that  makes  your  partner 
 anxious  but  then  also
[11:16] like  you  shouldn't  but  you  shouldn't  we 
 do  feel  anxious  in  these  situations 
 because  i  do  as  well 
 but  we  shouldn't  feel  anxious  because  if
[11:22] you  really  trust  the  person 
 it  shouldn't  be  an  issue  you  know  what  i 
 mean  and  it's  like
[11:27] how  often  was  i  going  to  go  to 
 nightclubs  realistically  how  often  did 
 you  think  i  was  going  to  go  to
[11:32] nightclubs 
 i  had  to  say  because  you  you  do  have
[11:38] this  vibe  of  like  oh  no  not  me  like  you 
 know 
 i'll  go  once  every  now  and  then  but  i 
 only  knew  you  threw  kovid  anyway
[11:44] when  that  stuff  was  closed  and  the 
 moment  at  least  not  in  the  nightclubs 
 when  the  bars  were  opening  you  were
[11:49] going  straight  away 
 and  so  you  do  have  maybe  not  like 
 specifically  a  nightclub  but  you  have
[11:55] the  persona  of  someone  i'd  imagine  who 
 like  you  are  like  a  pretty  popular  girl 
 you've  got  a  pop  in  social  circle  and
[12:00] stuff  you've  built  that  up  so 
 you've  got  enough  people  to  like  hang 
 out  with  so  whilst  it  might  not  be
[12:05] specifically  at  nightclub  it  is 
 in  that  environment  of  like  nighttime
[12:10] drinking  mixing  with  a  bunch  of  guys  and 
 girls
[12:15] yeah  i  understand  that  i  have  probably 
 been 
 to  nightclubs  probably  maximum
[12:22] 15  20  times  in  my  whole  life  um
[12:27] so  it's  not  something  i  would  have 
 done  often  i  feel  like  we  both  have  a
[12:32] very  very  very  different 
 opinion  of  nightclubs  because  we've  had 
 very  different  experiences
[12:37] like  my  i've  never  been  to  a  nightclub 
 single  i've  never  been  to  a  nightclub
[12:42] not  once 
 when  i've  been  single  so  i've  never  gone 
 to 
 get  with  a  guy  or  and  or  anything  like
[12:48] that  i've  never  gone  for  male  attention 
 whereas  i  feel  like  you  genuinely 
 believe 
 that  the  only  reason  a  girl  will  go  to  a
[12:53] nightclub  is  to  get  attention  from  guys 
 and  the  only  reason  the  girl  will  get 
 ready  and  they'll  put  on  their  makeup
[12:59] and  they'll  make  themselves  look  nice  to 
 go  to  a  nightclub 
 is  for  guys  and  that's  like  yeah  that's 
 the  case  for  a  lot  of  girls  like  a  lot
[13:05] of  girls 
 but  not  for  me  and  not  for  my  friends 
 it's  never  been  me 
 like  ever  that's  what
[13:13] every  girl  would  say  though  that's  the 
 issue  yeah  maybe  it  is  but  that  does  it 
 doesn't  matter  what  every  girl  would  say
[13:19] it  matters  what  i'm  saying 
 because  i  was  your  girlfriend  it 
 shouldn't  matter  what  every  other  girl 
 oh  every  other  girl  goes  to  nightclubs
[13:25] to  impress  guys 
 okay  cool  but  i  don't  are  you  in  a 
 relationship  with  the  other  girl  no 
 you're  in  a  relationship  with  me
[13:31] so  what  should  have  mattered  we've  got 
 to  know  that  they 
 including  you  you  don't  consciously
[13:39] know  something  like  this  you  don't 
 consciously  think  oh  i'm  going  to  get 
 ready  i  hope 
 i  pull  a  guy  tonight  guys  do  this  guys
[13:45] openly  will  say  it  to  their  friends  like 
 i  hope  i  get  laid  tonight  for  poor  girl 
 tonight 
 girls  don't  exactly  have  that  openness
[13:51] even  though  girls  are  becoming  more  open 
 with  their  sexuality  and  they  will  say 
 to  their  friends  like  i  really  want  to 
 pull  a  guy
[13:56] it's  like  you  don't  exactly  know  it 
 yourself 
 because  you've  got  5  000  years  of
[14:01] progress  sexist  programming  telling  you 
 okay  don't  don't  show  any  kind  of 
 sexuality 
 be  repressed  and  so  subconsciously
[14:09] this  is  probably  what's  happening  is 
 subconsciously  you  kind  of  know  that  if 
 you  look  really  pretty  tonight  that
[14:14] there's  a  chance  to  get  with  a  guy  who's 
 like 
 really  really  really  awesome  but  it's 
 not  something  that
[14:19] you  hear  those  thoughts  in  your  mind 
 that  you  can  actually  express  to  people
[14:24] which  is  like 
 in  my  experience  if  one  of  say  if  i  was
[14:30] going  on  a  night  out  with  a  friend 
 and  they  were  like  wanted  to  get  with  a 
 guy  and  well  not  a  friend  could  never  go
[14:36] with  just  like  one  friend  it  would 
 always  be 
 like  a  group  of  people  um  they'd  say  it
[14:42] they  maybe  don't  say  it  to  guys  but  they 
 say  it  to  their  girlfriends
[14:47] but  i've  never  gone  to  clubs  for  like 
 that  reason 
 i've  never  put  on  makeup  to  impress  a
[14:52] guy  i've  never  worn  a  nice  outfit  to 
 impress  a  guy  yeah  it's  like 
 when  i've  got  ready  and  the  guy
[14:57] compliments  me  he  says  i  look  pretty  it 
 feels  like  it  [ __ ]  feels  nice  when 
 you  put  effort  into  your  appearance  but
[15:02] that  isn't  the  reason  i  do  it 
 like  when  i  put  on  makeup  when  i  get 
 ready  like  that's 
 my  like  form  of  expression  like  that's
[15:09] it's  like 
 creativity  like  i  could  [ __ ]  put  like 
 a  unicorn  on  my  eye  if  i  wanted  to  do
[15:14] you  know  i  mean  it's  like 
 you  can  do  whatever  you  want  with  it 
 it's  not  for  men  and  i  feel  like  that's 
 a  very
[15:19] outdated  view  to  think  that  makeup  and 
 clothes  is  for  men  when  that's  not  the
[15:24] case  for  some  girls  yeah  but  for  me  now 
 and  that's  what  matters  in  this 
 situation  because  it's  our  relationship
[15:30] not 
 every  other  goal
[15:36] what's  the  first  thing  you  have  on  your 
 your  list  that  you'd  like  to  discuss 
 on  my  list  um
[15:45] so  i've  like  done  it  in  sections  so 
 the  breakup  is  the  first  one  yeah
[15:52] it's  your  first  one  on  your  list 
 first  one  was  what  was  it  like  dating  me
[15:59] that  we  asked  that  one  and  the  second 
 one  was  the  best  and 
 the  best  of  worst  things  about  dating  me
[16:05] we  kind  of 
 i  mean  you  can  answer  that  if  you  want 
 but  you  kind  of  discussed  that  with  me
[16:11] the  toxicity  is  the  worst  and  the  best 
 was  like  the 
 positive  influence  on  the  blood
[16:18] um  i  wouldn't  even  say  that  was  the  best 
 thing  i'd  just  say 
 yeah  no  that  probably  was  the  best  thing
[16:23] actually  for  the  vibe 
 [Music] 
 another  the  third  one  i've  got  is  why
[16:29] did  we  break  up 
 i've  got  well  i  think  we  break  off  as
[16:34] well  what's  your  best 
 and  worst  thing  about  dating  me  um
[16:40] best  would  be 
 do  you  know  what  changed  i  remember
[16:45] saying  to  you  and  even  to  a  bunch  of 
 boys  that 
 the  the  best  thing  about  you  was  the
[16:51] fact  that 
 you  were  you  were  like  feminine  and
[16:56] it  complemented  me  so  nicely  that
[17:02] i  could i  could  influence  you  that  i 
 could  that  positive  influence  like  could 
 you  know  i  could  tell  you
[17:07] meditation  you'd  do  it  i  could  tell  you 
 this  and  this  and  this  even  from  the 
 start  before  i  got  you  onto  those 
 self-improvement  practices  i  would  often
[17:13] see  that 
 you'd  almost  automatically  be  influenced 
 by  my  decisions  and  my
[17:19] my  mindset  even  though  i  don't  think 
 you'd  be  able  to  admit  this  or  you  even 
 knew  what  would  happen 
 what  was  happening  but  i  remember
[17:24] sometimes  it'd  be  late  it  would  be  tired 
 for  example  you'd  say  that  you  didn't
[17:29] like  this  song  or  something 
 and  then  i  would  say  like  that's  pretty 
 good  and  you'll  be  like  yeah  that's
[17:34] pretty  good 
 all  right  so  that's
[17:39] yeah  that  was  your  best  trait  and  then
[17:44] after  everything  ended  and  i  was  opening 
 my  mind  up  to  someone  and  he
[17:49] he  said  no  no  that's  that's  not  what  you 
 want  a  girlfriend  at  all 
 and  i'm  so  confused  i've  literally
[17:54] thought  the  ability  to  influence  your 
 your  girlfriend  and  to  like  train  her  to 
 be  you  know  into  the  self-improvement
[17:59] was  awesome 
 and  say  like  nah  if  she's  got  that  trait 
 that  means  that
[18:04] she'll  blow  wherever  the  wind  goes  or 
 she'll  go  wherever  the  wind  blows  and 
 that 
 anyone  around  her  will  be  able  to
[18:09] influence  her  and 
 straight  i  was  like  that's  the
[18:15] unfortunate  truth  is 
 when  you  were  with  me  you  were 
 completely  obsessed  with  me  you  did 
 everything  exactly  like  me  but  then  when
[18:21] you  were  with 
 your  friends  you  turned  exactly  like 
 them  and  you  were with  your  family  you 
 turned  like  them
[18:26] and  so  it  was  like  kind  of  like  a 
 shape-shifter  personality  where 
 no  one  really  knows  who  the  real  version
[18:33] of  you  actually  is 
 i  think  that's  fair  to  say  why  not
[18:40] i  just  don't  think  it  is 
 do  you  think  it's  not  nice  to  say  but
[18:45] you  think  it's  partially  true  at  least 
 um  i  think  it's  partial  it  is  partially
[18:52] true 
 like 
 um  i  don't  think  that's
[19:00] the  case  that  i'd  just  be  influenced  by 
 anything 
 i'm  influenced  by  things  that  interest
[19:05] me 
 i'm  not  this  shape-shifter  person  i'm 
 not  a  different  person  when  i'm  with  my
[19:10] mom  i'm  not  a  different  person  when  i'm 
 with  you  i'm  not  a different  person  when 
 i'm  with  my  friends 
 i  saw  that  of  course  yeah  but  we  talk
[19:17] like  i'm  not  going  to  talk  about  the 
 same  things  to  you  that  i  talk  about 
 with  my  friends  am  i 
 of  course  i'm  going  to  be  slightly
[19:22] different  we  were  in  a  relationship 
 together 
 i'm  not  going  to  be  the  exact  same  with 
 you  as  i  was  with  my  mum  or  i  was  with
[19:27] my  friends  because  we  were  in  a 
 relationship 
 yeah  i'm  not  expecting  you  to  to  talk
[19:33] about  the  same  things  but 
 your  your  personality  changed  a
[19:39] significant  amount 
 if  you'd  be  next  to  me  you  were  very 
 similar  to  me  and  you'd  be 
 like  the  other  half  of  me  and  then  you
[19:45] went  away  you  went  to  uni 
 and  it's  like  you  turned  into  just  like 
 a  normal  girl
[19:51] who's  doing  [ __ ]  on  like  social  media 
 who's  like  stalking  my 
 checking  my  followers  and  everything  and
[19:57] it  was  like  you  literally  changed  the 
 way  that  you'd  speak  and  like  that 
 attitude  that  was
[20:02] that  you  were  holding  you you're 
 presenting 
 i  don't  think  it's  something  that  you
[20:07] would  be  so  aware  of 
 and  it  is  like  it  is  somewhat  of  a 
 commentary  i  do  see  this  with
[20:13] a  lot  of  people  and  especially  if 
 they've  had  similar  experiences  as  you 
 add 
 which  we  want  we  don't  need  to  go  into
[20:19] too  much  detail  but  like 
 a  lot  of  the  stuff  that  the  boys  who  are 
 watching  this  have  experienced  where
[20:24] you  know  you've  been  in  high  school  and 
 and  you've  had  like  some  shitty  friends 
 and  so  if  you  felt  somewhat  excluded
[20:29] when  you  were  younger 
 you  will  do  everything  it  takes  to  make 
 sure
[20:34] you're  around  a  pop  in  social  life  now 
 that  you're  accepted  amongst  other 
 people 
 and  that  that's  i  think  what  you
[20:40] portrayed  which  i  thought  was  your  best 
 trait  was  that  essentially  you  were 
 you  were  doing  what  it  took  to  be
[20:45] accepted  by  me  and  i  thought  that  was  an 
 awesome  trait  made  me  feel  awesome  that 
 oh  you  know  she's  changing  the  mind
[20:50] about  the  song  and  about  bigger  things 
 and  everything 
 and  then  i  would  see  you  do  that  with
[20:55] other  people 
 and  like  what
[21:04] it's  like  your  interest  changed  so  your 
 interest  was 
 next  to  me  it  was  like  a  simple  life  it
[21:11] was  very  similar  to  the  life  i'm  living 
 where  it was  like  dopamine  detox  you 
 barely  use  your  phone  you  barely  do  like
[21:16] any  of  the  bad 
 behaviors  or  anything  and  the  moment  you 
 step  away  from  me 
 you  want  to  go  to  nightclubs  you  want  to
[21:22] like  drink  and  and  get  into  like  the 
 instagram 
 but  hamza  the  thing  that  you  don't
[21:27] understand  is  i  didn't  want  to  go  to 
 nightclubs  like  if 
 if  a  friend  asked  me  that  oh  you  want  to
[21:32] go  out  this  weekend  like 
 i'd  either  say  yes  or  no  depending  on  if 
 i  wanted  to  it  wasn't  my  friends
[21:38] influencing  me  but 
 the  issue  was  i  wasn't  upset  with  your 
 control  because  i 
 so  desperately  wanted  to  go  to
[21:44] nightclubs  is  that  i  shouldn't  have  been 
 told  what  i  can  and  can't  do  in  the 
 first  place 
 i  probably  would  have  never  gone  to
[21:49] nightclubs  realistically  i  probably 
 would  have  gone 
 to  a  nightclub  without  you  maybe  once  a 
 year  maybe  maybe  twice  a  year  at  a  bush
[21:56] it  isn't  the  fact  that  i  really  really 
 desperately  wanted  to  do  these  things 
 it's  because  i  was  being  told  that  i
[22:01] couldn't 
 that  isn't  healthy  that  isn't  how  that 
 isn't  in  any 
 way  shape  or  form  that  is  not  healthy
[22:08] so  still  to  this  day  you  you  can 
 remember  a  time  where  i  said  you  cannot 
 do  this  that  if  you  do  this
[22:14] like  i  gave  you  an  ultimatum  if  you  do 
 this  i  will  break  up  with  you  because 
 that's  not  how  it  went 
 the  conversation  talking  about
[22:20] boundaries 
 i  had  broken  up  with  you  and  we  were 
 kind  of  like  speaking  again  so  we  kind 
 of  back  together  and  i  said  that
[22:26] i  didn't  want  a  girlfriend  who  would  be 
 going  into  that  environment
[22:31] that's  it's  not  exactly  yeah  controlling 
 with  liverpool  that's  a  different  thing 
 with  liverpool  that's  it  i  can
[22:37] understand  that  slightly  more  because 
 like  i  wasn't  going  to  go  into  a  party 
 environment  i  was  going  to  go
[22:42] live  with  people  who  like  to  go  out  and 
 party  sometimes  but  it wasn't  it  wasn't 
 going  to  be  a  party  environment  at  all
[22:48] like  i'm  going  to  be  a  master  student 
 they're  going  to  be  third  year  students 
 like 
 it's  not  going  to  be  like  a  first  year
[22:54] party  house 
 but  i  can't  remember  what  my  initial 
 point  was  with  that  no  that  was  a
[22:59] different  thing 
 but  nightclubs  is  a  whole  separate  thing 
 that  has  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with
[23:04] me  going  and  living  there 
 still  the  same  boundaries  it's  not
[23:10] you  expressed  your  boundaries  to  me  that 
 you  didn't  feel  comfortable  with 
 me  training  shirtless  in  in  the
[23:17] gymnastic  ring  spot 
 i  stopped  straight  away  because  i  saw
[23:22] this  for  the  long 
 long  term  for  example  like  i  wasn't 
 doing  any  of  the  parting  stuff  but  for 
 example  you  did  say  that
[23:27] i  think  like  yes  sound  like  this  is  my 
 baby  girl  this  is  the  girl  who
[23:32] i'm  gonna  have  kids  with  like  a  party  at 
 nightclub  is is 
 nothing  if  it  even  makes  you  feel  one
[23:38] percent  worried  or  anxious 
 it's  not  worth  it  because  i  plan  my  life 
 with  you
[23:43] and  to  see  you  like  i  guess  like  argue 
 against  this  and  to  see  your  family  kind 
 of  back  all  this  up
[23:48] it  was  just  showing  me  like  maybe  your 
 intentions  weren't  honest  maybe
[23:53] the  plans  that  we  made  with  the  stuff 
 that  you'd  say  about  your  connectivity 
 to  me  and 
 your  future  that  you  saw  with  me  i  can't
[24:00] i  can't  see  how  you'd  see  both  of  those 
 being  a  reality  to  still  keep  up 
 the  nightclub  environments  party  stuff
[24:09] they  keep  up  as  if  that's  a  lifestyle  i 
 have  i've  never  had  that  lifestyle 
 not  once  my  whole  life  the  most  i've
[24:16] probably  ever  been  out  is  like 
 twice  in  one  week
[24:24] i  cannot  i  can  i  can  completely 
 understand  where  you're  coming  from  and 
 saying  that
[24:29] like  i  can  understand  why  you  have  that 
 view  but  then  also 
 like  i'm  not  i'm  not  saying  i  was
[24:35] perfect  in  the  relationship  i  was  toxic 
 as  well  like  that's  something  i  should 
 have  said  that  earlier  but  i  was  toxic
[24:40] as  well 
 like  saying  to  you  oh  i  don't  want  you 
 to  train 
 here  because  it  makes  me  uncomfortable
[24:47] that's 
 toxic  me  saying  to  you  oh  what  was 
 what  was  i  what  my  other  like  boundary
[24:53] that  i  made  can  i 
 actually  can  i  be  honest  with  you  you 
 know  we  were  having  that  conversation 
 about  boundaries
[24:58] and  we  were  sat  in  the  car  and  you  were 
 like  oh  what's  your  boundaries 
 i  was  actually  thinking  in  my  head  i  was
[25:03] like  i  don't  i  can't  actually 
 think  of  any  boundaries  that  i  have
[25:08] which  like  i  should  have  boundaries  like 
 that's 
 my  own  like  fault  of  course  but  i  was 
 actually  thinking  in  my  head  like  do  i
[25:13] just  say  that  i  don't  have  any  because  i 
 don't 
 like  i'm  pretty  chill  with  most  things
[25:18] or  do  i  turn  around  and  say  oh  my 
 boundaries  are  you  don't  train  at  this 
 spot 
 you  don't  i  can't  what  the  other  one  was
[25:27] i um  i  i  can't  remember  what  the 
 boundary  asset  was  but  um 
 something  like  training  shirtless  or
[25:32] something  but  i  was  like  oh  do  i  just 
 use  this  as  a 
 chance  to  get  rid  of  all  the  things  that
[25:37] make  me  slightly  uncomfortable  because 
 if  that's  what  hamza's  doing  i  might  as 
 well  do  the  same  thing 
 but  i  would  have  never  if  you  hadn't
[25:43] like  said  to  me 
 oh  you  you  can't  do  this  you  can't  do 
 that  i  would  have  never
[25:49] turned  around  and  said  to  you  oh  you 
 can't  work  out  here  because  i  know  that 
 me  being  anxious  about  you  working  out
[25:54] with  that  spot  that's  like  a  valid 
 that's  a  valid  thing  to  be  worried  about 
 like  you  get  girls  there  like  you  did
[25:59] right  before  we  got  together  like  that's 
 a  very  valid  thing  for  me  to  be  anxious 
 about  but  i  would  never
[26:04] ever  ever  tell  you  what  you  kind  of 
 can't  do  just  because  i'm  anxious 
 like  i've  had  these  insecurities  and
[26:10] these  like  anxieties 
 way  before  you  and  they'll  exist  way 
 after  you 
 i  would  never  ever  ever  use  them  or  use
[26:17] attachment  styles  or  use 
 being  insecure  as  an  excuse  to  tell  you 
 what  you  can  and  can't  do  but  i  did
[26:22] because  that's  what  you  were  doing 
 and  i'll  put  my  hands  up  and  i'll  say 
 i'll  regret  that  like  i  behave  toxic  at 
 the  end
[26:27] but  that's  not  something  that  i  would 
 normally  do
[26:34] i'm  not  sure  you've  got  like  an 
 understanding  of 
 healthy  relationships  i'm  not  gonna  lie
[26:40] i  don't  think  you  have  an  understanding 
 of  healthy  relationships 
 can  i  well  have  you  been  in  a  healthy
[26:46] relationship  before 
 yeah  really  yeah
[26:54] well  from  what  you've  told  me  of  them 
 they  didn't  see  him  maybe  the  foot  would 
 you  mean  the  first  one
[26:59] yeah  oh  yeah  okay  i'll  give  you  that  to 
 be  fair 
 have  you  i  did  team  it  wasn't
[27:06] at  the  end  but  generally  it  was  very 
 healthy
[27:12] the  reason  why  i  say  that  that  i  don't 
 think  is  because 
 of  something  you  just  said  then  that  you
[27:19] call  yourself 
 toxic  and  honestly  that  it's  not  even 
 been  in  my  mind  at  all
[27:24] like  i  i  don't  think  i  don't  call  myself 
 toxic  but  i  behave  in  toxic  ways
[27:29] but  you  think  that  you 
 telling  me  something  that  made  you
[27:34] anxious  was  toxic 
 not  telling  you  but  telling  you  what  you 
 can  and  can't  do  because  of  it
[27:40] yes  without  telling  you  i  don't 
 understand  how  your  mind  goes  to  that 
 i'd  i'd 
 like  that  isn't  what  the  conversation
[27:47] was  like 
 your  mind  was  the  conversation  you  you 
 believed  that  when  we  had  that
[27:52] conversation  we  were  saying  this  is  what 
 you  can  and  can't  do 
 because  like  you  actually  think  that  you
[27:57] said  that  to  me  but  you  never  once  said 
 it 
 like  we  weren't  talking  to  each  other  in
[28:02] in  a  hostile 
 negative  way  i'm  sorry  yeah  deception 
 that  it  wasn't  not  saying  that 
 like  you  did  not  say  um  you  i  don't  want
[28:09] you  to  train  shirtless  you  can't  train 
 shirtless  and  i  did  not  say  i  don't  like 
 you  cannot  you  cannot  go  to  nightclubs
[28:14] or  anything  i'm  so  surprised  that  you 
 have  this  perception  of  that 
 conversation  because 
 it  was  literally  your  saying  what  would
[28:20] hurt  us  and  what  what  makes  us  feel 
 anxious  and  the  other  person  was  like 
 like  i  said  it  to  you  and  you  were  like
[28:25] oh  yeah  like  i  don't  even  like  going  to 
 night  club  so  if  it  makes  you  anxious 
 like  there's  no  worries  like  oh  and  you 
 literally  even  said  like  oh
[28:30] about  moving  like  you  plan  to  move 
 somewhere  and  you're  like  oh  no  like 
 if  it  makes  you  anxious  like  yeah  you're
[28:36] gonna  like  probably  decide  against  it 
 and  i  did  the  same  thing  for  you  when 
 you  said  like  about  me  training  in  the
[28:41] gym  ring  spot 
 you  didn't  say  like  no  i  don't  want  you 
 to  train  that  you  just  said  like  yeah  it 
 does  make  me  like  anxious  because
[28:47] you  you  got  a  girl  from  there  just 
 before  we  got  together  and 
 you  um  if  you  keep  training  there  it's
[28:52] like  you  know  that 
 girls  walk  past  and  they  talk  to  me  and 
 so  i  said  it  to  you  like  i  said  okay
[28:57] like  i'm  gonna  stop  training  the  not 
 once  did  either  of  us  actually  say 
 like  we  weren't  that  type  of  couple  i'm
[29:03] so  surprised  that  you  have  i  didn't  say 
 pudding  i'm  so  surprised  like  perception
[29:08] of  us  that  we  were 
 the  type  of  couple  who  who  said  you  can 
 do  this  and  you  cannot  do  this 
 it  was  more  that  we  were  saying  about
[29:13] our  own  personal  feelings  say 
 you  were  saying  that  it  would  make  you 
 feel  like  scared
[29:18] because  of  like  what  you  know  girls 
 could  walk  past  and  i  was  saying  yeah  it 
 could  make  me  feel  scared  if  you  went  to
[29:23] the  nightclub  because 
 of  the  experiences  i've  had  in 
 nightclubs
[29:28] like  neither  of  us  actually  said  to  each 
 other 
 oh  you  i  didn't  say  i can't  go  there  i
[29:34] didn't 
 yeah  neither  of  us  actually  physically 
 said  that  that's  not  what  i'm  saying  but 
 i'm  saying  you  said  to  me
[29:40] oh  if  you  went  if  you  went  to  a 
 nightclub  i'd  feel  too  anxious 
 so  i  couldn't  be  with  you  i  won't  be
[29:46] able  to  be  in  a  relationship  with  you 
 but 
 it  doesn't  matter  the  way  you  think 
 about  that  do  you  think  what  you  said
[29:55] how  is  that  manipulative  how  because 
 it's 
 saying  oh  if  you  go  and  spend  time  at
[30:01] this  place  with  your  friends 
 i'm  gonna  leave  you  they  should  never  be 
 like
[30:06] it  should  never  be  you  or  that 
 they  can  coexist  like
[30:13] so  if  someone  if  that  was  someone's 
 boundary 
 and  they  did  not  want  to  be  with  someone 
 who  was  going  into  that  environment  that
[30:19] they  weren't  comfortable  with 
 what  would  the  non-manipulative  way  that 
 this  person  should  express  it  because  i
[30:25] think  i  did  it  in  a  pretty  healthy  way
[30:32] i'm  not  saying  that  you  said  it  in  a 
 nasty 
 it's  coming  across  that  way  because  like
[30:38] we've  broken  up  like 
 you're  not  exactly  going  to  talk  about 
 things  in  the  nicest  way  but  i'm  not 
 saying  that  you  said  it  in  a  nasty  way
[30:44] you  said  it  exactly  like  that  if  you  if 
 you  went  to  a  nightclub  with  your  friend 
 i'd  feel  too  anxious  so  i  break  up  with
[30:49] you 
 that  is  what  you  said  correct 
 so  that  that  is  manipulative  it's  saying
[30:57] oh  if  you  don't  behave  in  a  way  that  i 
 that  i  specifically  want  you  to  if  you 
 don't  fit  this  cookie  cutter
[31:02] then  that's  it  and  i'm  not  when  i'm 
 talking  about  this  i'm  not  talking  about
[31:08] going  to  liverpool 
 i'm  talking  about  just  nightclubs 
 specifically  which  i  don't  know  why  i'm
[31:13] focusing  on  that  because  i  don't  even 
 like  them  anyway 
 but  i  literally  don't
[31:20] i'm  confused  the  issue  isn't 
 the  issue  isn't  oh  i  so  desperately  want
[31:26] to  go  to  nightclubs  so  i  so  desperately 
 want  to  go  out  and 
 be  around  loads  of  guys  and  just  be  with
[31:31] my  friends  and  never  spend  time  with  you 
 that  isn't  the  issue  the  issue  is  that 
 you  shouldn't  tell  someone  what  they  can
[31:36] and  can't  do 
 that's  the  bottom  line  it  isn't 
 it  doesn't  matter  what  it  is  i  agree
[31:43] with  that 
 and  that  i  don't  believe  that  i've  ever 
 i  ever 
 told  you  what  you  could  or  could  not  do
[31:49] and  that's  i  think 
 by  the  way  you've  like  we've  both  just 
 admitted  that  i  said  something  as
[31:54] very  similar  to  that  if  you  go  to  those 
 places  i'll  be  too  anxious 
 i'll  be  too  like  uncomfortable  with  it
[31:59] and  so  i  wouldn't  want  to  be  with  you 
 but  that  is  healthy  boundaries
[32:04] manipulation 
 toxicity  and  like  abusiveness  is  me 
 saying  no
[32:09] if  you  go  there  i  will  break  up  with  you 
 if  you  like  you  cannot  go  no  it's  not 
 even  that  even  that  is  like
[32:14] honestly  on  the  healthier  side  it's  it's 
 if  i  said  you  cannot  you're  not  allowed 
 to  go
[32:19] that's  manipulative  that's  abusive 
 that's  toxic  if  i  said  you  are  not 
 allowed  to  go 
 as  if  i  said  that  like  you  want  to  we're
[32:25] going  to  stay  together 
 but  you're  not  allowed  to  do  this  my 
 thing  was  okay  if  that's  what  you  want
[32:30] to  do 
 then  we're  not  compatible
[32:35] that's  healthy  that  is  not  manipulative 
 like 
 i  think  like  everyone  around  you  has
[32:41] kind  of  twisted  your  mind  to  think  that 
 what  the  some  healthy  parts  of  our 
 relationship
[32:47] just  because  it  kind  of  insults 
 the  people  who  have  been  giving  you
[32:52] advice  if  for  example  your  friends  go 
 out  to  these  clubs  or  for  example  your 
 mum  likes  to  drink 
 and  her  her  response  to  this  was
[33:00] oh  hamza  is  going  to  control  you  he'll 
 never  never  let  you  out  for  a  drink 
 like  and  she  got  really  really  like 
 angry  and  like  resentful  towards  me  when
[33:06] she  heard  about  me  saying  that  oh 
 like  we're  not  going  to  be  compatible  if 
 you  go  out  to  night  clubs
[33:11] they  were  personally  getting  offended  at 
 something  i  said  without  actually  taking 
 into  account  the  fact  that  you  didn't
[33:16] even  like  to  go 
 and  you  said  it's  like  10  times  in  this 
 goal  you  didn't  even  like  to  go  there  so 
 the  fact  that  if  you  are  going
[33:21] when  you  know  of  how  worried  that  would 
 make  me  feel  because  of  experiences  i've
[33:26] had  in  nightclubs  when 
 no  matter  how  much  you  want  to  say  it 
 you  you  do  like  you  were  able  to  see  it
[33:31] from  my  point  of  view  that 
 yeah  half  of  the  girls  i've  been  with 
 have  got  boyfriends  a  girl  saying  that
[33:36] she's  got  a  boyfriend 
 it  doesn't  stop  that  type  of  guy  and  it 
 happens  only  in  nightclubs
[33:41] and  so  like  the  mindset  i've  had  for 
 years  which  i  tell  the  boys  which  tell 
 everyone  is  that
[33:46] no  girl  when  she  enters  the  nightclub 
 has  a  boyfriend 
 it's  just  they'd  love  to  think  that  they
[33:52] do  they'd  love  to  say  like  oh  no 
 i'm  just  getting  ready  to  have  fun  with 
 the  girls  but  if  the  right  guy
[33:57] approaches  her  and  he  says  the  right 
 things 
 it  there  is  no  relationship  the  girls
[34:02] will  back 
 uh  back  her  up  if  the  boyfriend's  not 
 there  it  literally  takes  like  two 
 sentences  to  get  a  girl  to  like  drop  a
[34:07] relationship  for  the  right  guy 
 and  you  can  say  oh  no  but  i'm  different
[34:12] i'm  different  to  all  the  women  you've 
 ever  experienced  in  your  life 
 and  i  don't  think  that's  exactly  like  a
[34:18] fair  statement  to  say  but  you  could  say 
 it  but  either  way 
 having  empathy  for  from  my  experiences
[34:23] and  what  i've  what  i've  felt 
 and  the  fact  that  you  didn't  even  want 
 to  go  to  clubs  you  should  instantly  be
[34:28] saying  like  yeah 
 like  i'm  not  gonna  go  then  maybe  we'll 
 go  together  i  did  say  that
[34:33] did  i  not  say  that  to  you  but  then 
 you're  literally  a  couple  days  later 
 you're  like  oh  yeah 
 so  there's  a  there's  a  club  on  21st  of
[34:40] june  that  i'm  going  to  go  to  with  my 
 friend 
 no  no  that  wasn't  that  wasn't  what 
 happened
[34:45] we  were  on  facetime  and  we  were  talking 
 about  it  and  i  said 
 i've  completely  forgotten  how  it
[34:50] reminded  me  today  like  literally  like  a 
 month  ago  we  had  this  thing  booked  when 
 everything  was  meant  to  be  open
[34:55] and  i  was  like  would  i  be  able  to  go  and 
 he  said  no
[35:00] but  it  isn't  it  isn't  even  like  i  can 
 completely  like  i  agree  with  that  like 
 some  girls
[35:05] some  guys  like  a  lot  of  people  are 
 horrible  a  lot  of  people 
 are  like  untrustworthy  like  you  should
[35:10] not  be  in  relationships  but 
 if  i  for  one  second  ever  thought  that  if
[35:15] i  were  to  go  into  an  environment  where 
 arguably  yeah 
 cheating  is  much  easier  in  nightclubs  if
[35:20] i  ever  thought  that  if  i  were  to  go  into 
 an  environment 
 and  would  cheat  on  someone  i  won't  be  in 
 a  relationship  to  start  with
[35:27] like  the  you  always  would  use  the  term 
 of  like 
 bad  patches  it  doesn't  matter
[35:34] it  literally  doesn't  matter  what  did  you 
 say  at  the  end  then  because  there  was  a 
 point  i  was  going  to  make  i  forgot  what
[35:39] it  was
[35:44] well  they  didn't  want  to  go 
 no  it's  something  that  you  said  at  the
[35:49] end  i  can't  remember  what  it  was 
 um  that  you  weren't  being  like
[35:54] empathetic  to  how  i  felt  with  my 
 experiences 
 oh  yeah  um  i
[36:01] i  can  understand  why  you  disagree  with 
 that  because  of  obviously  everything  i'm 
 saying  now 
 but  i  just  want  to  like  reiterate  my
[36:08] issue  isn't  the  fact  that  like 
 you  said  oh  i  won't  feel  comfortable  if 
 you  went  to  nightclubs  like
[36:13] it's  not  about  nightclubs  it's  just  the 
 fact  that 
 you  were  saying  like  what  i  can't  do
[36:19] anyway  what  i  forgot  what  the 
 point  even  was  i  keep  going  off  on  these 
 tangents  and  forget  what  i'm  even  saying
[36:25] what  was  it  i'm  sorry
[36:31] um  oh  yeah  i wasn't  being  empathetic  um 
 [Music] 
 do  you  like  think  that  i  wasn't  being
[36:37] empathetic  yeah  you  weren't 
 why
[36:44] i  don't  think  you  had  any  level  of 
 empathy 
 in  our  relationship  i  think  you  were
[36:50] like 
 very  very  quick  to
[36:55] drop  your  attempts  at  trying  to  make  me 
 feel  better  if  you  made  me  feel  anxious 
 if  you  made  me  feel  worried 
 i  remember  there  was  a  couple  of  times
[37:01] when  we'd  be  on  a  call  and  and 
 literally  within  30  seconds  of  you 
 trying  to  make  me  feel  better  you  just
[37:06] kind  of  shrug  your  shoulders  and  say 
 well  i  don't  know  what  i  can  do  then  i 
 don't  know  what  else  i  can  say  to  you
[37:13] these  situations  would  never  happen  on 
 calls 
 they  wouldn't  exactly  happen  on  the  call
[37:18] but  we'd  be  talking  about  it  afterwards 
 though 
 i  don't  remember  anything  ever  happening
[37:23] like  that  in  on  the  call  but  i  remember 
 it  happened  in  person 
 and  yeah  i  should  have  been  more
[37:28] empathetic 
 100  but  i  wasn't  shrugging  my  shoulders 
 and  being  like  i
[37:33] don't  know  what  to  say  now  i'll  give  up 
 don't  know  what  to say  but  i  was 
 genuinely  saying  like 
 i  like  i  don't  know  how  to  be  like  in  a
[37:40] lot  of  situations  i  didn't  know  how  to 
 reassure  you  like  i  tried 
 what  i  thought  would  work  what  would 
 work  for  me
[37:46] and  it  wouldn't  work  and  that's  i  yeah  i 
 shouldn't  have  said  that  i  agree  like  i 
 didn't  behave  in  the  best  ways  in
[37:51] our  relationship  i  think  i  don't  think 
 it's  fair  to  say  that  i  wasn't 
 empathetic  i  think 
 you  have  this  assumption  of  me  that
[37:57] actually  really  hurts  that  you  have  this 
 assumption  of  me  because  i  remember  when 
 i  came  back  to  uni
[38:02] yeah  i  messed  up  and  i  did  that  whole 
 instagram  thing  which  i  shouldn't  have 
 done  like  i  looked  through 
 um  who  you  were  following  um
[38:09] which  i  shouldn't  have  done  but  i  like  i 
 hand  in  heart  can  say  like 
 subconsciously  yeah  i  was  doing  that  out
[38:14] of  insecurity  but  i 
 genuinely  wasn't  doing  out  of  insecurity 
 like  i  was  just  messing  about  with  my
[38:19] friend  and  i  can  understand  why  that 
 comes  across 
 stupid  because  it  was  stupid  i  didn't 
 think  about  it  at  the  time  and  i  think
[38:24] you  have  this  assumption  that  my  friends 
 are  always  like 
 oh  like  backing  me  and  hating  anyone
[38:29] else  like 
 that  i'm  with  but  after  i  after  i  went 
 and  told  harry  about  that  afterwards  and
[38:34] she  was  like  eve  you  shouldn't  have  done 
 that  but  that  was  really  messed  up  you 
 shouldn't  have  done  that  and  i  was  like 
 oh  god  i  didn't  even  think  of  it
[38:40] in  a  bad  way  because  i  wasn't  doing  it 
 in  a  bad  way 
 but  i  shouldn't  have  done  that  and  it's
[38:46] like  and  my  mom  called  me  out  as  well  my 
 mom  said  you  shouldn't  have  done  that 
 and  she  said  that  to  you  when  she  spoke 
 to  you  about  it  i'm  sure
[38:54] it  was  an  interesting  conversation  i  had 
 with  your  mum  which 
 it  the  reason  i'll  tell  you  now  like
[39:00] why  i  have  like  such  a  a  negative 
 perception  of  everything  where 
 right  now  i  don't  exactly  look  back  with
[39:06] any  kind  of  positivity 
 is  because  of  how  i  feel  like  everyone
[39:12] in  your  life  was  like  two-faced  to  me 
 where  they  your  mum's  calling  me  we  have 
 an  hour  conversation  she's  saying  that
[39:17] i've  changed  your  life  i've  changed  her 
 life  i've  changed  your  sister's  life 
 i've  been  such  a  good  positive  influence
[39:22] i'm  so  good  and  amazing  and  and  i  should 
 come  around  on  saturday  when  you're  not 
 even  there  like  i  should  come  around  and 
 spend  time  with  her  and
[39:27] the  family  and  everything  and  by 
 expressing  my  one  boundaries
[39:33] everyone  changed  their  their  opinions  of 
 me 
 and  like  we  will  get  into  the  video  as
[39:39] well 
 but  that  was  the  boundaries  wasn't  what 
 changed  it  was  the  boundaries  pad  with
[39:44] the  video 
 yeah  but  like  it  was  originally  the 
 boundary  like
[39:49] me  expressing  the  fact  that  i  didn't 
 want  like  to  feel  i  don't  want  to  be 
 with  a  girl  who  was  going  to  nightclubs
[39:54] was  what  started  her  sort  of  negativity 
 of  me  where 
 she  was  giving  you  like  the  mean  girl
[39:59] attitude  and  she  was  like  not  speaking 
 to  you  and  everything  and  saying  like 
 you  shouldn't  come  speak  to  me  and 
 everything  and  that's  when  she  started
[40:04] you  know  essentially  digging  up  dirt  on 
 me 
 and  yeah  we'll  give  the  boys
[40:11] if  she's  looking  through  all  my  old 
 videos  like  pretty  much  she  was  looking 
 for  something 
 she  um  she  didn't  look  through  it  what
[40:17] happened  was  she  had  a  conversation  with 
 her  friend  cat  and  laura's  mum  and  cat
[40:22] and  laura  had  seen  the  video  before  and 
 then  they  heard  what  happened  showed  the 
 video  to  them  and  then 
 they  showed  it  someone  showed  it  to  my
[40:28] mum  wasn't  my  mom  going  digging 
 it  was  found  because  of  my  friends
[40:33] i  don't  know  if  that's  true  that's  what 
 i  thought  the  day  because  that's  what  i 
 thought  had  happened
[40:38] this  wasn't  like  my  mum  found  out  about 
 the  manipulation  video 
 days  before  we  broke  up  but  we  like  we
[40:43] weren't  speaking  i  didn't  know 
 i  had  no  idea  about  this  i  didn't  find
[40:48] out  until  after  we  broke  up 
 the  um  the  video  got  sent  by  my  woman's 
 friend  because  my  friend
[40:53] showed  it  to  them  yeah  so  for  contacts 
 for  the  context  for  the 
 viewers  who  are  watching  so  eve's  like
[40:59] family  or  friends  they  found 
 an  old  video  of  mine  which  is  how  to 
 manipulate  people  using  psychology
[41:06] and  i  mean  i'll  link  the  video  in  the
[41:11] description  in  the  comments  i'd  like  to 
 hear  everyone's  opinion  of  it  you  can 
 see 
 like  we  can  send  hundreds  of  people
[41:16] there  and  see 
 still  to  this  day  i'm  surprised  that 
 that  video  has  been  taken  negatively
[41:22] because  you  watch  it  and  almost 
 instantly  i  say  oh  by  the  way  i'm 
 literally  using  the  word  manipulation
[41:28] for  views 
 what  we're  just  going  to  talk  about  is 
 how  healthy  people  interact 
 huh  you  don't  say  that  in  the  video  yes
[41:34] i  do 
 i'll  say  it  in  the  video  and  i  also  said 
 like  it's  like  the  first 
 sentence  in  the  description  yeah  it's  in
[41:41] the  description 
 yeah  and  i  say  like  manipulation  sounds 
 bad  but  like  it  sounds  like  a  horrible
[41:46] word  what  we're  actually  doing  is  just 
 positive  reinforcement  and  this  is  how 
 healthy  people  interact  with 
 if  someone  behaves  but  you'd  like  them
[41:52] to  then  you  spend  more  time  with  them 
 that's  like  it's  okay  it's  manipulative
[41:57] in  a  certain  way  but  at  this  point 
 it's  like  the  word  manipulation  needs  to 
 needs  to  have  its  negative
[42:02] label  removed  and  just  say  like  okay 
 that's  how  humans  interact  everything  at 
 that  point  is  manipulation  if
[42:07] if  that  is  what  what  you  think 
 manipulation  is  is  that
[42:13] someone  acts  in  a  way  that  you  like  it 
 so  you  like  them  more 
 now  healthy  people  do  this  automatically
[42:18] the  reason  why  i'm  making  these  videos 
 is  because 
 these  videos  are  not  for  healthy  guys 
 they're  for  guys  who  are  trying  to  be
[42:23] healthy  but  right  now  they're  unhealthy 
 all  of  their  lives  is  spent  on  the 
 computer  screen  so  they  need  to  be
[42:29] taught  this  stuff 
 your  family  who  saw  this  and  had  a  very 
 very  negative  hostile  resentful
[42:35] vibe  to  me  because  of  this  video  they 
 did  not  once  consider  the  fact  that  i'm 
 using
[42:40] youtube  as  a  business  to  help  people  who 
 are 
 help  a  specific  type  of  person  who's
[42:45] going  to  be  attracted  to  that  type  of 
 video  that's  why  i  want  that  video  is 
 like  one  of  the  highest  views  on 
 my  channel  that  instantly  got  like  2  000
[42:51] views  because  that's  what  these  guys 
 want  to  see  they  want  to  see  a  picture 
 of  a  girl  in  the  thumbnail  they  want  to 
 see  a  guy  talking  about  getting  girls
[42:58] and  you've  you've  seen  the 
 transformation  of  the  boys  who  watch  a 
 lot  of  my  videos  seeing  the 
 transformation  where 
 i  don't  do  really  that  stuff  anymore  i'm
[43:04] not  like  a  player  anymore 
 and  so  it's  not  exactly  a  reflection  of
[43:09] me 
 it's  a  reflection  of  the  guy  i'm  trying 
 to  to  attract 
 so  that  he  can  go  through  the  same
[43:14] journey  as  i  have 
 but  you  guys  saw  it  and  you  said  okay 
 this  is  hamza  hamza  is  manipulative
[43:20] he  is  controlling  and  he  also  said  to 
 eve  that  she  shouldn't  go  to  nightclubs 
 so  he's  controlling  his  manipulative  he
[43:25] can't  be  trusted  he's  grooming 
 my  granddaughter  and  she's  not  safe  with
[43:30] him  we  can't  allow  her  to  speak  to  him 
 and  so  we're  gonna  break  up  we're  gonna 
 break  them  up
[43:36] that  was  at  least  my  perception  of  the 
 breakup  would  you  agree  with  that 
 um  to  some  extent  yeah  to  a  big  extent
[43:45] yeah 
 because  you  have  to  understand  like 
 obviously  you're  saying
[43:50] um  this  isn't  like  you 
 isn't  a  representation  of  you  it's  a
[43:55] representation  of  what  you're  trying  to 
 sell  online 
 but  you're  saying  in  the  video  this  is 
 what  i  do  you're  using  me  as  an  example
[44:01] in  that  video 
 so  of  course  my  family  gonna  see  it  as  a
[44:06] game  when  they  like  they  don't  know 
 like  youtube  is  a  business  they  don't 
 know  that  you're  doing  it
[44:11] to  attract  these  guys  to  you  know  i  mean 
 to  build  your  business  essentially 
 they've  seen  it  as  oh  they  say  he's
[44:18] talking  about  eve 
 and  saying  how  he's  managed  to 
 manipulate  her  into  buying
[44:23] food  and  going  getting  drinks  and  giving 
 her  giving  like 
 him  her  ring  and  then  using  like  my  text
[44:30] messages  and  stuff 
 paired  with  the  fact  that  i  came  back 
 for  i  came  back  to  uni  for  six  days
[44:35] i  came  back  because  you  broke  up  with  me 
 and  then  i  moved  out  of 
 in  the  space  of  this  was  all  in  the
[44:40] space  of  three  days  dropped  out  of 
 moving  to  go  and  live  with  my  best 
 friend  in  liverpool 
 i  said  i  wasn't  like  obviously  told  them
[44:47] about  the  nightclubs  and  stuff 
 but  also  another  thing  that  i  forgot  to 
 mention  is  i  remember  saying  to  you  when
[44:52] we  were  having  this  conversation  in  the 
 car 
 like  when  we  were  talking  about  the 
 boundaries  like  it  wasn't  exactly  said
[44:57] like  oh  if  you  do 
 x  i  will  break  up  with  you  but  that  it 
 was  it 
 that  is  what  you  were  saying  whether  you
[45:02] said  it  that  in  that  exact  sentence  that 
 is  what  you  were  saying
[45:07] another  thing  was  i  remember  i  said  to 
 you  um 
 i  don't  know  if  you  remember  talking
[45:12] about  my  friend  daisy  who  lives  in 
 london 
 um  i  remember  i  said  to  you  oh  like  i
[45:17] barely  ever  see  her  like 
 would  it  be  like  just  like  speaking 
 hypothetically  like  sometime  in  the
[45:22] future  would  it  be  okay 
 for  me  to  go  and  visit  her  and  you  were 
 like  that  won't  make  me  feel  comf  that
[45:27] would  make  me  feel  anxious 
 so  no  i'd  probably  end  up  leaving
[45:35] your  perception  of  these  things  is 
 completely  off  when  you  said  that 
 i  told  you  that  i'd  feel  anxious  about
[45:41] of  course  i  would  that  was  it 
 i  didn't  one  say  oh  if  you  go  if  you  go 
 see  your  friend  then  i'm  gonna  like
[45:46] you  you  think  you've  been  convinced  that 
 i'm  manipulative  everyone  around  you  has 
 has  fed  this  into  you  you  saw  that  video
[45:52] yourself  be  like  months  before  everyone 
 else  and  you  literally  just  watched  it 
 with  me  as  if  it  was  nothing
[45:57] and  everyone  has  kind  of  like  maybe 
 kind  of  insulting  you  but  like  with  the
[46:02] shapeshifter  kind  of  personality  that 
 said  do  you  probably  do  have 
 you've  now  believed  this  stuff  and  so
[46:08] you've  gotten  a 
 far  far  negative  more  hostile  view  of 
 all  of  our  interactions  because  that  is
[46:13] not  how  it  went 
 whatsoever  you  mentioned  that  in  passing 
 and  i  said
[46:18] yeah  it  would  i  like  i  would  probably 
 feel  pretty  anxious  with  it  that  was  it 
 i  didn't  like  everything  just  stops 
 talking  i  was  like  no  no  if  you  do  that
[46:24] like  i'll  break  up  with  you 
 it  didn't  know  you  didn't  say  it  like  i 
 never  i  never  said  that  you  said  it  like
[46:29] oh  i'd  break  up  with  you  you  said  no  i 
 feel  so  anxious 
 yeah  but  that's  that's  which  in  my  my
[46:34] head  i  can't  remember  whether  you  said 
 i'd  leave  or  not  you  probably  didn't 
 need  to  be  fair 
 but  in  my  head  me  thinking  oh  he  said
[46:42] he'd  feel  anxious  if  i  went  to  a 
 nightclub  so  he  would  leave  me 
 so  i'm  thinking  in  my  head  oh  he  said  it
[46:47] means  that  he's  anxious  so  that  means 
 he's  going  to  leave  me 
 so  i  it's  not  like  a  fair  thought  though
[46:53] that's  not  like 
 you  can't  exactly  it's  not  but  that's 
 the  way  you  feel
[46:59] that's  the  way  you  made  me  feel  but 
 anyway  back  to  like  the  video 
 you  have  to  think  like  all  the  big
[47:05] changes  that  i 
 made  in  the  space  of  a  few  days  that 
 came  home  from  uni 
 um  said  about  liverpool
[47:12] um  and  then  my  family  saw  this  video 
 where  you're  saying  like 
 oh  like  women  buy  me  like  they  buy  me
[47:18] things  like  they  do  like  the  manual 
 labor  of 
 like  my  work  of  my  job  like  they  come
[47:24] and  see  me  like  and  all  this 
 of  course  they're  gonna  think  that 
 you're  doing  this  as  a  game  and  that
[47:29] this  is  all  so  big 
 but  i  don't  think  it  was  a  game  like  we 
 didn't  mean  to  end  up  in  a  relationship
[47:34] it  just  happened  like  i  know  for  a  fact 
 it  wasn't  a  game  i  don't  think  it  was  in 
 genuine  at  all
[47:39] i  feel  like  you  you  believe  that  i  think 
 it  was  in  genuine 
 is  that  true  no  so  why  did  you  ask  me  if
[47:45] i  was  manipulating  you  then 
 when  did  i  ask  you  if  you  manipulated  me
[47:50] when  your  family  had  an  intervention 
 with  you  and  then  i  facetimed  you 
 and  your  grandfather  all  um  answered  the
[47:56] call 
 and  your  whole  family  is  like  literally 
 swearing  at  me  shouting  across  the
[48:01] street  it doesn't  sweat 
 the  word  he  doesn't  swear  i  can  still 
 remember  like  see
[48:06] the  disrespectful  faces  of  the  people 
 who  had  literally  just  smiled  at  me  and 
 said  like  how  much  i've  transformed  your
[48:11] life 
 and  your  grandparents  got  calling  me  a 
 [ __ ]  your  grandma's  like  climbing  over 
 the  table  like  screeching  like  break  up
[48:17] with  them  you've  just  ended  none  of  this 
 happened 
 on  the  call  that  i  was  in  maybe  in  the 
 calls  that  you  and  my  granddad  had  when
[48:22] i  was  in  the  room  i 
 i  heard  that  you  were  just  sat  on  the 
 kitchen  table  because  then  he  turned  it 
 around  it  and
[48:28] it  was  you  and  it  was  like  we  went  from 
 just 
 me  and  you  versus  the  world  kind  of  vibe
[48:34] to  you  just 
 automatically  believe  in  what  they  had 
 said  where  i  smiled  and  i  said  to  you
[48:40] like  oh  hi 
 and  you  literally  just  started  like  you 
 went  aggressive  on  me  out  of  nowhere  i
[48:45] mean  you  were  good  literally  a  couple 
 hours  ago  and  you  went  aggressive  and 
 you're  like 
 this  isn't  a  time  to  smile  i'm  just  like 
 were  you  manipulating  me  like  were  you
[48:51] manipulating  me  i  wasn't 
 i  was  not  aggressive  i  was  literally  in 
 tears  i  could  be
[48:56] like  that  was  literally  like  like  i 
 can't  even  remember  a  lot  of 
 that  conversation  because  it's  just  like
[49:02] i  mean  you  saw  me 
 i  was  in  a  mess  but  when  i  was  sat  at 
 the  table  with  my  family
[49:07] when  all  that  was  happening  like  behind 
 the  scenes  when  you  didn't  see  the  calls 
 like  i'm  i  was  defending  you  to  them
[49:15] you  probably  won't  believe  that  because 
 of  everything  i've  said  in  this  but  i 
 was  literally  defending  you  i'm  going 
 in  this  video  because  yeah  the
[49:21] manipulation  video  that  is  how  normal 
 people  interact 
 it's  like  if  the  same  thing  had  happened
[49:26] with  that  text  conversation 
 and  it  was  the  other  way  around  i 
 wouldn't  have  replied  to  you  like 
 that  is  just  how  people  interact  but
[49:32] it's  the  way  you're  explaining  it  in  the 
 video 
 and  i'm  sat  there  and  i'm  saying  this  to 
 them  and  i'm  going  like  no  but  this
[49:37] isn't 
 like  this  is  just  how  people  act  like 
 this  is  how  people  are  in  dating  now 
 like  in  like  [ __ ]  2021.
[49:44] so  i  was  i  was  literally  sat  there 
 defending  you  at  that  table
[49:49] you  didn't  know  that  because  obviously 
 you  weren't  there  like  i  can't  blame  you 
 for  not  knowing  that 
 i  can't  blame  you  for  like  i've  always
[49:54] said  this  like  since  the  breakup  like 
 i  can't  blame  you  for  not  knowing  how  i 
 feel  because  i  never
[49:59] really  gave  you  that  chance 
 to  know  how  i  felt
[50:07] i  think  that  you  have  i  think  that  you 
 have  a  much  more  negative  perception  of
[50:12] what  my  perception  is 
 what  is  your  perception  if  you  have  if
[50:19] you  look  back 
 over  the  no  no  not  not  right  now  but 
 let's  say  over  the  last  week  or  so
[50:25] when  you  randomly  get  thoughts  of  me  in 
 the  relationship 
 what  kind  of  thoughts  are  they
[50:32] um 
 go  down  bad
[50:40] generally  like 
 i  it's  hard  to  put  into  words
[50:48] i  think  like  i  don't  believe  i  think 
 you're  a  bad  person 
 at  all  like  i  don't  think  that  like  you
[50:54] you  treated  me  very  well  in  our 
 relationship  like  i've 
 always  said  that  like  i've  listened  like 
 even  after  we've  broken  up  when  i've
[50:59] spoken  back  to  people  i've  said  like 
 i  i  can  say  he  did  treat  me  well  like  he
[51:04] did 
 but  i  just  think  that  you  have 
 i  think  in  in  terms  of  a  lot  of
[51:11] relationship  stuff  we  have  very 
 different  mindsets 
 um  yeah  agreed
[51:17] so  when  i  when  i  have  these  thoughts  i 
 get  up 
 like  i  get  upset  of  course  because  i'm
[51:23] upset  like  it  ended  like  this  because  i 
 like  we  did  end  because  of  like  your 
 boundaries
[51:29] on  my  part  um 
 but  i  do  like  i  do  have  a  lot  of
[51:34] reference 
 what  did  you  mean  by  what  you  just  said 
 then  we  ended  because  of  my  boundaries
[51:40] on  your  part 
 yeah  on  my  like  on  my  part  like  from  my
[51:46] view 
 on  my  like  reason  why  we  ended  because 
 it's  like  a  weird  breakup  like  we  never
[51:51] really  spoke  about  anything  it's  like 
 we  went  on  this  facetime  call  and  it's 
 like  i  can't  even  remember  like
[51:57] who  broke  up  with  who  but  like  we  both 
 knew  that  we  were  like  breaking  up  with 
 each  other 
 it  was  like  a  i  feel  like  it  was  a  very
[52:03] unmutual  thing 
 um  what  was  the  question  again
[52:10] our  our  perception  on  the  breakup
[52:17] yeah  mine  was  because 
 i  realized  like  after  seeing  the  like
[52:23] after  seeing  the  manipulation  video  in  a 
 different  light  because  obviously  i 
 when  i  saw  it  i  saw  it  like  i  was  like  i
[52:28] feel  like  what  the  [ __ ]  for  i  saw  it  in 
 a  more  positive  way  because  i  was 
 obviously  with  people  then  when  i  was 
 kind  of
[52:33] partially  taken  out  of  the  situation  and 
 saw  saw  it  from  a  different  light  and 
 then  paired  with  everything  else  i  was
[52:38] like  wait 
 but  there's  a  lot  of  um  there's  a lot  of 
 other  things 
 like  not  things  that  happened  but  things
[52:44] that  were  said  throughout  our 
 relationship  that 
 like  i  kind  of  blocked  out  at  the  time
[52:49] and  then  when  like  we've  broken  up  and 
 i'm  like  [ __ ]  wait  this  none  of  this  was 
 okay
[52:54] am  i  well  um 
 i'm  gonna  move  back  just  because  my 
 back's  hurting  from  saying  i'm  obviously
[53:12] sucks 
 so  i'm  just  getting  comfy
[53:18] um
[53:24] and  it's  just  like  a  few  things  that  you
[53:29] said 
 um  so  like
[53:35] like  throughout  our  relationship 
 obviously  you 
 said  like  my  insecurity
[53:42] is  your  responsibility  which  to  some 
 extent  it  is 
 um  but  then  you  also  said  things  that
[53:48] like 
 very  much  contradicted  that  so 
 i  remember  when  you  said  to  me  this
[53:55] wasn't  when  we  were  just  like  seeing 
 each  other  this  was  when  i  don't  think 
 we  were  in  a  relationship  at  this  point 
 but  i  think  this  is  when  we  both
[54:00] stopped  like  seeing  other  people  and 
 when  you  said  to  me  that  you  would 
 i  can't  even  remember  what  the  context
[54:06] it  was  said  in 
 um  but  i  remember  you  saying  that  you'd 
 have  sex  with  my  auntie
[54:13] and  i remember  you  saying  that  if  we 
 weren't  in  like 
 we  weren't  in  a  relationship  at  this
[54:18] point  but  we  weren't  not  in  a 
 relationship  i  can't  remember  like  when 
 we  were  like  exclusive  or  whatever  the
[54:23] hell  that  means 
 um  i  remember  that  really  upset  me  at 
 the  time  and  i  remember  thinking  like
[54:29] why  did  you  say  that  like  it  wasn't 
 exactly  necessary  and  also  another  thing
[54:35] when  you  would  say 
 that  your  love  is  conditional  and  that 
 all  it  would  take  is  a  conversation  with
[54:40] your  ex 
 for  you  to  get  feelings  with  them  again 
 um
[54:45] and  it's  like  yeah  like  it's  not  that 
 big  of  a  deal  to  say  things  like  that
[54:50] but  also  it's 
 you  saying  that  i  should  be  aware  of 
 your  insecurities  and
[54:55] i  was  very  i  can't  what  the  word  was 
 that  you  used  but  i  wasn't  empathetic
[55:00] towards  you  and  your  insecurities  in 
 terms  of  me  saying  that  it  wasn't 
 fair  for  you  to  say  that  you  would  break
[55:06] up  me  if  i  went  to  a  nightclub 
 but  then  you  played  on  my  insecurities
[55:13] i  think  it's  very  hypocritical  for  you 
 to  say  that  i  wasn't  empathetic  towards 
 you  when  you  literally  said  to  me  hamza
[55:19] that  you  would  have  sex  with  my  auntie 
 that  like  there's  no  context  for  that  to
[55:24] ever  come  up  in  conversation  and  the 
 next  and  then  the  next  time  my  auntie 
 came  over  you  went  and  gave  her  a  hug
[55:30] i  remember  you  turned  around  and  said  to 
 me  sorry  i'm  getting  upset
[55:36] um 
 yeah  and  you  you  gave  her  a  hug
[55:44] i  mean  i remember  you  turned  around  and 
 said  to  me  afterwards  i  can't  remember 
 exactly  what  you  said  but  you  were  like
[55:49] oh  you're  getting  anxious  i  was  like  no 
 no  i  wasn't  before  but  i  am  now
[55:54] and  you  said  about  the  auntie  thing  you 
 were  like  oh  like  if  we  were  still 
 seeing  each  other  like  i'd  try  and  make
[55:59] it  happen  like  i  could  see  it  happening 
 like  who  says  that  to  my  girlfriend
[56:09] i'm  sorry  i  don't  want  to  get  upset  but
[56:14] i'm  sorry  but  you  can't  sit  here  and  say 
 that  i  was  unsympathetic  towards  you  and
[56:20] your  insecurities  when  you  were  saying 
 things  like  that  to  me
[56:27] that  was  disrespectful  i'm  sorry  for 
 saying  that
[56:35] thanks  for  apologizing
[57:10] um  but  yeah 
 i  just  feel  like  you  did  really  play  on
[57:16] my  insecurities 
 i  felt  i've  constantly  felt  um
[57:21] scared  that  you  were  gonna  leave  me  like 
 all  the  time 
 especially  towards  the  end  the  last  few
[57:28] weeks  like 
 i  mean  obviously  you  saw  me  like  i  was 
 just  crying  all  the  time  like  i  wasn't 
 doing  well  at  all
[57:35] um  and  it's  like 
 i  don't  know  i  was  just  i  just  felt  like
[57:41] i  was  walking  on  eggshells  a  lot  of  the 
 time 
 because  i  was  just  so  so  scared  of  you
[57:47] leaving  me 
 [Music] 
 and  i  think  you  did  play  on  that  because
[57:52] you  knew  that 
 it's  not  the  right  word  to  use  it  wasn't 
 play  it  wasn't
[57:58] yeah  maybe  that's  not  the  right  one  yeah 
 because  that's  like  assuming  that  i  was 
 playing  a  game  or  something  that  i
[58:03] wasn't  being  hurt  through  all  this  time 
 and  that  wasn't  like 
 feeling  the  yeah  the  pace  like  we
[58:08] connected  and  we  we  got  so  attached  that 
 you  experiencing  pain  was  painful  for  me
[58:14] and  i  need  you  to  know  that  because  i 
 think  you  have  a  perception  of  like
[58:19] i  wanted  you  to  like  feel  bad  for  this 
 stuff  anytime  you  felt  bad  like  i  felt 
 bad  too
[58:24] and  that  was  the  issue  that  we  both  just 
 would  get  into  this  like 
 very  very  negative  hurtful  cycle
[58:30] and 
 i  agree  with  you  like  honestly  almost
[58:37] not  not  throughout  the  relationship  but 
 at  least  for  like  the  second  half  of  it 
 i  was  i  kept  on  said
[58:42] like  telling  you  like  i  was  on  the  line 
 of  like  not  wanting  to  be  with  you 
 and  looking  back  at  it  now  i  realize
[58:48] it's  because  we  should  have 
 we  were  never  compatible  for  a  long-term 
 relationship  like  we  were  very  very
[58:54] compatible  in  terms  of 
 like  friends  with  benefit  in  terms  of 
 like  just  connecting  with  each  other  but
[58:59] i  think  that 
 the  foundation  a  friend  that  i  spoke  to
[59:04] said  it  perfectly  for  me  like  i  had  this 
 feeling  throughout  our  entire 
 relationship  but  i  wasn't  able  to  put  it
[59:09] into  words  up  until  he  said  it  and  he 
 said  that 
 what  you've  built  is  is  great  but  the 
 foundation  was  always  weak
[59:16] and  that's  what  it  was  it  was  you  as  a 
 person  was  not 
 the  type  of  person  that  not  the  type  of
[59:22] girl  that  i  wanted  to  have  as  my 
 girlfriend 
 that  when  we  were  just  kind  of  casually 
 seeing  each  other  when  you  tell  me  about
[59:28] like  stuff  that  you  were  doing 
 in  my  mind  i'd  just  be  like  silently 
 judging  you  thinking  like  yes
[59:33] don't  get  feelings  for  hamza  don't  be 
 dick  don't  don't  get  feelings  for  this 
 girl  but  she's  a  thoughtless  say  the 
 exact  same  thing  about  you
[59:43] friends  with  benefits  potential  we  were 
 like  what  is  that  and  i  think 
 getting  feelings  for  each  other  just
[59:49] kind  of  like  i  would  and  i  can't  even 
 say  that  because  honestly  like  the  best 
 part  came  once  we  got  feelings  for  each
[59:54] other  because  we  connected  so  well  and 
 we  had 
 like  such  a  great  strong  connection  that 
 i'd  never  felt  before
[60:00] that  was  the  best  part  and  then  of 
 course  it  kind  of 
 slingshotted  to  the  worst  part  that  now
[60:05] because  we've  got  that  great  connection 
 we've  got  so  much  to  lose  and  now  we're 
 just  like 
 at  least  i  was  like  so  anxious  of  losing
[60:12] it
[60:17] through  our  time  together  especially 
 like  before  we  got  into  a  relationship  i 
 was  thinking  that
[60:23] like  i  i  didn't  plan  it  but  i  saw  the 
 the  trajectory  of  our  time  together  that
[60:28] it  would  be  that  we'd  be  somewhat  just 
 doing  the  same  thing  for  a  while  just 
 being  would  stay  single  but  we'd  keep
[60:33] seeing  each  other  every  now  and  then 
 and  then  once  you  finish  uni  and  you 
 matured  a  bit  then  we'd  probably  get
[60:39] into  a  relationship  then  when  you  were 
 like 
 22  23  and  i  think  that  would  have  been
[60:44] like  the  better  case  scenario  because 
 i  did  i  did  my  growing  up  over  the  last 
 year  and
[60:50] to  see  someone  like  who  does  like 
 normal  people  stuff  is  weird  for  me
[60:56] because  i'm  not  normal  anymore 
 like  i'm  very  abnormal  and  i  think 
 although  we  were  compatible  in  terms  of
[61:02] like 
 our  sort  of  companionship  we  weren't 
 compatible  in  terms  of  our  the  habits
[61:08] and  the  people  we  surround  ourselves 
 with 
 and  that  always  used  to  just  scare  me
[61:13] and 
 to  think  that  in  my  opinion  almost 
 everyone  around  you  was  like  a  negative
[61:18] influence 
 even  though  it's  hard  for  me  to  explain 
 why  that  was
[61:24] i  think  maybe  i've  got  the  ego  the  bias 
 to  think  that  good  influence  on  you 
 would  be  the  things  that  i  was  doing
[61:29] which  was  like  getting  you  away  from 
 like  the  bad  habits 
 whereas  we  could  argue  that  the  bad 
 habit  is  like  good  for  you  if  you  wanted
[61:35] to  do  them 
 but  objectively  we  could  say  that
[61:40] for  example  going  on  social  media  going 
 out  drinking  is  like  somewhat  of  a  bad 
 habit  whereas 
 objectively  everyone  agrees  like
[61:46] meditating  and  getting  our  self 
 improvement  is  a  good  habit 
 and  so  i  felt  like  it  was  me  against 
 your  entire  social  circle  it  was  me
[61:52] trying  like  and  i  was  winning  i'm  not 
 gonna  lie 
 that  was  the  thing  it  was  like  everyone 
 was  pulling  you  away  from  the
[61:58] like  i  was  pulling  you  away  from  the  bad 
 habits 
 and  like  your  mum  said  this  you've  said
[62:04] this  a lot  of  times 
 even  in  this  course  that  i  was  a  very 
 positive  influence  on  you
[62:10] and  i  don't  feel  the  same 
 about  you  on  me  like  i  wrote  this  on
[62:17] like  one  of  the  love  letters  that  like 
 the  last  love  letter  that  i  sent  you 
 where  you  and  your  family  got  better
[62:24] because  of  me  but  i  only  got  worse 
 like  i  i  took  that  sacrifice  to  be  with 
 you
[62:29] i  didn't  voice  like  how  did  you  how  did 
 you  get  worse
[62:36] like  the  [ __ ]  we  were  going  through  was 
 a  lot  of  it  was  unnecessary 
 and  a  lot  of  it  if  for  example
[62:43] like  bad  guy  good  guy  but  if  you  had  to 
 say  that  if  like  you  were  a  bad  guy  in  a 
 situation
[62:48] it  was  like  just  because  you'd 
 emotionally  react  to  it  and  start  crying 
 because  i  was  upset  with  you  and  i  you 
 know  i'm  not  replying  to  for  example
[62:53] because  i  don't  want  to  speak  to  you 
 right  now  i've  lost  attraction  in  you 
 and  stuff 
 then  you're  crying  and  okay  i'm  the  bad
[62:58] guy  now  now  i've 
 made  you  cry  now  that's  how  it  is  i 
 don't  think  that  i  don't  think  that's
[63:03] true 
 like  if  i 
 like  if  i  start  crying  that's  just  like
[63:09] you  know  i'm  emotional  i  just  react  to 
 things  like  that  but  that  isn't  me 
 automatically  becoming
[63:14] the  person  who's  in  the  right  but  what's 
 this  like  i  can't 
 like  what's  a  situation  where  that  kind
[63:20] of  thing  happened 
 where  you  were  like  oh  i'm  not  speaking 
 to  you
[63:27] it  was  a  few  like
[63:32] but  when  you  went  to  your  uni  house  and 
 then 
 the  social  media  ship  that  was  like  the
[63:38] first  big  one  and  then  after  that  it  was 
 like 
 yeah  i  remember  being  like  a  week  or  two
[63:44] where 
 it  was  just  kind  of  like  negativity 
 almost  every  single  like  we'd  be  like 
 fully  in  love  with  each  other  we're 
 spending  all  day  on  facetime  like
[63:50] literally  24  7  like  you're  watching  me 
 have  a  poop  like 
 seven  times  a  day  and  then  the  next  day
[63:55] we're  like 
 i'm  back  to  thinking  like  this  is  this
[64:00] is  horrible  for  me  like  this 
 like  my  life  was  actually  better  before 
 this  like  before  we  actually  got  serious
[64:06] like 
 yeah  i  used  to  think  that  as  well  i  used
[64:11] to 
 because  like  we  obviously  weren't  in  a 
 relationship  for  a  very  long  time  we 
 were  literally  in  a  relationship  for
[64:17] like 
 how  long  was  it  i  think  it  was  that  long
[64:22] i  think 
 it was  like  three  weeks  literally
[64:35] [Laughter]
[64:52] yeah  three  weeks 
 i  felt  longer  than  that  like  i  felt  like
[64:58] it's  weird  like  we  we  got 
 so  attached  to  each  other  so  quickly  i
[65:04] think  we  already  had  like 
 a  good  level  of  connection  and  a  good 
 compatible  personality
[65:10] but  the  moment  that  we  actually  became 
 exclusive  and 
 we  just  kind  of  suddenly  fell  in  love
[65:15] with  each  other  and  we  became  like  so  so 
 attached  to  each  other  that 
 our  relationship  was  just  very  very
[65:22] like  it  was  just  like  very  intense  very 
 quickly  yeah
[65:27] that  was  it  it  went  from  like  nothing  to 
 like 
 100  and  then  zero  yeah
[65:34] space
[65:40] it  was  longer  than  that  because  we  were 
 exclusive  for  a  while  before  we  were 
 in  a  relationship  like  six  weeks
[65:47] well  it would  take  most  couples 
 literally  like  their  three  to  five  year 
 relationship  where  they  have  the 
 honeymoon  period  and  then  they  start
[65:52] like  hating  each  other  and  then  they 
 eventually  break  up 
 we  did  that  in  like  six  weeks  so  we  beat 
 the  high  school
[65:57] good  job
[66:05] oh  that's  it  yeah  it's  [ __ ] 
 oh  is  it  there's  a  video  that  i  haven't
[66:11] released 
 that  it  was  on  like  the  list  for  the 
 video  editor  sam  to  edit
[66:17] and  then  i  just  took  it  off  because  i  we 
 watched  it  and  just  made  me  really  sad 
 where
[66:22] it  was  titled  like  why  you  should  care 
 and  i  was  saying  like  oh  you  know 
 jeffrey  doesn't  doesn't  want  to  care
[66:28] like  he  searches  for  advice  on  how  not 
 to  care  what  people  think 
 and  i  said  that  oh  no  like  caring  what 
 other  people  think  is  actually  like
[66:34] the  big  alpha  male  trait  because  the 
 alpha  male  of  like  a  tribe 
 cares  the  most  and  i  said  that  caring
[66:40] has  got  me  this  business 
 and  you  know  i  went  into  like  detail  i 
 went  into  like  unfiltered  talk  and  i  was
[66:46] talking  about  our  relationship  and 
 that's  the  one  where  i  went  like  really 
 into  detail  with  a  bunch  of  our  stuff
[66:51] this  was  like  before  we  broke  up  so  we 
 were  still  like  fully  together  and  i 
 keep  calling  you  like 
 baby  girl  and  everything  i'm  talking
[66:57] about  like 
 the  secret  handshake  and  like  connecting
[67:02] with  you  forgot  about  that
[67:18] you  still  love  me 
 you  still  love  me
[67:25] i  don't  know  um 
 you  still  love  me
[67:37] it's  like 
 it's  the  i'm  not  in  love  with  you
[67:44] it's  almost  like  i'm  not  allowing  myself 
 to  because  it  would  it 
 it's  not  practical  it's  not  like
[67:50] you  know  why  would  you  like  turn  it  on 
 right  now  it  feels  like  something  that 
 we  could  allow  it  to  turn  on
[67:58] yeah  but  we're  just  not  letting  it  yeah 
 it's  kind  of  like  it's  almost  like
[68:04] binary 
 and  then  it's  like  a  percentage  where
[68:09] it's  like  you'll  meet  people 
 eventually  it  clicks  and  it's  like  okay 
 this  is  the  person  that  you  love
[68:14] and  then  from  that  point  it's  like  the 
 percentage  and  right  now  it's  like  we're 
 already  in  in  the  love 
 i  don't  think  you  can  ever  come  out  of
[68:19] that  binary  like  we're  on  the  one  like 
 we're  on 
 love  but  it's  like  been  dialed  down  to
[68:25] like  one  percent  where  we  can't  exactly 
 feel  it  because 
 our  mind  and  our  body  our  chakras  or
[68:31] something  has  has 
 dialed  it  down  so  we  don't  get  hurt 
 like  it  doesn't  meet  the  circumstances
[68:37] of  our  lives  right  now  so  it's  just  not 
 yeah  this  is  what  i  know  it  hurt  you  but
[68:42] this  is  what  i  meant  when  i  said  that 
 like  one  conversation  with  like  my  ex 
 could  turn  like  i  could  i  could  be  in
[68:48] love  with 
 them  again  i  could  be  yeah  i  could  be  in 
 love  because 
 the  right  conversation  would  you  and
[68:54] both  of  us  would  be  back  at  100 
 and  i  think  yeah
[68:59] i  think  that's  true  and  so  when  i  when  i 
 said  that  about  my  ex  i  didn't  mean  so
[69:04] obviously  like  scare  you 
 or  or  make  you  feel  negative  is  more
[69:09] that 
 i  was  still  trying  to  discover  my  own 
 meaning  and  my  own  version  of  love
[69:16] yeah  of  course  and  i  think  i  don't  want 
 to  lie  to  you 
 yeah  when  i'm  saying  these  things  like
[69:22] um 
 like  what  i  said  before  about  like  oh 
 when  you  said  your  love  is
[69:27] conditional  and  think  about  your  ex  um 
 i  didn't  i  don't  think  that  apart  from
[69:32] the  anti  thing  because  i  can't  really 
 think  that  you  would  say  that  without 
 thinking  it  wouldn't  hurt  me  especially
[69:38] like  you  know  my  insecurities  were  at 
 that  point  we'd  like  been  through  all 
 this  like  we  were  pretty  much  together
[69:43] um  but  i  don't  think  you  said  these 
 things  to  hurt  me  i  didn't  believe  that
[69:48] you  did  any  of  these  things  to  hurt  me 
 like  when  you  were  controlling  i  don't
[69:53] think  you  were  doing  that  to  hurt  me 
 i  i  know  i  don't  think  i  know  that  you
[69:58] were  doing  it  because 
 you  wanted  what  was  best  for  me  but 
 you  can't  you  can't  take  what  you  think
[70:05] is  best  for  someone 
 and  tell  them  what  they  can  and  can't  do 
 based  on  that  like  look  i'll  give  you  an
[70:10] example  okay  so 
 my  ex-boyfriend  um  obviously  we  were
[70:15] together  when  i  went  to  uni 
 um  he  was  cheated  on  she  probably
[70:20] shouldn't  be  saying  this 
 but  he  was  cheated  on  um  by  his  ex
[70:25] and  they  she  is  i  think  she's  still  in  a 
 relationship  with  that  guy  now
[70:31] and  when  i  was  going  to  uni  obviously 
 tom  was  anxious  about  me  going  and  being
[70:37] a  part  of  your  lifestyle 
 in  first  year  of  course  you're  going  to 
 think  that  when  i'm  in  first  year 
 um  i  didn't  get  into  the  uni  that  i
[70:43] wanted  to  so  i  went  through  clearing 
 i  got  into  leeds  beckett  sheffield
[70:48] hallam  and  then  i  got  into  york 
 so  obviously  york's  the  best  out  of  all 
 of  them  it's  like  a  brussels  group  uni
[70:54] and  i  really  i  really  really  didn't  want 
 to  come  to  york  but  he  was  like  pushing 
 me  and  saying  like 
 come  on  like  you  should  go  to  york  like
[71:00] this  is  the  best  uni  like  for  your 
 degree  which  it  was  in  the  country  at 
 the  time
[71:05] um  but  even  though  he  was  going  to  be 
 anxious  about  that  i  was  going  to  be 
 putting  myself 
 in  a  situation  where  he  was  going  to  be
[71:11] anxious  he  pushed  me 
 into  doing  it  he  pushed  me  into  going  to 
 the  uni  that  was  the  furthest  away  from
[71:17] him 
 because  he  wanted  what  was  best  for  me 
 you  don't  tell  people  what  they  can  and
[71:22] can't  do  because  you  think  that's  what's 
 best  for  them 
 you  feel  like  going  to  nightclubs  is  the
[71:27] best  for  you 
 no  of  course  not
[71:32] [Music] 
 so  but  it's  not  nightclubs  isn't  a  lot
[71:37] the  point  you  just  made  is  that  he  did 
 something  good  which  was  he 
 he  he  was  anxious  and  he  pushed  you  to
[71:42] do  something  good  like  something 
 positive 
 i  mean  like  moving  to  liverpool  i'm
[71:47] talking  about  liverpool  in  this 
 situation  what  would  you  say  that  that's 
 that's  positive  um
[71:54] what  pushing  me  into  living  there  or  not 
 not  living  there  i  think  there's
[72:02] positives  and  negatives  for  both
[72:16] i  don't  think  that  you  ever  did  any  of 
 these  things  to  hurt  me  like 
 i  do  think  he  played  games  but  i  don't
[72:21] think  it  was  a  big  game  to  like  make 
 me  fall  in  love  with  you  that  wasn't  the
[72:26] plan 
 i  mean  like  we  were  seeing  each  other 
 for  like  eight  months  before  we  even  got 
 into  a  relationship
[72:31] hmm  what  games  do  you  think  i  played
[72:37] i  think  you  just  kind  of  i  don't  know  if 
 you  did  it  subconsciously  or  not  like  i
[72:42] don't  think  you  played  games  actively  if 
 that  makes  sense 
 um  i  just  think  you  kind  of  tried  to
[72:48] like  keep  me  on  my  toes 
 and  stuff  i  feel  like  you  knew  how 
 scared  i  was  for  you  to  leave  me
[72:55] and  you  did  play  on  that  by  constantly 
 saying  like  literally  every  day  you'd  be 
 like  oh  i'm  online  and
[73:00] i  remember  when  i  was  here  and  we  were 
 talking  about  you  coming  to  visit 
 me  and  one  day  on  facetime  you'd  be  like
[73:06] oh  like  don't  not  let  me  come  like  make 
 sure  i  come  like  we're  gonna  have  such  a 
 nice  time  and  all  this
[73:11] and  then  you  were  like  oh  like  look  at 
 train  times  and  i'll  book  it  tonight  and 
 then  we  got  onto  a  facetime  and  you're
[73:16] like  oh  i  don't  know 
 back  coast  the  land  again  and  it  was 
 like  this  like  every  single  day  i  was  in 
 york  but 
 one  day  you're  like  oh  yeah  i'll
[73:21] definitely  come  like  don't  let  me  not 
 come 
 and  the  next  day  you're  like  i'm  too 
 close  like  oh  no  i  can't  even  see  us
[73:26] being  together  on  the  19th  which  i  mean 
 you're  right  so  well  done  but  um
[73:34] yeah  i  think  it's  just 
 i  don't  know  if  you  i  think  it  was
[73:39] probably  subconscious  but  i  do  think 
 that  you 
 were  aware  of  how  scared  i  was  for  you 
 to  leave  me  and  i  think  you  did
[73:45] you  did  play  on  it  because  you  can't  you 
 can't  have  not  been 
 when  you  were  saying  the  things  that  you
[73:50] were  saying  and  i  was  feeling  the  things 
 that  i  was  feeling 
 it  wasn't
[73:57] when  i  was  saying  that  stuff  it  was 
 because  we  we  had  a  very  very  honest  and
[74:02] and  open  relationship  we  didn't  hide 
 because  we  had  done  saying  this  to  each
[74:07] other  that  these  were  like  the 
 uncomfortable  conversations  that  most 
 people  would  just  keep  to  themselves  if 
 they  had  this  thought  of  like  oh
[74:13] i  don't  really  feel  so  confident  in  our 
 relationship  and  stuff  that  they'd  keep 
 it  to  themselves  and  then  they'd  kind  of 
 stay  together  for  a  longer  period  of
[74:18] time  but 
 it'd  be  unideal  we  never  did  that  like  i
[74:23] we  both  made  it  like  such  a  such  a  big 
 intention  to  like  just 
 fully  say  what  was  on  our  mind  that  was
[74:29] me  saying  it  wasn't  me  saying  it  and 
 like  oh 
 i  bet  this  is  gonna  hurt  her  but  this  is 
 gonna  make  her  anxious  because  i  didn't
[74:34] want  that  effect 
 but  it  was  more  so  me  saying  it  because 
 i  was  hoping  that  you'd  just  be  able  to
[74:39] kind  of  say  the  right  things  to  me  and 
 say  that  you  know  you  cared  about  me  you 
 wanted  to  be  with  me  and  that  you  could 
 see  us  together  that
[74:44] would  warm  me  up  to  to  it  as  well 
 but  this  is  what  i  mean  this  is  when  i
[74:49] said  like  i  didn't  think  you  had 
 any  empathy  because  i  would  say  this  a 
 lot  of  the  times  and  i  don't  remember  a
[74:54] single  time  that  i  would  say 
 something  like  this  like  essentially  i 
 was  saying  i  don't  feel  confident  in  our
[74:59] relationship  right  now  because 
 of  whatever  i  don't  remember  a  single 
 time  where  you  were  able  to  like
[75:04] or  you  even  put  in  an  okay  amount  of 
 effort 
 to  change  my  mind  whereas  the  times  you
[75:11] never  really 
 said  something  like  this  but  i  could 
 imagine  if  you  did  i'd  be  like  all  over 
 you  i'd  be  like
[75:16] telling  you  just  so  much  stuff  about  our 
 plans  together  and  i  get  your  mind  off 
 that  and  i'd  get  you  like  feeling 
 confident
[75:22] i  would  say  those  things  to  you
[75:27] i  will  always  try  to  reassure  you  i  feel 
 like  you're  painting  this  as  if  i  was 
 just  like 
 oh  you  feel  insecure  like  but  don't  need
[75:34] to  do  about  it 
 but  that  was  never  the  case  at  all  i  got 
 so  upset  over  your  like
[75:39] that  i  i  would  always  feel  i  felt 
 insecure  a  lot  of  the  time
[75:44] the  end  of  our  relationship  but  i  like 
 we  were  so  sensitive  to  each  other's 
 emotions  like  you  said  it  before
[75:49] you're  like  if  you  felt  insecure  i'd 
 feel  insecure  but 
 you  felt  insecure  so  like  so  much  of  the
[75:54] time  towards  the  end  and 
 maybe  it's  because  i  was  here  and  you 
 were  at  home
[75:59] um  i  mean  yeah  that  was  definitely  the 
 reason  but
[76:04] coming  out  like  the um  and  i  think 
 that's  why  one  we  had  distance  between
[76:09] us 
 and  yeah  this  is 
 i  mean  it's  hard  for  everyone  but
[76:14] obviously  at  least  for  me  like 
 distance  is  like  it  kills  the  there  is
[76:19] no  relationship  with  distance  in  my 
 opinion  like 
 for  me  other  people  can  say  oh  you  know
[76:24] they're  fine  with  it  they  can  do  long 
 distance  they  can  be  away  from  each 
 other  but  for  me  it's  like 
 my  relationship  is  literally  physically
[76:30] being  around  each  other  like  24  7. 
 and  maybe  maybe  it's  not  healthy  right 
 that's  me  i  can't  expect  that  all  the
[76:35] time 
 yeah  i  don't  think  that  is  healthy
[76:42] somebody  both  unhealthy  because  honestly 
 that's  what  you  wanted 
 yeah  i  know
[76:51] yeah  i'm  not  saying  that  i  was  i  was 
 perfect  like  neither  of  us  were  we  both 
 made  mistakes
[76:57] we  both  have  a  lot  to  learn  from 
 i  know  that  i  definitely  do  i  know  that
[77:02] you  definitely  do  whether  you 
 take  it  and  learn  from  it  i  don't  know 
 that's  completely  your  choice  but
[77:13] what  do  you  think  your  learning  lessons 
 are
[77:18] um  or  what  do  you  think  mine  should  be 
 that's  great  and  then  i'll  tell  you  what 
 i  think  you  you  should  be
[77:25] um  you  go  first 
 i  was  going  to  think  of  him  as  you  were
[77:30] talking  i  was  going  to  think  about  it
[77:35] give  me  a  second  i'm  really  firstly  done 
 let  me  read  my  notes
[77:42] what  was  the  question  again  so  what 
 something  we  should  both  learn  you've
[77:48] got  a  short  term  memory  loss  recently 
 right 
 i  do  have  short-term  memory  loss
[77:53] i  have  a  really  bad
[78:01] because  you  can't  even  remember  who's 
 your  question 
 i  was  thinking  of  a  different  question 
 but  enough  i  want  to ask  that  one
[78:08] go  on  my  heart's  like  beating  fast  no 
 i'm  not  asking  it  i  was  like 
 no  please  you  can't  say  that  and  they're
[78:13] not  asking  no 
 come  on  have  you  started  dating  anyone
[78:18] else
[78:24] not  dating  anyone  else  yeah
[78:29] i  think  you  moved  on  very  quick 
 i  was  surprised  to  see  that
[78:35] um  don't  need  to  be  honest  with  you 
 i  was  very  upset  for  the  first  week
[78:42] i  was  like  literally  a  mess  like  i 
 couldn't  be  on  my  own  i  literally  wasn't 
 on  my  own  for  a  whole  week
[78:47] um  and  then  obviously  i  had  my 
 dissertation  to  write  oh  yeah 
 like  literally  we  broke  up  and  my
[78:53] dissertation  was  due  like  two  weeks 
 afterwards  and  i  hadn't  started  writing 
 it  i  was  like  oh  my  god  like  what  was  my 
 lifestyle
[78:59] um  so  i  think  i  kind  of  suppressed  it 
 um
[79:04] [Music] 
 yeah  for  all  that  time  and  then  when  i
[79:09] submitted  my  dissertation  it  like  kind 
 of  hit  me 
 all  over  again  as  if  it  just  happened  so
[79:15] yeah  didn't  move  on  quick  what  makes  you 
 think  that  i  moved  on  quickly  i  remember
[79:22] i  started 
 being  a  little  social  media  [ __ ]  and  i 
 was
[79:27] um  like  i  just  kept  on  going  on  your 
 page  i  was  like  i  know  the  advice  i  give
[79:33] that  advice  to  everyone  like 
 don't  you  know  block  her  don't  go  on  a 
 page  don't  do  anything  but  it  was  like
[79:38] automatically  when  we  were  messaging 
 each  other  on  instagram 
 i'd  do  it  and  then  i'd  see  your  follower 
 can't  go  up  and  i was  thinking  okay  she
[79:44] hasn't  obviously  met  these  guys  in 
 person  so 
 within  a  day  of  breaking  up  for  a  couple 
 days  like  she's  back  on
[79:49] the  dating  apps  and  that  made  me  like  i 
 didn't  i  didn't  get  dating  apps  until
[79:54] like  maybe  two  or  three  weeks  after  we 
 broke  up 
 and  i  don't  even  use  them  i  downloaded 
 them  but  i  don't  use  them
[79:59] i'm  not  sure  about  that  because  unless 
 you  just  randomly 
 like  followed  a  couple  of  guys  who  are
[80:05] your  type  because  i  sorry  and  i  was  like 
 oh  like 
 okay  like  she  moved  on  quick  where  i
[80:10] can't  remember  who  i  felt 
 i  remember  i  followed  joe  back  after  we 
 broke  up
[80:15] because  obviously  he's  my  friend 
 so  i  followed  him  back  but  i  can't
[80:20] remember  who  else  i  followed  but  it  was 
 never 
 like  that  but  i  mean  i  was  doing  the 
 exact  same  thing  as  you  said
[80:27] and  i  saw  your  follower  can't  go  up  yeah 
 but  not  my  voice
[80:32] i  didn't  really  like  how  much  did  mine 
 go  up  by
[80:38] um  i  think  it's  almost  like  four  like  i 
 i  don't  know  why  i'm  pretending  because 
 i  know  exactly  the  numbers
[80:49] [Laughter]
[80:55] i  mean  it  was  an  easy  number  to  remember 
 in  it  and  you're  on  like 
 just  under  600  like  i  haven't  actually
[81:00] looked  through  it  recently 
 well  you  were  on  like  1-1-1  because  i
[81:05] remember  you  were  on  112 
 and  then  you  went  down  to  1-1-1  i 
 remember  thinking  has  he  done  that  on
[81:10] purpose  so  i'm  like 
 angel  number  nah  i  didn't  even  think  of 
 that
[81:18] but  yeah  no  um 
 [Music]
[81:24] when  when 
 was  the  last  time  that  you  did  that  what
[81:31] social  media  stuck 
 so  recently  as  i've  been  messaging  you
[81:36] for  the  podcast  i'd  go 
 i've  clicked  on  your  name  but  i  haven't
[81:41] clicked  on  your  follower  account 
 so  i  i  don't  know  if  i  was  expecting  to
[81:46] see  like 
 a  picture  of  you  like  a  second  or 
 something
[81:53] but  i  was  i  don't  know  like  yeah  like 
 i  looked  through  your  follow  account  i
[81:59] think  probably 
 probably  like  five  ten  times  over  the
[82:04] couple  of  days  after  we  broke  up 
 and  then  after  a  certain  amount  of  time 
 i  think  by  the  time  like  because  i 
 blocked  you  for  a  little  bit
[82:10] i  think  by  that  point  then  i  just 
 stopped  looking  and  i  was  like 
 yeah  because  to  be  honest  you  you 
 started  grinding  for  the  dissertation  i
[82:17] literally  started  grinding  for  the 
 business 
 because  it  was  like  at  this  point  i  was 
 putting  in  like
[82:23] eight  hours  of  deep  work  like 
 unimaginable  levels  of  deep  work  and 
 [ __ ] 
 and  so  i  literally  i  went  celibate  i
[82:29] went  like  you  literally  made  me  like 
 asexual  like 
 i'm  not  even  interested  anymore  like  i 
 don't  even  need  women  i've  reached  a
[82:35] higher  level  where  i  just 
 levitate  and  i'm  in  monk  mode  now
[82:40] [Laughter] 
 how  long  can  we  celebrate
[82:48] probably  a  high  school  mate  um 
 it's  probably  a  high  school  now
[82:55] have  you  seen  anyone  since  we  broke  up
[83:00] i  met  one  woman  but  i  didn't  exactly 
 like
[83:06] dude  that  was  just  like  two  days  ago  but 
 i  didn't  exactly  do  anything  with  her 
 it's  like  kissed  and  other  than  that
[83:11] like  just  kept  to  myself 
 like  i  was  the  usual  stuff  out  like  what
[83:17] my  mind 
 wanted  me  to  do  was  to  get  on  the  app 
 city  sap  and  start  like  sleeping  with
[83:22] girls  again 
 and  i  just  got  a  feeling  of  like  nah
[83:27] like 
 i'm  for  this  time  like  i'm  not  purposely 
 gonna  go  and  like  rebound  and  like
[83:32] do  that  [ __ ]  i'm  just  i'm  actually  going 
 to  accept  the  feeling  of  like
[83:37] the  disattachment  and  like  the  breakup 
 feeling  without  trying  to  cover  it  with
[83:42] someone  new  so  i've  literally  just  kept 
 to  myself 
 apart  from  meeting  this  one  girl  nothing
[83:49] i've  literally  done  the  exact  same  like 
 i  just  kind  of
[83:54] like  after  the  breakup  like  obviously 
 straight  away  you're  like  oh  not 
 straight  away  but  like  after  a  bit  of 
 time  you're  like  oh
[83:59] i'm  gonna  get  back  on  dating  outside  i'm 
 just  gonna  see  loads  of  people  and  it's 
 not  even  gonna 
 like  think  about  him  i'm  just  gonna
[84:04] distract  myself  about  so  many  people  but 
 i  just  like  i  downloaded  the  dating  apps
[84:09] and  like 
 i  just  i  just  don't  reply  to  people 
 like  i  just  never  ever ever  reply  to
[84:16] people  i  just  don't  i  just  don't  have 
 interest 
 honestly  i  just  don't  have  an  interest 
 in  it  like  so  i'm  kind  of  the  same  like
[84:22] kind  of  turned  asexual  i  guess  um 
 and  was  just  not
[84:29] even  interested  at  all  and  i  mean  i'm 
 still  not 
 yeah  yeah  we're  both  still  in  love  with
[84:36] each  other 
 we're  both  still  in  love  with  each  other
[84:41] do  you  think  i  think  at  least  for  me 
 it's  like 
 i've  not  wanted  to
[84:48] i've  wanted  to  view  everything  more 
 negatively  so  that  it  hurts  less
[84:54] but  yeah  me  too 
 judging  off  how  like  our  actions  have 
 been  and  how
[85:01] with  it  like  it's  just  it's  becoming  so 
 clear  to  me 
 because  i  don't  think  that  me  and  you
[85:08] even  like 
 broke  up  like  we  we  have  broken  up  but  i 
 don't  think  that  i  broke  up  with  you  or
[85:13] you  broke  up  with  me  i  think 
 it  was  just  a  weird  situation  where  your 
 family  broke  up  with  us
[85:20] because  if  for  example  that  didn't 
 happen  you  wouldn't  have  broken  up  with 
 me  just  then  even  if  you  had  it  in  mind
[85:25] like  oh  you  know  the  manipulation  video 
 or  the  boundaries  or  whatever  you 
 wouldn't  have 
 and  i  wouldn't  have  either  like  we  would
[85:30] have  literally  died  together
[85:35] [Laughter] 
 you  would  have  got  to  find  where  you
[85:40] swallowed  the  key 
 i  locked  myself  inside  of  you  neither  of
[85:46] us  leave
[85:55] doesn't  make  you  sad  when  you  think 
 about  it
[86:00] like  i'll  be  completely  honest  the  only 
 thoughts  i've  had 
 have  been  like  resentful  ones  not  even
[86:05] like 
 hostile  ones  not  not  sad  ones  and  not 
 positive  ones  i  think
[86:10] my  mind  just  keeps  generating  reasons  to 
 be  like 
 mad  it's  like  my  like  before  i  came  onto
[86:18] this  call  i  was  like  thinking  like 
 let  me  write  down  all  these  points  why 
 he's  a  dick
[86:24] but  i  [ __ ]  hate  him 
 but  it's  like  like  i  remember  i  was
[86:29] speaking  to  my  friends  about  they're 
 like  oh  like 
 i  don't  want  you  to  go  on  thinking  it's 
 going  to  be  like  a  nice  conversation
[86:35] i  was  like  oh  no  it  probably  won't  be 
 but  like  i  wouldn't  say  it's  been  like  a 
 necessarily  not  nice  conversation  like  i
[86:41] think  we  both  feel  very  respectful  to 
 each  other 
 and  i  think  like  when  it's  like  when  the
[86:47] person  becomes  not  a  person  anymore 
 they  just  become  like  an  image  in  your 
 head
[86:53] that's  what  you  became  for  me  yeah 
 that's  a  very  very  good  because  i
[86:58] i  feel  like  the  same  way  but  i  can't 
 exactly  describe  it 
 but  it's
[87:07] i  honestly  can't  even  describe  it  how  i 
 feel  towards  you 
 because  i  said  this  to  you  last  time  it
[87:14] was  like 
 huh  is  it  good  or  bad
[87:20] up  until  this  call  it  was  like  100  bad 
 not  like  horrible  horrible  but  like  just
[87:25] every  now  and  then  i'd  be  brushing  my 
 teeth  like  that  [ __ ]  [ __ ]
[87:30] just
[87:35] but  i  think  now  that  we've  spoke 
 and  especially  because  we  haven't  been
[87:40] like  hostile  with  you  i  mean  you 
 probably  did  start  a little  bit  hostile 
 like  oh  yeah  do  you  have  manipulative
[87:48] [Music]
[87:53] [Laughter] 
 journal  still  been  using  this  one
[88:07] hi  literally  straight  after  we  broke  up 
 the  relationship  journal 
 the  attachment  book  anything  that
[88:13] reminded  me  of  you  literally 
 throw  into  the  back  of  the  wardrobe  i 
 couldn't  look  at  it  i  couldn't  meditate
[88:18] for  weeks  couldn't  journal  for  weeks 
 i've  only  just  been  able  to  listen  to 
 some  of  our  songs
[88:23] only  just  but 
 what  songs  like  what  are  like  proper
[88:28] like  trigger  songs  for  you 
 i  wonder  if  they're  the  same  red  stripe
[88:33] rapid  z 
 yeah  yeah  i  haven't  listened  to  because
[88:38] as  soon  as  we  broke  up  i  went  on 
 we  had  like  a  joint  playlist  i  went  on 
 that  and  just  like  removed  myself  from
[88:43] it 
 because  i  knew  that  it would  be  like  so 
 hurtful  i  removed  you  from  it 
 no  i  left  from  it  oh  you  might  have  like
[88:51] i  i  might  have  actually  just  like  taken 
 off  the  playlist  off  my  spotify  but  you 
 probably  like  saw  my  account  on  there
[88:56] you  probably 
 removed  me  like  that  but  i  like  stopped 
 i  removed  you  often
[89:01] yeah  so  i  couldn't  moved  you  up  and  i 
 added  you  back  on 
 so  you're  back  on  it  just  because  he
[89:06] wants  to  add  anymore
[89:18] [ __ ]  stuff
[89:27] what  are  the  songs
[89:32] um  the  late  night  vibe  i  don't  know  the 
 exact  names  of  them  but  there  was  like 
 you  know  the  female  artists  a  bunch  of
[89:38] them  like 
 warm  pants  obviously
[89:44] i  don't  even  listen  to  warm  pants  oh  my 
 god  i'm  not  gonna  be  able  to  listen  to 
 that 
 and  i  was  like  i  actually  changed  it  i
[89:49] was  like  no  i'm  good
[89:59] [Laughter]
[90:05] which  ones  is  it  for  you  um
[90:10] 24k  that's  a  big  one  which  one  is  that
[90:15] [Music] 
 um
[90:28] i  can  think  of  one  that  would  be  but  i'm 
 never  going  to  listen  to  ever  again 
 that  fallen  for  you  one  oh  yeah
[90:35] no  i'm  good  i'm  i've  been  listening  to 
 that  but  yeah  i've  never  listened  to 
 that  ever  again
[90:40] because  we  actually  thought  that  that 
 was  like  our  song  didn't  we 
 yeah  it  was  it  wasn't  looking  that's
[90:47] another  one  i've  not  even  listened  to 
 that  one  i  won't  be  able  to
[90:52] because  that  was  another  one  that  we 
 said  was  literally  us 
 in  a  song
[91:00] oh
[91:06] i  think  that's  the  thing  that  was 
 pissing  me  off  the  most  about  the 
 breakup
[91:11] like  not  being  able  to  listen  to  music 
 like  i  literally  didn't  listen  to  music 
 for  like  weeks
[91:20] i'm  actually  like  i've  been  avoiding  it 
 thinking  like  oh  you  know  make  me  think 
 about  her  but  now  i'm  like
[91:26] yeah  maybe  think  about  [ __ ]  like  i 
 want  this  song  to  come  on  now  because 
 i  was  for  the  first  time  yesterday
[91:32] instead  of  just  listening  to  drill  or 
 like  an  audio  book 
 i  was  coming  home  from  kickboxing  and  i
[91:37] went  through  i  usually  like  don't  ever 
 do  this  but  like
[91:42] i  went  off  the  the  drill  playlist  and  i 
 went  to  the  chill  rap  one 
 and  i  scrolled  on  that  out  i  haven't 
 listened  to  that  because  that's  the  one
[91:48] which  we  originally  started  listening  to 
 when  we  first  started  like 
 seeing  each  other  where  it  was  like  come
[91:53] through  and  chill  and  everything 
 burnt  fires  when  exchange  came  on
[91:59] and  i  was  i  was  still  making  the  noises 
 by  myself  and  i was  just  imagining  you 
 like 
 looking  at  me  weird  when  i  was  doing  the
[92:05] ad-libs 
 that's  so  weird  i  think  the  exact  same 
 thing  when  that  song  comes
[92:15] i  think  songs  like  that  like  exchange 
 like  i've  listened  to  that  a  few  times 
 since  we  broke  up  and  i  did  think  of
[92:20] like  that  moment  but  i  think  because  i 
 listened 
 i  think  once  i  listened  to  before  you
[92:25] i  thought  they're  okay  yeah 
 yeah  agreed  like  the  start  of  that
[92:33] i  remember  it  being  like  it  would  make 
 me  think 
 but  then  i've  listened  to  that  song  for
[92:39] like 
 like  that  was  like  one  of  my  go-to  songs 
 anyway  and  so  it  was  just  kind  of  like 
 it  was  reminding  me  of  like  all  the
[92:44] stuff  was  like  being  back  in  manchester 
 and  everything  so  it  was 
 it's  like  an  emotional  song  for  me  in
[92:49] general  but  the  ones  with  you 
 specifically  are  like  the  ones  that 
 they're  the  playlists  we  made  and  that
[92:55] whole  playlist 
 yeah  like  we've  got  like  four  playlists 
 like  that  can't  even  like
[93:00] look  on  spotify  anymore  after  like  click 
 on  the  the  drill  playlist  like  that  like 
 not  look  at  anything  else  you  would
[93:07] listen  to  the  journaling  playlist 
 anymore  yeah 
 dude  did  that  not  make  you  sad  to  start
[93:12] with 
 it  gets  me  in  my  feelings  it  gets  me 
 like  deep  thoughts
[93:18] because  i've  always  uh
[93:27] it's  hard  to  say  because  it'd  be 
 somewhat  in  general  like  i  don't  get  an 
 overwhelming  sense  of  like
[93:33] thinking  about  you  but  at  the  same  time 
 like
[93:39] i've  i  think  i've  only  journal  like  i've 
 joined  about  some 
 some  of  the  stuff  i've  pretty  much  only
[93:44] journaled  about  you  since  like  the  last 
 month  or  so  because  it's  been  like  the 
 thing  on  my  mind 
 journal  about  maybe  like  two  three  other
[93:50] stuff  that's  about  it 
 and  so  have  you  journaled  me  much  since 
 we  broke  up
[93:55] did  i  not  just  say  that  research  yeah 
 but  much 
 yeah  but  you  said  you  could  have  only
[94:00] journaled  three  times  if  you  broke  up 
 yeah  um
[94:08] we  broke  up  by  like  the  start  of  may 
 i think  it's  starting  may  [ __ ]  it's
[94:13] actually  it  was  the  12th  of  may 
 yeah  april
[94:19] so  this  was  28th  of  april  10  things  i'm 
 grateful  about  you  okay  let's  not  read 
 that
[94:24] so  yeah  let's  not  read  that  one  7th  of 
 may
[94:29] um  this  is  me  talking  about 
 social  media  and  everything  8th  of  may
[94:36] 12th  may  it  happened  i  think  11th  of  may 
 was  like  the  last  time  we 
 we  spoke  and  this  was  when  i  wrote  like
[94:42] we  were  on  facetime  when  i  wrote  like  a 
 letter  to  you  while  you  were 
 talking  on  facetime  and  i  was  saying
[94:48] you've  got  to  stop  indulging  in  your 
 emotions  baby 
 you've  been  practicing  mindfulness  and
[94:53] gratitude  for  months 
 and  then  the  next  one  is  just  we  broke
[94:58] up 
 and  then  20
[95:04] how  many  we  got  26  reasons  why  like 
 you  were  trash
[95:24] [Laughter]
[95:31] 18th  of  may  i  got  like  i  wasn't  even 
 joking  before  you  know 
 debate  in  celibacy
[95:38] i  hope  for  like  whilst  i  was
[95:50] no  i'm  not  gonna  read  this  why
[95:58] there's  some  emotional  stuff  on  this 
 a  letter  to  future  hamza
[96:05] no  matter  what  your  connection  with  her 
 do  not  forget  about 
 her  found  it  do  not  forget  about  the
[96:10] foundation  which  your  relationship  is 
 built  upon
[96:16] i  think  that's  like  the  main  thing  like 
 no  matter  how  much  we  get  on 
 no  matter  how  like  compatible  we  are
[96:23] like  we  have  different  values  in  terms 
 of  relationships  so  it would  never  work
[96:29] bad  yeah  i  agreed 
 i  just  think  like  everything  is  a  life
[96:36] lesson  like  everyone 
 come  like  comes  into  your  life  to  teach 
 you  a  lesson  like
[96:41] good  things  bad  things  like  like  after 
 we 
 broke  up  i  literally  just  wanted  to  have
[96:46] a  [ __ ]  brain  shock  therapy  and  have 
 my  memory  wiped  into 
 you  like  completely  i  didn't  want  to 
 know  who  you  were  i  didn't  want  to
[96:52] like  anything  i  just  completely  wanted 
 to  be  like  rid  of  you  but  now  that  i'm 
 like
[96:57] over  it  not  like  i'm  not  fully  over  it 
 i'm  not  gonna  lie  like 
 i'm  not  even  nearly  there  i  don't  think
[97:05] um  you're  not  over  it 
 no
[97:12] boy  you  used  to  love  me
[97:21] [Laughter]
[97:26] all  right  boys  100  likes  on  the  podcast 
 i  mean  if  we'll  get  back  together
[97:32] smash  that  like  button  guys  rate  comment 
 and  subscribe
[97:43] i  just  yeah  reckon  that's  because  of 
 closure 
 or  just  in  general  like  yeah
[97:51] definitely  that's  why  i've  done  this 
 that's  why  i've  agreed  to  do  it 
 because  obviously  like  when  we  broke  up
[97:58] you  asked  to  meet  up 
 and  i  said  no  because  i  just
[98:03] i  just  needed  to  like  like  like  i  said  i 
 wanted  to  forget  that  you  existed  so  i
[98:08] just  needed  to  like 
 and  it's  like  i  don't  think  you 
 understand  like
[98:13] i  think  you  seem  to  think  that  because  i 
 was  quite  like
[98:18] like  quite  not  ignorant  but  like  i 
 wasn't  really  willing  to  like  have  a
[98:23] conversation  with  you  after  we  broke  up 
 like  at  all  or  i  think  that  you
[98:29] and  i  would  do  the  same  if  it  was  like 
 rolls  reverse  i'd  like 
 assume  that  that  means  that  like  oh  the
[98:34] other  person's  moved  on  like  it's  fine 
 but  it  was  just  it  was  just  too  painful 
 it  was  just  way  too  painful
[98:40] so  that's  why  i  was  when  we  broke  up  i 
 was  like  no  like 
 i  can't  meet  up  with  him  like  i  can't
[98:45] even  have  a  face  time  with  him  i  was 
 like 
 like  we've  broken  up  like  we've  had  a 
 few  days  of  no  contact  i  was  like
[98:50] i  can't  go  back  to  that  now  but  then 
 like  obviously  over  time  i've  realized 
 like
[98:55] i  do  need  that  closure  and  i've  been 
 trying  to  figure  out  how  to  say  what  i 
 like  needed  to  say  to  you
[99:00] because  obviously  you  wrote  me  that 
 letter  and  i  said  that  i'd  let  you  know 
 how  i  felt  and  then  like 
 a  month  later  still  haven't  said
[99:06] anything  um 
 so  and  then  i  was  still  trying  to  figure
[99:12] out  how  to  tell  you  how  i  felt  and  then 
 you  asked  me  to  do  this  so  i  was  like
[99:18] let  me  let  me  just  jump  on  this  real 
 quick  and  just 
 really  yeah  um
[99:26] me  too  did  it  hurt  you  when  i  was  like 
 hesitant  to  talk  to  you  afterwards
[99:33] no  not  at  all  actually  because  really 
 yeah  i  actually  did  understand  and  i
[99:38] didn't  really  view  it 
 because  by  this  point  i  had  stopped  like 
 checking  on  instagram  i  was
[99:43] just  back  to  in  the  business  instantly 
 productivity  went  so  business  was 
 growing  and  everything  and  so  i  was  just
[99:48] busy  and  i  was 
 i  just  i  honestly  at  this  point  i  went 
 into  like  this  monk  mode  period  where  i
[99:53] just  went  like  celibate  i  didn't  even 
 want  to  think  about  girls  for  a  bit 
 of  it  like  yeah  so  i  didn't  even  view  it
[100:00] negatively  at  all  i  figured  it  was 
 your  way  of  like  coping  with  it  and  yeah
[100:06] i'll  be  honest  after  the 
 when  i  sent  you  like  a  long  message  we 
 were  like  we  weren't  going  to  meet  in
[100:11] person  so  i  wrote  the  letter  and  i  just 
 sent  you  like  a  three-page  letter  and 
 recorded  it  all  on  voice  note
[100:16] literally  the  moment  i  said  that  it 
 wasn't  three  pages  it  was  like
[100:25] the  moment  i  sense  it  i  was  like  that 
 was  my  closure  honestly 
 it  kind  of  felt  like  i  didn't  exactly
[100:30] need  to  to  hear  back  from  you 
 because  i  needed  to  say  my  piece  and
[100:36] i  knew  that  hearing  your  piece  would  be 
 like 
 for  you  not  for  me  yeah  so  i  got  mine
[100:42] and  i  was  like 
 i  just  dipped  after  that  yeah  i was 
 literally
[100:47] i  think  that's  why  i  found  it  hard  to 
 move  on  because  i  haven't
[100:52] ever  like  given  myself  that  yeah  that's 
 honestly  that's  what  it  was  for  it  was
[100:57] like  me  saying  it  helped  me  and  i  think 
 if  you  said  it  would  have  helped  you  it 
 might  have  like  worsened  it  for  me
[101:03] you  know  hearing  how  like  you  felt  and 
 you  if  you  said  anything  bad  or  if  you 
 said  even  good  stuff  about  me  would  have
[101:08] like 
 emotionally  affected  me  whereas  it  just 
 feels  relieving  to  like
[101:13] say  what  needs  to  be  said  and  so  i'm 
 very  very  glad  that  i  just  wrote  that 
 massive  letter  sent  it  over  to  you
[101:18] because 
 straight  after  that  i  just  started  like 
 clearly  like  haven't  fully  moved  on  or
[101:23] anything  i  don't  think  either  of  us  have 
 but  at  least 
 it  was  like  some  sort  of  closure
[101:29] yeah  it  was  at  least  like  close  the 
 chapter  in  it 
 yeah  of  course  i  think  that's  why  i
[101:35] struggled  because  i  haven't  had  that 
 i  mean  that's  my  own  fault  i  just  i 
 couldn't  have  met  up  with  you  like
[101:42] i  just  couldn't 
 i  wanted  to  more  than  anything
[101:50] come  to  meet  me  and  start  packing  the 
 [Laughter]
[101:58] blankets 
 [Laughter]
[102:09] um  yeah  i'm  gonna  just  look  over  this 
 and  see  because  i'm  gonna  be  really
[102:16] annoyed  at  myself  if  i  haven't  said 
 anything  that  i 
 want  to  say  um
[102:23] yeah  sorry  to  take  it  from  like  a 
 positive  note  to  back  to  a  negative  from 
 a  negative
[102:28] i  think  like  the  day  that  we  broke  up  i 
 saw  a  very  different  side  to  you 
 that  i've  never  seen  before  like  i
[102:35] understand 
 like  i  can  understand  why  you  were  like 
 laughing  and  smiling  and  i  don't  think  i
[102:40] was  aggressive  towards  you  on  that 
 facetime  call 
 i  think  like  i  wouldn't  be  surprised  if
[102:46] it  came  across  that  way  because 
 obviously  it's  like  my  whole  family  were 
 like  kicking  off  at  you  you're  gonna
[102:51] think  that  i  was  being  aggressive  but  i 
 wasn't  being  aggressive  at  all  and  when 
 you  were  smiling
[102:56] i  remember  i  literally  said  to  you 
 exactly  like  this  like  this  isn't  a 
 laughing  situation  hamza  like  this  is 
 horrible
[103:01] and  i  think  that  like  that  did  hurt  me 
 that  you  were  smiling  because
[103:06] to  me  it  seemed  as  though  it  didn't 
 matter  to  you 
 like  if  it  was  rolls  reverse  and  say  i
[103:11] was  in  that  situation 
 where  your  family  were  like  really  upset 
 with  me
[103:16] i  wouldn't  be  sat  there  smiling  no 
 matter  how  awkward  i  felt  i'd  literally 
 be  in  tears  like  please
[103:21] let  me  explain  and  obviously  i  didn't 
 hear  the  conversation  between  you  my 
 grandad  so  i  don't  know  what  was  said
[103:26] but  um 
 yeah  it  just  kind  of  hurt  me  to  see  that 
 you  were  smiling  because  it  made  me  feel
[103:31] like 
 you  didn't  care  and  i  was  in  absolutely 
 i  mean  you  saw  the  mess  i  was  in
[103:37] um  it's  interesting  that  you  like  you 
 perceived  me  smiling  as 
 as  negative  because  my  smile  wasn't
[103:46] my  it  wasn't  like  me  smiling  at  the 
 situation  it  was  me  smiling  at
[103:51] the  girl  i'm  in  love  with  it  actually 
 it's  like  seeing  her  for  the  first  time 
 in  a  little  while  in  a  stressful 
 situation 
 it  was  yeah  it  was  me  smiling  at  you
[103:59] not  at  the  situation  like  the  situation 
 was  making  me  tense  and 
 uncomfortable  but  the  moment  i  see  you
[104:05] it's  like  i  always  smile 
 and  it  it  hurt  when  you  instantly  took
[104:10] that  as  like 
 an  insult  and  you  like  you  you  it  was 
 like  now  it  felt
[104:15] at  first  it  felt  like  me  and  you  versus 
 everyone  then  it  felt  like 
 you  plus  everyone  versus  me  because  then
[104:20] you  started  like  you  were  like 
 doing  the  gun  fingers  and  [ __ ]  and  like
[104:25] manipulating  me  i'm  seeing  [ __ ] 
 grooming  gang
[104:30] oh  thank  you  yeah 
 he  said  that  you  agree  with  me
[104:38] he  still  believes  that  now  but  like 
 i  don't  blame  him  honestly  he's  like  you
[104:44] see  that  video  you  see  me 
 like  getting  girls  and  stuff  it's  like  i 
 couldn't  understand  this  perception  of
[104:49] that 
 it's  obvious  it's  not  right  but  it's 
 like  i  was  and  it  isn't  like
[104:54] well  for  that  buzz 
 would  you  say  i  was  like  resentful
[105:03] for  the  perception  that  that  was  the 
 image  that  was  put  onto  me  for  that  all 
 this 
 that  i  was  like  grooming  you  i  was
[105:09] manipulating  you  but 
 and  i  said  that  myself  i  said  that  you 
 weren't  grooming  me
[105:14] like  i  think  you  did  you  did  manipulate 
 me  like  you've  even 
 kind  of  admitted  it  to  admitted  to
[105:20] having 
 somewhat  manipulated  me  in  the  past  like 
 when  we  weren't  together
[105:25] obviously  when  it  was  just  like  seeing 
 each  other 
 i  think  without  actually  having  like
[105:31] without 
 having  to  try  and  convince  someone  first 
 oh  but  but  by  the  way  like  manipulation
[105:36] is  kind  of  how 
 humans  interact  anyway  and  so  you've  got 
 to  not  use  manipulation  yeah
[105:41] it  would  a  way  yeah 
 but  i  think  you  have  a  very  negative
[105:46] view  of  my  family  yeah 
 i  do  i'm  very  very  negative
[105:51] yeah  and  i  can  understand  why  you  have 
 that  view 
 but  like  it
[105:58] indifference  it  like  i  didn't  ever 
 expect  for  this  to  happen  like  i'm
[106:03] i  was  just  as  like  confused  as  you 
 i  wasn't  so  confused  but  i've  never  ever
[106:10] ever  seen  my  granddad  like  that  before 
 [Music] 
 i  think  he  was  just  very  i  think  it  was
[106:17] the  pictures  that  you  included  in  the 
 video  i  don't  think  it  was  necessarily 
 i  think  it  was  what  you  were  saying 
 about  me  of  course  and  i  think  it  was
[106:23] the 
 it  was  the  comparison  it  was  when  you
[106:28] were  talking  about 
 the  experiments  with  rats  and  pigeons
[106:33] and  he's  like  he's  comparing  a  woman 
 no  that's  such  a  like  useless  point
[106:38] honestly 
 i  know  like  it  might  be  a  useless  point 
 but  you  have  to  think  like
[106:43] this  is  someone  who's  nearly  in  their 
 70s  like  a  completely  different 
 generation  doesn't  know 
 what  youtube  is  i've  seen  a  video  of  you
[106:49] saying  oh  this  is  how  i  manipulate  girls 
 into  getting  what  i  want 
 and  then  all  the  things  that  had
[106:54] happened  of  course  he's  going  to  see  it 
 in  a  negative  way  like 
 my  granddad  he's  my  granddad  but  he's 
 like  my  dad  he's  raised  me
[107:01] if  he  thinks  that  there's  some  a  guy 
 that's  like 
 like  showing  some  form  of  danger  towards
[107:06] me  of  course  he's  gonna  react  in  a 
 horrible  way  because 
 that's  his  job
[107:13] yeah  that's  why  although  i  have  like  a 
 negative 
 thought  towards  like  the  situation  your
[107:21] family 
 but  i  don't  exactly
[107:26] like  i'm  i'm  offended  but  i  understand 
 i  think  that's  the  way  it  is  i'm  pissed
[107:32] off  that 
 me  and  you  we  didn't  get  the  autonomy 
 like  we  didn't  get  the  freedom  to  make
[107:37] this  choice  because 
 i  think  that  it  put  us  in  like  a  weird 
 situation
[107:42] where  we  didn't  get  to  like  break  up 
 with  each  other  which  would  have  been 
 the  best  case  scenario  like
[107:47] it  was  like  yeah
[107:52] like  that  wasn't  fair  and  the  last 
 conversation  we  had  is 
 you  know  you  go  up  to  your  room  so  we
[107:58] can  speak 
 on  facetime  and  then  your  granddad  walks 
 straight  up  as  well  he's  still  stood 
 there  like  he  was  talking  aggressively
[108:04] to  me 
 but  at  that  point  it's  like  that's  so  so 
 respectful  if  if  it's  going  to  be  your
[108:10] last  conversation  in  a  relationship  you 
 you  deserve  to  at  least  have 
 two  minutes  to  say  goodbye  to  each  other
[108:15] and  to  like  end  it 
 and  the  grand  island  is  like  looking  at 
 me  [ __ ]  like
[108:21] i  mean  like  it's  kind  of  funny  now  but 
 it 
 it's  not  something  at  the  time  it  was
[108:26] like  i'm  not  gonna  sound  like  a  [ __ ] 
 but  it's  not  something  i'd  expect  them 
 to  say 
 in  person  because  that  that's
[108:32] that's  man  to  man  that's  very  offensive 
 man  to  find  you  don't  say  that  type  of 
 [ __ ]  to  someone 
 and  especially  not  if  you  you  think  it's
[108:38] good  i  didn't  hear  it 
 i  didn't  hear  whatever  was  said  to  say
[108:43] what  is  to  look  at  someone  and  say  like 
 start  swearing  at  them
[108:48] like  okay  say  that  i've  done  something 
 wrong  fine  but  if  you  start  swearing  at 
 me  like 
 that  is  not  just  an  insult  it's  like
[108:54] it's  a  threat 
 at  that  point  yeah  and  you  can  say  i 
 mean  i  i  can't  comment  on  that  because  i
[108:59] didn't  hear  him  i 
 i  didn't  hear  him  i  can't  comment  on 
 that  because  i  didn't  hear  him  and  if  he
[109:04] did  swear 
 like  i  don't  think  he  should  have  done 
 but  then  they 
 they  didn't  know  you  they  didn't  know
[109:11] the  good  sides  to  you  all  they  saw  was 
 this  bad 
 and  that's  that's  why  i  i've  got
[109:17] negative  views  of  them  is 
 there's  a  hundred  videos  on  my  channel  a 
 hundred  videos  of  me  talking  about 
 mental  health  of  me  talking  about
[109:23] helping  these  guys 
 thousands  of  comments  of  guys  saying 
 that  i've  helped  them  but  the  issue
[109:28] isn't  about  how  you  can  help  guys  judged 
 literally 
 my  whole  like  person  my  every  the  person
[109:34] i  am  they've  judged  me  from  one  video 
 not  even  just  one  video 
 the  title  of  the  video  i've  been  i've
[109:40] been 
 branded  as  a  manipulator  because  i  made 
 a  video  on  manipulation 
 like  that  is  true  but  you  have  to  think
[109:46] that  interest  isn't 
 that  interest  isn't  how  well  you  can 
 help  young  men  i'm  not  a  young  man  who's
[109:52] been  helped  by  you 
 i  was  a  girl  that  was  in  a  relationship 
 with  you  so 
 their  concern  is  going  to  be  your  views
[109:58] towards  women  which 
 from  that  video  your  views  towards  women 
 seem  very  negative  because
[110:03] i  believe  they  were  very  negative  at 
 that  time 
 whether  they  are  now  or  not  i  don't  know
[110:08] i  i  don't  know  it's  like 
 when  we  were  in  a  relationship  like  i
[110:13] remember  i'd  say  to  you  all  the  time 
 like  the  guy  that  you  were 
 when  for  the  majority  of  the  time  that
[110:19] we  knew  each  other  even  though  like  the 
 time  we  were  spending  together  was  like 
 still  the  same  but  we're  still  getting 
 on  the  same
[110:24] seemed  like  you  were  a  completely 
 different  guy  like  i 
 i  wasn't  in  love  with  that  guy  i  was  in
[110:29] love  with  the  guy  i  was  in  a 
 relationship  with 
 but  like  when  this  is  a  video  that
[110:35] you've  posted  on  the  internet  people 
 can't  differentiate
[110:40] people  aren't  in  the  people  aren't  in 
 the  relationship  the  only  people  that 
 were  in  the  relationship  is  me  and  you
[110:47] so  they  they  didn't  know  the  extent  of 
 the  good 
 and  like  i've  spoken  to  my  grandparents
[110:52] afterwards  like  i've  spoke  to  my  nana 
 like 
 she  said  like  he  was  like  a  very
[110:57] positive  influence  like  i  do  think  he 
 was  a  good  guy  like  he  wanted  what  was 
 best  for  you  but 
 he  just  got  some  [ __ ]  up  views
[111:07] i  think  you  like  whether  you  do  now  or 
 not  but  i  think  in  the  past  you  have  had 
 some
[111:12] very  very  very  negative  news  towards 
 women  but  you  even  said  to  me  yourself 
 that  you  hated  women
[111:18] no  do  you  still
[111:23] no  that  was  a  long  time  ago  and 
 i'm  glad  i've  experienced  that  that  it's
[111:29] a  transition  that 
 these  guys  are  going  through  and  and 
 it's  a
[111:34] lot  more  common  than  most  people  think 
 it  is  the  majority  of  young  guys  hate 
 women
[111:39] because  the  world's  against  them  women 
 are  against  them  they  don't  understand 
 how  women  work  and  when  they  do  try  and 
 find  out  that  they're  branded  as  creeps
[111:46] they're  branded  as  like  weirdos  and 
 misogynists  and 
 and  in  cells  and  all  this  [ __ ]  and
[111:55] it's  not  exactly  like  something  fair  to 
 say  it's  like  oh  he's  got  such  a 
 negative  view  because
[112:01] i  have  to  counter  and  say  yeah  but 
 everyone  does  is  when 
 if  for  example  a  girl  says  oh  men  are
[112:06] trash  which  for  example  you've  at  least 
 either  said  that  before  or  you've  like 
 had  that  feeling  before  like  oh  these 
 guys  are  just  dicks  that's  that's
[112:12] horrible  that's  toxic  and  every  so  we 
 can  say  every  girl 
 every  mod  like  middle  um  my  age  girl
[112:18] like  20  year  old  girl  is  toxic 
 but  then  that's  just  a  stupid  conclusion 
 to  make  and  at  that  point  we  can  say
[112:24] okay 
 either  everyone's  toxic  or  we  are  now  at 
 the  baseline  where 
 the  baseline  is  toxic  and  above  that  is
[112:30] like  something  else 
 above  that  is  like  misogynistic 
 assumption  and  extremely  extremely  toxic 
 and  elusive
[112:35] and  abusive  and  i  wasn't  there 
 i  was  about  here  but  i  was  i  was  making
[112:41] it 
 honestly  i  was  about  here  making  videos 
 for  people  who  were  about  here
[112:46] but  i'm  like  i'm  at  the  level  if  this  is 
 my  ego  i  don't  know  but  i'm  at  the  level 
 where  i'm
[112:51] past  the  normal  level  of  toxicity  i'm  at 
 like  the  acceptance  stage  where  like 
 i  understand  how  this  stuff  works
[112:57] because  i've  spent  five  years 
 researching  it 
 like  i've  done  more  than  a  master's
[113:02] degree  of  how  of  behavioral  science 
 of  how  men  and  women  interact  with  each 
 other
[113:07] i  don't  know  i  i  don't  think  i  i  mean 
 obviously  yeah  you've  done  the
[113:12] the  work  behind  it  but  i  don't  agree 
 with  that  i  think 
 from  my  experience  on  what
[113:18] a  healthy  relationship  is  and  when  i've 
 spoken  to  people  about 
 what  their  view  of  a  healthy
[113:23] relationship  is  like  all  the  things  that 
 you 
 said  to  me  weren't  healthy  not  old
[113:29] things  like  old  things 
 that  we're  talking  about  you  know  i  mean 
 all  the  bad  things  but
[113:34] so  i  was  i  wasn't  good  either  i  wasn't 
 great  you
[113:39] things  that  you  said  were  worse  i  think 
 but  i  wasn't  great  either
[113:53] yeah  like  your  boundaries 
 boundaries  um  we're  much  more  extreme
[114:00] than  mine 
 cut  in  those  fingers  though
[114:06] but  yeah  my  boundaries  were  more  extreme 
 that's  because 
 i  was  doing  less  of  the  things  that
[114:11] would  make  you  anxious  so  naturally  mine 
 would  be 
 more  restrictive  i  wasn't  going  out
[114:16] clubbing  clubs  aren't  even  open 
 what  was  the  the  problem  through  all
[114:21] this  if  i  was  saying  this  and  you  were 
 like  oh 
 still  to  this  day  you  said  i  didn't  even 
 want  there  you  go  boys  we  got  her
[114:29] she  dipped  out  of  the  course  she  had 
 nothing  to  say  for  that  one's  gonna  die
[114:50] i  you  have 
 really  bad  trust  issues
[114:55] [Music] 
 like  really  bad  and  i  remember  when  we
[115:01] used  to  have  conversations 
 and  this  would  usually  be  when  i  was
[115:06] not  empathetic  towards  your  insecurities 
 i  think  this  would  always 
 pretty  much  always  be  the  situation
[115:12] where  that  would  happen  where  we'd  get 
 onto  the  conversation  of  trust  and  you'd 
 say 
 um  oh  like  i  wouldn't  ever  cheat  on  you
[115:19] but  it  could  happen  he's  like 
 like  say  if  we  were  in  a  bad  patch  and 
 like  a  girl  approached  me
[115:24] like  it  could  happen  like  i  could  see 
 myself  doing  it 
 and  when  i  would  turn  around  and  say  to
[115:30] you  it  wouldn't  happen 
 like  it  would  never  ever  ever  no  matter
[115:35] what  bad  patch  we  were  in  it  would  never 
 happen  and  you  would  say 
 no  like  you're  not  being  truthful  like 
 it  could  happen  of  course  it  could
[115:41] happen 
 i'm  not  going  to  say  it  could  happen 
 when  it  wouldn't  and  i 
 i  believe  now  and  i  said  this  to  you  at
[115:49] the  time  as  well  and  i  think  this  is 
 probably  why  i  used  to  get  so  upset  well 
 it  is  why  i  used  to  get  so  upset
[115:54] um  i  felt  like  your  lack  of  trust  in  me 
 was  a  reflection  of  yourself
[116:00] because  in  your  brain  it  seemed 
 physically  capable  for  you  to  cheat  on 
 me 
 whereas  in  my  brain  it  it  wasn't  even  it
[116:07] wasn't  even  part  of  it  like  me  and  my 
 ex-boyfriend 
 like  you  know  what  we  went  through  like
[116:12] we  went  through  some  of  the  worst 
 patches  you  could  have  ever  imagined 
 not  once  did  i  ever  cheat  on  him  i  was
[116:17] still  going  to  nightclubs  i  would  have 
 guys  approach  me  in  nightclubs 
 turn  around  and  tell  them  to  effort  like
[116:24] not  once  did  i  even  think  about  it  in  a 
 three-year  relationship 
 where  we  were  having  some  of  the  worst
[116:29] patches  like  obviously  i'm  not  going  to 
 go  into  it  but 
 some  of  the  worst  patches  you  could  have 
 ever  ever  ever  imagined
[116:37] and  not  once  did  i  think  about  it  and  i 
 think  that  i  think  that's  why  i  became
[116:42] unempathetic  because  i  would  get 
 frustrated  that  you 
 i  felt  like  you  weren't  believing  me
[116:48] when  i  was  saying  that  i  would  never 
 cheat  on  you 
 when  i  wouldn't  have  like  no  matter
[116:54] what  bad  patch  we  were  in  like  no  matter 
 whether  you  cheated  on  me  which  like 
 i  won't  be  still  be  with  you  but  say  if
[117:00] you  had  cheated  on  me  and  we  had  to  stay 
 together 
 or  anything  like  no  no  amount  of  being
[117:05] in  a  bad  couch  would 
 ever  ever  ever  change  my  values  and  my 
 morals  and  my  values  my  morals  are  that
[117:10] you  don't  cheat  on  someone  that  you're 
 with  like  i  think  that's  like 
 lowest  of  the  low  like  absolute  scum
[117:15] like  anyone  who  cheats  like 
 it  it  just  doesn't  make  it  honestly
[117:20] makes  no  sense  to  me 
 at  all  like  why  are you  gonna  hurt  the
[117:25] person  that  you're  supposed  to  be  in 
 love  with 
 and  i  think  that's  why  i  was 
 unempathetic  because  to  me
[117:30] it  was  physically  like  it  wasn't  even  a 
 possibility  that  i'd  cheat  on  you  not 
 even
[117:35] like  if  anything  had  happened  whereas  to 
 you  when  you  were  saying  to  me
[117:40] oh  um 
 when  you'd  say  to  me  oh  my  brain  is
[117:45] broke 
 when  you'd  say  to  me  that  it  was
[117:50] possible  for  you  to  do  it  i  think  that's 
 what  hurt  me  because  it  felt  like  your 
 lack  of  trust  was  a  reflection  of
[117:55] your  possible  like  unfaithfulness
[118:01] that  could  be  it's  hard  for  me  to  like 
 fully  say  but  i  mean 
 i  do  hear  that  that's  something  that
[118:07] happens  with  people  is 
 if  they  feel  untrustworthy  themselves 
 then  they  think  the  other  person's 
 untrustworthy
[118:12] so  that  could  have  but  then 
 i  mean  it  could  have  it's  hard  for  me  to
[118:17] like  say  yes  or  no  but  when 
 instantly  i  thought  about  my  first 
 girlfriend  and  i  felt  the  same  way
[118:23] and  after  reading  more  about 
 some  things  about  relationships
[118:29] something  stuck  out  to  me  recently  and 
 it  said  that
[118:34] don't  know  if  i'm  just  using  this  as 
 some  kind  of  basic  excuse  but  it  did  say 
 like 
 you  you  get  the  you  expect  the  love  that
[118:41] you  got  from 
 your  parents  and  it  does  seem  like  to  be 
 generally  true
[118:47] and  somewhat  i  think  that 
 my  expectations  of  of
[118:53] like  anxiousness  and  broken  love 
 reflects  my  childhood  experiences  of
[118:59] of  somewhat  like  an  abusive  house  and 
 that's  my  my  view  of  relationships
[119:05] because  i've  never  exactly  trusted 
 anyone  i've  been  with  because 
 it's  not  it's  not  an  insult  on  you  and
[119:10] your  faithfulness  it's  more 
 i  can't  imagine  how  anyone  would  be
[119:17] faithful  to  me 
 do  you  think  that  you  would  have  cheated 
 on  this
[119:23] no  but  this  is  a  different  question  to 
 what  originally  we  were  speaking  about 
 though  the
[119:28] i  know
[119:33] i  was  like  madly  in  love  with  you  like 
 not  even  in  love 
 not  just  like  normal  people  love  like  i
[119:38] was  on  the  extreme  level 
 like  there  was  not  even  like  i  was  going 
 to  say  there's  not  a  possibility  but
[119:43] that's  that's  false  the  reason  why  you 
 when  you  ask  me  or  is  there  a  chance
[119:48] like  i  i  don't  believe  anyone  could  say 
 that  oh  no  there's  no  chance  whatsoever 
 i  think  that  consciously  it  sounds  so
[119:54] nice  to  think  like  oh  no  no  100 
 it's  not  gonna  happen  but  i  think  that
[119:59] are  you  literally  saying  that  there's 
 like  a  zero  percent  chance  there's 
 almost  nothing  has  a  zero  percent  chance
[120:04] almost  and  so  there  is  like  a  zero  point 
 something  percent  chance  for  it  to 
 happen  when
[120:09] for  example  i  think  we're  going  to  break 
 up  anyway  and  you've  you've  cheated  on 
 me  you've  hurt  me  or 
 where  you  know  something's  like  [ __ ]  has
[120:15] happened  i  think  we're  going  to  break  up 
 and  someone's  like  entered  my  life  at 
 this  point  and  they've  said  the  right 
 things  and  i'm  feeling  the  right
[120:20] emotions  like 
 it  can  happen  and  yeah  i  wasn't 
 empathetic  to  you 
 to  you  because  this  this  now  that  i  say
[120:27] it  like  this  makes  me  think  that  this 
 was  a  very  like 
 analytical  logical  way  to  think  about
[120:34] probability  and  [ __ ]  instead  of  thinking 
 about  how  you  do  it  with  emotions  which 
 is  oh  [ __ ]  he  just  said  that  he  could
[120:39] cheat  on  me  whereas  i  was 
 like  i  was  thinking  like  is  there  more 
 than  a  zero  point  is  like  greater  than
[120:44] sign  a  zero  percent  chance  like  i  guess 
 they  would  be  like  let  me  add  up  all  the 
 variables  like
[120:49] and  the  thing  is  if  you  do  that  you  have 
 to  be  a  liar  to  say  like  oh  no  it's 
 still  going  to  be  zero
[120:54] you  have  to  be  because  yeah  the  person 
 can  hurt  you 
 yeah  so  then  but  the  thing  is  like
[121:01] like  it  could  happen  of  course  and  thank 
 you  like  for  saying  that 
 because  i  think  that  is  a  big  thing  that
[121:07] made  me  feel  insecure  in  our 
 relationship  was  how  you  would  always 
 say  that  but  it's  like  yeah  but  if  it
[121:12] wouldn't  happen 
 it  couldn't  like  of  course  it  could 
 happen  like 
 of  course  when  you  were  asking  me  like
[121:18] oh  could  it  happen  like  like  could  you 
 see  yourself 
 i'm  not  asking  you  could  it  i'm  asking 
 you  would  it  but  no  you  guys  don't  think
[121:25] that's  that  though 
 because  you  used  to  ask  that  like  like 
 you  did  today  like  a  little  bit  later 
 and  i'd  say  no  and  then  you  get  confused
[121:31] but  you  just  said  that 
 because  you're  asking  each  other  feel 
 like  in  my  head  could  it  happen
[121:36] is  like  you  physically  thinking  would  it 
 happen  yeah 
 i  wasn't  thinking  about  the
[121:41] probabilities  i  never  even  thought  of  it 
 like  that  until  you  said  it 
 yeah  i  think  the  thing  is  like  people
[121:47] who  are  gonna  cheat  are  gonna  cheat 
 regardless 
 of  what  environment  they're  in  like
[121:53] no  no  that  is  so  true  that  is  so  true 
 like 
 that  girl  the  girl  at  the  gym  rings  all
[121:59] she  did  was  go  for  a  walk 
 and  she  cheated  on  her  boyfriend
[122:04] nah  all  she  did  was  go  through  real  life 
 of  course  of  course  it's  easier  in  the 
 club 
 i  don't  know  serial  cheaters  will  but
[122:12] without  i'd  have  to  go  into  like  vulgar 
 detail  to  explain  how  it  truly  happens 
 but
[122:17] through  my  experiences  which  i've  told 
 the  boys  as  well  to  be  honest  for  like 
 two  hours  into  the  podcast  i  can  speak
[122:22] pretty  unfiltered 
 so  i've  told  the  boys  and  i  think  i've 
 told  you  as  well  about  half  of  my
[122:28] the  girls  that  i've  been  with  have  been 
 with  her  bad  boyfriends  and 
 through  this  experience  the  same
[122:37] thing  always  pops  into  my  mind  is  that 
 it  is  a  situation  that  builds  it  and
[122:42] there's  about  like  five  like  triggers  of 
 this 
 and  problems  with  the  boyfriend  is 
 always  number  one
[122:47] because  if  you  were  like  very  very  like 
 a  you  know  on  our  good  days  we're  like 
 proper  hugging  each  other  you're  not
[122:52] you're  not  even  gonna 
 like  it  could  not  even  that's  a  zero 
 percent  day 
 but  never  gonna  happen  on  that  day
[122:58] anyway 
 it  was  gonna  go  from  zero  to  like  zero 
 zero  zero  point  one  percent
[123:03] when  we  think  we're  going  to  break  up 
 anyway  when  you  feel  close  to  the  line 
 because  i've  done  something  stupid  or 
 you  know  something  happens
[123:09] if  for  example  on  that  day  like 
 everything  went  down  we  we 
 ended  on  that  day  but  for  example  if  we 
 didn't  but  your  parents  were  saying  oh
[123:15] no  you  can't  be  with  him  but  we  didn't 
 end  on  that  day 
 then  if  you  went  out  then  if  the  right
[123:20] attractive  guy  came  and  he  said  like  the 
 right  words  to  you  and  you  were  feeling 
 him 
 then  the  probability  goes  up  like  the
[123:26] situation  builds  and  it  is 
 yeah  like  the  point  just  was  because
[123:31] the  thing  that  i  was  anxious  and  i  had 
 boundaries  about  was  the  situation  that 
 i  could  see  happening  where  it  is  always
[123:37] night  time  at  least  it's  always  alcohol 
 related  it's  always 
 like  female  friends  related  all  the
[123:44] girls  i've  been  with  it's 
 honestly  largely  because  their  their 
 female  friends  kind  of  like
[123:49] made  it  happen  and  we  were  all  drinking 
 and  it  was  nighttime  and  she  was  having 
 problems  with  the  boyfriend  and 
 generally  i  was  higher  value  than  the
[123:55] boyfriend 
 now  maybe  my  big  fight  ego  but  it  would 
 be  difficult
[124:00] for  you  to  like  see  someone  who  was 
 better  than  me 
 but  it  does  happen  like  there  are  some
[124:05] [ __ ]  like  good  guys  out  there 
 and  some  attractive  ass  guy  can  approach 
 you  and  it  like  it  can't  happen
[124:11] it's  not  gonna  happen  that  often  and 
 it's  quite  funny  because  it's  like 
 it's  hard  to  be  better  than  me  but  i've
[124:17] been  embarrassed  i've  been  in  bad 
 practices  and  gone  on  nights  out  and  not 
 cheated  i've  been  on  i've  been  in  bad 
 patches
[124:22] i've  gone  on  nights  out  and  had  guys 
 approach  me  that  i  found  attractive 
 didn't  cheat  that's  most  of  the  situ
[124:28] that's  most  of  the 
 the  factors  a  couple  more  factors  and
[124:33] it  could  have  like  no  no  amount  of 
 factors  like  i
[124:39] ultimately  i  can't  blame  you  for  feeling 
 this  way  because  i  know  myself  no  one 
 can  ever  know  you
[124:44] to  the  extent  that  you  know  yourself  i 
 know  that  i'd  never  do  that  like 
 i'm  not  asked  about  going  out  and
[124:49] getting  with  guys  like  i  literally  went 
 to  a  house  party  a few  days 
 ago  didn't  even  think  about  it  not  and
[124:54] didn't  even  think  about  it  for  one 
 second  i  went  there  to  be  with  my 
 friends 
 and  to  have  a  nice  time  with  my  friends
[124:59] i  didn't  go  because  i  want  to  get  with 
 the  guy
[125:05] but  this  is  the  tricky  part  because 
 it's  not  a  conscious  decision  it's  not
[125:11] it's  it  never  is  that's  the  thing  no  one 
 actually  thinks  themselves  like  oh  i'm 
 going  to  cheat  today
[125:17] no  of  course  not  but  only 
 when  you  think  about  okay  you  know
[125:22] you've  had  the  opportunity  with  your  ex 
 for  example  but  like  10  times  over  the 
 times  you  went  to  the  clubs  and  stuff
[125:28] when  this  keeps  happening  but  you  end  up 
 staying  together  for  literally 
 three  four  five  years  that's  when  it
[125:33] starts  happening  because  at  that  point 
 you've  had 
 a  hundred  situations  where  it  could  have 
 happened  and  then  it  only  needs  to
[125:39] happen  once  for  the  entire  thing  to 
 crumble 
 now  yeah  when  i  look  back  on  it  i  just 
 think  like
[125:45] so  me  from  a  couple  months  like  one  two 
 months  ago  i was  just  thinking  like 
 like  what  what  benefit  what  positive  was
[125:52] there  for  you  to  even  have  this 
 this  feeling  of  this  foreseeable  future
[125:57] to  think  oh  she  could  cheat  on  you  like 
 why  not  just  act  as  if  she'll  never 
 cheat  on  you  and  go  up  with  that  because
[126:02] she'll  be  less  likely  to  cheat  on  you 
 and  you'll  be  less  likely  to  break  up 
 if  you  just  kind  of  hold  the  identity
[126:07] that  she  never  will  anyway  instead  of 
 expressing  that  oh 
 it  could  happen  like  maybe  if  john  so
[126:12] i'd  like  i  see  it  from  your  point  of 
 view  because  me 
 holding  that that  insecurity  and  that
[126:17] jealousy 
 it's  just  it's  like  autistic  it's  just 
 unvaluable  in  every  sense
[126:23] it  doesn't  do  anything  positive  and  all 
 it  does  is  just  make  it  more  likely  to 
 happen  because
[126:28] you're  obviously  going  to  go  through 
 more  problems  this  way  yeah  of  course 
 do  you  think  i  would  have  cheated
[126:36] no  but  i  mean  if  we  talk  about  the 
 probability
[126:41] i  could  see  i  can  see  like  it  could 
 happen 
 0.000
[126:57] do yeah  think  i  would  have  do  you  think 
 like 
 there  was  like  a  pretty  big  chance  like
[127:03] 10  15 
 like  it  would  have  happened  over  a 
 couple  years 
 yeah  yeah  when  we  were  together  no
[127:11] but  when  we  broke  up  i  remember  thinking 
 about  it  and  i  was  like 
 yeah  this  guy  would  have  cheated  on  me
[127:18] like  this  is  gonna  sound  [ __ ] 
 horrible  to  say  but  i'm  glad 
 i  got  out  of  our  relationship  granted
[127:26] well  it  didn't  go  on  any  longer  although 
 it  was  painful  it  was  like  literally  one 
 of 
 the  most  painful  things  i've  ever
[127:32] experienced  in  my  whole  life  like 
 it  was  horrendous  or  i  was
[127:37] grateful  because 
 i've  been  debating  whether  to  say  this
[127:43] or  not  for  the  whole  thing  but  i'm  like 
 [ __ ]  it  do  i  just  i  you
[127:49] i've  like  read  into  it  and  stuff  since 
 we  broke  up  because 
 um  i've  like  struggled
[127:56] you  were  showing  all  of  the  first  signs 
 of  abuse
[128:01] like  what  controlling
[128:06] gaslighting  because  you  got 
 you  did  gas  like  me  you  made  me  feel  so
[128:11] guilty 
 like  so  guilty  pudding  what's  good
[128:16] it's  when  you  it's  a  form  of  emotional 
 manipulation  where  you 
 make  the  person  feel  like  they're
[128:23] like  guilty  for  everything  or  make  them 
 feel  like  they're 
 like  going  crazy  and  i  remember
[128:30] i 
 just  heard  the  noise  home  below  that's
[128:36] kind  of  good 
 yeah  i'm  literally  like  my  all  my 
 housemates  because  i'm  back  at  you  now
[128:41] if  you  can't  tell 
 or  my  housemates  have  moved  out  so  i'm 
 just  i'm  well  once  but
[128:46] what  was  i  even  saying  oh  yeah 
 gaslighting  um  basically  where  you  kind
[128:53] of  make 
 not  it  is  question  their  sanity  but 
 that's  like  an  extreme
[128:58] case  so  basically  just  like  when  i  was 
 at  uni 
 when  i  came  back  to  york  um  i  remember
[129:04] you  say  to  me  that  oh  like  you've  not 
 reassured  me  at  all  since  you've  been 
 back  which 
 i  messed  up  and  i  did  that  instagram
[129:10] thing  but  like 
 i  admitted  that  was  messed  up  and  i 
 shouldn't  have  done  that
[129:15] but  and  you're  like  oh  you  haven't 
 reassured  me  like  you've  essentially 
 behaved  in  the  exact  way  that  i  was
[129:21] scared  of  you  behaving  but  literally 
 every  single  day  i  was  sending  you  so 
 many  messages  like
[129:26] you'd  wake  up  every  morning  to  a  massive 
 paragraph  for  me  tell  me  how  much  i 
 loved  you  like  voice  notes  and  you  made
[129:33] me  feel  like  i  wasn't  doing  that  and 
 it's  only  when  i  came  out  of  the 
 situation  i  was  like
[129:38] okay  what  what  else  did  you  expect  from 
 me
[129:44] and  it's  like  i  felt  i  felt  like  i  was 
 in  the  wrong 
 for  wanting  to  go  on  a  night  out  with  my
[129:50] friends  once  every  year  or 
 wanting  to  go  and  visit  my  friend  in 
 london  i  felt  like
[129:55] guilty  i  was  like  oh  i  shouldn't  want  to 
 do  those  things  anyway  like  it's  going 
 to 
 harms  are  anxious  which  yeah  to  an
[130:00] extent  but  you're  gonna  feel  anxious  in 
 those  situations  like  you  do  feel 
 anxious  when  your  partner  goes  out
[130:05] like  i've  had  that  exact  thing  i'm  like 
 what  if  he's  cheating  on  me  my  wife  is
[130:10] cheating  on  me  but  he's  like  no  he's  not 
 that's  just  the  anxious  part  of  my  brain 
 that's  being  stupid
[130:17] it's  not  the  real  belief
[130:23] i  feel  like  i've  just  explained  that 
 really  really  badly  but  i'll  get  your 
 point 
 i  mean  i  could  be  abusive  and  i  think
[130:30] you  are 
 i'm  not  saying  that  to  be  hurtful  i'm
[130:35] just  i  think  we  both  have  a  lot  like 
 this  is  why  i've  done  this  call  because 
 i  think  we  both  have  a  lot  to  learn  from
[130:41] that  we  don't  even 
 really  know  because  we  haven't  told  each 
 other  yeah
[130:49] i  think  you  are  abusive  hanzo 
 emotionally  anyway 
 i  remember  you  saying  to  me  that  a  few
[130:54] girls  have  said  that  to  you  in  the  past 
 that's  what  i  was  thinking  at  first  i 
 was  thinking  like
[131:01] like  oh  women  are  strange  because
[131:08] women  the  women  who  have  said  this  are 
 the  ones  who  like  me  the  most
[131:13] and  so  what  what  should  a  guy  do  if
[131:19] like  this  is  what  women  seem  to  want 
 this  is  what  women  are  like  attracted  to
[131:24] because  when  you've  been  emotionally 
 abused  and  manipulated  by  someone
[131:29] you  feel  like  you  have  to  clean  i  i 
 can't 
 i  know  it  in  my  head  but  i  can't  fully
[131:34] explain  it  but  it's  like 
 you  feel  the  need  to  like  cling  on  to 
 them  i  think  you  feel  more  attached  to
[131:39] them  because 
 they're  not  constantly  giving  you  good 
 attention  all  the  time  it's  like  when 
 they  do  it's  like  can  you  get  so
[131:44] attached 
 like  why  do  people  why  people  in  a 
 relate  an  abusive  relationship  and  stay
[131:49] in  it  for  30  years 
 you  get  attached  i  promise  you  this
[131:56] isn't 
 like  the  way  that  you  need  to  act  to  get 
 girls  like 
 it's  it's  not  nice  like
[132:04] the  the  mental  damage  that  you've  caused 
 me  in  just 
 three  days  of  being  controlling  and
[132:11] abusive 
 literally  it  was  it  was  like  everything 
 was  so  good  and  it  just  turned  to  [ __ ] 
 in  literally  three  days
[132:17] like  i'm  not  like  recovered  from  that
[132:22] like  you've  really  really  damaged  me 
 mentally 
 like  really  badly
[132:32] how 
 i  don't  know  how  to  exactly  like  put  it 
 into  words  but  i  don't  know
[132:37] how  does  it  make  you  feel 
 um
[132:46] depressed  and  anxious 
 and 
 [Music]
[132:52] like 
 it's  not  even  a  feeling  i  can  describe
[133:02] i  wouldn't  wish  anyone  to  feel  the  way 
 that  you  made  me  feel
[133:11] my  perception  of  it  is  that
[133:17] i  i  just  set  my  boundaries 
 like  i  you  know  i  said  that  i  didn't
[133:24] want  to  be  with  a  girl  who 
 would  do  x  for  example  x  and  if  you
[133:30] wanted  to 
 not  exactly  like  oh  you  know  if  you 
 wanted  to  stay  with  me  but  it  was  like 
 your  conscious  decision  to  think  oh
[133:36] x  is  worth  less  than  hamza  so  i'll  be 
 with  hamza 
 so  that  to  me  doesn't  seem  like  it  would
[133:41] be  like 
 mentally  traumatic  no  it  was  just
[133:46] things  over  time  like  the  gaslighting 
 and  thinking  back  to  things  that  you 
 said  in  the  past  and
[133:53] just  the  like  i  don't  know  your  attitude 
 towards  certain  things  like  i  remember 
 when
[133:58] you  went  to  have  the  conversation  with 
 my  granddad  i  remember  i  was  on  the 
 facetime  call  with  you  and  i  was  crying
[134:03] and  i  was  like  can  you  please  come  and 
 have  a  conversation  with  him  tomorrow 
 and  you  were  like  no  it's  a  work  day
[134:08] which  i  complete  like  i  completely 
 understand  like  yeah  it's  a  work  day 
 like  work  is 
 the  priority  as  you  always  used  to  say
[134:15] um 
 but  you  it  just  seemed  like  you  were  you
[134:20] seemed  very  like  insensitive  like  i 
 remember  you  weren't  even  like  looking 
 at  me  you  were  just  doing  something  on
[134:25] your  computer  and 
 that  was  actually  like  crying  and 
 begging  you  and  being  like  please  like 
 i'm 
 i'm  struggling  so  much  like  i  really
[134:30] just  need  you  to  have  this  conversation 
 with  him 
 and  i  mean  yeah  you  would  breathe  in  the
[134:36] end  but  you  were  like  no 
 you  don't  know  sorry  baby  no  and  like 
 that  just
[134:41] hurt  because  i  needed  that  from  you  so 
 badly  like 
 i  remember  like  literally  begging  you
[134:46] being  like  please  i  need  this  like 
 like  i  need  i  literally  need  you  to  have 
 this  conversation
[134:53] and  i  just  felt  like  you  were  very  like 
 insensitive  towards  it  i  don't  know  i 
 just  felt  like  i  saw 
 the  old  you  in  the  last  few  days  of  our
[134:59] relationship 
 and  it  kind  of  scared  me
[135:05] that  makes  sense  as  we  got  closer  and  i 
 was  able  to 
 like  peel  back  the  onion  layers  i  was
[135:12] able  to  show  you  like 
 the  sweet  side  of  me  the  the  un
[135:17] um  i  don't  know  what  you  call  it  but  i 
 was  able  to  show  you  like 
 maybe  i  can't  tell  if  it's  the  real  side
[135:23] of  me  you  know  it  probably  is  if  it  was 
 like  the 
 side  of  me  that  was  coming  out  when  we 
 were  like  in  love  with  each  other  and 
 that  so  that's  probably  the  real  side
[135:29] the  real  side  to  you  but  i  think  the 
 side  that  you 
 not  necessarily  a  side  that  you  put  on
[135:35] as  a  facade 
 but  i  feel  like  maybe  you  initially  put 
 it  on  as  a  facade  and  now  that's  like
[135:40] become  who  you  are  like  in  social 
 situations  but  i  think  who  you  were  with 
 me  was  the  real  you
[135:45] because  it  was  a  complete  decide  to  have 
 never  been  anywhere 
 yeah  that's  actually  something  that  i've
[135:50] thought  and  i've  spoke  to  the  boys  about 
 is 
 when  you  do  get  into  the  culture  that
[135:56] i'm  in  when  you  when  you  talk 
 like  talking  about  like  cringy  [ __ ]  like 
 alpha  male  bitter  male  and  [ __ ]  it's
[136:01] like 
 automatically  you  are  gonna 
 push  towards  that  even  if  you're  trying
[136:07] to  remain  you  know 
 like  oh  yeah  we  want  we  want  to  be 
 individual  but  for  example  like 
 girls  don't  exactly  do  this  right  but  a
[136:13] lot  of  guys  who  have  watched  this  but  i 
 could  almost  guess  that  100  of  the guys 
 who  are  still  watching
[136:18] have  watched  the  video  on  for  example 
 how  to  increase  testosterone 
 and  i  doubt  you  know  a  single  girl  who's
[136:24] ever  searched  unless  if  it  was  medical 
 related  like  how  to  increase  estrogen  to 
 be  like  more 
 womanly  and  attractive  to  men  well  guys
[136:30] do  this  [ __ ]  because  we  need  every 
 little  bit  of  like  advantage  we  can 
 and  so  we  watch  a  video  like  this  and  it
[136:35] says  oh  the  the  alpha  male  does  this  and 
 he 
 and  he  speaks  with  a  deeper  voice  and  he
[136:40] and  he  takes  up  more  and  so  we're  like 
 oh  yeah 
 okay  yeah  me  too  but  next  one  x  so  we 
 start  doing  it  we  fake  it  till  we  make
[136:46] it  people  start  believing  in  it  we  get 
 more  confidence  we  go  to  the  gym  because 
 going  to  the  gym  building  the  body  make
[136:51] essentially  fools  people  to  think  that 
 this  was  your  natural  genetics  and 
 you're  better  than  them  naturally  and 
 this  is  why
[136:56] it's  attractive  to  women  it's  not  that 
 they  actually  care  about  the  fact  that 
 you've  done  a  thousand  workout 
 issues  that  it  makes  your  genetics  seem
[137:02] better  yeah  it's  just  the  attraction 
 that  it  gives  you  yeah 
 so  we  do  this  stuff  and  it's  like  you 
 you
[137:07] you  forget  who  you  were  at  the  start  but 
 then  also 
 is  that  even  you  anymore  because  the
[137:13] thousand  workouts  does  truly  change  you 
 and  you  do  get  a  sense  of  like 
 of  you  know  that  discipline  and  and  for
[137:19] a  lot  of  guys  it  does  turn  into  a 
 cockiness  and  it  did  for  me 
 because  you  do  get  if  you've  been
[137:25] zero  to  100  if  you've  been  the  [ __ ] 
 sim  to  pimp  you  do  get  cockiness  from 
 that 
 and  i  found  that  it  does  go  like  this
[137:31] where  like  cockiness 
 hits  here  because  right  now  all  the 
 gains  all  the 
 the  result  is  new  and  obviously  like  the
[137:38] ego  hasn't  caught  up  to  it 
 and  eventually  it  becomes  natural  and 
 it's  like  okay  now  i'm  like
[137:43] the  the  natural  person  who's  used  to 
 this 
 yeah  i  feel  uh
[137:51] yeah  so  it  can  go  i  forgot  what  the 
 point  was  right  like  it  can
[137:57] about  personality  in  it  because  i  i've 
 was  wondering  this  as  well 
 because  there  was  times
[138:05] no  i'll  let  you  finish  because  i  wasn't 
 even  sure  i  was  gonna  say
[138:12] there  was  times  when  i  remember  when  you 
 you  were  like  proper  proper  insulin  you
[138:18] you  proper  found  me  cute  and  everything 
 when 
 it  was  like  the  opposite  of  what
[138:25] is  it  a  persona  i  don't  know  but  you  can 
 say  that  there's  two  versions  of  me  that 
 you  saw 
 there  was  like  and  and  this  is  the  issue
[138:32] because 
 you  you  got  with  the  first  guy  that's 
 the  thing  like  the  first  guy
[138:39] he  was  like 
 the  reason  why  you  stayed  around  and
[138:44] actually  got  to  witness  the  second  guy 
 and  this  is  at  least  like  these  boys
[138:49] yeah 
 right  if  i  was  originally  the  second  guy 
 i  would  have  been  like  the  guys  on  your
[138:54] snapchat  with  where  we  have  a  40  day 
 conversation  and  you're  not  meeting  me 
 because  you'd  be  meeting  a  guy  like  the
[138:59] first  guy 
 i  was  the  first  guy  i  was  i  was  like  the 
 avoidant  style  like  the  [ __ ]  boy  style
[139:04] and  that's  what  actually  attracted  you 
 you  you 
 were  attracted  because  of  that  masculine
[139:09] like  alpha  male  type  of  [ __ ] 
 but  you  stayed  because  of  the  pain  but  i 
 wasn't  i  wasn't  looking  for  a
[139:15] relationship 
 i  didn't  want  a  relationship  with  you 
 like  for  the  most  like  for  the  first
[139:20] part  of  our  relationship 
 well  not  relationship  but  like  you  know 
 i  mean  like  first  part  was  knowing  each
[139:25] other 
 like  i  remember  we  we  literally  like
[139:30] wouldn't  text  apart  from  when  we  would 
 see  each  other  like 
 usually  you'd  message  me  to  come  and  see
[139:36] me  to  come  and  see  you 
 um  and  i  literally
[139:42] wouldn't  i'm  gonna  be  saying  to  me  as  a 
 joke  you'd  be  like  oh  you've  been 
 thinking  about  me  and  i'd  be  like 
 no  i  literally  like  i  wouldn't  think
[139:49] about  you  unless  you  messaged  me  to  come 
 and  see  you  like  that's  the  only  time 
 i'd  ever  think  about  you
[139:54] so  it  wasn't  like  i  was  going  into  this 
 one  in  a  relationship  i  never  wanted  a 
 relationship  from  you  and  like
[140:00] i  thought  you  were  an  absolute  like  dick 
 like  literally  my  nickname 
 i've  called  you  a  what  was  it  a  scumbag
[140:06] that  was  the  little  nickname  i  made  for 
 you  a  scumbag  like  i  thought  that  you
[140:11] were  an 
 absolute  like  egotistical  like  arrogant
[140:16] like  that  you're  attracted  to  and  this 
 is  why  guys  are  confused
[140:24] we  just  got  on  and  then 
 when  like  we  both  started  like  getting
[140:29] feelings  but  didn't  admit  it 
 i  think  the  second  you  had  started  to 
 come  out  a  little  bit  because  that's  why
[140:35] i 
 kind  of  started  getting  feelings  because 
 we  started  it  was  kind  of  weird  we 
 started  acting  like
[140:41] i  think  we  both  had  like  two  sides  to  us 
 and  slowly  we  started  showing  like
[140:47] the  vulnerable  real  honest  side  tools 
 which  we  because  we  just  you've  done  the 
 same  thing  maybe  to  less  of  an  extent
[140:53] because  you  haven't  actually  done  like 
 the  whole  like 
 self-improvement  as  much  as  i  have  but
[140:59] you  definitely  had  like  a  different 
 persona  as  well  the  first  times  like  you 
 were  just 
 standing  basically  yeah  like  you're
[141:05] you're  i  was  very 
 i  was  very  different  when  we  first  met 
 yeah  i  was  a  very  very  very  different
[141:10] person  when  we  first  met 
 you  you  did  develop  as  a  person  but  it
[141:15] was  also 
 this  the  version  of  you  that  you  were 
 showing  i  think  if  we  say  persona  maybe
[141:21] it's  like  a  bit  too  negative  but  it 
 it's  kind  of  like  um  you  go  to  an
[141:26] interview  and  they  see  a  version  of  you 
 compared  to  how  your  friends 
 see  you  and  it's  like  i  think  generally
[141:31] how  relationship  seems  at  least  it  was 
 for  us  is 
 the  first  time  you're  meeting  for  for  a 
 while  it  was  like  we  were  both
[141:37] conveying  what  was 
 expected  or  strategic  or  whatever  where
[141:43] it  was  in  that  environment  where  we  were 
 just  purely  just  meeting  and  we  weren't 
 exactly  like  getting  feelings  we  weren't
[141:48] going  to  show  up  our  vulnerable  side  to 
 like  be  open  honest  with  each  other 
 and  as  we  spent  time  with  each  other  and
[141:53] we  started  doing  that  that's  when  the 
 feelings  came 
 yeah  because  we  always  kind  of  acted
[141:59] like  even  when  we  weren't  like  doing 
 cuckoly  things  i  feel  like  we  did  always 
 kind  of  act  like  a  couple  like
[142:04] even  kind  of  near  dark  that's 
 interesting 
 not  right  here  there's  not  like  a  month
[142:09] or  two  yeah  but  do  you  think  like 
 the  reason  why  we  actually
[142:16] the  reason  why  we  progressed  and  we  like 
 we  continued 
 was  because  of  let's  say  the  real
[142:23] vulnerable  like 
 cutie  side  to  us  because  that  was 
 actually  the  reason  why  like  i  was  more
[142:28] interested  in  you  than  other 
 it  was  because  it  wasn't  just  like  i  was 
 meeting
[142:33] not  exactly  like  i  still  thought  you 
 were  a  basic  [ __ ]  but  it  was  like 
 i  wasn't  meeting  like  a  girl  who  just
[142:38] had 
 the  the  male  personality  equivalent  of
[142:44] what  you  thought  i  was  in  terms  of 
 scumbag  fuckboy 
 it's  like  that's  you  were  the  female
[142:49] equivalent  of  that 
 and  most  girl  like  all  girls  i  mean 
 honestly  like  the  female  equivalent  of 
 that  i 
 know  you  don't  you  don't  like  see  it  but
[142:55] i  was  never  i've 
 never  been  a  you  can't  tell  though  you 
 weren't  dating  you  you  weren't  like 
 meeting  you  though  if  i  accept  that  i
[143:03] was  a  scumbag  if  you're  saying  it 
 you've  got  to  accept  this  yeah  that's 
 true  that  is  true
[143:09] i  just  thought  you  know  when  you  text  me 
 to  do  the  podcast
[143:14] that  was  when  i  as  i  was  i  was  literally 
 drinking  a  basic  [ __ ]  cocktail  that's
[143:20] what  it was  called  basic  [ __ ]  cocktails 
 and  i  saw  that  you've  messaged  me 
 and  i  was  like  i  might  just  send  a
[143:26] picture  of  this  content 
 that's  your  answer  i  am  really
[143:31] interested  in  that 
 to  think  that  at  first  okay  we  were
[143:36] attracted  to  each  other  just  on  that 
 like  kind  of  physical  sense 
 and  the  personality  we  were  conveying
[143:41] was  like  let's  say  [ __ ]  boy  and  [ __ ] 
 girl 
 superheroes  and
[143:49] perhaps  the  reason  why  at  least 
 you  for  me  was  that  you  were  the
[143:54] priority  like  i  told  you  this  you  were 
 like  the  priority  above 
 other  girls  or  like  pretty  quickly  and
[144:00] i  think  that's  because  actually  like  i 
 saw  the  non-fucking  version  of  you  and  i
[144:05] think  you  felt  the  same  way 
 when  you  started  to  see  the  non-fuckboy
[144:10] version  of  me 
 and  it's  like  we  all  like  you 
 automatically  did  it  i  consciously  did 
 it  which  is  like  more  manipulative  i
[144:16] will  say  that  but 
 both  of  us  put  this  this  persona  that  is
[144:21] more  widely  socially  accepted 
 and  you  kind  of  have  to  do  this  [ __ ] 
 when  you  go  on  to  dating  apps  and  you're 
 seeing  a  hundred  people
[144:27] you  have  to  be  like  maybe  the  avoidance 
 style 
 personality  where  you  you  know  yeah  if
[144:33] you're  cool  and  everything  they're 
 treating  me  and  keep  them  keen  yeah  both 
 of  us  did  that  because
[144:39] we  actually  progressed  because  we we 
 went  away  from  that  and  it's  making  me 
 think 
 what  if  there  was  just  none  of  the
[144:46] the  first  part 
 i  was  thinking  i  wonder  if  it  would  have
[144:53] happened  or  not 
 would  we  have  even  been  attract  like 
 attracted  to  each  other
[144:59] i  think  we  would  have  been  or  would  we 
 have  literally  just  been  like  one  of  the 
 people  who  sent  like  paragraphs  on
[145:04] dating  apps  and  then  just  never  met  up 
 because  the  reason  why  we  were  attracted 
 to  each  other  was  honestly
[145:09] it  was  sexual  attraction  at  first  we 
 didn't  know  enough  about  each  other's 
 personality  we  met  just  because  we  knew 
 like  okay
[145:14] both  of  us  was  just  like  i'd  [ __ ]  this 
 book  i  was  just  like  this  guy's  a  dick 
 but  he's  good  looking  and  i  get  on  with
[145:19] him  so 
 yeah  i  was  thinking  about  myself  as  well 
 yeah  of  course
[145:25] you  have  a  god  complex 
 it's  not  a  complex  way  it's  just
[145:34] honestly  some  of  the  things  you  say  make 
 me  feel  physically  repulsed 
 like  literally  there's  been  so  many
[145:40] things  you  said  in  this  call 
 i  hope  he  texts  me  i  hope  he  texts  me
[145:46] today 
 well  that's  what  i'm  thinking  i  actually
[145:51] haven't  thought  that  since  we  broke  up 
 no  i'm  not  saying  you  broke  up  but  just 
 in  general  like  because
[145:56] near  the  start  obviously  you  were  saying 
 that  i  was  a  scumbag  i  was  a  dick  but  it 
 was  like
[146:02] as  soon  as  i  sent  you  the  message  you're 
 like  oh  yeah  let's  go  let's  go  meet  this 
 guy  oh  yeah 
 that's  another  thing  in  the  manipulation
[146:08] video  that  you  [ __ ]  lie  about 
 you're  like  oh  you  like  guys  won't
[146:13] believe  this  like  the  girl's  doing  all 
 the  work  like  she's  asking  to  see  me 
 literally  when  we  were  like  before  we
[146:18] were  in  a  relationship  i  probably  asked 
 to  see  you  like 
 three  or  four  times  and  we  saw  each 
 other  like  three  times  a  week
[146:26] no  you  no  you  you  could  scroll  up  the 
 text  messages  at  first  it  was  mostly  me 
 and  then  it  began  to  be  you  like
[146:32] when  we  were  in  a  relationship  yeah  not 
 before  that  not  hard
[146:37] yeah  like  even  then  we  can  say  that  this 
 is 
 like  weirdly  your  level  of  manipulation
[146:43] where  even  though  you  wanted  to  see  me 
 you  knew  for  a  fact  i'd  be  messaging  you 
 today  or  tomorrow  anyway
[146:48] so  yeah  i  mean  so  you  can  shut  the  [ __ ] 
 up  you  just  didn't  want  to  put  yourself 
 the  manipulation  that's  just  i  don't
[146:54] want  to  be  the  one  to  ask  but  i  know 
 he's  going  to  ask  me 
 there  we  go  the  first  time
[147:07] let's  see  let's  see  what  else  oh  no  no 
 more  of  the  negative  [ __ ] 
 i'm  done  there  is  negative  stuff
[147:18] [Music]
[147:28] 11. 
 oh  that's  not  bad  reason  number  eleven
[147:33] why 
 uh  what  what  i  didn't  i  haven't  actually
[147:40] titled  it  why  eve  is  trash  but  we  can 
 say  that's 
 that's  the  list  is  number  11.  she  wanted
[147:45] to  continue  her  plans  which  she  made 
 when  she  was  single  and  everyone 
 supported  that
[147:50] you  already  knew  that  to  be  honest  i'll 
 let  you  re-roll  for  another  one 
 because  there's  some  juicy  ones  on  this
[147:56] read  me  the  juiciest 
 no  you  cut  you  guessed  the  number
[148:01] 17  17.
[148:10] oh  interesting 
 she  would  have  pressured  me  into
[148:16] marriage  and  like  a  dumbass  i  would  have 
 considered  it
[148:22] i  would  have  pressured  you  into  marriage 
 100. 
 no  100  that  actually  leads  me  on  to  what
[148:28] i  was  going  to  say 
 yeah  because  when  we  first  met  you 
 didn't  even  want  you  i  remember  asking 
 you 
 do  you  think  you'll  ever  get  into  a
[148:34] relationship  at  any  point  in  your  life 
 and  you're  like  no 
 no  he  didn't  say  that  i  did
[148:40] i  might  say  do  you  think  you  have  to  get 
 in  a  relationship  and  you're  like  no
[148:45] no  no  that's  that's  not  true  at  all  yeah 
 if  we  had  i  don't  remember  having  this 
 conversation  but  if
[148:50] if  you  asked  me  if  i  ever  wanted  to  be 
 in  a  relationship  for  the  rest  of  my 
 life 
 not  ever  i  probably  didn't  say  ever  i
[148:56] probably  said  can  you  see  yourself 
 getting  into  a  relationship 
 you're  like  no  yeah  but  could  you  at
[149:01] that  point  though 
 exactly  no  it  hit  us  both  yeah  i  wasn't 
 talking  about  with  me
[149:07] i  just  meant  in  general  because  i 
 couldn't  see  myself  getting  in  the 
 relationship  with  you  so  i  wasn't 
 talking  about  me 
 yeah  but  just  in  general  like  i  wasn't
[149:13] expecting  it  with  you  or  with  anyone 
 and  you  went  i  think  you  were  the  same 
 when  you  it  just  kind  of  happened
[149:18] yeah  that's  true  but  um
[149:23] you  have  in  the  terms  of  like 
 male  and  female  roles  you  have  like
[149:29] traditional 
 values  would  you  say  yeah  so
[149:34] do  you  think  that's  like  you  think  no 
 um  so  like  a  woman  should  be  submissive
[149:41] man  should  be  dominant 
 that's  what  you  said  but  i  think  it's
[149:46] you  can't  really  in  my  opinion  i  don't 
 think  you  can  really  pick  and  choose
[149:51] things  to  be  traditional  about  when 
 you  your  relationship  with  women  is 
 untraditional
[149:57] oh  casual  sex
[150:04] is  untraditional  not  necessarily  for 
 these  times  but  it's  also  for  these 
 times
[150:09] the  views  that  you  have  for  male  and 
 female  roles  are  very 
 outdated  and  not  traditional  so  and  also
[150:15] like 
 marriage  like  you  said  you  won't  get 
 married  that's  very  traditional 
 so  you  can't  really  say  oh  men  should  be
[150:22] this  and  women  should  be  this 
 unless  you  want  to  do  that  when  when  you 
 don't  have  the  whole
[150:27] traditional  problems
[150:34] we  got  him  girls  that's  a  very  good 
 point  actually 
 i  appreciate  you  bringing  that  up  i've
[150:39] never  even  considered  that  like  i  i  do 
 you  you  know  me  i'd  have  very  much
[150:44] valued  like  the  traditional  sense  of 
 like  man 
 because  these  days  like  relationship
[150:49] like  dynamics  are  just  [ __ ] 
 it's  like  both  of  them  are  dominant  or 
 usually  the  man  is  actually  submissive
[150:54] and  it  excuse  the  whole  thing  that  even 
 if  people  can  get  in  a  relationship  and
[150:59] stay  in  it 
 the  girl  always  resents  a  guy  who's  more 
 who's  less  dominant  than  she  is  no
[151:04] matter  if  she  wants  to  pretend  like 
 she's  like 
 not  as  dumb  it's  like  subconsciously  it 
 it  isn't  right
[151:09] even  we're  not  allowed  to  say  it's 
 offensive  but  subconsciously  it's  like 
 human  nature  is  that  the  man  is  more
[151:14] dominant  and  the  woman  is  more 
 submissive 
 and  yeah  i  do  agree  with  that
[151:19] well  i  think  i  want  that  without 
 actually  doing  the  rest  of  it 
 this  traditionally  yeah  which
[151:26] you  can't  expect  yeah  that's  a  very  good 
 point  and 
 it's  actually  something  i  realized  not
[151:31] completely  but 
 i  think  as  we  were  getting  together  and 
 i  was  i  was  drifting  away  from  casual
[151:36] sex  and  that 
 because  the  fulfillment  that  i  got  from 
 you  was 
 uncomparable  to  when  i  meet  girls
[151:44] just  to  sleep  with  them  and  i  always 
 find  myself 
 casually  sleeping  with  girls  and  wanting
[151:51] something  more  like  wanting  essentially 
 honestly  exactly  what  we  had  but 
 attracting  the  wrong  girls  from  that
[151:57] and  it's  more  like  easier  or  it's  easier 
 to  be  successful  with  that
[152:03] to  to  start  as  the  [ __ ]  boy  to  start  as 
 a  casual  sex  and  to  move  over  to
[152:08] the  relationship  because  you're  going  to 
 get  more  girls  like  this  but  the  issue 
 is  that  the  girls 
 you  attract  with  this  generally  don't
[152:14] fit  in  with  this 
 and  i  think  that  that  maybe  is  what 
 happened  with  us  is
[152:19] i  like  i  tried  we  went  into  the  casual 
 sex  thing  but  we 
 yeah  to  transition  that  into  a  long-term
[152:25] relationship  it  doesn't 
 generally  work  i  think  that's  the  i
[152:30] think  that's 
 the  issue  with  us  because  i'm  not  like 
 a  casual  like  i'm  not  like  you  in  terms
[152:37] of  like  my 
 i'm  not  like  the  other  girls  i'm  not 
 like  no  i'm 
 honestly  i'm  like
[152:44] like  i've  not  been  with  many  people  you 
 know  that  um
[152:51] so  i'm  not  like  i've  never 
 really  like  been  in  that  scene
[152:59] like  at  all  so  i  i  feel  like  this  like 
 [ __ ]  girl  i'm  really  surprised  that  you 
 say  that  i  had  like  a  [ __ ]  girl  persona
[153:05] because 
 like  that  couldn't  be  the  first  thing
[153:11] the  res  what  do  you  say  the  results  of 
 that 
 if  you  were  single  for  longer  put  in
[153:19] yeah  like  you  had  the  personality  and 
 the  behavior  of  it  you  just  didn't  have 
 enough  time  to
[153:24] essentially  get  the  the  body  count  up 
 and  i  think  with  some  time  you  yeah 
 maybe 
 when  you're  single  now  you're  gonna  go
[153:30] to  uni  you're  gonna  do  your  masters  and 
 everything  you'll  go  to  like 
 a  double  digit  body  count  and  then 
 triple  digit
[153:37] you're  going  to  be  a  triple  digits  are 
 you 
 you're  going  to  be  a  triple  digit  not
[153:43] like  you 
 no  i'm  not  that  i  mean  maybe
[153:48] that's  not  it's  not  going  to  be  me  i'm 
 not  like  you  i  don't  just  [ __ ]  anything
[153:54] that's  what  i  did  with  you  you  have  to 
 lower  the  standards  way  down
[153:59] i  might  just  drop  one  in  there 
 it  literally  goes  against  everything  you
[154:04] said  in  this  thing
[154:09] um  yeah 
 i  just  think  with  our  relationship  it
[154:17] seemed  very  much  like  it  was  like 
 for  a  lot  of  things  it  was  like  me  or 
 this
[154:22] like  i  feel  like  you  i  remember  when  i 
 came  back  to  uni  and  yeah 
 i  probably  shouldn't  have  come  back  to
[154:27] uni  like  we've  been  in  a  relationship 
 for  what  like 
 two  three  weeks  and  i  came  back  to  york
[154:32] which  yeah  i  probably 
 i  shouldn't  have  done  and  i  completely 
 understand  like  your
[154:37] view  on  that  like  100 
 um  but  then  also  i  think  it  needs  to  be
[154:43] considered  that  it  was  like  my  last  bit 
 of  time  here  like  i'm  never  gonna
[154:48] live  in  york  again  which  is  like  why 
 i've 
 stayed  here  when  everyone  else  has  gone
[154:53] because  i'm  just  like  i  wanna 
 be  here  but  um  that  didn't  mean  i  didn't 
 want  to  be  with  you  and
[154:59] you  said  bro  i  remember  you  saying  like 
 around  about  the  time  we  were  breaking 
 up  you're  like  oh  you 
 you  put  your  friends  above  me  which  i
[155:05] can  understand  why  you  feel  that  way  100 
 um  because  obviously  when  i  was  coming
[155:10] back  to  uni  i  was  like  oh like  grace  is 
 on  their  own  like  i  need  to  come  back 
 and  be  with  grace  and  all  this
[155:15] which  i  remember  you  saying  like  oh  you 
 put  being  with  grace  above  being  with  me
[155:22] but  the  thing  is  being  with  you  like  i 
 thought  i  was  going  to  spend  my  whole 
 life  with  you 
 what's  three  weeks  when  we've  got
[155:28] forever 
 when  i've  already  made  that  promise  to 
 my  friend  i'd  already  promised  her  that
[155:34] i  was  coming  back  two  weeks  before 
 and  if  i'd  have  told  her  that  i  wasn't 
 going  to  come  back  she  wouldn't  have 
 come  back  either
[155:40] so  that's  like  i  think  it's  it's 
 it  is  difficult  to  say  because  i 
 understand  your  perspective  on  it  but
[155:46] also  like 
 my  care  and  my  like  want  to 
 actually  like  spend  like  not  a  lot  of
[155:52] time  but  like  some  time  with  my  friends 
 never  ever  would  have  invalidated  my
[155:57] like  love  and  commitment  towards  you 
 and  i  don't  think  you  understood  that
[156:02] i  think  you  thought  that  it  was  like  me 
 choosing  my  friends  over  you  but  that 
 was  never  the  case
[156:07] but  that  i  think  i  think  you  can  see 
 it's  like  objectively  it  did 
 look  like  that  if  you  look  at  it  from
[156:13] the  outside 
 we  get  into  a  relationship  and  you  know 
 it's  like  literally  honeymoon  period
[156:18] we're  so  close  and  then  straight  away 
 you're  going  away  for  it  you're  going 
 away  for  as  long  as  we've  been  together
[156:24] and  yeah  you  know  i'll  come  and  see  you 
 for  like  a  couple  of  days  but  it's  like 
 it's  just  strange  to  do  that  but  i  think
[156:31] when  i  look  back  at  it 
 at  that  time  i  was  like  quite  resentful 
 and  i  was  quite  like  worried  and
[156:36] everything  for  it  but  now  when  i  look 
 it's  like 
 it  was  honestly  just  an  unideal 
 situation  where
[156:41] i  understand  why  you  went  and 
 i  i  was  really  really  looking  at  it  from
[156:47] your  point  of  view  and  even  my  point  of 
 view  which 
 i  was  thinking  okay  if  i  was  back  in 
 that  student  accommodation  which  i  used
[156:52] to  like  and  it  was  going  to  be  my  last 
 time  there 
 like  it  would  be  awesome  to  have  like
[156:57] three  weeks  there  even  if  it  would  make 
 you  feel  anxious 
 like  i  remember  i  remember  when  the
[157:02] lease  ended 
 in  the  place  that  you  with  with  your  ex 
 and  like  she'd  left  remember  you
[157:08] would  always  talk  about  it  and  you 
 remember  you  even  messaged  me  saying 
 like  oh  if  i  try  and  get  the  keys  like 
 like  we'll  go  and  we'll  spend  a  couple
[157:14] of  nights  there  like  that  was  you  really 
 wanting  to  go  and  spend  time 
 in  this  last  place  yeah  and  that's  what
[157:21] i  wanted  to  do 
 and  be  with  my  friends  who  like  one  of 
 my  friends  lives  in  guernsey
[157:26] when  am  i  ever  going  to  see  her  my  other 
 friends  live  in  london 
 like  realistically  how  often  am  i  going
[157:31] to  see  them  like  what  once  or  twice  a 
 year 
 if  that  and  this  was  the  last  bit  of
[157:37] time  that  i  had  here  i  mean 
 yeah  i  had  more  time  after  that  but  that 
 was  the  last  bit  of  time  that  i  was
[157:42] choosing  to  go  there 
 and  yeah  i've  come  back  like  sounds 
 contradictory  because  i'm  saying  like 
 that  was  my  last  bit  of  time  when  i'm
[157:47] literally  here  now 
 when  we've  been  broken  up  a  month  but 
 like  that  was
[157:52] like  i  remember  saying  to  you  like  i'm 
 gonna  come  for  this  amount  of  time  and 
 then  i'm  gonna  just  come  back  and  just 
 not  have  the  rest  of  the  lease  like  i
[157:57] was  planning  on  just  coming  and  staying 
 at  home  and  obviously  i  only  came  back 
 i  came  back  here  for  six  days  and  then
[158:03] went  home  because  you  broke  up  with  me 
 and  then  we  got  back  together  and  then
[158:08] broke  up  again  two  days  later 
 um  it was  a  horrible  week  god  that  was
[158:14] literally  like 
 like  that  showed  me  the  effect  that  an 
 attachment  can  have  when
[158:19] it  literally  made  me  feel  like  i  was 
 genuinely  sick
[158:24] like  i  know  i  literally  got  a  feeling 
 from  that  and  of  course 
 like  you  know  could  have  been 
 coincidence  or  something  like  i  got  a
[158:29] fever  randomly 
 but  i  think  it  genuinely  was  just  caused 
 by  forming  a  such  a  stronger  connection
[158:35] and  then  just  seeing  it  like 
 like  falling  apart  i  think  and  i  think
[158:41] that's  like  a 
 a  big  thing  like  people  in  my  life  that 
 i  need  like  i  would  want  people  in
[158:46] my  life  to  understand  is  like  like 
 obviously  everyone  in  my  life  has  a  very
[158:51] very  very  negative  opinion  of  you  and 
 you  know  i  actually  spend  a  lot  of  time
[158:56] defending  you  which  i  i  don't  like  and  i 
 get  called  out  for 
 all  the  time  but  um  just  joining  with
[159:02] him  like  yeah  he  wasn't  there 
 i  do  usually  join  him  but  then  like
[159:07] i  feel  like  they  don't  just  [ __ ] 
 say  that  so  i  do  usually  join  in  and
[159:12] then  move  the  topic  of  the  conversation 
 i  wasn't  moving  i  was  carrying  on  no  i
[159:18] mean  like 
 i  do  have  mainly  negative  feelings 
 towards  you
[159:23] probably  not  after  this  call  but  like  i 
 did  have  mainly  noticed  fearless  towards 
 you  but  like
[159:28] like  people  seem  to  think  that  i  was 
 completely  a  victim  in  this  which  like
[159:35] to  some  extent  yeah 
 but  also  like  you  were  hurt  as  well 
 like  it  was  a  very  hurtful  situation  for
[159:41] both  of  us  it  wasn't 
 one  of  us  was  hurting  the  other  person 
 it  was  was  both  hurting  each  other  and
[159:46] the  situation  hurting  both  of  us 
 like  it  was  my  friend  because  my
[159:51] if  i  like  the  guys  i  speak  to  only  have 
 like  the  negative  view  of  you  even 
 though
[159:56] i  said  so  much  positive  stuff  about  you 
 like  just  you  know  the  days  before 
 everything  happened
[160:01] so  when  it  comes  up  obviously  we're  just 
 like  insulting  you  and  [ __ ] 
 but
[160:09] what  do  you  say  when  you  insult  me  sam 
 always  calls  you  a  wench
[160:14] i  think  you're  like  oh  when  she  got  me 
 that  when  we  were  together 
 not  a  when  sam
[160:24] [Laughter]
[160:31] it's  how  i  expect  our  like  social  circle 
 to 
 because  all  your  friends  and  all  your
[160:36] family  are  not  just  going  to  suddenly 
 say  oh  hamza  was  a  great  they're  not 
 going  to  say  are  they  like  maybe  you'll 
 come  up  every  now  and  then  in  a  couple
[160:42] of  months  time  or  something  when  you're 
 reminiscing 
 oh  yeah  he  was  actually  called  for 
 setting  you  up  with
[160:47] mindfulness  or  something  but  right  now 
 easier 
 it's  like  nicer  for  our  friends  to  say
[160:52] bad  stuff  about  us  because 
 it  kind  of  helps  us  because  yeah  our
[160:58] minds  automatically  been  generated  more 
 negative  than  positive  because  positive 
 would  mean  that 
 we'd  want  this  connection  again  and  yeah
[161:05] i  wonder  what  it's  going  to  be  like 
 after  this  call  because  it's  definitely 
 going  to  at  least  for  me  it's  good 
 yeah  it  is  for  you  as  well  to  be  honest
[161:11] it's  going  to  be  like  more  positive  than 
 it  has  been 
 yeah  which  i  am  i'm  actually  really 
 looking  forward  to  that
[161:16] because  even  if  it  kind  of  hurts  and 
 more  in  the  sense  of  like  an  attachment 
 being  broken
[161:21] and  we  miss  each  other  more  i  i  actually 
 want  to  experience  that  than  just
[161:26] negativity  and  resent  in  you  like  i 
 actually  just  want  to  miss  you  i 
 i  want  to  feel  like  i  look  back  and  i
[161:33] cry  at  like 
 all  the  happy  moments  rather  than  look 
 back  with  like  anger  for  the  bad  moments
[161:38] that's  what  i  say  to  people  like  like 
 when  my  friends  are  really  trying  to
[161:43] but  it's  not  like  they're  trying  to  make 
 me  feel  negative  about  it  like  they  do 
 feel  negative  about  it  they  will  like  if
[161:48] i  was 
 my  friend  i'd  be  saying  the  exact  same 
 thing  i'm  saying  a  lot  of  the  same 
 things  that  they  aren't
[161:54] i'm  like  sat  here  like  oh  yeah  like  i 
 didn't  say  nice  things  like  i  literally 
 say  that  i  like  hate  you  all  the  time  i
[161:59] [ __ ]  hate  you 
 that  means  you  still  fancy  me
[162:04] [Laughter]
[162:10] um  i  forgot  what  i was  even  saying 
 what  was  i  even  saying
[162:19] it's  really  gonna  piss  me  off  because  it 
 was  a  good  point  as  well
[162:27] i  can't  think  but  no  like  friends  are 
 obviously  gonna  say  more  negative  stuff 
 but
[162:32] um  like  you  know  i'd  say  there's  more 
 positive  than  there  was  more  positive
[162:38] than  bad  in  our  relationship 
 like  it  was  eight  months  of  good  but  i
[162:43] think  the  bad  outweighs  the  good 
 there  was  less  bad  but  the  bad  was  more
[162:48] serious  yeah  but  honestly  like 
 the  good  was  extreme  as  well  and  i  think
[162:53] that  we've  just  focused  on  the  bad  just 
 because 
 i  honestly  feel  at  least  for  me  i  focus
[162:58] on  the  bad  because  it's  been 
 easier  emotionally  to  focus  on  it  than 
 it  is  to  focus  on  the  good
[163:03] and  yeah  if  we  did  focus  on  the  good  if 
 for  example  like  it'd  be 
 counter-intuitive  maybe  but  if  we  like
[163:09] for  example  we're  like  proper  every  day 
 thinking  about  what  we  were  grateful  for 
 each  other  for  instead  of  thinking  oh
[163:14] i'm  grateful  it  ended 
 we  thought  okay  i'm  grateful  why  it 
 happened  and  what  happened  inside  of  it
[163:19] and  i'm  grateful  for  like  this 
 that  we  did  yeah  that  was  my  point  like 
 i  remember  saying  to  my  friends  like
[163:25] because  when  i  say  like  positive  things 
 like  sometimes  they're  all  like  a  bit 
 concerning  that  you 
 that  you  like  say  positive  things  but  i
[163:31] don't  want  to  be  filled  with  hate 
 yeah  i  don't  want  to  be  filled  with 
 resentment  i  don't  want  to  look  back  at
[163:36] this  time  of  my  life  and  be  like 
 and  feel  regrets  like  we've  had  a  great
[163:41] time  together  like 
 lockdown  would  have  been  horrible  if  if 
 we  didn't  have  each  other  in  our  lives
[163:47] like  there's  a  lot  of  positive  that  we 
 have  to  look  back  on  and  i  don't  want  to 
 look  back  and  see  red
[163:54] i  want  to  look  back  and  see  all  like  the 
 nice  memories  let  me  just 
 change  the  color  what  color  do  you  want
[163:59] to  look  back  on  like  should  we  put  green 
 you  know
[164:15] i  made  that  call  myself
[164:25] but  yeah 
 how  do  you  think  this  call  is  gonna
[164:31] change  things  for  you 
 or  do  you  think  it's  gonna  change  things 
 for  you  yeah  definitely
[164:36] i'm  gonna  i'm  already  seeing  you  in  a 
 way  more  positive  like  because  it's  not
[164:41] just  on  like  instagram  messages  which 
 feels  kind  of  cold 
 and  so  yeah  i've  been  kind  of  cold
[164:46] towards  your  messages 
 i  feel  like  like  you  went  back  i
[164:52] remember  the work 
 yeah  i  just  couldn't  like  i  couldn't
[164:57] be  that  lovey  side  towards  you  like  i 
 just  oh  it's  a  weird  angle
[165:02] i  couldn't  um  i  couldn't  i  couldn't  just 
 even  acknowledge  it  like  it  was  just
[165:07] too  painful  which  is  horrible  that's  the 
 first  time  in  my  life  i've 
 ever  like  shut  something  out  of  my  brain
[165:14] like  that's  the  first  time  i've  ever 
 like 
 like  i've  been  the  one  like  cutting
[165:19] contact  but  it  was  just 
 it  was  way  too  much  i  wasn't  caught  in 
 contact  but  do  you  know  what i  mean  like
[165:24] i 
 is
[165:36] but  like  i  was  the  one  who  like  blocked 
 you  and  deleted  your  number  and 
 unfollowed  you  and  everything  first  it
[165:41] was  like 
 yeah  but  that's  not  just  something  that 
 that's  not  something  that  i  do  anyway
[165:47] um  i  mean  whatever  it is  it  doesn't  have 
 to  be  a  competition  of 
 who  can  be  meaner  than  you're  the  first
[165:53] no  of  course  not  but 
 like  i  remember  like  i  sent  you  that 
 message 
 it's  telling  you  that  i  missed  you  and
[165:59] then  you'll  reply  oh  my  god  i 
 [ __ ]  strangle  you  and  i  got  that 
 reviled
[166:04] you  start  crying  but  then  i  was  like 
 afterwards  like  i  looked  it  and  i  was 
 like  wait
[166:09] like  you  asked  me  up  and  i  was  like  no 
 like  you  sent  me  voice  notes  like
[166:15] telling  like  tell  me  how  much  you  love 
 me  like  i  didn't 
 say  i  love  you  once  after  we  broke  up
[166:21] because  i  couldn't  allow  myself  to  say 
 it  and  i  was  like  i  can't  really  be 
 upset 
 that  he  sent  a  message  like  this  when
[166:27] i've  literally  just  like 
 not  said  i  love  you  back  or  although  my 
 responses  were  very  like
[166:32] robotic  yeah  it  felt  like  you  were 
 replying  as  if  like
[166:37] if  your  family  was  like  looking  over 
 your  shoulder  and  you  were  replying 
 no  obviously
[166:43] i'd  expect  it  not  to  be  true  to  be 
 honest  but  this  is  how  i  felt  towards 
 your  messages  it  was  like  it  wasn't  my
[166:50] eve  who  was  replying  it  was  like
[166:55] the  world's  e  it  was  like  you  know  the 
 [ __ ] 
 it  was  like  the  [ __ ]  girl  eve  it  was
[167:00] just  kind  of  like  oh  that's  the  way  to 
 cal  to  get
[167:06] i  don't  know  but  i  think  it's  i  couldn't 
 be 
 your  eve  it  wasn't  that  i  didn't  want  to
[167:12] like  i  just  couldn't 
 i  just  couldn't  show  that  side  to  you
[167:18] anymore  because 
 if  i  started  showing  that  side  it  it
[167:23] would  be  harder 
 i  think  if  you  did  try  it  outside  we 
 would  have  like  somehow  reconnected  i
[167:28] think 
 you  would  have  told  your  mum  that  you 
 were  meeting  someone  else  you  just  met 
 each  other 
 that's  why  i  didn't  meet  up  with  you
[167:33] because  i  knew  that  i'd  want  to  get  back 
 with  you  immediately 
 yeah  probably  we  did
[167:42] do  you  think  we  would  have  done  it  from 
 at  all
[167:47] like  we  would  have  like  reconnected  on 
 that  day 
 and  i  think  we  would  have  like  seen  like
[167:53] we  would  have  like  essentially  just  been 
 together  messaging  again 
 but  i  think  it  potentially  would  have 
 like  ended  again  within  us
[168:00] like  it  would  have  been  just  prolonging 
 the  pain  um 
 yeah  that's  what  i  look  like  i  am  like
[168:05] grateful  like 
 it  was  an  awkward  situation  we  didn't
[168:10] really  break  up  your  family  broke  us  up 
 but 
 i  like  i  do  look  with  gratitude  for  that 
 because  i  don't  think  either  of  us  had
[168:16] like  the  ability  to  break  up  with  each 
 other  and  i  don't  know  if 
 our  like  we  ever  had  like  long
[168:22] term  do  you  think  we  had  potential  long 
 term
[168:28] um 
 it's  difficult  to  say  um  yeah
[168:37] i  couldn't  see  it  i  thought  i  thought  it 
 was  gonna  happen 
 yeah  we  were  planning  that  [ __ ]  like  we
[168:45] were  literally  like 
 fully  fun  in  it  yeah
[168:55] the  valley  i 
 [Laughter]
[169:04] don't  be  surprised  if  we  bump  into  each 
 other  in  bali  one  day  imagine  how  weird 
 that  would  be
[169:13] how's  your  youtube  channel  going 
 um  i've  not  posted  a  video  since
[169:19] the  last  one  with  you  in  the  thumbnail 
 yeah  did  you  delete  that  one
[169:24] i  deleted  it  i  privated  it  and  then  i 
 then  i  unlisted  it  and  i  put  it  on
[169:29] public  then  i  unlisted  it  and  i 
 [ __ ]  yeah  it's  on  public  now
[169:36] yeah  what  did  you  see  that  i  deleted  it 
 i  think  sam  told  me
[169:41] that  you  deleted  it  and  then  i  think  i  i 
 unsubscribed 
 see  i  smash  that  subscribe  button  i
[169:47] don't  want  to  see  that  [ __ ] 
 yeah  i  unsubscribed  from  you
[169:53] apologies  huh  apologies 
 that's  all  right  i've  got  plenty  more
[170:00] oh  really  how's  youtube  going
[170:05] have  you  not  seen
[170:16] i  mean  if  you  want  to  go  and  subscribe 
 then  maybe  you  can  uh 
 i  mean  i'll  subscribe  to  you  when  you
[170:21] subscribe  to  me 
 [Music]
[170:27] i  don't  want  to  see  a  video  on  your  page 
 how  i  really 
 began  to  love  my  life  is  just  you  with  a
[170:34] different
[170:48] i'll  let  you  report  your  video 
 do  you  think  if  i  well  when  i  post  a
[170:54] video  again  you'll  watch  it 
 i  wasn't  gonna  like  i  already  knew  to
[171:01] myself  if  i  do  see  you  post  one  that  it 
 would  hurt  watching  it  and  i  know 
 you  probably  would  speak  about  this  and
[171:07] it  would  hurt  yeah 
 but  i  think  now  i  i  probably  would 
 i  think  it  would  it  would  hurt  it  would
[171:13] make  me  feel  uncomfortable  because  i 
 know  that  you 
 know  you'd  be  spitting  truth  anyway  you 
 said  oh  well  how  my  relationship  ended
[171:19] and  he  was  he  was  toxic  he  was  abusive 
 but  i  feel  like 
 you'll  also  do  like  i  can  imagine  you 
 also  saying  but  i
[171:24] wasn't  perfect  either  you  know  i  was  i 
 was  this  i  was  there  so  you're  just 
 gonna  say  that  [ __ ]  i've  literally
[171:29] filmed  a  clip  of  me  saying  that  exactly 
 yeah  i  knew  you  would  have
[171:35] so  i  think  i  don't  i  don't  put  that  in 
 the  video 
 like  the  next  video  i've  done  i've  got
[171:41] it  like  pretty  much  finished  i  just  need 
 to  edit 
 it  we'll  finish  um
[171:47] i  feel  like  my  camera  angle  keeps 
 sliding  down  just  piss  me  off 
 um  right  in  my  dissertation  in  a  week
[171:55] [Music] 
 i  literally  wrote  it  in  like  five  days
[172:02] do  i  see  it
[172:21] how  many  pages  is  it  like
[172:26] 39
[172:31] yeah  9  968. 
 did  you  get  the  result  for  it  not  yet
[172:40] i  think  i'll  literally  get  it  any  time 
 in  the  next  few  days 
 [Music] 
 just  scary  i  hope  i've  done  well  [ __ ]
[172:47] proud  of  myself  for  the  last  few  months 
 you  know  like  not  a  few  months  like  last 
 month 
 obviously  with  like  this  breakup  and
[172:53] stuff  and  like  the  dissertation  and 
 the  topic  it  was  on  as  well  and  writing
[172:58] it  all  in  like  a  week  whilst  going 
 through  that  like 
 i'm  just  gonna  be  your  own  biggest  fan
[173:04] sometimes 
 i  know  i  feel  funny
[173:11] now  you  know  how  i  feel  god's  complex 
 [ __ ]  i'm  gonna  be  like  you  next
[173:17] um  yeah  i'm  just  looking  over  my  nose
[173:23] i  put  in  capitals  we  don't  use  our 
 insecurities  to  justify 
 abuse  manipulation  and  control
[173:33] i  think  i  think  the  biggest  thing  for  me 
 that  makes 
 me  see  you  was  controlling  is  it  all
[173:38] came  out  after  i  was  in  love  with  you 
 like  none  of  these  boundaries  were  set 
 into  place  before
[173:44] we  even  started  getting  into  a 
 relationship  and  i  think  if  they  had 
 been  we  wouldn't  have  gotten  to  one  yeah
[173:51] but  i  don't  think  that's 
 that's  like  a  a  good  point  though 
 because
[173:56] before  we  go  into  a  relationship  then  of 
 course  like  i'm  not  gonna  have 
 boundaries  for  you 
 because  yeah  of  course  but  i  mean  like
[174:01] when  we  started  getting  into  one 
 yeah  but  it  it  wasn't  something  like
[174:06] something  that  was  in  my  mind  to  think 
 like  okay 
 yeah  johnny  because  you  weren't  you 
 weren't  doing  the  stuff  then  anyway  so
[174:12] it  didn't  even  come  up 
 it  was  like  i  didn't  calculate  saying  oh 
 let  me  make  her  in  love  with  me  then  be
[174:17] really  strict 
 it  was  just  that  it  kind  of  happened 
 that  we  we  fell  in  love  and  then 
 the  opportunities  for  you  to  like  go  out
[174:23] and  plan  all  these  nights  out  then  came 
 and  of  course  the  boundaries  are 
 somewhat  going  to  get  stricter  when
[174:28] the  investment  is  higher  the  emotional 
 investment  is  higher 
 yeah  of  course  it  wasn't  honestly  like  i
[174:35] probably  am  manipulative 
 but  i  have  the  confidence  to  say  that 
 and  i  think  that 
 almost  every  single  person  has  to  say
[174:42] that  like  you  would  be  too  at  this  point 
 everyone  would  be 
 i  would  be  higher  than  everyone  else 
 because  i've  purposely  like
[174:49] researched  and  i  found  the  things  that 
 work  and  you  know  through 
 self-improvement  itself  is  manipulative
[174:54] but 
 then  you  know  i mean  at  this  point  it's 
 like  i'll  go  into  the  gym  as  manipulator
[174:59] is  someone  going  to  make  that  as  a  point 
 or  a  girl  getting  advice  from  her  friend
[175:04] in  terms  of  texting  a  guy  and  her  friend 
 says  oh  you  don't  do  this  like  don't 
 reply  to  him  just  yet  that's 
 manipulative  but
[175:09] is  anyone  gonna  join  it's  just  that
[175:14] i  can  be  branded  as as  a  guy  who's 
 manipulative  who's  controlling 
 and  i'll  take  it  but  i  don't  think  most
[175:20] of  the  people  would 
 like  if  that  is  what  manipulation  that 
 isn't  something  that  you  should  take
[175:26] that  isn't  something  you  should  take 
 that's  something  that  you  should 
 acknowledge  and  look  at  the  behaviors
[175:32] that  are  that  way 
 and  assess  and  think  right  what  can  i 
 change 
 and  learn  from  it  you're  always  about
[175:38] bettering  yourself  and  like  literally 
 your  whole  channel  is  about 
 self-improvement  like  use  this  to 
 improve  yourself
[175:45] goodbye  like  i  know  i  know  that  you  in 
 your  brain 
 telling  your  girlfriend  if  you  do  this
[175:52] i'll  leave  like  that  seems  justified 
 because 
 obviously  that  anxious  attachments  that
[175:58] you  don't  put  yourself  in  a  situation 
 that  makes  your  partner  anxious  which  i 
 i  do  agree  with  to  some  extent  but  it
[176:04] we  don't  tell  people  what  they  can  and 
 can't  do  and  yeah 
 ultimately  you  can  say  i  wasn't  telling
[176:09] you  what  you  can  and  can't  do  i  was  just 
 telling  you  if  you  do  certain  things  i'd 
 leave 
 but  that  is  telling  me  what  i  kind  of
[176:14] can't  do  because  i  don't  want  you  to 
 leave 
 i  won't  get  into  a  relationship  with  you 
 if  i  wanted  you  to  leave  so  of  course
[176:19] like 
 when  you're  saying  to  me  oh  if  you  do 
 this  i  feel  too  anxious  and  i'll  have  to 
 leave  that  is  telling  me  what  i  can  and
[176:24] can't  do  and  that's  making  me  choose 
 between  you 
 and  something  that  would  have  happened 
 like  so  how  should  i  have  done  that  then
[176:30] what  do  you  think  what  you  mean 
 like  put  yourself  in  my  shoes  that's  a
[176:35] boundary  that  i  want  to  like  make  clear 
 because 
 i  didn't  need  to  kind  of  express  it
[176:40] beforehand  before 
 it  came  up  that  you  wanted  to  like  start 
 you  know  to  go  to  this  club  or  something
[176:45] but  when  it  came  up  it  wasn't  because 
 i've  just  broken  up  with  you  straight 
 away
[176:50] what  do  you  mean  but  there  was  no 
 situation  where  i  wanted  to  go  to  a  club 
 the  only  situation  was  the  event  that  i
[176:56] booked  which  i  remembered  about  after 
 we'd  already  had  all  these  conversations 
 mm-hmm  but  it  didn't  remember  like  we
[177:02] were  speaking  about  it 
 like  like  what  i  kind  of  see  i  do  see
[177:07] your  point 
 and  i  am  beginning  to  agree  with  it  but 
 my  issue  is  then  is
[177:12] in  terms  of  improving  and  to  not  be 
 manipulative  or  to  set  these  like 
 controlling  boundaries
[177:17] how  because  the  only  other  way  is  to 
 just  never  get  into  a  relationship
[177:22] with  someone  who  could  potentially  cross 
 one  of  your  boundaries  which  honestly  is 
 probably  like 
 the  better  way  but  at  some  point
[177:30] no  matter  whether  you're  with  someone 
 who  never  ever  ever  goes  out 
 never  goes  to  clubs  never  puts
[177:35] themselves  in  that  environment  i'm  that 
 person 
 i  never  i  never  ever  ever  go  to  clubs
[177:40] like  ever  i  mean  obviously  it's  been 
 locked  down  since  you've  known  me  so 
 you  can  only  like  believe  so  much  but
[177:47] it's  never  been  me  second  year  of  uni 
 literally  went  out 
 twice  at  uni  it  was  literally  at  uni
[177:54] and  went  out  twice  in  the  whole  year  and 
 but  the  thing  is  even  if  you  get  with
[177:59] someone  who's  not  like  that  there's 
 going  to  be  if  you're  planning  on 
 spending  forever  together  that  is  gonna 
 be 
 a  point  where  i  would  have  gone  on  a
[178:05] night  out  without  you 
 that  is  gonna  happen  at  some  point  in
[178:10] forever 
 there's  gonna  be  a  point  where  you  can 
 go  on  a  night  out  with  your  boys  like 
 this 
 that's  what  happens  so  you  can't
[178:18] say  oh  i'm  never  gonna  i'm  not  gonna  get 
 with  someone  that  never  goes  to 
 nightclubs  like 
 that  was  me  i  never  go  to  nightfalls  but
[178:23] it  is  gonna  happen  at  some  point 
 and  you  can't  ruin  a  whole  relationship
[178:28] based  off  something  which 
 isn't  gonna  happen  like  yeah  they're 
 going  to  go  tonight  not  going  to  cheat 
 on  you
[178:33] and  you  your  fear  of  something  that 
 would  have 
 never  ever  ever  happened  ruined  our
[178:39] relationship 
 for  me
[178:44] and  the  reason  why  we  were  hesitant  to 
 get  into  a  relationship  was  because  of 
 your  trust  issues
[178:49] and  for  me  it  feels  like  it  ended 
 because  of  your  trust  issues  i  feel  like 
 it's  probably  very  different  from  you 
 but 
 we  both  have  different  experiences  from
[178:55] this  so 
 yeah  that's  true  no  i  can  see  it  as 
 that's  like  a  reasonable
[179:01] um  oh  i  need  to  sneeze  but  it's  just 
 like  teasing  me
[179:06] i  hate  that  sorry  what  were  you  saying
[179:12] um  i  can  see  that  as  like  a  reasonable 
 um  reason  for  you
[179:19] to  think  about  the  breakup  it's  not 
 exactly  the 
 the  thing  that  i  have  in  mind  but  to  be
[179:24] honest  it  kind  of  is  because 
 if  i  didn't  have  the  trust  issues  if  i 
 didn't  think
[179:29] like  if  i  didn't  need  to  keep  thinking 
 to  myself  okay  i'm  close  to  the  line  i 
 don't  feel  secure  in  this  relationship
[179:34] she  wants  to  go  do  this  like 
 40  single  girl  [ __ ]  then  it  would  have
[179:39] been  like  a  closer  connection  it  would 
 have  been  less  negativity  it  would  have 
 been 
 lesser  the  thing  that  ended  us  wouldn't
[179:44] have  ended  us 
 yeah  i  don't  know  because  i  mean
[179:50] maybe  we  would  have  ended  because  of 
 something  else  who  knows  but  because  we 
 ended  before  that
[179:57] because  i  broke  up  with  you  while  she 
 was  still  in  york 
 because  it  just  stopped  being  worth  it
[180:03] at  that  point 
 it  was  like  because  of  the  issues  that 
 you  have
[180:09] it  wouldn't  have  not  been  worth  it 
 that's  not  fair  to  say  like  all  those 
 shoes  you  have  is  the  issues  we  had
[180:14] because  yeah  yeah  i  agree  that's  caused 
 by  huge  i  mean  it  was  like 
 whether  or  not  you  know  it's  my  brain
[180:19] it's  irrational  but  it's  like  it  was  our 
 issues  and  it's  unfair  to  just  say  yeah
[180:27] yeah  yeah  sorry  you  had  less  trust 
 issues  simply  because 
 maybe  we're  like  built  different  but
[180:32] honestly  mostly  because  of  the 
 environment  because  you're  not  like
[180:37] going  to  fear  much 
 much  trust  with  the  things  that  i  do 
 which  is  just  my  routine  and  you  know
[180:43] the  biggest  thing  was  like  going  to  the 
 gym  rings  but  if  i  started  going  out 
 more  consistently  and  i  went  away  for  a
[180:48] couple  of  weeks  to  like  live  with  my 
 boys  for  a  bit 
 you  and  to  you  know  go  drinks  you  would 
 then  100  be  in  my  situation  in  it
[180:55] yeah  it  wasn't  exactly  issues  yeah  this 
 calls  like 
 opened  like  maybe  you  understand
[181:02] a  lot  of  things  more  and  i  feel  like 
 maybe  you 
 had  that  perception  of  me  like  coming  to
[181:08] uni  or  going  to  uni 
 because  of  the  perception  you  had  of  me 
 when  we  first  met  which  is  this  [ __ ]
[181:13] girl  persona 
 whereas  that  like  it  couldn't  ever  have 
 been  further  from  the  truth  for  me
[181:19] so  i  feel  like  you  i  feel  like  maybe 
 like 
 this  has  just  clicked  maybe  you  thought
[181:24] that  me  going  to  uni  is  going  to 
 put  me  into  like  being  like  that  because
[181:29] of  when  we  first  met  i 
 you  had  this  like  football  perception  of 
 me  yeah  that's  exactly  what  it  is  but
[181:34] that  isn't  me 
 that's  never  ever  ever  been  me  no  but
[181:39] that's 
 i  mean  you  know  it's  nice  for  you  to  say 
 that  but  it's  like
[181:44] that's  how  you  interact  with  me  it's  not 
 about  believing  you  because  it's  not
[181:49] like  i 
 disbelieve  you  it's  just  that  i  can  only 
 obviously  see  you  how  i've  seen  you 
 and  that  was  you  like  the  [ __ ]  girl
[181:55] obviously  is  like 
 the  wrong  word  because  you're  not  you're 
 not  even  a  [ __ ]  girl  and
[182:00] but  whatever  word  we  would  say  is  is 
 not  my  eve  not  like
[182:06] we  both  had  like  two  versions  where  it 
 was  like  i  was  your  hamza  you  were  my 
 eve  and  then  we  also  had  the  one  where
[182:11] we  were  like  the  tinder  version  like 
 we'll  say 
 yeah  number  two  he's  the  one  who  gets
[182:17] all  the  [ __ ] 
 and  so  you  were  like  that  that  was  like
[182:23] i 
 automatically  in  my  mind  is  like  you're 
 gonna  be  like
[182:28] basic  [ __ ]  like  social  media  eve  or 
 tinder  eve  when  you  go  and  to  be  honest 
 the  thing  is
[182:33] it  it  happened  that  was  exactly  like  one 
 hundred  percent  of  what  happened  is  you 
 went  it  happened  but  i  showed  to  you
[182:39] that  i  was  that  i 
 i  it  didn't  happen  but  my  behavior  made 
 it  seem  as  though  it  had
[182:44] someone  so  it  happened  john  mean  let's 
 just
[182:52] but  no  like  the  instagram  thing  like 
 [ __ ]  stupid  like 
 that's  right  literally  what
[182:59] i  kind  of  knew  would  happen  and 
 you  didn't  go  as  far  as  i  thought  you'd
[183:05] you  would  have  with  something  like  that 
 but  if  again  it's  the  situation  if  that 
 was  coupled  with  you  drinking  and  you
[183:10] were  all  out  for  drinks  and 
 there  was  a  couple  of  guys  that  you  were 
 all  speaking  it's  like  it  can  add  up 
 especially  when  you  vote  yeah  of  course
[183:15] but  it  would  have  never  happened 
 so  i  can  understand  why
[183:21] for  them  it  did  happen  how  i  expected  it 
 is 
 you  you  reverted  back  to
[183:29] tinder  girl  or  like  social  media  eve 
 which 
 but  you  only  saw  that  one  point  you  only
[183:35] saw  that  one  point  where 
 i  was  stupid  and  i  went  and  looked  at 
 who  you  were  following  on  instagram
[183:40] you  didn't  see  all  the  other  time  when  i 
 was  sat  in  my  room  meditating  and 
 journaling  and 
 that  they're  thinking  about  you  like
[183:46] when  i'm  at  uni  i  spend 
 a  very  small  amount  of  time  with  my 
 friends  the  most  the  most  part  of  the
[183:51] time  i  spend  on  my  own  and 
 you  can  say  i  remember  i  told  that  to 
 you  and  you  were  like  oh  why  do  you  want 
 to
[183:56] go  back  to  uni  but  i  like  the  routine  i 
 have  here  like 
 my  housemates  have  moved  out  i'm  still 
 here  on  my  own  for  two  weeks
[184:04] i  do  understand  that  a  lot  more  now 
 after  i  think
[184:09] when  we  were  like  fully  together  i 
 didn't  have  a  negative  perception  of 
 your  family  at  all  like  i  really  liked 
 them
[184:14] and  i  didn't  see  any  kind  of  negativity 
 from  them  so  when  you  would  say  like  oh 
 you  didn't  exactly  want  to  be  home  you'd
[184:19] rather  do  your  dissertation  here  because 
 it's 
 peaceful  and  everything  i  couldn't 
 really  understand  it  cause  i  was  just 
 thinking  let's  do  it  at  home
[184:25] obviously  whilst  everything  was  kicking 
 off  i  was  like  [ __ ]  this  is  like 
 why  she  actually  liked  being  there  and
[184:30] it  reminded  me  of  a  few  years  ago  when 
 i  really  liked  being  in  my  student
[184:35] accommodation  because  it'd  be  like 
 just  yelling  and  [ __ ]  in  my  house  and  i 
 thought  oh  yeah  that
[184:40] it  makes  sense  now  like  why  should  she 
 enjoys 
 living  out  because  she's  still  like  20
[184:45] something  in  it  she's  like  21  like 
 yeah  like  you're  what  three  twenty  four
[184:50] twenty  fours 
 yeah  how  was  your  birthday  huh
[184:56] was  your  birthday  yeah  it was  real  good 
 got  cake  kickboxing
[185:03] all  the  boys  were  like  messaging  me  like 
 happy  birthday  and  everything  that  i  got 
 a  little  bit  you  just  lay  that  card  into
[185:09] your  pillow  like 
 [Laughter]
[185:16] not  exactly
[185:29] yeah  we  just  like  checking  your  phone 
 waiting  for  me  to  reply 
 yeah  like  once  or  like  50  times
[185:39] yeah  i  don't  think  i  don't  think  i'm 
 shocked  by  your  reply
[185:44] put  him  i  don't  think  i've  fully  moved 
 on  from  you 
 no  i  haven't  i  found  it  difficult  to
[185:49] like  interact  i  was  speaking  to  some 
 about  this  like  the  last  few  days 
 especially  like  i've  been  trying  to  get 
 back  out  there  and  speak  to  girls
[185:55] and  i  literally  i  find  it  so  difficult 
 and  i  was  trying  to  think  why  and  i was
[186:00] thinking  i  was  like  am  i  [ __ ]  am  i 
 ugly  now  like  what  the  [ __ ]  like 
 and  i  didn't  even  like  have  it  in  my
[186:05] mind  at  all  up  until  this  call  and  i 
 just  realized  it  yeah  it's  because
[186:10] how  [ __ ]  my  soccer  and  how  can  you 
 like  try  and  speak  to  new  girls  when 
 you're  like  still  in  love  with  someone
[186:17] you  know  i  think  that's  like
[186:22] why  i've  been  the  way  i  have  been  just 
 kind  of  like  no  interest  in
[186:27] hmm  asexual 
 yeah  like  i've  been  in  like  situations
[186:34] and  stuff 
 and  i  was  just  like
[186:40] that's  just  not  that's  what  girls  they 
 have  to  get 
 pounded  they're  like  oh  don't  know
[186:45] whether  no
[186:50] what  situation  is  that  um
[187:00] i'm  sorry  harry  was  calling  me  oh  [ __ ]  i 
 didn't  realize  the  times
[187:08] three  hour  podcasting  the  [ __ ]  gonna 
 watch  this 
 three  hours  yeah  what  time  did  you  start
[187:16] for  [ __ ]
[187:23] didn't  realize  it  was  a  sign  um
[187:35] do  you  miss  me
[187:48] so  mad  like  all  these  poems  do  you  miss 
 me
[187:53] um  yeah 
 i  just  miss  like  the  the  good  times
[188:03] i'm  not  sat  here  like  ah  oh  when  she 
 makes  me  cry  again 
 i  miss  that  [ __ ]
[188:09] the  good  times  like 
 yeah  i  kind  of  wish  i  could  re-lift  them
[188:16] sometimes  but 
 i  don't  feel  like  it  would  have  been 
 like  that  forever
[188:23] i  think  without  without  the  bad  times 
 it  would  have  and  i  don't  know  if  that
[188:29] like  makes  it  invalid  or  not  but  we 
 would  have  been  like 
 as  cute  together  forever  in  that  sense
[188:35] like 
 if  there  wasn't  a  bad  thing  then  we 
 would  have  still  been  like  how  cute  we 
 were
[188:40] even  when  we  were  like  something 
 still  going  on  drives
[188:50] finally  [ __ ]  finish  that  hike 
 [Laughter]
[188:56] for  like  10  minutes  let's  take  a  break 
 it  was  so  stumbling  oh  my  god  i  went  to
[189:02] the  beach  the  other  day  and  no  joke 
 burned  my 
 entire  body  like  i'm  so  sunburned  still
[189:08] i  think  i've  got  a  bit  of  a  tan  though 
 how  could  that
[189:13] go  over  time  but  um
[189:20] sorry  i  need  to
[189:33] sorry  harriet's  going  to  visit  me  so 
 she's  just  texting  me  um
[189:41] should  i  ask  my  questions  that  i  have 
 um  those  ones  yeah
[189:47] why  did  you  want  to  do  this  podcast
[189:53] i'd  be  lying  if  i  said  that 
 i  knew
[190:00] i'd  be  lying  if  i  said  that  i  didn't  do 
 this 
 knowing  that  it'd  get  better  views
[190:05] because  that's  like  it's  such  an 
 interesting  topic  to  see 
 two  exes  speak  especially  because
[190:10] they've  seen  me  on  the 
 um  videos  talking  about  you  they're 
 seeing  little  clips  of  you  throughout
[190:15] the  last  few  months 
 and  so  honestly  that  was  like  one  of  the 
 main  reasons
[190:20] but  also  it  was  like  my  own  curiosity  of 
 of
[190:28] you  know  like  it's  not  so  much  that  i've 
 wanted  to  actually  speak  about  our 
 relationship  in  the  sense  that  oh
[190:33] like  what  did  you  think  of  this  it 
 wasn't  even  that  it  was  literally  that
[190:38] i  just  felt  interested  in  speaking  to 
 you 
 and  i  just  knew  that  it  would  be  like  a
[190:43] good  conversation  even  if  it  was  a  bad 
 conversation  it  would  be 
 good  for  at  least  yeah  like  for  me  like
[190:49] yeah  just  i  was 
 hoping  that  you'd  come  on  here  and  just
[190:54] be  a  massive  dick  so  i  could  just  like 
 fully  just  be  like  oh  [ __ ]  that  guy  just 
 me  i  thought
[190:59] you  were  going  to  be  you  know 
 yeah  i  thought  you  were  going  to  be  like 
 full  on  like  like  i  had  some  [ __ ]
[191:05] good  comebacks  and  everything  like  i 
 would  [ __ ] 
 dropped  you  like  i  was  telling  them  to 
 simon  even  he  was  like  oh  my  god  i'm  so
[191:11] you  just  can't  read  anyone 
 they're  gone  no  god
[191:19] once  we're  good  oh  my  god  it's  that 
 hurtful 
 [ __ ]  yeah  just  in  case  if  you  wanted  to
[191:26] get  onto  the  hostility 
 i'll  just  go  through  the  four  four  point 
 combo
[191:33] okay  what  made  you  want  to  come  on  to 
 here
[191:38] i  think  i  kind  of  said  it  before  like  i 
 was  really  hesitant  to  speak  to  you
[191:43] right  after  we  broke  up  but  then 
 obviously  it's  been  like  one  month  now 
 like  just  over  a  month  probably  so  i
[191:50] think 
 it's  i've  realized  that  i  do  need 
 to  have  a  last  conversation  with  you
[191:57] like  talking  about  everything  and  like 
 was  both  getting  everything  off  our 
 chest  for  closure  that's  why  i  did
[192:03] how  did it  feel  news  isn't  even  a  part 
 of  it  for  me 
 yeah  where  did  you  feel  when  you
[192:09] messaged  because  i  was 
 you  know  it  disappeared  from  my  mind  but
[192:14] i  remember  you  messaged  me  saying  like 
 you  were  really  in  pain  and  you  really 
 missed  me  i 
 actually  felt  like  i  didn't  feel  that  at
[192:20] all  at  that  point  because  i  went  fully 
 into  like  i'm  not  thinking  about  girls 
 so  i  remember  messaging  you  like  oh  no
[192:26] i'm  good  i'm  happy  like  i  don't  want  to 
 speak  to  you  or  something  yeah 
 no  you  i  think  you  said  you've  already
[192:32] i'm  feeling  good 
 yeah  i  think  you  put  um  i'm  feeling
[192:38] much  happier  this  will  hurt  to  read  i 
 know  this  will  hurt  to  read  but  you 
 deserve  the  truth  and  i  was  like
[192:45] my  heart  but  um
[192:55] what  were  you  gonna  say  for  them  did  it 
 hurt  to  read
[193:00] yeah  i  was  already  in  a  mess  but  i  sent 
 you  that  message
[193:05] what  were  you  hoping  for  be  honest  like 
 completely  honest  and  unfiltered  were 
 you  hoping  for  me  to  say  like
[193:10] [ __ ]  me  too  huh
[193:16] i  wasn't  hoping  to  get  anything  from  it 
 i  just  wanted  to  let  you  know  how  i  felt 
 because  i  mean  like  going  from  sharing
[193:22] every  single  thought  that  came  into  my 
 brain  with  someone  to  having  absolutely 
 no  contact  as  i  would  [ __ ] 
 yeah  true
[193:29] i'm  glad  that  we're  both  on  like  pretty 
 much  the  same  page  now
[193:34] because 
 yeah  i  think  that's  what  you  wanted  like
[193:39] i  didn't  i  had  already  kind  of  moved  on 
 not  like  at  that  point  i  had  moved  on
[193:44] but  it  lasted  for  like 
 a  couple  of  weeks  whilst  i  wasn't  really 
 thinking  about  you  i  was  just  kind  of
[193:50] thinking  negatively  about  you 
 and  for  the  last  like  probably  week  week 
 and  a  half
[193:55] i  thought  like  a  quite  a  lot  more  about 
 you 
 and  i  think  i  will  think  a  lot  more
[194:00] about  you 
 yeah  but  more  in  life  you  think  got  me 
 every  day
[194:05] yeah  like  i  don't  know  like 
 20  something  times  a  day  probably
[194:13] yeah  it's  probably  about  the  same  amount 
 for  me  to  be  honest  what  like  what  are 
 you  doing  when  you  think  of  me
[194:20] oh  snap
[194:25] it's  not  like  it's  not  it's  nothing  like 
 that  is  there  like  certain  things  that 
 remind  you  of  me
[194:31] like  i'll  be  brushing  my  teeth  i 
 remember  the  video 
 of  oh  looks  like  around  the  video  of  me
[194:36] and  you  like  in  the  toilet  brushing  our 
 teeth  and  you  like  doing  a little 
 dance  and  everything
[194:44] remember  that  and  then  a lot  of  the 
 times  it's  just  me  kind  of 
 um  waking  up  like  the  moment  i  wake  up
[194:51] or  in 
 sure  yeah  now  when  i'm  sleeping  it's
[194:56] obvious  i'm  cuddling  my  pillow  thinking 
 about  you  and  [ __ ] 
 um  do  you  still  do  that  yeah
[195:05] every  now  and  then  i'll  throw  the  pillow 
 away  and  i'm  like  nah  i'm  not  gonna 
 leave  you  [ __ ]  off 
 like  halfway  through  the  night  i  just
[195:10] like  reach  back  for  it 
 i'm  sorry  is  it  always  thinking  about  me
[195:18] no  i  won't  lie  to  you  it  is  like  it  does 
 change 
 so  sometimes  i  do  think  about  like  my  ex
[195:24] before  you  sometimes  i  think  about  like 
 like  i've  spoke  to  like  a  couple  of 
 girls  over  the  last  month  or  so  so  i
[195:29] think  about  them  sometimes 
 but  i'd  say  it's  you  like  probably
[195:35] eighty  percent  of  the  time  no  it 
 it's  hard  to  say  because  you  can't  go
[195:40] back  now  eighty  percent  that's  what  it 
 is 
 no  i  was  gonna  say  it's  like
[195:45] it  would  be  100  but  it's  like  the  20  of 
 the  time  i've  like  purposely  thought
[195:50] like 
 oh  no  it's  probably  not  like  good  for  me 
 to  like  keep  thinking  about  it  yeah 
 so  it's  like  because  otherwise  it's  like
[195:56] if  there  is 
 like  i  love  you  right  now  more  than  i 
 love  anyone  else  and  so 
 it  is  going  to  be  like  if  i'm  going  to
[196:02] think  about  someone  in  a  sense  like  a 
 girl  like  you  know 
 i'm  cuddling  as  i  go  to  sleep  i'm  going
[196:07] to  think  about  you  in  it 
 yeah  of  course  do  you
[196:12] did  you  love  me  more  than  you  loved  the 
 other  girls  in  the  past 
 it's  not  even  close
[196:22] next  question  next  question 
 see  ya  um
[196:31] one  of  my  questions  i  mean  you've 
 answered  it  already  but  it  was 
 did  you  really  feel  the  way  you  said  you
[196:37] did  i  think  we  both  know 
 did  you  ever  feel  like  i  didn't  like  you
[196:42] can't  fake  that  [ __ ] 
 i  think  you  might  have  like  sometimes 
 gotten  the  idea  like  oh  wait  he  couldn't
[196:47] have  like  loved  me  if  he  was  being 
 controlling  or  something  or  manipulative 
 if  it  weren't  for  the  tears  yeah  but
[196:53] you've  got  to  think 
 okay  even  if  i  was  at  everything  you  say 
 manipulative  abusive  is  like
[196:59] that  wasn't  out  of  hate  that  was  that 
 was  like  my  [ __ ]  version  of  love 
 yeah  of  course  that's  a  hundred  percent
[197:05] like  that's  what  i've  always  said  is 
 you  loved  me  but  maybe  it's  in  your  own
[197:11] weird  way  yeah 
 did  you  feel  genuine  towards  everything
[197:17] you  said 
 to  you  what  do  you  think
[197:28] i've  had  in  my  mind  recently  like  i 
 don't  know  if  i've  tried  to  like 
 convince  myself  or  not  but  i  haven't  had 
 in  my  mind  like
[197:34] she  couldn't  have  meant  all  that  stuff 
 if  this  is  like  how  it  ended  if  this  is
[197:39] yeah  like  her  reaction  if  we  ended  and 
 and  she  didn't  even  message  me  properly 
 like  to  say  goodbye
[197:44] i  you  know  i  wrote  her  like  a  letter  and 
 i  even  wrote  on  it  like  i  would  be 
 grateful  if  you  wrote  me  one
[197:49] and  she  didn't  do  and  i  was  going  to  i 
 was  going  to 
 i  was  going  to  after  my  dissertation  i
[197:55] just 
 i  wrote  i  wrote  so  many
[198:00] letters  to  you  but  i  just  never  sent 
 them  some  of  them
[198:05] never  like  crumpled  them  always 
 i  mean  not  handwritten  ones  i've  written 
 on  my  notes  on  my  phone
[198:11] you  still  got  them  yeah  send  me  them
[198:16] right  now  yeah  okay  are  you  going  to 
 block  me 
 right  now  no  i  won't  do  it  right  now
[198:22] because  i've  got  to  go  kind  of  soon 
 because  um  harriet's  on  her  way 
 to  meet  me  um  but  i'll  i'll  send  it  to
[198:29] you  after 
 after  the  call  yeah  are  you  gonna  block
[198:34] me 
 why  would  you  say  that
[198:41] i  just  assumed  that  you  would  i  don't 
 think  it's  like 
 everyone's  been  telling  me  to  block  you
[198:47] but  i  don't  think  it's 
 necessary  like  although  we  ended  on  bad
[198:52] terms  like  i  don't  want  us  to  look  back 
 and  be  like 
 resentful  towards  each  other  and  i  think 
 when  you
[199:00] oh  i  think  your  audio  is  just  cut  out
[199:05] yeah  what  do  you  say  um  i  said 
 like  although  obviously  we  ended  on  like
[199:10] very  bad  terms  like 
 i  don't  i  feel  like  when  you  block 
 someone  that  shows  like  resentment  and
[199:16] like 
 i  don't  know  it's  just  kind  of  like  i 
 don't  know  i  don't  know  what  my  opinion
[199:21] is  of  it  but 
 um  it's  easier  to  move  on  when  you  do 
 that
[199:26] and  that's  why  i  did  it  yeah  it  wasn't 
 out  of  like  like  i  didn't  have 
 resentment  towards  you  but 
 it  was  honestly  more  of  like  a  practical
[199:32] way  like  i  deleted 
 everything  off  you  like  i  was  on  the 
 call  with  the  boys  and  i  literally  went
[199:37] through  like 
 500  pictures  or  something  in  videos  and 
 then  she  deleted  them  and  even  showed  it
[199:42] to  the  boys  and  said  like  i've  deleted 
 them  from  the 
 recently  deleted  and  then  a  few  of  them
[199:48] did  yeah  yeah  but  i  left  them  i  recently 
 deleted 
 and  then  they  left  my  recently  deleted
[199:53] the  other  day 
 i  was  actually  hoping  you  didn't
[199:58] actually  wanted  them  back  because  i  was 
 hoping  you  didn't  because  i  wanted  them
[200:03] it's  so  mad  like  all  these  things  that  i 
 think  like  my  assumption  was  after  we 
 broke  up  like  you  just  went  back  to  like
[200:09] just  seeing  loads  of  people  like  just 
 didn't  give  a  [ __ ]  like  just  completely 
 shut  your  emotions  off  but  like  but  then
[200:14] i'm  like  oh  what  if  he  is  thinking  this 
 and  like  this  chord  made  me  realize  that 
 you  were 
 thinking  all  the  things  i  thought  you 
 were  like  i  forget  that  we're  like
[200:21] we  are  very  similar  yeah  that's  why  we 
 like  we  got  something 
 like  the  same  person
[200:28] because  it  makes  me  feel  like  it  didn't 
 even  exist 
 like  we  do  obviously  we've  got  those
[200:33] memories  and  we  will  look  back  with  a 
 bit  more  positivity  after  this  call 
 but  there's  just  so  much  like  substance
[200:38] when  you've  actually  got  videos  and 
 pictures  and  you  can  actually  still  got 
 some  of  them 
 i  think  i  kept  a  few  but  i  hid  them  in
[200:44] my  camera  roll 
 a  good  few  yeah  i  am  kind  of  sad  that  i
[200:50] deleted  them 
 because  like  it's  literally  all  of
[200:56] pretty  much  all  of  like  both  of  our 
 memories  from  the  last  like  eight  months 
 gone  because  most  of  them  were  together
[201:03] i  have  like 
 a  very  very  limited  amount  of  them  like 
 and  they  they're  not  the  ones  where  it's
[201:09] so  clear  that  it's  lost  you  know  in  like 
 the  the  picture  of  if  you  were  scrolling 
 you  can't  see  it  so
[201:14] it's  maybe  just  like  a  dark  rectangle 
 and  i'd  like  i  saw  it  and  i  was  like  i 
 know  what  this  is  i  clicked  on  it  or
[201:19] freestyling 
 oh  is  it  have  you  kept  that  one  or  did 
 you  complete  it  yeah  i've  got  like
[201:25] five  freestyle  videos  of  us  i've  got  one 
 i  was  hoping  that  you  i  was  thinking 
 about  the  freestyle  videos  like  a  couple
[201:30] of  weeks  ago  and  i was  like 
 i've  still  got  all  the  things  that  you 
 sent  me  on  like  text  because  i've  still
[201:36] got  our  text  conversation  i  didn't 
 delete  that 
 oh  there's  like  we  i  sent  you  like  bare
[201:41] pictures  of  us  something 
 since  we  got  all  them  oh  i  sent  me  them
[201:47] i'm  gonna  save  them  this  time  okay
[201:53] i  feel  like  this  has  been  good  for  both 
 of  us  i  feel  like  it's  probably  going  to 
 hurt  a  little  bit  more  afterwards  but
[201:59] it's  like  a  good  pain  though  yeah  it's 
 like
[202:04] i  feel  like  i'm  like  obviously  i  do  i 
 still  have  negative  feelings  towards  you 
 like  i'm  not  going  to  say  that  i  don't
[202:09] because 
 i  do  think  that  you  have  had  a  negative 
 you've  had  a  very  positive  influence  on
[202:14] me  but  you've  also  had  a  negative 
 impact  on  me  yeah  um
[202:19] so  i  do  hold  some  bad  feelings  of  course 
 and 
 but  i  think  just  hearing  what  you  have
[202:25] to  say  and  also  like  hearing  you  say 
 that  you  agree  with  some  of  the  things 
 i've  said  and  like 
 i  hope  it's  changed  your  perspective
[202:32] into  some  extent 
 i  know  obviously  i  can't  fully  change 
 your  mindset  i  wish  i  could  but
[202:38] we'll  be  in  this  situation  if  we  could
[202:48] [Music]
[203:00] um  was  actually  thinking 
 i  would  be  gonna  do  that  nah  that's  too
[203:06] much 
 it's  too  much  you  can't  leave  me  hanging
[203:17] [Laughter]
[203:27] it's  nice  to  be  that's  nice  speaking  to 
 you  too
[203:32] i  mean  it's  not  so  far  away  i  couldn't 
 even  like  fully  recognize  you 
 yeah  i  couldn't  fully  recognize  you  but
[203:38] we've  both  done  that  like 
 subconsciously  but
[203:43] i'm  like  i  can't  i  can't  even  like 
 see  you  like  how  i  see  you  like  it's  not
[203:52] i  don't  know  like  when  i  was  even 
 looking  at  your  instagram  pictures  the 
 other  day  when  i  messaged  you 
 to  come  onto  the  podcast  i  was  trying  to
[203:59] think  of  like  which  picture  actually 
 like 
 looked  like  you  because  i  said  this  to 
 you  before  it's  like  that's  not  like
[204:04] that's  not  eve  i  found  your  pictures 
 it's  like  that's  not  how  you  look  like 
 to  me 
 really  is  this  not  how  i  look  like  you
[204:12] it  kind  of  is  but  it's  like  it's  a 
 different 
 i  think  what's  ingrained  in  my  mind  is
[204:20] like  when  we  when  we're  like 
 fully  fully  like  like  we  look  at  each 
 other  different
[204:25] when  we're  like  vulnerable  and  we're 
 connected  to  each  other  and  we're  like 
 fully  in  love  with  each  other  and  that's
[204:31] what's  like  the  image  of  who  eve 
 is  like  right  now  you  look  like  your
[204:36] instagram  pictures  which  is  still  like 
 is  it's  acceptable
[204:42] i  like  that  you've  still  got  me  tagged 
 in  that  picture 
 yeah  have  you  been  checking  if  i  haven't
[204:48] removed  you 
 i've  been  checking
[205:01] it's  like  almost  robotic  like  i'll  click 
 on  your  name  to  message  you  and  i'll  let 
 you  just  go  into  your  profile  click  on 
 that  picture  tap  on  it  once  okay  good
[205:06] i'm  still  there 
 i'm  good  so  we're  good  now  yeah  that's 
 what  i  that's  what  i  do
[205:14] like  how  often  do  i  check  it  yeah  put  in 
 like  10  15  times  of  like  last  month  like
[205:20] every  time  we're  speaking  if  you  go  onto 
 my  profile  you  checked  it 
 oh  i  was  doing  it  every  day  at  one  point
[205:26] multiple  times  a  day 
 yeah  i  think  the  last  time  i  did  it  was
[205:32] like 
 probably  like  a  week  ago  or  something 
 probably  not  even  that  to  be  honest  it's
[205:37] probably  like 
 [Laughter]
[205:43] will  you  untag  me 
 yeah  i  don't  think  i'll  untuck  you  even
[205:49] though  like  we're  still  not  together 
 they  were  like  memories  that  we  had 
 together  and 
 you  were  there  yeah  oh  we  took  the
[205:55] pictures  of  each  other 
 yeah  credit  to  the  photographer
[206:03] yeah  you're  the  person  who  takes  the 
 best  pictures  of  me  which  is  so  [ __ ] 
 annoying
[206:09] i  got  you  the  only  reason  i was  with  you 
 photographer 
 just  got  a  picture  that  you  took  with  me
[206:23] i  see  you  pretending  to  look  away  and 
 you're  like  look  at  the  corner  like 
 is  he  stuff  like  screen  shot  quick
[206:37] [Laughter]
[206:45] i  won't  be  surprised  if  i  just  get 
 attacked  soon  drive  one  day
[206:51] do  it  do  it  because  i'll  be  so  funny 
 obviously  i'm  not  going  to  come  but
[206:56] just  do  it  so  i  can  reject  you  um 
 for  me  she  loved  me  he  was  i  think
[207:01] you're  just  biting  me  into  doing  it 
 you're  actually  going  to  say  like 
 7  14.
[207:10] oh  [ __ ]  math  freedom
[207:15] i  have  a  feeling  like  we're  gonna  see 
 each  other  again  at  some  point 
 in  what  way  like  not  accidentally
[207:23] like  one  time  we're  gonna  like  either 
 one  of  us  is  gonna
[207:28] send  that  message  out  and  we  are 
 actually  gonna  meet  i  don't  know  if  we 
 probably  won't  like 
 get  into  a  relationship  but  i  don't
[207:34] think  we're  never  gonna  see  each  other 
 again 
 i  don't  know
[207:41] right  now  i  don't  feel  like  we'll  ever 
 see  each  other  again
[207:47] that's  completely  i  mean  we  live  in  the 
 same  time  we're  going  to  bump  into  it 
 not  even  that  it's  like  it's  gonna  be
[207:54] not 
 yeah  no  no  it  is  it's  going  to  be  like
[208:00] both  of  us  just  messaging  and  just 
 the  world  doesn't  want  us  to  do  that
[208:05] [ __ ]  but  it's  like  [ __ ]  yeah 
 the  only  way  it  would  happen  is  safe 
 like  you  messaged  me  and  we  were
[208:11] actually  like 
 messaging  and  stuff  and  getting  on  and 
 then  it  happened
[208:16] but  i  like  i'd  never  reach  out  for  you 
 for  that 
 to  you  for  that  to  happen
[208:21] [Music] 
 i  won't  be  surprised  if  you  did  yeah  i 
 have  a  feeling  like  i  will
[208:29] are  you  waiting  by  my  phone
[208:35] i'm  glad  you  said  that
[208:40] you  just  laughed  exactly  like  how  i 
 remember
[208:50] really 
 you  think  you  love  me  more  because  of
[208:55] this  call 
 yeah  definitely
[209:01] yeah  me  too  what  are  we  doing
[209:06] and  then  [ __ ]  like  i'm 
 right  now  i'm  like  oh  i  feel  good  like
[209:11] it's  it's  fine  like  this  has  actually 
 helped  but 
 i'm  on  the  call  with  you  right  now  yeah
[209:17] is  that  how  you  feel  what  do  you  mean 
 like  right  now  i  feel  better  about
[209:23] everything  and  i'm  like  oh  like  this  is 
 really  like  this  call's  really  helped 
 like  i  feel  really  fine  about  it  now 
 but  i'm  i'm  like  talking  to  you  right
[209:29] now  yeah 
 but  this  like  i  was  expecting  that 
 though  because
[209:34] like  we  always  felt  better  when  we'd 
 like  speak  about  this  stuff  but  when 
 we'd  have  like  a little  bit  of  a 
 distance  or  whatever
[209:39] then  it'd  be  worse  than  it  it  was  like 
 like  the  whole  time  no  i  i  knew  it
[209:47] wouldn't  be  i  knew  like  i  had  a  feeling 
 that  either  it  would  be  like 
 hostile  as  [ __ ]  and  we'd  be  like  calling 
 each  other  out  or  something  or  it  would
[209:53] be  like 
 yeah  i  knew  it  would  be  one  way  or  the 
 other  yeah
[209:58] i'm  glad  it  went  this  way  yeah  me  too
[210:03] i  kind  of  wanted  you  to  be  a  dick  but 
 i'm  glad  that  it's 
 like  we're  both  going  to  take  it  away
[210:08] i'm  glad  that  you  still  love  me  so
[210:14] yeah  because  i  like 
 we  know  me  i  think  about  worst  case 
 scenario  so  i've  just  assumed  that  after
[210:20] this  breakup  you  were  just  like 
 fully  just  like  forgot  that  i  existed 
 and  we  just  like  seeing  loads  of  girls
[210:26] and  stuff 
 um  yeah  i  mean  it 
 honestly  it  was  kind  of  like  the  plan
[210:31] but  it  was  it  was  like 
 it  was  such  a  yeah  huh  you  just  too  sad
[210:38] it's  not  even  that  is  it  it's  not  so 
 much  like  this  it  was  just  like
[210:44] i'm  not  going  to  go  get  girls  whilst  i'm 
 in  love  with  someone
[210:49] essentially  i  was  like  taking  like  a 
 month  off  dating  and 
 and  you  know  just  being  a  monk  and
[210:54] celibate  and  stuff 
 and  i  thought  maybe  even  longer  than 
 that  and  i  just  realized  like  the  reason 
 why
[210:59] i  feel  so  uncomfortable  speaking  to 
 girls  right  now 
 is  because  it's  like
[211:06] it's  not  even  what  i  want 
 i'm  not
[211:14] i'm  not  over  you
[211:22] i  know  that  it's  like  it's  a  tricky  as 
 [ __ ]  situation  and  it's  probably  not 
 even 
 good  for  us  or  anything  i  don't  know
[211:28] that  it's 
 jo  i mean  it's  it's  all  of  my  like 
 conscious  like
[211:33] good  brain  is  saying  like  what  the  [ __ ] 
 are you  doing  bro  just  go  [ __ ]  some 
 [ __ ]  like  just  go  back  to  normal  like
[211:38] i  mean  but  it's  like  we  have  that 
 attachment 
 yeah  do  you  think  you  ever  will  fully
[211:45] move  on 
 yeah  at  some  point  but  right  now
[211:50] i  think  i  can't  like  i  can  see  myself 
 moving  on  but  i  still  like  we'll  always
[211:57] have  a  bit  of  love  for  each  other 
 like  it's  always  going  to  be  like  like  i 
 said  it's  like  once  it  turns  like  once
[212:02] the  love  turns  on  it  never  fully  can 
 fully  go  off  it's  just  like  one  percent
[212:07] and  it's  always  going  to  be  at  least  one 
 percent  and  i  think  after  this  call  it's 
 like 
 just  went  straight  up  like  10  or
[212:12] something 
 i'm  glad  that  it  has  even  if  yeah
[212:17] me  too  consciously  or  whatever  it's  like 
 all  the  problems  we've  had  is  like
[212:22] you  know  that  but  it's  i'm  actually  i'm 
 glad  like  i  said  i'm  grateful  that  we've 
 had  this  conversation  that
[212:28] we  both  seem  to  have  like  the  same 
 feelings  i  know  for  a  fact  like 
 although  you're  kind  of  reserved  about
[212:33] this  like  you  kind  of  want  it  as  much  as 
 i  do
[212:38] i  want  what  as  much  as  you  do  like 
 how  this  callers  went  yeah  of  course
[212:47] that's  what  i  wanted
[212:54] interesting 
 that's  interesting  i  wasn't  expecting
[213:00] well  i  mean 
 kind  of  was  blue
[213:07] i  feel  like  we're  both  like  carrying 
 over  talking  about  the  same  things  that 
 we've  been  able  to  avoid  ending  the
[213:16] course
[213:25] [Laughter]
[213:30] vodka  that  would  be  us
[213:36] you  have  like  a  feeling  right  now  like 
 you  don't  want  to  stop  speaking  to  me
[213:43] yeah  well  me  too 
 i  don't  want  to  stop  speaking  to  me
[213:48] either 
 sometimes  i  just  forget  that  like  the 
 other  half  of  my  screen  has  got  you
[213:54] i  was  like  staring  at  myself  like  i  knew 
 you'd  be  doing  that
[214:05] i  wish  i  could  just  make  myself  go  full 
 screen 
 you  can  on  my  phone  i'm  full  screen  now
[214:12] yeah 
 let  me  just  reply  to  harriet
[214:40] um
[214:51] [Music] 
 sorry
[215:04] sorry  she's  literally  just  like  on  her 
 way 
 to  meet  me  and  i  was  meant  to  uh
[215:10] like  you  know  didn't  plan  on  being  this 
 cool  being  on  this  call  this  long
[215:15] i  had  plans  between  this  call  and 
 meeting  harriet 
 but  at  last  here  we  are  and  harriet's
[215:21] getting  to  the  train  station  in  10 
 minutes 
 20  minutes  but  um
[215:34] like  i  think  it's  going  to  happen  after 
 this
[215:42] give  it  like  a  couple  of  days  before  i 
 message  you
[215:48] didn't  you  all  message  me  yeah
[215:53] i  will  yeah
[216:05] i  do  but  i  shouldn't 
 [Music]
[216:11] this  is  why  we  couldn't  melt  up  well 
 that's  why  your  parents  stopped  us  from 
 speaking
[216:18] i'm  just  like  literally  i can't  want  to 
 call  it  you're  abusive  and  now  i'm  like 
 i  was  just  speaking  to  you
[216:24] [Laughter] 
 everyone  was  scared  of  yeah  no  i  think
[216:30] it  would  be  good  like  i  don't  want  to 
 like  i  don't  want  to  leave  the  situation
[216:36] with 
 bad  feelings  like  i've  had  a  lot  of  bad 
 feelings  towards  you 
 i  don't  want  to  feel  bad  because  i'm
[216:42] very  grateful  for  you  like  i'm 
 so  grateful  like
[216:47] half  of  me  is  like  i  wish  none  of  it 
 ever  happened  but  the  other  half  of  me 
 is  like  really  grateful  i  did
[216:52] i  really  only  wish  it  didn't  happen 
 because  it's  painful  but  it  isn't 
 yeah  but  it's  not  like  on  the  good
[216:57] points 
 yeah  yeah  i  feel  the  same  way  but  i 
 think  it
[217:02] for  me  now  after  having  this 
 conversation  has  changed  and  it's  like 
 i'm  just  i'm  just  positive  now  i'm  not
[217:07] gonna  lie  i'm  not  even  like 
 i've  realized  like  i  i  don't  want  that
[217:13] negativity  and  in  fact  i  can  see  so  much 
 positivity  in  the  fact  that  we're  still 
 like 
 on  the  same  level  with  everything  that
[217:19] we're  doing  with  how  we've  like  been 
 interacting  and  how  we've  been  thinking 
 and  everything  it's  just  reminded  me  of
[217:24] like  how  compatible  we  were  and  how  much 
 connection  we  had 
 and  it's  just  made  me  like  i  think  you
[217:31] what  sorry  what  were  you  gonna  say 
 it  was  amazing  but  we  had  like  a  lot
[217:36] like  i  have  not  been  thinking  about  the 
 positive  sides  of  what  we  had 
 up  until  right  now  well  we  had
[217:43] but  it  was  very  special 
 it's  not  even  what  we  had  honestly  it's 
 what  we  have  because  it's  not
[217:49] it  still  hasn't  went  away  let's  be 
 honest 
 yeah  that's  true
[217:56] why'd  you  have  to  be  like  this
[218:04] fix  yourself 
 go  interview  with  me
[218:12] self-improvement  coach  together
[218:17] go  from  being  each  other 
 self-improvement  coach  to  getting  one 
 together
[218:23] [Music]
[218:29] you're  gonna  cuddle  your  pillow  extra 
 hard  tonight 
 absolutely  i'm  gonna  grab  your
[218:38] toothbrush 
 i  don't  have  it  anymore
[218:47] okay 
 there's  a  boyfriend
[218:56] [Laughter]
[219:03] i'm  glad  you're  not 
 well  i'm  not  dating  anyone
[219:11] yeah  i  mean  i'm  not  going  to  start 
 dating  someone  when  i'm  still
[219:21] would  you  classes  dating
[219:29] yeah  to  be  honest  i  wouldn't  expect  you 
 to  be  like  fully  like
[219:34] fully  fully  going  out  with  someone  right 
 now 
 but  at  least  like  fancying  someone  i
[219:41] like  and  some  i  mean  i  don't  know  you 
 could  like  someone  right  now  as  well 
 actually
[219:46] yeah  i  think  it's  possible  you  don't
[219:55] there's  a  bit  of  hesitation  in  there 
 i  didn't  there  was  a  bit  of  hesitation
[220:00] in  that 
 in  what  and  you're  like 
 [Music]
[220:07] what  do  you  mean  no  it  doesn't  matter 
 whatever 
 i  don't  want  to  get  into  details  about
[220:12] like  because 
 i  think  if  either  of  us  say  i  mean  i
[220:18] don't  know 
 i  don't  fancy  anyone  else
[220:29] is  that  anyone  else
[220:34] i  don't  can't  see  anyone 
 that's  bullshitting  you  fancy  anyone
[220:46] there's  this  one  girl
[220:52] i'm  not  in  as  [ __ ]
[220:57] well  she  like
[221:04] she's  goofy
[221:10] that's  true
[221:19] i've  like  covered  it  with  negativity  you 
 know  so  instead  of  thinking  about  you  20 
 times  a  day  like 
 positively  we're  thinking  like  i  fancy
[221:26] her  and  i'm  interested  in  her  and  i'm 
 thinking  about  her  and  i'm  like
[221:32] like  sexually  into  her  and  everything 
 instead  of  that  i've  just  like 
 threw  a  negative  negative  blanket  over
[221:39] it 
 because  it  seemed  like  that  would  it 
 probably  has  helped  to  to  think  about  it 
 less
[221:44] yeah  of  course  i  don't  think  that's  like 
 truthful  i  think  that  was  me  literally 
 just  like
[221:49] trying  to  feel  less  pain  by  saying  like 
 okay  quick  full  like  i've  literally  you 
 know  wrote  26  things  that  i  don't  like
[221:55] about  you  purposely  so  like 
 i  like  you  less  yeah  and  it  hasn't
[222:00] really 
 like  i  mean  it's  kind  of  helped  in  the 
 sense  that  it's  made  me  feel  more 
 negative  about  you  but
[222:05] all  it  took  was  like  one  conversation  to 
 just  think  like  but  there's  so  much  to 
 be  positive  about
[222:11] yeah  there  is
[222:17] it's  just  so  much  like  we're  so 
 compatible  but  also 
 incompatible  at  the  same  time
[222:25] let's  say  the  compatibilities  outweigh 
 the  incompatibility
[222:30] in  combat  incompatibilities  and  more 
 serious 
 yeah  that's  a  good  way  to  put  it
[222:39] do  you  think  your  mindset  could  change 
 it  already  is
[222:48] like  i'm 
 you  know  i'm  into  that  like
[222:53] self-improvement  and  i'm  into  like 
 having  a  small  ego  and  and  seeing  what  i
[222:58] can  improve 
 and  i  do  have  like  somewhat  obviously  i 
 play  it  up  a  little  bit  with  you  like
[223:03] when  i'm  just  joking  but  i  do  have 
 obviously  a  little  bit  of  a  god  complex 
 and  i'm  like  i  do  think  i'm  like  [ __ ]
[223:08] sick 
 but  at  the  same  time  i  do  also  have  like 
 this  thing  of  like  i'm  a  student 
 and  i'm  always  willing  to  learn  and  i
[223:15] can  see  that 
 my  my  mindset  my  behavior  hasn't  been
[223:20] optimum 
 because  especially  when  i  say  it  in  like
[223:25] a  practical  like 
 sense  where  it's  literally  just  like 
 analytical  when  i  say
[223:31] is  there  any  benefit  to  having  that 
 trust  issue  kind  of  mindset  no
[223:38] is  it  going  to  lead  to  more  problems  yes 
 like 
 that  we'd  still  be  together  yeah
[223:53] i  don't  feel  sad  about  it  you  know 
 because 
 i  think  it's  easy  for  us  to  say  like  hey
[224:00] it  is  sad 
 i  don't  know  because  i  think  it
[224:07] it's  easy  to  say  oh  if  you  just  didn't 
 have  that  i'd  be 
 joining  but  it  wouldn't  have  been  me  at
[224:12] that  time 
 yeah  that's  true  that's  like  you  know
[224:17] everything  we  were 
 compatible  with  was  it  was  included  with 
 that  and  all  the  experiences  by  i've  all
[224:22] the  experiences  i've  had  and  have  the 
 person  i  am  and  the  person  that  you 
 are  that's  all  of  our  compatibility  like
[224:28] we  can't  say  oh  you  know  if  we  just  took 
 this  bit  because  it  what 
 it's  like  a  package  and  the  package  was
[224:33] like  you  said  more  compatible  than  it 
 was  incompatible 
 and  it  was  just  that  at  that  time  or
[224:39] even  probably  still 
 yeah  still  now  to  be  honest  it's  like 
 distal  areas  of  improvement
[224:44] which  yeah  we  could  look  at  as  like  sad 
 but  to  me  it's  honestly 
 it's  like  i'm  like  in  my  head  i'm
[224:49] thinking  all  right  relationship  coaching 
 and  okay  i  know  what  the  problem  is  like 
 let's  see  like  how  much  progress  i  can
[224:54] make  in  this  area  now 
 is  that  what  you're  gonna  do  i've
[224:59] already  like  been  looking  for  some  i'm 
 gonna  find 
 like  a  guy  or  a  girl  who's  like
[225:04] you  know  who's  compatible  with  me  in 
 that  sense  but  i  haven't 
 i've  known  for  a  while  but  i've  never
[225:09] actually  wanted  the  you've  never  wanted 
 to  admit  it 
 kind  of  thing  it's  not  that
[225:17] it's  that  i  i've  i've  known  it  i've 
 admitted  it  but  i've  also 
 thought  that  it's  just  better  to  be  like
[225:23] that 
 and  i  i've  started  like  being  around
[225:28] more  people  who  are  into  this  vibe  of 
 like  a  very  sort  of  like  healthy 
 honest  wonderable
[225:35] way  would  they  the  way  that  they 
 interact  in  relationships 
 and  i've  been  really  really  interested
[225:40] in  that  and  i  thought  like  that's  what  i 
 wanted  to  convey  myself  with  like  i  even 
 did  like
[225:45] kind  of  like  an  experiment  where  i 
 thought 
 like  i  went  on  tinder  like  two  weeks  ago
[225:52] and  i was  like  you  know  what  i'm  not 
 being  a  [ __ ]  boy  anymore  i'm  not  using 
 shirtless  pictures  or  anything  i'm 
 literally  just  gonna  like
[225:58] post  like  good  like  i  literally  made  a 
 folder  of  like  good  boy  pics 
 like  all  clothes  and  everything  and  it
[226:04] was  just 
 like  i  mean  yeah  like  that  i  was  just 
 thinking  like
[226:09] after  experiencing  what  what  i  had  from 
 you  and  obviously  comparing  that  to
[226:14] hookups  and  one  that  stands  and  like 
 friends  with  benefits  is  like 
 it  honestly  it  doesn't  even  compare  from
[226:20] what  i've  got  from  you  from  our  time 
 together  is  that  i  am  like  a 
 relationship  guy
[226:25] and  now  that  i'm  honest  with  that  it's 
 like  i  know  exactly  what  i'm  looking  for 
 and  because  of  that  i  don't  need  to  act
[226:31] in  a  certain  way  which 
 is  better  for  hookups  but  worse  for 
 relationships  because  that's  how  i've
[226:36] always  been 
 for  my  adult  life  i  want  to  go  the 
 opposite  way  around  now  where 
 i'm  better  in  a  relationship  but  worse
[226:42] in  a  hookup  which 
 that's  like  that's  negative  for  the  ego
[226:47] which  once  you  know  like  bear  girls  body 
 count  it  wants 
 loads  of  guys  to  know  that  i'm  shagging
[226:52] but  yeah 
 the  amount  of  fulfillment  i'd  get  from 
 you  was  just  insane
[226:58] i'm  gonna  [ __ ]  an  uber  if  i  go  off 
 the  zoom  will  it  go  off  no
[227:07] yeah  podcasts  gonna  be  four  hours 
 no  uploading  this  [ __ ]
[227:14] i'll  send  it  to  sam  and  i'll  tell  them
