[00:00] I've  woken  up  with  morning  wood  there's 
 already  tissues  in  my  bin  from  last  time 
 now  technically  I've  already  gone  day
[00:06] Zero  of  nofap  so  there's  no  harm  in 
 going  for  another  round  is  that  but  no 
 I'm  not  gonna  do  it  I'm  gonna  have  a
[00:11] discipline  productive  masculine  day  I'm 
 a  gladiator  I'm  an  expert  in  Hunter  hand 
 combat  I'm  a  brave  lion  hunter  but  still
[00:19] I  mindlessly  grab  my  phone 
 I  see  that  there's  notifications
[00:24] Instagram  notifications  and  without  even 
 thinking  about  it  I  click  on  them  and 
 then  I  go  on  to  the  explore  page  and  I
[00:30] start  scrolling 
 I  know  what  I'm  looking  for  but  I  don't 
 want  to  admit  to  man's  greatest  weakness
[00:36] gym  girls  these  are  women  who  post 
 videos  of  them  exercising  teaching
[00:41] nutrition  and  Sports  Science 
 whilst  men  masturbate  to  them  I  go  from
[00:47] one  gym  girl  to  the  next  it's  early 
 morning  and  I'm  literally  coping  saying 
 that  this  is  for  testosterone  to  start
[00:53] my  day  and  I  can't  hold  it  any  longer  I 
 get  to  an  Instagram  models  page  and  I
[00:58] beat  my  meat  like  a  sad  little  monkey 
 and  I  officially  reset  my  nofap  streak 
 and  it's  not  even  8am  yet  but  before
[01:04] closing  the  Instagram  app  in  shame  and 
 notice  how  many  likes  that  she  has  on 
 this  picture
[01:10] there's  a  lot 
 48 
 000.
[01:16] and  I  can't  help  but  to  think  that 
 probably  10  times  that  number  of  men
[01:21] have  fat  to  this  girl  I  imagine  48  000 
 men
[01:27] that's  a  small  town  of  men  it's  three  or 
 four  Villages  of  men  it's  the  capacity
[01:34] of  the  Roman  Colosseum  but  there's  no 
 Lions  there's  no  Gladiators  there's  no
[01:40] weapons 
 there's  just  the  Instagram  model  right
[01:45] in  the  middle  of  the  stadium  and  48  000 
 men  spasming  in  their  seats
[01:51] including  me  this  was  not  the  productive 
 masculine  discipline  start  to  my  day
[01:56] that  I  imagined  this  was  not  the  hunter 
 hand  combat  that  I  visualized  this  is  me
[02:01] and  my  48  000  Brothers 
 being  unable  to  control  our  desire  our
[02:07] lust  because  we  lacked  willpower  the 
 lesson  from  this  story  is  that  it  is  so
[02:12] easy  to  beat  99  of  men  you  just  need  to 
 follow  the  seven  steps  to  increasing
[02:17] your  willpower  otherwise  you'll  turn  out 
 like  a  Roman  Colosseum  fapper  like  me  my
[02:23] name  is  Hamza  Ahmed  and  I'm  making  this 
 full  guide  for  you  because  I  think  that 
 we  as  young  men  should  develop  and
[02:29] achieve  self-mastery  this  is  a  movement 
 of  young  men  who  no  longer  want  to  live
[02:34] in  mediocracy  just  for  this  fault  guide 
 that  you're  watching  for  the  past  week 
 I've  been  waking  up  at  4  30  a.m  putting
[02:41] in  a  solid  five  hours  every  single  day 
 to  make  the  script  the  research  and  now 
 for  the  recording  that  means  that  this
[02:46] is  the  one  video  you  need  to  put  your 
 trust  into  to  level  up  your  willpower 
 and  to  understand  how  to  delay
[02:51] gratification  here's  your  first 
 actionable  step 
 think  about  porn
[02:56] think  about  video  games  think  about  some 
 junk  food  think  about  the  thing  that 
 usually  brings  you  into  those  bad  habits
[03:03] really  just  close  your  eyes  for  a  second 
 and  think  about  the  bad  habit  that  often 
 pulls  you
[03:10] and  the  desire  is  forming 
 if  you're  really  really  seeing  it  in
[03:16] your  mind  you're  probably  starting  to 
 feel  a  little  bit  agitated  maybe  a 
 little  bit  scared  or  nervous  or  anxious
[03:21] or  stressed 
 maybe  you're  starting  to  feel  a  little 
 bit  of  some  physical  symptoms  and  upset
[03:27] stomach  some  agitation  in  your  chest 
 what  we're  doing  right  now  is  implanting 
 a  desire  into  our  mind  the  desire  is  for
[03:33] one  of  these  bad  habits  it's  for  porn 
 video  games  drugs  whatever  it  is
[03:38] willpower  is  the  skill  of  resisting 
 desires
[03:43] and  so  for  this  actionable  step  right 
 here  right  now  I  want  you  to  use  your 
 willpower  to  get  rid  of  the  desire  you
[03:49] feel  the  Cravings  of  this  desire 
 and  use  your  willpower  to  resist  against
[03:54] it  every  second  that  you  stay  sat  here 
 looking  at  me  right  now  you  are 
 resisting  the  desire  that  is  your
[04:00] willpower 
 and  now  if  you  just  mentally  see 
 yourself  in  a  moment  of  strength  almost
[04:05] like  punching  away  the  desire  and  saying 
 no 
 and  focusing  back  onto  this  video  you've
[04:11] just  successfully  overcame  an  urge  a 
 craving
[04:16] by  doing  that  you've  just  gained 
 experience  in  The  Willpower  skill  step
[04:21] one  understanding  willpower  imagine  your 
 four-year-old  self  being  escorted  into  a
[04:27] room  an  empty  room  by  a  stranger  told  to 
 sit  down
[04:33] and  just  look  at  the 
 bag  of  sweets  and  they  pull  out  a
[04:39] marshmallow 
 they  tell  you  that  you  can  have  this 
 marshmallow  right  now
[04:44] or  if  you  wait  around  15  minutes 
 you  can  have  two  marshmallows  this  is
[04:50] the  marshmallow  experiment  and  it's  a 
 wonderful  test  of  willpower 
 so  now  you're  hit  with  this  debate  okay
[04:56] do  I  take  the  instant  grassification  the 
 singular  marshmallow  right  now  or  do  I 
 wait  this  15  minutes  and  get  the  two
[05:02] logically  it  makes  sense  to  wait  for  the 
 two  marshmallows  but  of  course  many 
 little  fat  kids  weren't  able  to  if  you
[05:08] put  younger  me  traumatized  abused 
 younger  Hamza  into  that  room  the
[05:13] researcher  wouldn't  have  even  been  able 
 to  finish  his  sentence  now  Hamza  you  can 
 have  the  one
[05:19] oh 
 it  seems  like  a  simple  insignificant 
 test  but  the  results  were  actually  quite
[05:26] scary 
 the  kids  who  weren't  able  to  delay 
 gratification  so  the  kids  who  just
[05:31] grabbed  the  first  marshmallow  and  ate  it 
 they  weren't  even  able  to  wait  15 
 minutes  they  statistically  performed
[05:37] worse  in  so  many  different  metrics  they 
 had  a  higher  BMI  so  they  were  literally
[05:42] fatter  they  scored  on  average 
 210  points  Less  on  the  College  admission
[05:48] SATs  compared  to  the  highest  like  sort 
 of  the  most  patient  peers  that  they  had
[05:54] the  ones  who  were  unable  to  delay 
 gratification  were  even  rated  as  being 
 like  less  socially  desirable  and  more
[06:00] lonely  when  they  were  teenagers  imagine 
 having  that  kind  of  disadvantaged  life 
 just  set  in  the  trajectory  of  your
[06:06] future  being  two  or  three  or  four  years 
 old  just  because  you  had  a  low  level  of
[06:12] willpower  willpower  is  the  skill  of 
 resisting  desires  now  we  desire  all
[06:18] kinds  of  things  we  desire  the  junk  food 
 porn  video  games  these  are  things  that 
 you  already  knew  but  in  the  later  part
[06:23] of  this  full  guide  I'm  also  going  to 
 speak  about  higher  level  desires  I'm 
 going  to  speak  about  the  things  that
[06:28] this  materialistic  modern  world  put  on 
 to  us  which  seemed  productive  but  in 
 fact  are  as  destructive  if  not  even  more
[06:35] destructive  than  these  lower  level  ones 
 at  this  level  we're  thinking  about  porn 
 and  video  games  but  at  the  higher  level
[06:40] it's  more  like  working  too  hard  being 
 too  ambitious  making  too  much  money 
 building  too  much  muscle  for  many
[06:45] shallow  breathers  they're  like  small 
 brain  won't  be  able  to  comprehend  how 
 that  is  a  problem  I'm  assuming  you're 
 someone  who's  a  bit  more  intelligent  and
[06:51] I  can  open  up  your  mind  to  consider  that 
 the  path  that  has  been  laid  out  in  front 
 of  you  of  this  overachiever  great  great
[06:57] body  might  not  actually  be  the  one  that 
 leads  you  to  the  Fulfillment  that  you 
 desire  along  with  that  in  this  full
[07:03] guide  I'm  also  going  to  walk  you  through 
 the  greatest  realization  I've  had  in  my
[07:08] life  so  far  I  don't  exaggerate  when  I 
 say  that  I  think  that  we  might  be  able
[07:13] to  save  Decades  of  our  life  with 
 something  I'm  going  to  be  teaching  you 
 at  the  later  ends  of  this  full  guide  so
[07:19] we're  understanding  that  willpower  is 
 super  important  for  now  I  want  you  to 
 think  about  your  long-term  goals  chances
[07:25] are  you  want  to  be  successful  wealthy 
 happy  loving
[07:30] to  achieve  those  long-term  goals 
 really  the  most  important  skill  out
[07:35] there  is  willpower 
 because  on  the  way  to  the  dream  life
[07:40] there's  going  to  be  countless 
 distractions  hundreds  of  thousands  maybe
[07:46] millions  of  little  desires  that  pop  up 
 that  take  you  away  from  the  goal  the 
 task  the  the  trajectory  of  your  dream
[07:52] life  you  wanted  to  build  a  physique  and 
 there's  a  million  desires  for  sugar  and
[07:57] for  junk  food  and  for  skipping  days  off 
 the  gym  you  want  to  have  a  loving 
 relationship  with  a  beautiful  feminine
[08:02] woman  but  there's  a  million  desires  to 
 cheat  on  her  so  there's  something 
 interesting  that  you  can  do
[08:08] think  about 
 a  fairly  smart  guy  you  know  maybe  a
[08:13] little  bit  nerdy  there's  like  one  guy 
 you  might  remember  from  school 
 and  he  was  quite  intelligent  he
[08:19] performed  pretty  well  and  he's  probably 
 going  to  end  up  getting  like  a  pretty 
 good  job  and  he's  gonna  have  a  pretty 
 good  life
[08:25] and  then 
 one  late  night 
 he  has  a  random  hook  up  with  some  girl
[08:31] he's  just  met  it's  not  really  like  him 
 if  we're  being  honest  he  doesn't  get 
 laid  that  often  but  this  one  time  a  girl
[08:37] that  he  messaged  on  a  dating  app 
 actually  agreed  to  meet  him  at  night 
 time  and  they  ended  up  having  sex
[08:42] and  he  didn't  use  protection 
 and  he  got  her  pregnant
[08:49] this  guy  who  actually  had  a  wonderful 
 life  ahead  of  him  was  going  to  be  making 
 above  average  income  going  to  be  living
[08:55] in  this  great  house  and  you  know  achieve 
 the  sort  of  middle  class  dream  that  he 
 wanted
[09:00] suddenly  he  has  to  pay  1  250  a  month 
 every  single  month
[09:06] for  child  support  for  a  child  that  he's 
 not  even  raising  if  you  think  about  that 
 very  realistically
[09:13] his  life  has  changed  forever  because  of 
 this  one  moment
[09:18] willpower  would  have  saved  him 
 and  this  isn't  for  this  random  high
[09:23] school  student  that  you  know  this  is  for 
 every  man  especially 
 the  top  tier  men  the  athletes  the
[09:30] businessmen  the  guys  who  are  working 
 super  hard  because  it's  these  guys  who 
 get  trapped  by  their  desires  and
[09:36] impulses  it's  the  athlete  who's  been 
 grinding  super  hot  who's  disciplined  who
[09:41] ends  up  getting  some  random  girl 
 pregnancy  it's  the  businessman  who 
 marries  the  wrong  woman  gets  divorced 
 and  loses  half  of  his  stuff  it's  the  guy
[09:47] who's  disciplined  who's  going  to  the  gym 
 every  single  day  progressively 
 overloading  tracking  his  macros  building
[09:52] the  most  perfect  for  ziku 
 gets  into  an  argument  with  a  random  guy
[09:57] in  the  gym 
 and  punches  him 
 and  now  he's  in  jail  for  the  next  six  to
[10:04] 12  months  and  his  life  has  changed 
 forever
[10:09] it  is  willpower  that  will  genuinely  save 
 you  months  or  years  or  Decades  of  your
[10:14] life  so  this  is  a  skill  to  take 
 seriously  think  about  how  much  potential 
 has  been  robbed  off  the  world  because  we
[10:20] were  unable  to  control  our  desires  and 
 now  I  want  you  to  actually  feel  quite 
 great  about  yourself  because  you  are
[10:25] part  of  this  enlightened  group  that's 
 studying  a  concept  like  this  no  matter 
 how  smart  that  kid  was  that  we're
[10:31] thinking  about  in  high  school  he  wasn't 
 smart  enough  to  be  sat  here  literally 
 with  humility  thinking  I'm  gonna  learn
[10:36] about  the  skill  of  willpower  because  I 
 know  for  a  fact  that  there's  going  to  be 
 desires  that  arise  and  I  want  to  have
[10:41] this  skill  of  resisting  them  this  is 
 some  high  level  some  extremely  powerful 
 stuff  you're  doing  here  you're  learning
[10:46] such  a  powerful  skill  you're  spending 
 your  time  sat  here  focused  hopefully 
 you've  got  the  video  in  full  screen
[10:52] because  I'll  help  you  focus  even  more 
 compared  to  the  friends  that  you  know 
 the  little  Jeffrey  shallow  breathers  who
[10:57] are  literally  what  are  they  doing  right 
 now  if  you  could  almost  see  in  a  in  a 
 third  like  sort  of  person  perspective
[11:02] like  a  bird's  eye  view  of  the  houses 
 around  your  area  what  are  the  people 
 that  you  know  doing  right  now
[11:07] one  guy's  laying  in  bed  the  other  one 
 scrolling  on  his  phone  and  hey  you  are 
 actually  watching  a  guide  on  Willpower
[11:12] so  Props  to  you  step  two  lust 
 it's  summer  of  2022  and  I'm  in  Mexico  at
[11:20] the  edge  of  a  lake  which  is  right  next 
 to  the  hostel  that  I'm  staying  in 
 and  there's  a  sign  here  it's  a  red
[11:27] warning  sign 
 it's  a  sign  that  shows  that  there's 
 crocodiles  inside  of  this  Lake
[11:34] but  I'm  laying  down  on  the  grass 
 and  I'm  naked  I'm  with  a  girl  who  I  just
[11:40] met  an  hour  ago  outside  of  a  nightclub 
 and  we  can  hear  the  partying  the
[11:45] laughing  and  drinking  going  on  inside  of 
 the  hostel  and  this  is  when  something 
 appears
[11:51] it's  not  a  prehistoric  reptile 
 it's  not  police  it's  some  security
[11:56] guards  and  they've  caught  me  with  my 
 dick  out  having  sex  in  public  I'm
[12:01] Shuffling  my  clothes  on  getting  stuck  in 
 my  shirt  and  she's  like  holding  onto  my 
 arm  and  the  security  guards  and  her
[12:07] start  speaking  in  Spanish  because  she's 
 from  here  so  she  understands  and  I'm 
 literally  just  left  out  here  I  am  with
[12:12] an  erection  with  three  people  speaking  a 
 language  I  don't  understand  not  knowing 
 what's  gonna  happen  to  me  ask  her  what's
[12:18] going  on  what  are  they  saying  what's 
 gonna  happen  and  she  says 
 they're  not  gonna 
 call  the  police
[12:25] they're  not  going  to  file  a  complaints 
 but  they  want  you  to  go  to  the  reception
[12:32] where  the  ATM  is  I  know  what's  going  to 
 happen  I've  heard  of  this  before  I'm  in 
 Mexico  these  [ __ ]  are  going  to
[12:37] try  and  ask  me  for  like  a  bribe  they're 
 probably  going  to  try  and  charge  me  like 
 a  thousand  dollars  or  something  crazy
[12:42] I  might  run 
 I  might  run  my  heart  starts  going  fast  I
[12:48] might  actually  just  [ __ ]  run  away 
 from  here  right  now
[12:53] fight  flights 
 and  freeze 
 I'm  the  worst  one
[13:00] I'm  a  freezer  now  I'm  at  the  reception 
 of  this  hostel  and  they're  telling  me  to 
 pay  they  want  me  to  pay
[13:07] 150  dollars 
 I'm  an  entrepreneur  so  I  calculate  the 
 return  on  investment  in  my  mind  and  I'm
[13:12] thinking  you  know  what  150  not  get  sent 
 to  a  Mexican  prison  like  this  is
[13:17] actually  quite  a  high  Roi  investment 
 honestly  this  would  make  Warren  Buffett 
 proud  I  might  actually  take  this  deal
[13:23] so  he  points  over  to  the  ATM  in  the 
 corner  I'm  like  yeah  sure  I  go  in  put  my 
 card  in  put  my  pin  in
[13:30] doesn't  work 
 put  my  card  back  in  put  my  pin  in  right
[13:35] doesn't  work 
 I'll  put  my  card  in  again  but  I'm 
 thinking  away  it's  not  worked  twice  if  I
[13:40] try  and  put  it  in  again  it's  you  know  my 
 card  might  actually  get  blocked  by  the 
 bank  or  something  so  I  come  back  now  the
[13:45] ATM's  not  working 
 but  yeah  I  remember  I've  bought  water 
 from  here  from  this  reception
[13:51] um  I  paid  with  like  the  card  machine 
 last  time  I'll  just  pay  with  that  again 
 and  that's  not  what  they  wanted  to  hear
[13:58] because  there  was  a  card  machine  like  a 
 normal  credit  card  machine  behind  the 
 reception  and  I  had  literally  paid  for
[14:03] something  before  like  for  a  water  bottle 
 but  straight  away  the  guy  behind  the
[14:08] desk  starts  saying  like  no  no  you  can't 
 because  um it  doesn't  work  till  6  a.m  it
[14:13] doesn't  matter  it  doesn't  work  today  it 
 doesn't  work  till  like  7  A.M  or  8  A.M  it 
 needs  to  be  cash
[14:18] that's  how  I  understand  what's  happening 
 they  don't  want  me  to  pay  on  the  card 
 machine  because  then  that  money  is  going
[14:23] to  get  sent  to  like  the  company  bank 
 account  they  want  cash  to  split  between 
 the  two  security  guards  and  this  random 
 guy  behind  the  reception  so  what  can  I
[14:29] do 
 I'll  ask  my  sweet  Beloved  the  girl  that 
 I've  just  been  with  I  turn  over  to  her
[14:36] explain  the  situation  and  say  like  you 
 know  um  can  you  just  pay  for  it  with  you 
 know  cash  and  then  I'll  bank  transfer
[14:42] you 
 and  she  does  not  react  how  I  thought  she 
 would
[14:49] because  just  20  minutes  ago  we  were 
 having  sex  and  you  know  the  most 
 intimate  thing  that  you  can  do  together
[14:57] and  she  just  bursts  out 
 aggressively  almost  like  getting  into  my
[15:02] face  no  no  English  no  English  I  know 
 instantly  what's  going  on  it's  like 
 she's  almost  pretending  to  you  know  she
[15:07] it  was  quite  a  embarrassing  situation  so 
 she's  pretending  to  take  a  step  back 
 from  it  not  understanding  what's  going
[15:12] on  either  she  doesn't  want  to  associate 
 with  me  or  something  she  ends  up 
 storming  off  the  security  guards  let  her
[15:17] off  but  they're  actually  like  keeping  me 
 here 
 and  I  actually  don't  know  what  to  do  my
[15:23] heart  is  beating  very  fast  I'm  feeling 
 super  stressed  not  knowing  what  these 
 three  guys  are  going  to  do  to  me  and  so
[15:28] I  have  an  idea  that's  fairly  pathetic 
 I  say  to  them  oh  well  let's  go  into  the
[15:33] hostel  like  where  the  people  are 
 partying  because  there  was  a  few  people 
 there  like  I  partied  with  yesterday  and 
 then  I'll  you  know  I'll  ask  them  to  lend
[15:39] me  the  money 
 so  here  we  are  amongst  all  these  people 
 who  are  drinking  laughing  smoking  and
[15:44] and  I'm  going  one  by  one  asking  them  to 
 lend  me  150  dollars 
 no  one  has  got  the  money  for  it
[15:50] everyone's  like  yeah  yeah  you  know  I 
 don't  I  don't  have  enough  bro  yeah
[15:55] but  soon  there's  almost  like  a  small 
 circle  forming  around  me  the  security 
 guards  because  I've  told  people  the
[16:00] situation  and  you  know  they're  thinking 
 like  oh  you  know  don't  leave  him  alone 
 that's  fine  like  oh  what  are  you  gonna 
 do  you're  finding  him  like  you  know
[16:05] people  are  starting  to  defend  me  and  so 
 I  ask  a  few  of  them  to  come  back  with  me 
 and  we  go  to  the  reception  and  it  turns
[16:10] into  this  big  scene  I  can  see  the 
 security  guards  are  getting  kind  of 
 annoyed  and  so  they  let  me  go  back  into 
 my  room  once  they  like  fix  the  ATM  so
[16:17] I'm  here  in  the  little  hostel  little 
 single  bed  amongst  other  people  who  are 
 like  sleeping  and  everything  and  I'm
[16:22] lying  down  and  I  want  to  sleep  but  I'm 
 actually  terrified  thinking  at  any 
 moment  I'm  gonna  feel  like  a  tap  on  my
[16:27] shoulder  what  if  they're  gonna  wake  me 
 up  an  hour  from  now  say  no  no  yeah  we 
 want  300  because  we've  had  to  fix  the
[16:32] ATM  because  of  you  I'm  at  genuinely  like 
 a  10  out  of  10  state  of  stress  I'm
[16:37] thinking  should  I  just  run  away  they've 
 got  my  details  there  I  don't  even  know 
 what  to  do
[16:42] Indiana  decides  to  just  run  away  I  pack 
 all  my  stuff  in  a  bag 
 I  end  up  just  kind  of  like  watching  out
[16:48] for  the  CCTV  and  just  like  fast  walk  I 
 didn't  even  have  the  courage  to  run  for 
 some  reason  so  I  just  like  fast  walk  out
[16:54] of  the  hostel  never  checked  out  never 
 gave  them  the  little  key  card  just  kind 
 of  fast  walked  as  soon  as  they  noticed
[16:59] me  that's  when  I  started  to  like  jog 
 away  they  didn't  even  chase  me  but  as 
 I'm  jogging
[17:04] I  realize  that  this  whole  thing  started 
 because  of  my  inability  to  control  lust
[17:09] I  had  literally  just  met  a  girl  for 
 minutes
[17:14] and  then  had  sex  with  her  like  less  than 
 an  hour  later
[17:19] and  then  she  almost  she  betrayed  me  she 
 backstabbed  me  and  I  don't  blame  her  for 
 it  because  you  know  she  barely  knew  me
[17:25] but  she  barely  knew  me  she  was  the  kind 
 of  person  who  would  betray  me  and 
 backstab  me
[17:30] and  here  I  was  like  sharing  my  soul  with 
 her
[17:36] it  honestly  made  me  realize 
 casual  sex
[17:41] is  worse  far  worse  than  porn 
 with  porn  it's  just  you  there  by
[17:47] yourself  you're  not  hurting  anyone  but 
 it's  still  obviously  a  really  bad  habit 
 to  get  into
[17:52] but  it's  just  you 
 with  casual  sex  there's  a  whole  other 
 person  involved  in  this  situation  it
[17:57] wasn't  just  one  other  person  involved  it 
 was  two  security  guards  the  guy  behind 
 the  desk  all  the  other  hostel  like  you
[18:02] know  the  people  who  were  partying  and 
 then  also  the  girl  there  was  all  these 
 people  and  yet  I'm  still  alone  it  was
[18:09] honestly  one  of  the  most  like  stressful 
 days  and  somewhat  lonely  days  of  my  life
[18:14] I  want  you  to  think  of  just  how  bad  the 
 problem  of  controlling  our  lust  really 
 is  because  there's  entrepreneurs  out
[18:20] there  whose  entire  job  whose  entire 
 companies 
 are  just  revolving  around  monetizing
[18:27] your  lust  you  feel  this  somewhat  natural 
 desire 
 and  they  make  money  from  it  and  since
[18:34] they  make  money  from  your  lust  well  they 
 want  to  make  sure  that  you're  feeling 
 lustful  all  the  time  way  more  than  you
[18:39] actually  should 
 so  then  we  have  all  these  these  porn 
 companies  only  fans  that  even  the  guys
[18:46] who  are  like  sort  of  running  the  only 
 fans  agencies  and  all  this  pathetic  like 
 degenerate  stuff  that's  going  on
[18:52] and  you  the  consumer  are  the  one  who's 
 experiencing  the  the  pain  of  this
[18:58] because  it  is  everywhere  these 
 Temptations  how  crazy  is  this  it's  more
[19:03] common  for  me  to  speak  to  a  young  man 
 who's  had  a  porn  addiction  for  the  last 
 five  plus  years
[19:08] than  not  more  than  half  of  young  men 
 have  genuine  addictions  to  porn  and  have
[19:14] had  that  since  they  were  12  or  13  years 
 old  and  you  can  probably  relate  to  that
[19:19] I  speak  to  guys  who  tell  me  their  first 
 experience  of  porn  was  age  nine  before 
 puberty  and  not  only  that  I  honestly
[19:25] think  we're  gonna  see  it  such  a  huge 
 uprising  of  women's  problems  with  porn
[19:30] too  because  you  probably  can  imagine  for 
 the  last  few  years  women  have  had  like  a
[19:35] very  sort  of  free  sexual  experience  know 
 your  body  play  with  yourself  and  it 
 seems  like  wholesome  advice  Up  Until  you
[19:41] realize  that  when  a  woman  gets  addicted 
 to  porn  it  has  very  similar  consequences 
 it  truly  does  degrade  her  ability  to  be
[19:48] able  to  like  pair  bond  with  a  man  just 
 like  as  it  does  the  man  to  the  woman 
 because  here  you  are  practicing  these
[19:54] very  poor  like  sexual  habits  you're 
 restraining  your  breath  you're  focusing 
 very  much  on  like  mental  fantasy  you're
[20:01] looking  at  people  who  don't  even  know 
 that  you're  there  you're  conditioning 
 yourself  to  be  the  Observer  of  sex 
 rather  than  the  partaker  you're
[20:08] conditioning  yourself  to  literally  get 
 turned  on  with  your  own  sort  of  mental 
 fantasies  or  like  literally  being  a  [ __ ]
[20:13] and  the  exact  same  thing  is  true  for 
 women  so  here  we  are  degrading  our 
 future  ability  to  make  love  and  it's
[20:19] actually  like  Bond  incredibly  with  our 
 partners
[20:24] for  the  sake  of  some  pleasure  today 
 because  we  couldn't  resist  the  desire  of 
 lust  but  I  think  we  can  adopt  more  of  a
[20:29] positive  note  around  this  you  know 
 because  on  this  space  online  of  men's 
 self-improvement  you  know  the  problem 
 with  porn  is  very  clear  you  knew  this
[20:35] but  I  want  you  to  think  right  now 
 there's  a  lot  of  guys  who  know  about 
 nofap
[20:40] the  concept  of  nofap  of  not  watching 
 porn  it's  actually  quite  like  famous
[20:45] it's  quite  like  public  knowledge  these 
 days  right  like  you  actually  know  fully 
 about  nofap  and  not  watching  porn  and  so
[20:51] do  some  of  the  people  that  you  know  and 
 you  see  all  these  Community  these
[20:56] massive  influencers  talking  about  it  we 
 are  seeing  a  massive  uprise  for  people 
 who  are  like  openly  talking  about  the
[21:02] fact  that  porn  is  really  bad  and  it's 
 almost  become  like  a  counter  Community 
 mindset  to  the  people  who  just  like  you
[21:08] know  just  say  oh  well  you  know  it's  just 
 a  bit  of  fun  it  makes  me  feel  proud  for 
 young  men  like  us  who  are  being  served
[21:13] like  the  most  addictive  substance  and  we 
 literally  have  like  communities  and 
 mindsets  and  movements  training  each
[21:20] other  saying  like  no  no  we're  better 
 than  that 
 the  most  addictive  thing  they  can  put  in 
 front  of  you  and  here  we  are  literally
[21:26] like  routinely  knowing  that  it's  not 
 good  for  us 
 taking  the  harder  path
[21:32] you're  one  of  these  men  I  really  do 
 think  you  should  feel  proud  of  yourself 
 even  if  for  example  you  think  that 
 you've  been  struggling  you've  been
[21:37] relapsing  just  the  fact  that  you're 
 making  progress  the  fact  that  you're 
 trying  the  fact  that  you're  sort  of
[21:42] vigilant  of  this  problem  means  that 
 you've  actually  put  some  work  into  this
[21:47] and  not  only  porn  but  casual  sex  can  be 
 such  a  big  problem  as  well  and  I  think 
 that  this  is  more  of  a  hidden  problem  a
[21:53] lot  of  people  know  about  the  problems 
 with  porn  but  with  casual  Sexes  like 
 this  I'd  speak  to  a  lot  of  guys  who  are
[21:58] actually  kind  of  hoping  for  it  I  speak 
 to  a  lot  of  guys  who've  got  Tinder 
 accounts  and  they  just  want  to  try  and
[22:03] get  laid  because  they've  been  told  that 
 this  is  what  they  should  spend  their 
 time  on  and  I  don't  blame  you  if  you're
[22:08] like  this  because  I  spend  a  lot  of  my 
 life  chasing  like  you  know  this  the  sort 
 of  validation  and  convincing  yourself
[22:14] that  yeah  yeah  you  know  this  is  the 
 thing  I  should  be  spending  my  time  on 
 rather  than  just  developing  yourself  and 
 living  a  happy  life  in  your  happiness
[22:20] not  being  tied  to  some  random  drunk  girl 
 this  is  a  hard  one  to  grasp  for  a  lot  of 
 young  guys  including  when  I  was  younger
[22:26] because  when  you're  told  that  casual  sex 
 is  bad  you  might  be  asking  yourself  well 
 then  how  do  you  like  have  fun  but  it
[22:32] can't  because  it's  really  natural  this 
 isn't  to  say  that  sex  and  making  love  is
[22:38] a  bad  thing  I  think  that  can  be  very 
 very  pleasant  like  a  very  positive 
 experience  of  life  it's  the  say  like
[22:43] let's  just  be  honest  and  obvious  here 
 it's  to  say  that  having  sex  with  a 
 random  girl  that  you've  just  met  who's
[22:49] unintelligent  and  stupid  and  you've  just 
 met  her  in  a  nightclub  and  she  takes 
 drugs  and  she's  nothing  like  you
[22:55] it  means  that  that's  not  a  good  thing  it 
 means  that  matching  with  as  many  girls 
 as  possible  on  Tinder  and  trying  your
[23:01] best  to  just  sleep  with  as  many  as 
 possible  is  it's  not  like  it's  not 
 showing  that  you  respect  yourself  or
[23:07] your  time  you  could  be  building 
 something  great  like  focus  on 
 self-mastery  focus  on  trying  to  like 
 peel  back  the  layers  of  your  purpose  so
[23:13] you  can  discover  yourself  and  to  have 
 some  kind  of  like  spiritual  experience 
 to  feel  your  potential  to  build  like  a
[23:19] beautiful  business  where  you've  hired 
 loads  of  great  people  and  you  work 
 alongside  them  there's  so  many  things
[23:24] you  can  spend  your  time  on  and  also 
 developing  yourself  so  that  you  can 
 attract  a  really  nice  like  great  woman
[23:30] and  then  have  better  sex  with  her  anyway 
 so  the  problem  with  lust  is  that  usually
[23:35] it  will  drive  you  to  these  low  quality 
 places  where  you  don't  want  to  be  which 
 you're  better  than  when  I  think  about
[23:41] even  21  22  year  old  me  in  the  middle  of 
 a  club  or  party  I  just  see  it  so  odd
[23:46] because  I  was  like  you  don't  fit  in 
 there  everyone  there  is  taking  drugs 
 everyone  there  is  unintelligent  here's
[23:52] you  who's  reading  self-improvement  books 
 who's  watching  videos  like  this  here's 
 you  who's  going  to  the  gym  and  tracking
[23:57] your  Macros  and  you're  around  [ __ ] 
 like  stupid  people  just  for  the  sake  of 
 like  oh  but  you  know  I  might  get  laid
[24:02] tonight 
 how  about  you  just  conserve  that  lust 
 just  for  a  little  bit  develop  yourself
[24:08] and  think  to  yourself  when  I  meet  like  a 
 really  good  woman  and  we  really  match
[24:13] I'll  have  10  times  more  sex  with  her  you 
 can  still  enjoy  sex  in  your  life  but 
 just  make  it  with  the  right  person
[24:18] there's  something  from  that  marshmallow 
 experiment  that  we  spoke  about  at  the 
 start  of  this  video  which  I  found  very
[24:23] interesting  so  imagine  here  you  are 
 you're  the  little  little  four-year-old 
 boy  the  experimenter  SAT  you  down  and
[24:28] said  okay  okay  little  Timmy  you  know  you 
 can  have  this  marshmallow  right  now  you 
 can  have  two  later  what  they  found  was
[24:34] that  if  you  simply  just  moved  the  sort 
 of  bad  thing  away  from  your  visual
[24:40] sights  you  were  10  times  more  likely  to
[24:45] resist  the  desire  if  it  was  in  front  of 
 you  visually  it  was  very  hard  to  resist
[24:50] it  how  they  did  this  was  just  with  the 
 marshmallows  they  literally  just  put  a 
 plate  over  it  as  soon  as  they  did  that
[24:56] the  kids  were  10  times  more  likely  to 
 like  pass  this  test  now  I  want  you  to 
 just  visualize  all  of  like  the  the
[25:02] advertisements  billboard  social  media 
 the  porn  companies  everywhere  you  look
[25:07] there's  more  porn  there's  more 
 degeneracy  this  this  talks  of  like 
 casual  sex  and  pleasure 
 what  we  need  to  do  is  the  equivalence  of
[25:13] putting  that  plate  over  the  marshmallows 
 but  for  things  of  our  lust  because  right 
 now  here  right  now  if  you  do  have  a
[25:19] social  media  account  I'm  guessing  that 
 there  is  at  least  one  or  two  profiles 
 probably  from  women  that  are  like
[25:25] causing  urges  inside  of  you  you  go  onto 
 Instagram  just  coping  saying  that's  just 
 a  five  minute  break  you're  there  for  15
[25:30] minutes  and  you  end  up  just  clicking  on 
 the  girl  who's  kind  of  hot  that  you  know 
 and  before  you  know  it  you  probably  end
[25:36] up  relapsing  again 
 or  maybe  it's  on  YouTube  maybe  you  go 
 onto  YouTube  you  go  onto  one  of  these
[25:41] like  degenerate  podcasts  where  one  of 
 the  girls  there  has  got  cleavage  or 
 something  and  here  you  are  just  like 
 starting  to  fantasize  and  boom  you
[25:47] relapsed  again  what  we  need  to  do  is 
 cleanse  our  space  so  that  we  don't  see 
 these  degenerate  like  these  provocative
[25:53] things 
 I  hope  you're  getting  some  ideas  because 
 there's  some  things  that  you  could 
 Implement  right  here  right  now  and  we'll
[25:58] do  that  for  the  actionable  step  coming 
 up  soon  maybe  you  should  unfollow  like 
 the  girl  that  you  follow  who's  causing
[26:04] these  urges  to  arise  whether  there's  any 
 kind  of  social  consequences  or  not  like 
 oh  but  you  know  she's  a  girl  from  my
[26:10] school  and  she  follows  me  back  so  it 
 looks  kind  of  cool  that  I've  got  a  hot 
 girl  who  follows  me  if  you're  constantly
[26:15] just  being  led  by  your  lust  and 
 relapsing  because  of  this  it's  worth  it
[26:20] for  you  to  just  unfollow  her  maybe  it's 
 the  degenerate  music  that's  on  your 
 Spotify  and  you  listen  to  all  these
[26:25] rappers  you  know  I've  realized  so  much 
 recently  how  bad  music  is  and  how  easy 
 it  is  for  you  to  get  like  a  quick  little
[26:30] boost  to  your  self-improvement  your 
 self-esteem  your  self-image  by  not 
 listening  to  degenerate  music  whether
[26:36] you're  plugging  it  in  of  this  like 
 rapper  or  singer  who's  talking  about  how 
 great  he  is  and  how  many  [ __ ]  he
[26:42] [ __ ]  and  how  much  money  he  makes  and 
 has  you  like  little  chump  like  listening 
 to  his  brainwashing  of  like  him  talking
[26:48] about  how  great  he  is  and  you're  tuning 
 into  that  I  just  kind  of  like  I  don't 
 know  I  saw  that  in  a  different
[26:53] perspective  and  thought  man  [ __ ]  me 
 that  side  I'm  never  listening  to  that 
 kind  of  music  ever  again  for  the  last
[26:58] like  three  months  or  so  I've  not 
 listened  to  like  songs  like  that  because 
 it  just  disgusts  me  when  I  think  of  the
[27:03] idea  of  like  here  is  a  degenerate  who's 
 talking  about  having  sex 
 and  that  the  girls  he's  sleeping  with
[27:09] like  it  and  here  I  am  like  listening  to 
 it  it's  literally  it's  kind  of  like  [ __ ]
[27:15] porn  like  most  rap  songs  are  like 
 cockapon  these  days  and  you  are  like 
 this  weird  disgusting  [ __ ]  weirdo  if  you
[27:22] listen  to  that  consistently  and  all 
 these  like  normal  people  are  gonna 
 listen  oh  well  wraps  actually  it's
[27:27] actually  art  bro  and  like  oh  but  you're 
 just  being  like  you  know  you  can  listen 
 to  some  rap  guys  don't  listen  to  him
[27:32] like  yeah  sure  do  what  you  want  but 
 don't  be  surprised  when  you  start 
 getting  these  weird  cuck  fantasies  that
[27:37] are  arising  that  you  feel  like  quite 
 soft  and  timid  when  it  comes  to  you 
 having  sex  with  a  woman  because  you're 
 more  used  to  listening  to  guys  who  are
[27:43] talking  about  pounding  them  and  how  you 
 are  listen  like  tuning  into  that  and 
 you're  more  used  to  watching  porn  with
[27:49] the  guys  [ __ ]  the  girl  and  hey  you 
 are  as  a  passive  Observer  and  so  when 
 it's  time  for  you  to  have  sex  you  almost
[27:54] feel  like  a  passive  Observer  even  though 
 this  girl's  on  you  you  want  her  to  kind 
 of  put  it  onto  you  you  want  her  to
[27:59] engage  it  you  want  her  to  start  on  you 
 you  want  her  to  dominate  you 
 that's  how  they've  conditioned  you  to  be
[28:06] this  isn't  your  natural  impulse  you 
 weren't  born  as  a  [ __ ]  you  weren't  born 
 as  like  you  know  like  as  a  boy  who  was
[28:12] supposed  to  turn  into  a  man  who  was  a 
 coward  this  is  conditioning
[28:17] it'd  be  interesting  to  see  what  kind  of 
 man  you  would  be  without  these  external 
 influences  without  this  lust  being  put
[28:22] onto  you  without  this  messaging  from 
 this  rapper  or  this  TV  show
[28:28] most  men  never  find  out  who  they 
 actually  are 
 when  you  unplug  and  you  really  unplug
[28:36] that's  when  you  start  to  discover 
 yourself  and  there  was  another  Finding 
 from  the  marshmallow  experiment  that's 
 going  to  help  you  overcome  lust  so
[28:41] imagine  okay  they've  put  you  there  again 
 with  the  marshmallow  the  two 
 marshmallows  okay  you've  got  to  wait  for 
 them  okay  then  they  tell  you  why  don't
[28:48] you  think  of  something  that  makes  you 
 happy  remember  the  time  that  you  when 
 your  mummy  pursue  high  on  the  swing  they
[28:54] would  say  that  to  some  kids  some 
 obviously  that  you  know  they  get  like 
 super  happy  thinking  of  like  this  happy
[28:59] moment  they  again  were  super  super 
 significantly  more  likely  to  resist  the
[29:05] temptation  of  just  eating  the  one 
 marshmallow  now  rather  than  delaying 
 gratification  for  the  other  one  was  very
[29:11] interesting  they  also  tried  the  exact 
 opposite  they  told  some  kids  why  don't
[29:16] you  just  think  about  how  good  the 
 marshmallow  is  gonna  taste 
 those  kids  ate  it  almost  immediately
[29:24] so  what  does  this  teach  us 
 we  should  one  be  trying  to  think  of  like 
 positive  thoughts  and  positive  memories
[29:31] but  two  we  should  not  be  fantasizing  and 
 keeping  in  mind  the  bad  desire  that  we
[29:37] don't  want  to  act  on  and  this  is  the 
 exact  opposite  that  a  lot  of  us  often  do 
 when  you  get  an  urge  for  porn  be  honest
[29:43] you're  probably  kind  of  circulate  the 
 urge  in  your  mind  a  bit  you  kind  of 
 almost  fantasize  in  it  mentally  first
[29:48] don't  you  you're  almost  like  play  around 
 with  it  it's  kind  of  annoying  and 
 agitating  to  experience  like  an  urge  to
[29:54] relapse  but  you  almost  like  purposely 
 keep  it  in  your  mind  at  times  the  fat
[29:59] person  who's  like  you  know  thinking 
 should  I  eat  the  cake  or  not  should  I 
 eat  the  cake  or  not  they're  literally 
 just  like  thinking  about  the  cake  for
[30:04] the  next  10  20  minutes  and  of  course 
 they're  going  to  end  up  eating  it  when 
 you  get  thoughts  and  urges  and  Desires
[30:09] in  your  mind  of  okay  ah  maybe  I'll  go 
 watch  porn  and  I  don't  want  to  maybe  I 
 should  maybe  I  should  by  keeping  it  in
[30:15] your  mind  you're  absolutely  going  to 
 relapse  by  like  visualizing  the  kind  of
[30:21] Pawn  that  you  want  to  watch  visualizing 
 you  know  fantasizing  about  the  girl  that 
 you  want  to  sleep  with  you  absolutely
[30:26] will  fail  at  this  goal  of  yours  to  like 
 become  a  better  man  and  to  be  stronger
[30:31] and  to  use  willpower  so  instead  we're 
 going  to  use  a  principle  which  is  called 
 if  then  a  lot  of  programmers  like  nerds
[30:37] know  about  this  if  then  it's  kind  of 
 like  a  mental  model  almost  like  we're 
 forming  a  mental  habit  and  the  way  it
[30:43] works  is  we  clarify  with  humility  that 
 we're  certainly  going  to  experience  a
[30:49] desire  for  porn  or  sex  again  right  we 
 know  this  right  no  matter  even  if  you 
 get  onto  nofap  no  matter  how  long  you've
[30:55] been  on  we  know  for  a  fact  that  we're 
 gonna  have  desires  for  porn  or  sex  at 
 some  point  in  our  lives  probably  like  50
[31:01] million  of  them  right  so  if  we  are 
 honest  with  that  okay  we're  gonna  have 
 those  desires  we  need  to  start  to  plan
[31:07] this  almost  mental  model  where  we're 
 going  to  say  okay  when  I  get  that  mental 
 model  then  what  I'm  going  to  do  is
[31:13] and  set  a  real  consistent  like  super 
 specific  plan  for  that  so  you  can  do
[31:18] this  right  now  think  to  yourself  right 
 here  right  now  I'm  gonna  get  a  lot  more 
 desires  for  porn  and  for  all  bad  desires
[31:25] as  soon  as  I  notice  that  I'm  getting 
 this  desire  this  craving
[31:30] I'm  going  to  do  X 
 now  a  lot  of  people  I've  noticed  will
[31:35] say  like  oh  yeah  do  some  push-ups  do 
 some  exercise  you  possibly  could  do  that 
 I'm  not  sure  if  that  would  be  effective
[31:40] the  people  I've  spoke  to  the  young  guys 
 who  say  like  oh  yeah  you  know  just  do 
 some  push-ups  they  always  end  up
[31:45] relapsing  because  I'm  not  sure  if  trying 
 to  counter  like  a  sort  of  a  mental 
 craving  with  something  real  world  which
[31:51] you  know  it's  almost  a  bit  unimpractical 
 which  sounds  silly  but  it's  like  it's 
 almost  a  bit  impractical  it's  like  get 
 down  and  do  push-ups  a  lot  of  the  time  I
[31:57] think  it's  better  to  almost  make  your 
 like  action  your  response  action  more  of
[32:02] like  a  way  of  thinking  so  mind  for 
 example  is  when  I  have  a  desire  that  I 
 don't  want  to  fulfill  I  will  instead
[32:08] immediately  go  and  think  about  some  kind 
 of  happy  Pleasant  funny  memory  because 
 when  we  have  these  positive  emotions
[32:14] inside  of  us  we're  far  more  likely  to 
 delay  gratification  just  because  we 
 don't  really  need  much  external  things
[32:20] anymore  you  know  when  you  feel  happy  you 
 don't  need  to  eat  as  much  sugar  because 
 you  already  kind  of  feel  happy  so  you
[32:25] can  just  take  my  one  when  you  feel  a 
 desire  for  something  that  you  don't  want 
 to  feel  immediately  go  and  think  about
[32:30] some  kind  of  like  funny  memory  that  just 
 makes  you  kind  of  smile  of  love  and 
 you'll  find  that  your  desire  for  that
[32:35] thing  will  usually  go  down  because  if 
 we're  being  honest 
 the  biggest  reason  why  you  watch  porn  is
[32:40] probably  just  because  you're  sad  bored 
 or  lonely  sometimes  yeah  there  is  the
[32:46] sort  of  the  lust  and  the  horniness  but 
 let's  say  real  emotions 
 I  feel  sadness  I  feel  bored  I  feel
[32:52] lonely 
 so  how  many  times  do  we  really  get  this 
 intense  need  to  fap  when  we're  in  like  a
[32:59] humorous  joyful  grateful  present  happy 
 mood 
 not  often  right  it's  usually  when  we're
[33:05] in  this  quite  silent  mood  and  you  know 
 it's  4  P.M  or  7  p.m  and  we're  just  in 
 our  bedrooms  by  ourselves  we're  not
[33:11] talking  to  anyone  we  haven't  seen 
 sunlight  for  the  last  few  hours  and 
 we're  sat  here  just  mindlessly  looking
[33:16] at  content  and  you're  just  wasting  time 
 pretending  to  study  that's  when  it  hits 
 us
[33:21] it's  not  like  you  ever  are  having  such  a 
 funny  conversation  with  someone  you 
 can't  stop  laughing  and  that's  when
[33:27] you're  thinking  like  yeah  now  would  be  a 
 good  time  to  ejaculate  in  the  sugar 
 section  of  this  full  guide  I  explain 
 fully  how  to  control  your  emotions  so
[33:33] that  these  emotions  of  sadness  boredom 
 or  loneliness  don't  make  you  relapse  on
[33:38] porn  so  you  might  want  to  go  watch  that 
 section  as  well  but  first  your 
 actionable  step  for  this  part  of  the 
 guide  is  to  take  action  right  here  right
[33:44] now 
 with  me 
 grab  your  phone  go  on  to  those  apps
[33:49] which  you  usually  find  have  caused  the 
 trigger  for  you  for  a  lot  of  guys  this
[33:54] will  be  social  media  maybe  you've 
 deleted  your  social  media  already  but 
 let's  say  it's  the  Instagram  and  if 
 you're  just  being  honest  on  Instagram
[33:59] there  is  a  girl  that  for  example  it 
 feels  like  a  lot  of  triggers  a  lot  of 
 cravings  and  desires  happen  because  of
[34:05] her  maybe  it's  some  like  model  or  some 
 celebrity  maybe  it's  some  girl  that  you 
 know  from  like  school  or  work  or
[34:10] something 
 go  in  and  follow  her  this  is  for  your 
 own  mental  health  your  own  good  there's
[34:15] no  reason  to  keep  something  which  is 
 literally  just  like  poisoning  your  mind 
 and  you  know  causing  your  mind  to  fall
[34:21] in  because  remember  for  the  the  kids  in 
 the  marshmallow  experiment  if  we  can 
 cover  the  desire  so  you  can't  see  it
[34:26] you'll  be  far  less  likely  to  relapse 
 maybe  it's  a  girl  on  Instagram  but  maybe 
 it's  also  content  creators  on  YouTube  I
[34:32] know  for  a  lot  of  young  men  they  watch  a 
 lot  of  like  to  seemingly  traditional  but
[34:37] actually  degenerate  male  influencers 
 role  models  and  so  these  people  online
[34:43] like  you  know  who  I'm  talking  about  but 
 like  they'll  they'll  be  causing  more 
 triggers  even  though  they're  pretending
[34:49] to  help  you  so  there's  the  nofap 
 YouTuber  who  shows  you  pictures  of  like 
 attractive  girls  knowing  that  it's  Gonna
[34:55] Make  You  relapse  just  because  he  doesn't 
 actually  give  a  [ __ ]  about  you  he  just 
 wants  you  to  like  you  know  watch  be  more
[35:00] likely  to  click  on  the  video  anytime  I 
 see  a  nofap  YouTuber  who  puts  something 
 like  triggering  as  a  picture  you  know
[35:05] the  thumbnail  or  whatever  he  puts  like  a 
 sexy  girl  or  something  I  always  just 
 think  to  myself  this  is  a  grade  a
[35:10] [ __ ]  the  same  thing  I  see  with  these 
 sort  of  men's  podcasts  where  they  know 
 that  the  major  problem  that  their
[35:15] audiences  of  experiencing  is  like  porn 
 and  masturbation  and  triggers  and  here
[35:21] they'll  bring  in  a  bunch  of  degenerate 
 women  and  telling  them  to  like  dress  up 
 nice  and  put  away  in  the  push-up  bras 
 just  to  kind  of  put  that  into  your  face
[35:27] and  then  there  they  are  shouting  at  them 
 and  tell  them  no  like  you  know  I  am  a 
 high  value  man  and  you  you  do  this  and 
 you  have  sex  and  like  and  then  straight
[35:33] after  the  show  they  just  message  them 
 and  say  like  oh  hey  do  you  wanna  [ __ ] 
 they  desperately  are  trying  to  [ __ ]  the
[35:38] same  girls  that  they're  saying  are 
 damaged  your  actionable  step  which  will 
 genuinely  change  your  life  forever
[35:43] unsubscribe  from  garbage  content  from 
 the  girl  who  doesn't  even  post  anything
[35:49] educational  but  she's  just  you  know  it's 
 like  the  girl  who's  pretending  to  be 
 like  a  fitness  influencer  and  she's
[35:54] posting  like  you  know  her  little  workout 
 routines  but  she's  wearing  quite  like 
 sexual  clothing  the  kind  of  leggings
[35:59] that  like  [ __ ]  go  up  her  [ __ ]  and 
 here  she  is  posting  it  from  the  back  her 
 head  you  know  today  I  hit  four  times
[36:04] eight  squats  he's  not  actually  selling 
 Fitness  she's  selling  sex 
 unfollow  unsubscribe  block  delete  this
[36:12] includes  seemingly  like  educational 
 YouTubers  who  aren't  actually  posting
[36:17] like  valuable  content  and  instead 
 they're  just  posting  triggering  content 
 it's  the  red  pill  podcast  it's  the  um
[36:24] Instagram  Pages  you  post  that  you  know 
 they've  got  pictures  of  girls  in  them 
 whatever  it  is  if  there's  things  that 
 trigger  you  just  get  rid  of  it  you  don't
[36:30] need  to  see  this  stuff  in  your 
 day-to-day  life  if  you  respect  yourself 
 you'll  go  and  do  that  right  now  step
[36:35] three  video  games 
 I'm  17  years  old 
 and  I'm  in  a  dark  quiet  room
[36:43] I'm  grunting  I'm  sweating 
 and  I'm  straining  repetitively  I'm  in
[36:49] our  home  gym  in  the  garage  working  out 
 my  brother's  recently  got  me  into
[36:54] weightlifting  it's  like  this  new  thing 
 that  I'm  doing  where  you  lift  these 
 weights  and  you're  trying  to  get  bigger 
 muscles  and  it  seems  like  super  super
[37:00] fun  and  so  I'm  here  and  last  week  I  hit 
 this  weight  so  I'm  gonna  look  around  for
[37:05] the  smallest  little  weight  here  we  go 
 and  I'll  add  that  in  and  instantly  it 
 clicks  into  my  mind  that  this  is  the  way
[37:12] I  progressed  on  RuneScape  on  the  video 
 game  that  I've  been  addicted  to  for  like 
 10  years  but  the  desire  to  make  progress
[37:17] has  always  been  inside  me  but  it's  just 
 been  brainwashed  manipulated  and  stolen
[37:22] by  games  so  that  I  grew  up  leveling  up 
 in  video  games  instead  of  the  real  world
[37:27] so  I  put  the  extra  weight  plate  onto  the 
 dumbbell  put  it  onto  the  other  one  and 
 I'm  doing  bicep  curls  I'm  literally  just
[37:32] thinking 
 where  I  could  have  been  in  life  if  I 
 started  this  mindset  earlier  of  leveling
[37:38] up  in  the  real  world  instead  of  in  the 
 virtual  world  now  there's  something 
 super  interesting  in  that  same  study  the
[37:44] marshmallow  experiment  they  found  that 
 if  they  complemented  or  criticized  the
[37:49] children  for  their  performance  on  their 
 work  or  school  it  changed  how  much  they
[37:55] were  able  to  resist  the  marshmallow  so 
 right  right  here  right  now  what  do  you 
 think  would  happen  if  we  complimented 
 you  like  four-year-old  you  on  his  little
[38:02] school  work  whilst  you  were  trying  to  do 
 the  marshmallow  experiments  you  know 
 you've  got  this  one  marshmallow  but  if 
 you  wait  15  minutes  you  can  have  these
[38:07] two  if  we  made  you  feel  good  and  we 
 complimented  you  you'd  be  much  more
[38:12] likely  to  delay  grassification  but  the 
 little  kids  who  were  criticized  and 
 given  negative  feedback  for  their
[38:17] schoolwork  they  were  far  more  likely  to 
 be  unable  to  resist  than  just  eat  the
[38:23] one  marshmallow  right  now  and  that 
 really  made  me  think  of  the  concept  and 
 you  can  probably  relate  to  this  of  like
[38:28] the  the  somewhat  lonely  and  shy  video 
 gamer  in  high  school  whose  teachers  keep
[38:33] giving  him  like  bad  grades  and  every  now 
 and  then  they  shout  at  him  and  he 
 doesn't  feel  like  good  in  school  he 
 keeps  getting  this  negative  feedback  and
[38:39] so  he  goes  home  and  plays  video  games  of 
 course  he  does  because  with  this  like
[38:44] quite  inhumane  education  system  some 
 kids  don't  perform  well  in  it  I  didn't  I
[38:50] always  got  like  quite  below  average 
 grades  like  D's  and  E's  and  there  was  a
[38:55] couple  of  F's  and  everything  and  my 
 family  are  quite  High  performing  in  this 
 you  know  I'm  Brown  so  my  brother
[39:00] performed  really  well  he  got  A's  and  a 
 Stars  my  sister  to  perform  really  well 
 she  got  AIDS  and  a  starts  and  here's  me
[39:05] like  the  the  dumb  kid  of  the  family 
 underperforming  every  single  day  every
[39:10] single  exam  underperforming  then  my 
 brother  and  my  sister  getting  compared 
 to  them
[39:15] getting  shouted  out  by  my  father  oh  you 
 you  didn't  study  for  this  one  you  didn't 
 revise  for  this  one  teacher's  telling  me
[39:20] you  know  being  angry  at  me  sometimes  I 
 wasn't  able  to  understand  the  test  or 
 the  homework
[39:25] so  imagine  that  in  my  life 
 where  am  I  gonna  go  other  than  the 
 virtual  world  because  in  the  real  world
[39:31] I'm  failing  I  keep  messing  up  people 
 don't  like  me  my  friends  keep  like
[39:36] essentially  bullying  me  girls  don't  like 
 me  teachers  are  shouting  at  me  my  dad's 
 shouting  at  me
[39:41] but  in  the  virtual  world  I'm  a  dragon 
 slayer 
 in  the  virtual  world  I'm  doing  quests
[39:47] and  killing  demons  and  and  Dracula  and 
 vampires  and  I'm  doing  cool  [ __ ]  you
[39:52] know  I'm  quite  a  high  level  in  there 
 because  I've  been  grinding  and  so  when  I 
 do  meet  other  people  in  these  video 
 games  they  actually  respect  me  and  give
[39:58] me  status  and  compliments  me  a  young  man 
 is  just  going  to  go  away  his  status  is 
 higher  he's  just  gonna  go  where  he's
[40:03] complimented  and  where  he  feels  like  a 
 sense  of  social  connection  and 
 Brotherhood  and  when  we  don't  feel  that
[40:08] in  school 
 then  you  are  going  to  go  to  video  games 
 you  are  going  to  form  that  sort  of  peer
[40:14] circle  of  Gamers  can  we  blame  these  like 
 teenagers  who  are  totally  addicted  to 
 video  games  you  know  I  think  we  have
[40:20] like  quite  a  negative  perception  of 
 games  don't  we  when  we  look  back  we  we 
 get  angry  at  how  much  we  played  them  and
[40:25] that  makes  me  quite  offensive  to  Gamers 
 the  way  that  I  talk  about  them  but  I 
 don't  even  mean  to  honestly  like  when  I
[40:31] get  angry  at  like  video  Gamers  it's  more 
 that  I'm  just  talking  about  my  younger 
 self  but  then  when  I  take  a  moment  to
[40:37] reflect  and  take  like  a  deep  breath  I 
 realize  it's  like  should  we  be  angry  at 
 our  younger  selves  who  who  wasted  so
[40:43] much  time  in  the  virtual  world  when  that 
 was  genuinely  where  he  was  accepted  most
[40:48] was  it  the  problem  of  our  younger  selves 
 or  was  it  a  problem  of  like  probably  the
[40:54] education  system  and  maybe  our  parents 
 and  it's  not  good  to  place 
 responsibility  onto  them  but  when  you're 
 a  child  and  you're  10  years  old  it's
[41:00] like  you  know  we're  not  going  to  put 
 that  much  responsibility  on  a  literal 
 child  right  now
[41:05] because  if  school  was  more  engaging  if  I 
 was 
 you  know  more  involved  in  like  sports  or
[41:11] you  know  I  was  asked  and  encouraged  to 
 be  more  into  Sport  and  I  was  trained 
 there
[41:16] then  I'm  sure  I  wouldn't  have  been  as 
 addicted  to  RuneScape  and  Minecraft  and 
 I  played  those  games  for  literally  like
[41:21] 15  years  straight  hours  every  day  over 
 10  000  hours  in  video  games
[41:29] you  know  it's  often  said  that  to  master 
 its  skill  it  takes  10  000  hours  and  all 
 video  Gamers  know  this  it's  like  you've
[41:34] probably  put  in  10  000  or  maybe  more 
 hours  into  video  games 
 you  could  have  mastered  a  skill  and
[41:40] become  like  like  at  a  World  level  for 
 this  one  sport  for  example
[41:46] and  instead  it's  just  spread  amongst  all 
 the  games  that  we  have  on  Steam  so  this
[41:51] effect  that  when  you're  given  negative 
 feedback  it  reduces  your  willpower  your 
 ability  to  delay  gratification  that  is
[41:58] very  bad  for  us  but  we  can  actually 
 reframe  that  because  if  we're  given 
 positive  feedback  if  we're  given
[42:04] compliments  and  we're  made  to  feel  happy 
 then  we  will  get  like  an  improvement  to
[42:09] our  ability  to  be  able  to  delay 
 gratification  and  wait  for  the  second 
 marshmallow  and  to  improve  our  willpower 
 and  so  we  can  take  control  of  this
[42:15] ourselves  we  don't  need  to  wait  for  the 
 teachers  to  compliment  us  we  can  do  that 
 ourselves
[42:20] you  can  do  it  like  when  you've  been 
 hitting  a  workout  you  can  manually  say 
 positive  thoughts  in  your  mind  often  you
[42:26] have  to  manually  forcefully  say  like 
 positive  things  in  your  brain  because
[42:31] they  don't  often  come  up  naturally  so 
 here  you  are  like  you've  just  done  a 
 workout  and  automatically  your  brain  is 
 just  thinking  about  high  schools
[42:36] thinking  about  you  know  irrelevant 
 things  stupid  thoughts  everything  you 
 know  it's  just  whatever  but  you  can  take
[42:41] a  few  seconds  to  think  yes  like  you  can 
 say  the  words  in  your  brain  like 
 forcefully  I've  completed  the  workout  I
[42:46] feel  awesome  I'm  so  proud  of  myself  for 
 completing  the  workout 
 I've  studied  today  for  25  minutes  it's
[42:52] not  that  it's  not  like  as  much  as  you 
 know  other  people  do  but  it's  quite  a 
 high  amount  for  me  so  I'm  proud  of
[42:57] myself  I'm  happy 
 it's  it's of  utmost  importance  that 
 someone
[43:03] honestly  that's  [ __ ]  sad  but  it's  off 
 very  much  importance 
 for  everyone  but  especially  for  children
[43:09] and  teenagers  that  you're  hearing  some 
 of  these  positive  words  and  I'm  so  like
[43:15] I'm  sad  for  you  that  you're  not  hearing 
 that  from  the  people  in  your  life  and
[43:20] you  know  from  school  from  teachers  from 
 parents
[43:26] but  our  sadness  is  not  going  to  help  us 
 here 
 proactiveness  is
[43:31] if  other  people  aren't  implanting  these 
 positive  happy
[43:36] joyful  words  into  your  mind  then  it's 
 your  duty  to  do  it  yourself  if  you  are
[43:41] trying  to  quit  video  games  the  single 
 greatest  piece  of  advice  that  I  can  give 
 you  is  not  just  the  quit  video  games  or
[43:48] rather  to  replace  them  with  a  hobby  or 
 skill  that  has  a  very  similar  feeling  of
[43:53] like  progression  status  Brotherhood 
 leveling  up  and  weightlifting  is
[43:59] absolutely  perfect  for  this  you  go  from 
 grinding  and  leveling  up  inside  of  the
[44:04] virtual  world  and  you're  getting  some 
 level  of  status  for  like  the  high  score 
 that  you're  hitting  and  the  boss  that 
 you've  just  killed  so  getting  into  the
[44:10] gym  and  grinding  and  leveling  up  like 
 the  weight  of  the  big  movements  the
[44:15] bench  press  and  the  squat  and  the 
 deadlift  and  you  get  some  level  of 
 status  there  you  get  some  Brotherhood 
 when  you  work  out  with  guys  understand
[44:20] this  every  single  guide  that  I  have 
 known  who  has  successfully  quit  video
[44:25] games  which  is  hundreds  of  people  that 
 I've  spoke  to  in  this  work  that  I've 
 done 
 every  single  one  of  them  replaced  video
[44:32] games  with  weightlifting  every  time 
 literally  like  it  seems  to  me  that  you
[44:38] can  like  100  guarantee  that  you'll  quit 
 video  games  if  you'd  rather  get  into 
 weightlifting  instead  and  it  seems  to  me
[44:43] that  people  who  try  to  quit  video  games 
 without  specifically  getting  into 
 weightlifting  often  don't  end  up  being
[44:50] successful  they  often  go  back  to  playing 
 video  games  of  course  there's  some 
 people  who  have  quit  playing  games  and 
 you  know  they  ended  up  doing  some  other
[44:55] skill  or  whatever  but  it  seems  to  me 
 that  weightlifting  is  probably  the  best 
 one  on  my  recent  discipline  full  guide  I
[45:01] actually  had  a  whole  section  on  like  how 
 to  start  going  to  the  gym  it's  like  it's 
 it's  in  like  autistic  detail  of  like
[45:07] okay  this  is  how  you  find  a  gym  this  is 
 how  you  sign  up  this  is  the  workout  you 
 should  hit  I  even  made  the  workout
[45:12] routine  and  linked  all  the  videos  that 
 you  need  to  watch  to  begin  so  the 
 discipline  full  guide  will  be  like 
 linked  somewhere  as  a  card  that  you  can
[45:18] go  watch  now  and  just  go  look  out  for 
 the  section  that  says  like  starting  the 
 gym  but  before  you  can  make  progress  in
[45:23] quitting  video  games  and  moving  on  and 
 you  know  leveling  up  in  real  life  we 
 have  to  acknowledge  that  your  social 
 life  will  have  a  huge  influence  here  if
[45:30] you're  friends  with  these  guys  these 
 losers  who  are  stuck  or  who  are  happy  in
[45:35] mediocrity  who  are  happy  to  continue 
 playing  video  games  and  you  stay  friends
[45:40] with  them  you  will  stay  stuck  at  this 
 level  here  you  are  like  a  young  man
[45:45] who's  so  different  from  your  friends  but 
 you  just  haven't  really  shown  it  that 
 much  you  still  keep  for  example
[45:50] pretending  to  be  friends  with  them  you 
 don't  want  to  play  video  games  but  then 
 you  still  join  the  Discord  server  of
[45:56] your  little  gamer  friends  and  you  it's 
 just  kind  of  agitating  to  listen  to 
 people  play  games  whilst  they're  on 
 Discord  you  have  a  voice  chat  and  so  you
[46:02] end  up  joining  and  you  just  like  relapse 
 your  your  non-gaming  streak  and  you  feel 
 pathetic  and  you  know  one  of  the  guys
[46:07] there  isn't  even  nice  he's  actually  a 
 bit  of  an  [ __ ]  and  everything  so  that 
 piece  of  advice  I'd  give  you  is  if  you
[46:13] do  genuinely  want  to  quit  playing  video 
 games 
 you  probably  need  to  stop  being  friends
[46:18] with  the  same  video  Gamers  because 
 you'll  realize  that  a  lot  of  your 
 friendship  just  revolves  around  the
[46:24] video  game  which  you  might  not  think  it 
 does  because  you  might  laugh  about 
 things  you  might  talk  about  other  things 
 and  oh  you  know  new  tape  podcast  guys
[46:30] and  stuff  when  you  stop  playing  video 
 games  you'll  realize  just  how  little  you 
 have  in  common  with  them  and  the  more
[46:35] that  you  attach  yourself  to  the  same 
 people 
 the  less  you're  going  to  be  able  to 
 progress  in  life  because  if  they're  here
[46:42] at  this  level  you're  trying  to  climb  but 
 while  spending  time  talking  and 
 integrating  their  beliefs  their  mindsets
[46:48] their  words  into  your  brain  so  your  own 
 self-improvement  journey  is  just  slower
[46:53] like  you're  literally  delaying  the 
 points  of  which  you're  gonna  meet  like  a 
 beautiful  feminine  wife  because  you're
[46:58] still  friends  with  these  guys  and  that 
 woman's  not  gonna  like  you  feel  like  a 
 [ __ ]  loser  like  this  because  this  is
[47:03] below  you  the  Discord  Friends  the  video 
 games  it  is  below  you  if  you're  watching 
 a  video  like  this  undoubtedly  you  are
[47:09] better  than  that  now  you're  better  than 
 these  modern  addictions  but  too  many 
 young  guys  they  want  to  quit  video  games
[47:14] but  they  don't  quit  that  friendship 
 group  because  it  feels  super  painful  to 
 leave  like  the  Social  Circle  that  we're
[47:19] in  you  must  get  used  to  this  concept  of 
 shedding  layers  of  your  life  that  for
[47:24] example  whilst  you  wear  this  video  gamer 
 all  part  of  your  life  aligned  to  it  you 
 know  the  clothes  you  wore  the  hairstyle
[47:30] you  had  the  friends  you  kept  the  apps 
 that  you  had  on  your  phone  and  on  your 
 computer  when  you're  not  like  this
[47:35] anymore  you  need  to  almost  shed  that 
 identity  that  means  shedding  the  the 
 kinds  of  clothes  that  remind  you  of
[47:41] being  a  video  gamer  that  means  shedding 
 like  the  desktop  wallpaper  that  reminds 
 you  from  it  shedding  the  Discord  server
[47:47] even  the  friends  the  people  who  remind 
 you  of  that  lesser  version  of  you 
 because  you're  no  longer  that  guy  but  if
[47:52] you  don't  actually  make  actions  in  the 
 real  world  then  you  technically  haven't 
 changed  at  all  so  this  seems  scary  but
[47:58] your  actionable  step 
 is  the  construct  a  respectful  message
[48:04] which  you're  going  to  send  over  to  this 
 chart  and  then  you're  going  to  leave 
 straight  after  that
[48:09] this  is  something  I've  helped  quite  a 
 lot  of  young  men  with  and  this  is  the 
 most  effective  way  to  quit  playing  video
[48:16] games  and  say  like  get  away  from  this 
 friendship  group  that  aren't  really 
 doing  much  with  their  lives
[48:21] we've  tried  different  ways  like  I've 
 spoke  to  hundreds  of  guys  speaking  about 
 this  problem  there's  so  many  different
[48:26] ways  you  could  consider  you  can  try  to 
 just  you  know  ghost  them  a  little  bit 
 you  can  try  to  just  be  friendly  and  be 
 on  good  terms  none  of  that  ever  works
[48:34] your  real  like  big  progress  will  come 
 from  you  specifically  creating  like  a
[48:39] full-on  okay  point  I'm  like  leaving  this 
 I'm  no  longer  this  person  anymore  this 
 is  why  I'm  saying  you  construct  a
[48:44] respectful  message  you  don't  blame  them 
 you  don't  say  anything  bad  to  them  if 
 you  really  want  this  full  guide  to  help
[48:49] you  this  is  a  task  that  you  must  get 
 through  right  now  open  up  like  a  word 
 doc  or  maybe  just  open  up  the  exact
[48:54] Discord  server  that  you  usually  go  to  or 
 the  fact  like  you  know  the  WhatsApp 
 group  chat  or  whatever  it  is  that  you
[48:59] use  for  these  friends  and  you  just  can 
 tell  like  they're  not  getting  onto 
 self-improvement  they're  not  interested
[49:05] in  this  they  think  that  going  to  the  gym 
 is  gay  they  just  want  to  keep  playing 
 games 
 you're  going  to  construct  it  just  a  few
[49:11] sentences  just  saying  like  hello 
 everyone  you  know  thank  you  so  much  for 
 like  the  experiences  and  memories  that 
 we've  had  I'm  grateful  to  have  like  you
[49:17] know  experienced  this  all  but  video 
 games  that  just  don't  interest  me 
 anymore  and  I  don't  and  I  want  to  like
[49:22] shed  this  layer  of  my  life  and  move  on 
 to  the  next  part  of  like  my  my  growth  as 
 a  person  and  this  is  nothing  against  you
[49:28] guys  I  really  hope  that  you  keep  having 
 lots  of  fun  take  care  you  send  a  message 
 like  that  where  you  don't  say  anything
[49:33] mean  to  them  but  you  just  kind  of  say 
 like  you  know  I'm  just  kind  of  like 
 shedding  the  layers  of  my  life  or
[49:38] something  like  that  right  and  you  end  up 
 sending  it  and  then  leaving  the  group 
 chat  you  fully  like  leave  the  server  you
[49:44] might  think  wait  this  is  really  scary 
 one  but  you're  already  past  this  you 
 don't  even  play  games  with  them  anymore
[49:49] you  don't  even  enjoy  it  there's  no  value 
 for  you  being  there  it's  just  the  fear 
 of  like  stepping  into  the  unknown  it's
[49:55] the  fear  of  just  going  about  it  yourself 
 but  what  I've  found  is  like  you  almost 
 have  to  go  through  this  transition
[50:00] period  where  you  have  the  bad  friends 
 you  have  this  period  of  loneliness  and 
 then  you  start  making  the  good  friends
[50:05] the  good  friends  aren't  going  to  be 
 attracted  to  you  when  you're  still  the 
 guy  who's  in  the  middle  of  like  a  bad 
 video  gamer  friendship  group  it's  better
[50:11] to  be  by  yourself  than  it  is  with  people 
 who  are  dragging  you  back  and  who  are 
 like  negative  influences  when  you  send
[50:16] this  message  you  probably  will  get  like 
 a  barrage  of  disrespect  they'll  send  you
[50:21] a  bunch  of  messages  they  will  talk  about 
 you  and  chat  [ __ ]  about  you  which  I  know 
 sounds  scary
[50:26] this  will  last  for  about  three  days  the 
 retention  span  isn't  that  powerful
[50:32] after  that  they'll  go  back  to  playing 
 their  games  with  mild  depression  and 
 they'll  stop  thinking  about  you  you'll
[50:38] realize  that  this  strong  friendship  that 
 you  thought  you  had  all  this  time 
 because  you  speak  to  each  other  for
[50:43] three  hours  a  day  you'll  realize  it  100 
 revolved  around  video  games
[50:48] which  you  don't  want  to  play  anymore 
 the  best  friend  like  the  nicest  guy  the
[50:54] most  like  awoke  guy  from  the  group  will 
 probably  send  you  a  private  message  he's
[50:59] the  one  that  you  can  try  and  save  and 
 try  and  get  onto  self-improvement  but  it 
 most  likely  will  be  a  waste  of  your  time
[51:05] the  exact  same  Dynamic  please  trust  me 
 when  I  say  I  have  seen  this  happen  over
[51:11] a  hundred  times 
 the  work  that  I've  done  here  is  over  the 
 last  three  years  this  has  literally  been
[51:16] like  my  full-time  job  is  getting  guys  to 
 like  quit  the  bad  habits  and  stop  the 
 good  ones  trust  me  when  I  say  over  the
[51:21] last  years 
 it's  such  a  wasted  time  trying  to  hold
[51:27] on  to  these  people  who  aren't  even  good 
 for  you 
 there's  better  growth  coming  from  this
[51:33] and  it's  not  terrible  to  be  alone  for 
 some  time  when  you're  trying  to  figure
[51:38] things  out  and  learn  who  you  are  and 
 you're  navigating  self-improvement  even 
 more  there's  two  paths  that  you  can  take
[51:43] here  if  you  do  want  to  join  my  online 
 community  I  have  a  paid  school  called 
 Adonis  school  where  we've  got  like  the
[51:48] whole  Community  then  we've  got  teachers 
 we  teach  yourself  Improvement  tactics  we 
 teach  you  like  business  models  I  think
[51:54] it's  an  awesome  place  to  be  and  you  can 
 consider  joining  that  that's  the  top 
 Link  in  the  description  but  you  can  also
[51:59] just  join  communities  and  make  friends 
 without  needing  to  pay  for  anything  they 
 can  go  to  the  gym  and  make  a  workout
[52:04] friend  there  like  make  like  a  workout 
 partner  and  you  can  even  go  and  find 
 free  communities  online  it's  far  better
[52:09] for  you  to  be  in  the  middle  of  other 
 guys  who  are  on  self-improvement  who  are 
 going  to  the  gym  who've  got  values  just
[52:15] like  you  do  than  it  is  to  be  around 
 people  who  like  you  don't  even  respect 
 anymore  step  four  sugar
[52:22] I'm  in  the  car  with  my  girlfriend  and 
 we're  in  the  Scotland  Highlands  right  at
[52:27] the  top  of  the  UK  we're  here  on  a  road 
 trip  we've  been  driving  around  having  a 
 great  time  sleeping  in  the  car  going
[52:33] from  Cafe  to  Cafe  enjoying  all  these 
 like  treats  and  coffees  and  we're  sat
[52:38] here  right  now 
 I've  got  a  cookie  I've  got  a  cake  and 
 we've  got  coffee  next  to  us
[52:45] but  it  doesn't  feel  quite  right  on  our 
 last  trip  here  we  were  so  loving  and  we 
 stumbled  upon  these  beautiful  family  ran
[52:52] cafes  where  we  enjoyed  some  of  the 
 treats  that  were  made  by  like  the 
 authentic  60  year  old  grandmas  this  time
[52:57] I  was  autistically  mapping  out  our 
 itinerary  to  make  sure  we  could  hit  all 
 these  cafes  again  and  it  was  like  I
[53:03] became 
 a  sugar  fiend 
 like  a  crackhead
[53:08] and  we're  sat  here  when  I've  got  a 
 hundred  grams  of  sugar  between  my  legs
[53:13] the  cookie  and  the  cake  and  like  the 
 cake  that  we've  traveled  300  miles  for
[53:19] and  she  actually  says  it  to  me 
 I  don't  think  you're  as  loving  as  you
[53:25] were  last  time  we  were  here 
 and  that  hits  me  because  you  know  I've
[53:30] been  reading  the  web  the  superior  man 
 and  I've  been  leveling  up  my  my  skill  of 
 relationships  of  love
[53:36] has  my  own  woman  telling  me  that 
 not  only  have  I  been  less  loving  on  this
[53:41] trip  or  rather  she  has  seen  this  weird 
 addictive  side  to  me  where  I've  been  so 
 obsessed  of  making  sure  that  we  hit
[53:46] every  Cafe  that  I  had  plotted  out  on 
 Google  Maps
[53:51] and  it  hits  me  but  we  are  hundreds  of 
 miles  away  from  home
[53:56] the  reason  why  I  was  super  Keen  for  this 
 trip 
 wasn't  to  spend  loving  time  with  her
[54:05] it  was  for  sugar 
 I  realized  even  here  right  now  today  the
[54:10] sugar  has  a  huge  hook  on  me  a  hook  to 
 the  level  that  it  will  make  me  travel
[54:16] the  entire  country  hundreds  of  miles  to
[54:21] just  go  get  some  cake  and  you  know  this 
 yourself  whether  it's  with  sugar  or 
 other  kinds  of  junk  food  the  food  that
[54:27] we  have  in  this  modern  day  is  so 
 addictive  low  quality  lacking  in 
 nutrition  and  here  we  are  just  eating  it
[54:33] as  if  it's  completely  normal  and  if  you 
 don't  have  a  problem  with  the  things 
 that  you  eat  then  maybe  it's  someone
[54:38] that  you  know  what  there's  a  lot  of 
 people  you  know  which  have  literally  got 
 health  problems  inside  of  them  there's
[54:44] genuine  the  cancer  and  diabetes  forming 
 right  now  and  yet  we're  still  having  100
[54:49] grams  of  sugar  every  single  day  without 
 realizing  if  you  can  relate  to  this  I 
 just  want  to  twist  the  knife  on  your
[54:54] pain  a  little  bit  are  we  really  men  of 
 character  and  strength  if  there's 
 substances  that  we're  consuming  every
[55:00] day  that  actually  have  such  a  hook  on  us 
 from  what  you  know  about  me  you  probably 
 think  that  I'm  quite  like  a  disciplined
[55:06] regimented  guy  who  likes  being  on  his 
 routine  and  working  hard  and  everything 
 but  here  I  was  on  this  trip  genuinely
[55:12] having  drove 
 10  hours  straight 
 to  go  to  a  particular  Cafe  because  I
[55:19] just  wanted  the  cake  from  the 
 that  kind  of  sounds  like  a  cute  like  lit 
 bonding  moment  with  your  girl  but
[55:24] genuinely  I'm  telling  you  it  was  not  for 
 love  it  was  for  sugar
[55:29] so  I  have  the  humility  to  admit  the 
 sugar  is  very  addictive  for  me  even 
 though  I  don't  have  that  much  of  my
[55:34] day-to-day  diet  and  so  this  is  exactly 
 what  you  do  to  overcome  the  pull  that
[55:39] sugar  and  junk  food  has  on  you  in  that 
 same  marshmallow  experiment  they  found 
 that  when  they  cued  the  children  to  feel
[55:46] negative  and  to  feel  unhappy  they  were 
 far  less  likely  to  delay  gratification 
 so  if  you're  sad  you'll  have  less
[55:53] willpower  if  you're  happy  you  have  more 
 willpower  and  you  can  almost  imagine 
 like  the  middle  aged  women  who  struggle
[56:00] with  their  diets  and  you  always  hear  of 
 this  of  like  guilty  upset  depressive
[56:05] eating  when  someone  is  sad  they  always 
 are  more  likely  to  cheat  on  their  diets 
 and  the  same  thing  for  us  with  not  just
[56:11] diets  but  let's  say  porn  and  video  games 
 I  think  that  when  we've  done  these  bad 
 habits  our  emotions  have  played  a  huge
[56:17] part  in  that  we  often  will  eat  the  sugar 
 or  we'll  watch  the  porn  not  when  we're 
 hungry  or  when  we're  feeling  horny  but
[56:25] rather  when  we're  just  bored  sad  and 
 lonely  what's  super  interesting  is  that 
 when  when  those  researchers  cued  these
[56:31] children  to  feel  sad  or  to  feel  happy  to 
 see  what  the  effective  emotion  was  on 
 their  ability  to  delay  gratification
[56:37] guess  how  they  did  it 
 it  was  as  simple  as  just  telling  the
[56:42] children  to  remember  a  specific  type  of 
 memory  so  when  they  wanted  to  see  the 
 effect  of  like  being  sad  on  your  ability
[56:48] to  have  willpower  they  literally  just 
 said  to  the  children  like  a  standardized 
 sentence  that  they  said  to  each  of  them 
 think  of  something  sad  like  when  you're
[56:55] crying  but  there's  no  one  there  to  help 
 you  that  was  the  one  cue  that  they  gave 
 that  literally  put  the  children  in  a  sad
[57:02] mood  I  keep  saying  this  in  every  video 
 that  I  record  you  can  control  which
[57:07] emotions  that  you  feel  you  do  it  by 
 manually  putting  a  thought  inside  of 
 your  mind  manually  thinking  of  a  memory
[57:13] that  makes  you  feel  sad  manually 
 thinking  of  something  that  makes  you 
 feel  anxious  now  most  of  the  time  these
[57:18] emotions  and  thoughts  and  memories  come 
 about  automatically  in  our  brain  don't 
 they  it's  like  you  know  you're  just
[57:23] going  through  life  you're  just  whatever 
 you're  doing  whatever  you're  supposed  to 
 be  doing  and  suddenly  there's  a  thought 
 of  anxiousness  suddenly  there's  a
[57:28] thought  of  sadness  that  happens  but  we 
 need  to  be  manually  implanting  positive
[57:33] thoughts  recalling  happy  memories  like 
 manually  forcefully  into  our  brain 
 because  when  they  did  that  and  the
[57:38] researchers  asked  children  think  of 
 something  that  makes  you  happy  like  when 
 your  mommy  pushes  you  really  high  on  the
[57:43] swing  you  know  like  the  little  swing 
 thing  like  a  children's  playground  this 
 was  their  standardized  sentence  and  it
[57:49] literally  worked  to  make  the  children 
 happy  which  then  meant  that  they  delayed 
 gratification  more
[57:54] so  why  don't  we  just  start  doing  this 
 just  through  the  day  just  recall  to 
 things  that  make  you  happy  more  quite
[57:59] frankly  there's  a  lot  of  like  weak  and 
 hateful  people  in  this  modern  world
[58:04] usually  the  weaker  people  are  more 
 hateful  and  so  when  they  see  you  being 
 quite  happy  and  when  they  see  us
[58:09] discussing  something  like  this  they'll 
 for  some  reason  think  that  this  is  this 
 is  evil  like  you  can  imagine  the  kind  of
[58:15] person  I'm  thinking  about  there's  people 
 who  if  they  found  out  that  we  were 
 manually  implanting  positive  thoughts
[58:20] and  memories  in  our  brain  they  would  say 
 that  this  is  like  a  bad  practice  they 
 would  almost  like  they're  there  in
[58:25] depression  like  wanting  you  to  feel 
 depressed  but  we've  all  like  we've 
 experienced  what  it's  like  to  feel
[58:30] depressed  and  it's  [ __ ]  awful  so  why 
 would  we  stay  like  that 
 it  sounds
[58:35] so  inconsiderate  like  insensitive 
 but  really  the  cure  to  like  your
[58:41] emotional  problems  is  like  just  think  of 
 something  pleasant  it's  pretty  much  as
[58:46] simple  as  that 
 just  think  of  something  pleasant  right 
 here  right  now  is  like  a  mini  actionable
[58:52] step 
 think  of  a  happy  memory  that  you've  got 
 one  that  you  couldn't  stop  laughing  like 
 when  was  the  time  where  you  can  remember
[58:58] were  you  like  fully  laughed  a  lot 
 play  that  memory  into  your  mind
[59:04] hmm 
 you  can't  help  but  to  feel  more  pleasant
[59:09] when  that  happens  and  when  you  have  that 
 Pleasant  feeling  you're  gonna  wait  out 
 for  the  second  marshmallow  well  now  what
[59:14] do  you  think  would  happen  when  they  kept 
 on  reminding  the  kids  who  were  trying  to 
 delay  gratification  of  what  the  reward
[59:20] would  be  if  they  waited  remember  they 
 get  two  marshmallows  if  they  wait  but
[59:25] only  one  if  they  eat  it  right  now  when 
 the  researchers  kept  on  reminding  the 
 children  that  they'd  get  essentially
[59:30] double  the  reward  they  were  more  likely 
 to  delay  gratification  because  they  kept 
 the  dream  results  in  their  mind  and  that
[59:36] reminds  me  of  what  you  can  probably 
 imagine  like  a  bunch  of  businessmen  do 
 they  write  their  goals  every  morning
[59:41] they're  keeping  the  dream  result  in  mind 
 and  do  you  do  this  why  not  think  to 
 yourself  every  single  day  what  the  dream
[59:47] result  that  you're  waiting  out  for  is 
 there's  a  random  girl  like  giving  you 
 flirtatious  eyes  and  she's  speaking  to
[59:53] you  maybe  she's  approached  you  but  you 
 don't  want  to  cheat  on  your  woman 
 why  don't  you  just  think  of  like  the
[59:59] dream  results  with  your  woman 
 happy  long-term  relationship  the
[60:04] children  the  beautiful  loving  safe 
 household 
 because  one  of  mine  is  tempted  if  that's
[60:10] the  things  that  he's  thinking  of  but 
 then  he's  not  going  to  cheat  on  the 
 other  side  the  man  who  gets  tempted  and
[60:15] he  thinks  about  the  pleasure  that  he 
 could  go  and  gain  right  now  and  he 
 almost  tries  purposely  not  to  think 
 about  his  family  he's  the  one  who  breaks
[60:21] his  commitments  remind  yourself  of  what 
 the  dream  results  you  want  is  this  works
[60:26] super  super  well  for  this  step  right 
 here  with  sugar  with  your  diet  with  your 
 physique  put  a  picture  of  your  dream
[60:31] physique  on  your  phone  lock  screen  go 
 take  like  the  best  picture  you've  taken
[60:36] so  far  in  the  gym  and  put  it  as  your 
 phone  lock  screen  and  if  you  get  tempted 
 by  sugar  and  by  diet  just  look  at  that
[60:42] picture  look  at  that  picture  and  feel 
 proud  of  yourself  and  think  to  yourself 
 like  you  know  this  is  what  I'm  working 
 so  hard  for  I  like  looking  good  I  like
[60:49] feeling  strong  I've  built  this  myself 
 and  so  when  you  get  tempted  and  you  look 
 at  a  picture  like  that  you  remind
[60:54] yourself  this  is  what  you're  doing  it 
 for  there's  two  books  that  I  read  for 
 this  full  guide  one  is  the  marshmallow
[60:59] test  by  Walter  Miss  Chell  and  this  is 
 the  one  you  know  talking  about  the 
 marshmallows  and  the  children  but  the
[61:05] other  book  I  read  which  is  super 
 interesting  is  called  discipline  is 
 Destiny  by  Ryan  holiday  I  read  that  book
[61:10] for  the  discipline  full  guide  that's  on 
 my  channel  but  a  lot  of  it  was  about 
 willpower  resisting  desires  and  there
[61:15] was  a  quote  which  I  want  to  read  you  out 
 and  I  just  as  I  read  it  to  you  maybe 
 just  visualize  what  I'm  saying  remember
[61:21] to  conduct  yourself  in  life  as  if  at  a 
 banquet  as  something  being  passed  around
[61:26] comes  to  you  reach  your  hand  and  take  a 
 moderate  helping 
 does  it  pass  by  you  don't  stop  it  it
[61:34] hasn't  come  yet  don't  burn  in  desire  for 
 it  but  wait  until  it  arrives  in  front  of 
 you  act  this  way  with  children  espoused
[61:41] towards  position  with  wealth  one  day  it 
 will  make  you  worthy  of  a  Bankai  with 
 the  Gods
[61:46] if  you  imagine  yourself  in  that 
 situation  you're  in  this  restaurant  and 
 they're  bringing  delicious  food  over 
 most  people  will  have  such  intense
[61:52] desires  or  like  this  uncontrollable  urge 
 to  Feast  right  now  you  know  they  can 
 smell  the  nice  tasty  like  like  trans
[61:58] fats  coming  into  the  air  and  they'll 
 really  want  a  lot  you  can  imagine  a  fat 
 relative  of  yours  who  would  take  like
[62:03] big  servings  stick  it  onto  his  plate  and 
 some  of  your  other  fat  relatives  will 
 almost  compliment  him  on  that  and  say
[62:09] like  wow  you  know  you're  eating  so  much 
 oh  but  imagine  yourself  this  stoic 
 unperturbed  by  the  addictions  of  food
[62:16] still  enjoying  it  but  within  moderation 
 of  mastering  the  desire  inside  of  you
[62:21] for  this  addictive  food  and  it's  very 
 hard  to  have  the  thing  that  you  might  be 
 addicted  to  the  sugar  the  junk  food
[62:28] right  in  front  of  you  but  to  be  able  to 
 act  with  character  at  the  same  time
[62:33] that's  why  I'm  inviting  you  to  do  a 
 practice  which  is  what  I  call  willpower 
 training  I  did  this  for  a  year  straight
[62:40] every  single  day  and  it  changed  my  life 
 it  will  change  yours  and  it's  super 
 simple  go  out  to  a  store  as  soon  as  you
[62:45] can  and  go  and  buy  your  all-time 
 favorite  treat  maybe  it's  a  chocolate 
 bar  maybe  it's  Chris  maybe  whatever  it
[62:51] is  like  the  thing  that  is  unhealthy  but 
 you've  always  like  really  really  liked 
 for  me  it's  like  chocolate  bars  and
[62:56] there's  one  in  specific  called  Kinder 
 hippos  like  absolutely  delicious 
 chocolate  bar  and  there's  also  um  Lindor
[63:03] chocolate  like  people  in  the  UK  will 
 know  what  I'm  talking  about  okay  you  go 
 out  and  you  go  buy  one  of  those  like  one 
 chocolate  bar  right  put  it  on  your  desk
[63:10] put  it  in  front  of  you 
 stare  at  it  like  a  psychopath
[63:17] feel  the  emotions  that  arises  the  copes 
 that  start  in  your  brain  thinking  like 
 yeah  you  know  this  is  kind  of  weird  I
[63:22] may  as  well  just  eat  it  otherwise  you 
 know  it'll  be  wasted  like  you  know 
 because  someone  else  might  eat  it  so 
 yeah  I  may  as  well  just  eat  it  now
[63:27] because  I'm  just  being  weird  with  that 
 thing 
 stare  at  it  and  just  analyze  the 
 thoughts  and  feelings  that  happen  get  a
[63:34] journal  out  and  ask  yourself 
 why  does  this  have  power  over  me 
 I  know  that  it's  not  good  why  do  I  feel
[63:41] an  urge  to  indulge  in  it  right  now 
 this  will  drain  your  willpower  but  this
[63:47] is  how  you  level  will  power  up 
 it's  when  you  use  your  willpower  like  a 
 muscle  and  then  it  gets  strengthened
[63:53] overnight  you  do  this  as  like  a  specific 
 practice  you  just  go  and  get  the 
 all-time  favorite  snack  put  it  in  front
[63:59] of  you 
 the  reason  why  I  suggest  this  is  because 
 I've  heard  in  the  self-improvement  space
[64:05] online  of  everyone  just  saying  like  oh 
 hey  just  throw  away  the  junk  food  and 
 don't  buy  it  at  the  store
[64:10] so  that  you  know  your  environment  is 
 clean  that's  actually  pretty  good  advice 
 but  it's  not  good  enough  you  know  why
[64:16] I  want  you  to  imagine  like  there's  some 
 fat  woman  who's  got  problems  with  with 
 dieting  and  she's  got  a  bunch  of  snacks
[64:22] in  the  kitchen  and  she  hears  this 
 self-improvement  you  know  this  lay  Mass 
 like  average  advice  like  yeah  just  throw
[64:27] it  away  and  just  don't  buy  it  at  the 
 store  anymore  this  is  what  most  people 
 do  this  is  probably  what  you've  thought 
 is  the  right  answer  it's  not  because
[64:32] what's  going  to  happen  sir  she's  gonna 
 throw  it  all  away  feel  kind  of  proud  of 
 herself
[64:38] and  then  she's  going  to  go  to  work  and 
 her  co-worker  is  going  to  offer  it  to 
 her  and  then  there's  the  birthday  party
[64:43] coming  up  and  someone's  gonna  offer  it 
 there  with  how  prevalent  sugar  and 
 unhealthy  food  is  and  just  addictions
[64:49] and  Drugs  in  general  you're  never  safe 
 just  by  changing  the  environment  we 
 should  absolutely  set  up  our  environment
[64:55] for  Success  you  don't  want  to  like  you 
 know  just  have  porn  open  24  7  on  your 
 computer  or  something  but  at  the  same
[65:00] time  you  want  to  develop  like  the  mental 
 strength  The  Willpower  so  that  if  porn 
 was  blasted  right  in  front  of  you  you'd
[65:05] be  okay  so  that  if  someone  pulls  out  the 
 ultimate  chocolate  bar  that  you've 
 always  loved  your  entire  life  you'd  be
[65:11] okay  saying  no  because  you've  been 
 training  for  this  very  moment  throwing 
 it  out  is  like  level  one  like  you've
[65:17] made  some  progress  throwing  it  out  but 
 then  specifically  getting  the  like  the 
 hardest  thing  for  you  to  use  your
[65:22] willpower  again  and  dangling  that  in 
 front  of  you  like  a  psychopath  and 
 staring  at  it  with  your  squinted  eyes
[65:28] and  thinking  why  do  you  have  control 
 over  me 
 that  will  make  you  realize  things  that
[65:34] you've  never  known  about  yourself  if  you 
 feel  like  you  have  absolutely  no 
 self-control  at  all  then  maybe  skip  this
[65:40] step  because  it's  quite  Advanced  but 
 will  power  training  will  work  for  you  if 
 you  can  kind  of  imagine  yourself  that  if 
 you've  got  this  sort  of  chocolate  bar
[65:46] you  would  be  able  to  somewhat  resist  you 
 might  even  cope  and  just  eat  it  and  say 
 like  oh  well  you  know  the  experiment  is
[65:51] done  like  you  know  there's  willpower 
 training  was  kind  of  stupid  so  I'm  just 
 gonna  eat  it  because  otherwise  it'd  be  a 
 waste  even  if  you  coped  you'd  benefit
[65:56] because  straight  after  that  you'd  feel 
 guilty  as  [ __ ]  realize  how  much  extra 
 power  it  had  over  you  I  had  my  favorite
[66:02] chocolate  bar  on  my  desk 
 for  an  entire  year 
 you  know  after  a  few  days  you  lose  the
[66:09] desire  for  it  because  it  these  things 
 are  very  unnatural  you  know  how  does 
 this  piece  of  food  just  last  there  just
[66:16] there  on  your  desk  it  makes  you  realize 
 this  it's  not  even  real  food
[66:21] it's  just  like  this  weird  chemical 
 substance  that  some  scientists  and 
 entrepreneurs  have  put  together  to
[66:27] addict  you 
 so  when  I've  got  my  favorite  chocolate 
 bar  on  top  of  my  desk  and  I  haven't
[66:33] touched  it  for  months 
 when  it's  time  for  someone's  birthday 
 and  I  can  see  that  they've  got  a  kind  of
[66:38] a  mediocre  shitty  cake 
 I'm  not  gonna  have  any 
 when  I  go  out  to  a  restaurant  I'm  not
[66:45] gonna  have  the  dessert  menu  because  I've 
 already  had  the  perfect  thing  in  front 
 of  me  I've  been  training  my  willpower  so
[66:50] that  when  the  addiction  is  in  front  of 
 me  I  can  resist  it  do  that  while  still 
 setting  up  your  environment  for  Success
[66:56] you  still  for  example  don't  want  to  be 
 using  your  phone  or  your  computer  for 
 work  and  stumble  upon  something  that's 
 going  to  trigger  you  into  relapsing  in
[67:02] your  nofap  streak  so  you  want  to  set  up 
 that  you  still  for  example  want  to  go 
 through  the  kitchen  and  make  your  food
[67:07] without  seeing  something  that  you  might 
 quickly  grab  it  and  eat  but  some 
 specific  time  for  willpower  training  can
[67:13] be  very  beneficial  that's  your 
 actionable  step  go  and  get  the  thing 
 that  you  feel  addicted  to  it  can  be 
 sugar  it  can  be  junk  food  it  can  be  for
[67:19] any  of  the  other  like  addictions  that  we 
 spoke  about  and  just  put  it  in  front  of
[67:24] you  and  journal  about  what  you  feel 
 and  be  pissed  off  step  five  find  your
[67:31] hot  triggers  now  think  about  how  crazy 
 it  is  to  think  of  a  World  level  athlete
[67:36] or  a  president 
 extremely  disciplined  committed  men  who
[67:41] will  eventually  go  on  and  cheat  on  their 
 wives  I've  experienced  this  firsthand 
 myself  for  the  last  three  years  I've
[67:47] lived  in  this  house  with  my  family  I've 
 been  super  disciplined  I  wake  up  every 
 day  5  a.m  cold  showers  you  know  I  do
[67:53] like  the  discipline  stuff  and  yet  I've 
 traveled  to  Thailand  twice  in  the  last
[67:58] few  years  along  with  some  other 
 countries 
 and  it's  so  interesting  of  what  happens
[68:03] to  my  discipline  when  I  go  somewhere 
 else 
 I  turn  into  a  degenerate
[68:09] here  I'm  super  productive  my  diet  is  is 
 like  on  point  I'm  training  hard  every
[68:15] day  I'm  working  super  super  hard  I  go  to 
 Thailand  and  I'm  literally  edging  my 
 dick  whilst  High  whilst  like  message
[68:21] like  barrage  messaging  girls  on  on 
 Tinder  or  Instagram  I  go  to  Mexico  and
[68:27] I'm  literally  caught  having  public  sex 
 why  is  it  that  you  can  show  like  a 
 spectrum  of  character  traits  you  would
[68:32] assume  that  someone  who  is  disciplined 
 is  disciplined
[68:37] but  not  exactly  someone  who's  discipline 
 is  not  always  disciplined  rather  he  is
[68:42] disciplined  when  the  context  is  the  same 
 and  so  if  he  keeps  the  context  the
[68:48] environment  the  same  then  he  stays 
 disciplined  and  he  seems  like  an 
 all-round  discipline  in  person
[68:54] put  that  same  discipline  guy  let's  say 
 this  world  level  athlete 
 and  put  his  type  of  woman  in  front  of
[69:01] him 
 like  some  curvy  light-skinned  woman 
 that's  you  know  his  his  exact  type
[69:06] and  suddenly  he's  not  disciplined  and 
 he's  cheating  on  his  wife
[69:12] so  this  is  called  your  hot  trigger  and 
 this  is  something  you'll  really  want  to 
 do  alongside  me  right  now
[69:18] be  honest  with  yourself  and  start  to 
 think  what  your  hot  trigger  could  be
[69:23] what  is  the  thing  that  triggers  you  to 
 behave  in  a  way  that  you  wouldn't  like
[69:28] for  a  lot  of  guys  it  might  be  like  a 
 sexually  attractive  woman  who's 
 specifically  showing  some  interest  in
[69:33] you  most  married  men  may  feel  kind  of 
 like  committed  to  their  wives  and 
 they've  been  good  boys  but  it's  just
[69:38] because  that  situation  hasn't  arose  but 
 once  that  situation  does  arise  in  their 
 10  20  30  year  marriage  when  the  other
[69:45] guys  working  at  some  convention  or 
 something  and  that's  when  some  like 
 random  woman  that  he  works  with  starts
[69:50] like  speaking  to  him  flirting  and  he 
 ends  up  cheating  it  was  never  that  he 
 was  like  this  totally  committed  guy  all
[69:55] this  time  it  was  like  he  always  had  this 
 hot  trigger  that  was  just  not  in  front 
 of  him  likewise  for  you  you  might  be
[70:00] quite  a  disciplined  guy  and  yet  when  you 
 get  triggered  to  for  example  get  into 
 that  like  incessant  urge  to  fap  because
[70:07] you've  been  on  social  media  and  you've 
 seen  some  like  gym  girl  who  posts  a 
 picture  of  her  ass  then  you're  not  as
[70:12] disciplined  anymore 
 what  is  the  equivalent  of  of  going  to
[70:17] Thailand  for  you 
 for  me  my  hot  triggers  and  I'm  just
[70:23] going  to  be  totally  honest  and  vulgar 
 if  I  smoke  weed 
 I  turn  into  a  degenerate  I  get  horny  as
[70:30] [ __ ]  and  I'm  literally  like  I  get 
 obsessed  with  having  sex
[70:36] if  I  go  and  move  to  a  different  place  if 
 I  go  travel  and  specifically  if  I'm  away
[70:41] from  like  either  family  or  or  people  who 
 ground  me  even  when  I've  moved  with  like
[70:47] with  good  friends  I've  still  turned  into 
 like  a  degenerate 
 being  with  my  family  seems  to  keep  me
[70:53] quite  stable 
 which  of  course  is  like  it's  common 
 sense  that's  what  family's  supposed  to 
 do  and  these  days  we  don't  even  value
[70:58] family  anymore  this  part  of  this  guide 
 might  literally  save  you  from  making  the 
 biggest  mistakes  of  your  entire  life
[71:05] what  could  be  your  hot  triggers  what  are 
 the  negative  if  then  situations  if  x
[71:13] then  y  if  I  smoke  weed  then  I  turn  into 
 a  degenerate
[71:18] if  a  girl  approaches  me  I  might  end  up 
 cheating  on  my  girlfriend  be  honest  with
[71:23] yourself  in  this  practice  and  this 
 actually  reminds  me  of  something  that  Dr 
 Andrew  huberman  talks  about  on  his
[71:28] podcast  where  he  spoke  about  failure 
 forecasting  the  idea  is  that  we  should
[71:33] take  some  dedicated  time  every  now  and 
 then  to  think  about  the  ways  that  we 
 could  actually  fail  the  obstacles  that
[71:39] could  arise  so  that  we  can  plan  to 
 overcome  them  we  don't  want  to  live  in 
 this  way  we  don't  want  to  you  know  24  7
[71:44] be  thinking  about  the  ways  we  could  mess 
 up  the  failures  and  you  know  feeling 
 quite  negative  and  reserved  but  rather
[71:49] just  for  like  some  dedicated  time  maybe 
 once  a  month  once  every  few  months  you'd 
 want  to  just  project  forward  and  think
[71:55] okay  what  could  be  the  mistakes  and 
 failures  that  I  could  make  soon  if 
 you've  got  a  girl  that  you  really  love
[72:00] and  you  really  want  this  relationship  to 
 be  a  success  you  should  be  asking 
 yourself  this  question  like  what  kind  of
[72:05] situation  might  I  cheat  in 
 maybe  if  I  take  drugs  maybe  if  I  drink
[72:11] alcohol  maybe  if  a  girl  really  really 
 you  know  approaches  me  and  she's  like
[72:16] being  very  straightforward 
 maybe  if  I  get  a  DM  from  a  girl  on 
 Instagram  maybe  if  I'm  on  Instagram  or
[72:22] whatever  app  and  like  an  awesome  girl 
 has  liked  my  picture  when  you're  honest 
 with  yourself  you  know  the  tendencies
[72:27] that  you  have  you  know  the  situations 
 where  you  might  actually  sway 
 and  most  people  will  never  do  this  most
[72:35] people  will  never  have  the  honesty  to 
 admit  this  to  themselves  this  is  what's 
 going  to  set  you  apart  from  the  Lesser
[72:40] version  of  yourself  who  doesn't  want  to 
 have  the  honesty  or  humility  to  admit 
 this  once  you're  becoming  aware  of  your
[72:46] if  then  situations  if  this  happens  then 
 I  might  act  like  that  whether  it's  for
[72:51] positive  things  or  negative  things  it's 
 time  to  start  really  thinking  deeply 
 about  the  kind  of  environments  you  might
[72:57] want  to  set  up  for  yourself  you  want  to 
 set  up  an  environment  a  place  to  live 
 situations  to  get  into  context  to  be  in
[73:04] which  are  going  to  support  your  goals 
 they're  going  to  support  the  the 
 character  traits  that  you  want  so  for
[73:09] example  for  a  long  time  since  around 
 2019  I  wanted  to  be  a  digital  Nomad 
 that's  where  you  work  online  you  make
[73:15] money  online  and  you  just  take  your 
 laptop  and  you  can  work  from  any 
 different  country  I  wanted  to  do  that 
 for  so  long  covet  happened  I'm  waiting
[73:22] I'm  waiting  I'm  waiting  waiting  making 
 money  online  it  gets  to  2022  and  I'm
[73:27] ready  to  actually  fly  out  to  Thailand 
 and  live  out  the  stream  I'm  gonna  live 
 there  for  literally  like  months  or  even 
 years  and  not  even  come  back  to  the  UK
[73:34] and  after  literally  just  a  few  days 
 it  was  so  clear  that  like  that  wasn't
[73:40] the  place  to  be  but  there  was  this  huge 
 goal  that  I  had  been  working  on  to  be 
 there  for  so  long  that  you  know  I  stayed
[73:45] there  for  a  little  bit  longer  then  we're 
 one  month  in  and  I'm  really  turning  into 
 a  degenerate  I'm  smoking  a  lot  of  weed
[73:50] this  was  like  a  solid  you  know  year  of 
 year  and  whatever  ago 
 and  it  was  so  strange  to  be  in  this
[73:56] situation  because  just  a  month  before 
 that  when  I  was  at  home  I  was  waking  up 
 at  4am  going  to  the  gym  and  so  I  started
[74:01] to  doubt  myself  thinking  wait  am  I  still 
 a  Jeffrey  am  I  still  like  you  know  I 
 must  still  not  be  disciplined  at  all  it
[74:06] was  so  strange  to  literally  see  myself 
 like  beginning  to  like  [ __ ]  not  fap
[74:11] fap  but  like  Edge  and  cope  and  say  that 
 it  was  for  a  testosterone  boost  that's 
 how  I  that  was  my  morning  routine  I  used
[74:17] to  wake  up  and  literally  look  at  girls 
 on  Instagram  and  say  that  it  was  for 
 like  a  testosterone  boost  and  then  me
[74:22] and  my  friend  would  drive  to  the  gym 
 whilst  listening  to  like  [ __ ]  porn 
 audio  saying  that  it  was  a  testosterone
[74:28] boost  and  it's  not  like  don't  [ __ ]  do 
 that  because  it's  a  stupid  idea  and  it 
 literally  ruins  your  workouts  but  like
[74:34] just 
 I  think  about  that  and  I'm  like  what  the 
 [ __ ]  was  I  doing  that  like  doesn't  even
[74:40] sound  like  me  at  all  but  when  your 
 environment  changes  so  much  then  you 
 can't  expect  your  behavior  not  to  so
[74:47] what  happened  around  that  time 
 my  channel  literally  started  to  die  off 
 like  it  was  the  first  month  of  my
[74:53] Channel's  history  that  it  actually  went 
 down  because  I  was  so  distracted  because
[74:58] you  know  my  brain  was  just  going 
 elsewhere 
 and  I  let  that  happen  for  about  a  month 
 one  month  and  a  half  and  then  I  just  got
[75:04] so  frustrated  thinking  like  I'm  not  even 
 happy  here  I'm  not  even  making  progress 
 to  the  goals  that  I  care  about  I'm
[75:10] wasting  my  time 
 I  don't  care  about  like  this  digital 
 Nomad  feeling  of  you  know  working  in  the
[75:16] cafes  and  stuff  and  so  I  left  the  trip 
 early  moved  back  home  and  got  straight 
 onto  like  a  great  grind
[75:23] luckily  the  day  before  I  left 
 I  ended  up  meeting  my  girlfriend  there
[75:30] in  Thailand 
 so  that  was  like  at  least  a  happy  moment 
 with  that
[75:35] but  then  we  went  to  Thailand  together 
 just  in  um  in  January  of  this  year
[75:42] and  I  went  again  not  really  for  the 
 digital  Nomad  lifestyle  but  more  for 
 this
[75:47] um 
 why  did  I  even  go  I  went  with  this  like
[75:53] goal  of  becoming  like  a  martial  artist 
 and  I'm  gonna  go  train  there  but  Muay 
 Thai  and  everything  and  um  I  realized
[75:59] that  that  wasn't  actually  for  me  that  I 
 was  pretty  much  just  pursuing  this  goal 
 of  becoming  a  fighter  just  because  it
[76:05] would  look  cool  online  and  that  I  didn't 
 actually  give  a  [ __ ]  about  that  like  you 
 know  it's  kind  of  nice  to  try  and  show
[76:10] so  we  went  together  and  I  literally  just 
 wasted  another  two  months  of  my  life 
 it's  been  a  six  months  of  my  entire  life
[76:16] has  been  wasted  because  I  was  following 
 like  a  goal  that  randomly  popped  into  my
[76:21] mind  which  you  know  seemed  kind  of  cool 
 like  yeah  go  to  Thailand  go  to  like  a 
 different  country  and  stuff  and  you  know 
 it  for  me  it's  like  okay  go  to  Thailand
[76:27] go  to  like  one  of  these  countries  for 
 you  it  might  be  something  like  pursuing 
 a  certain  sport  which  isn't  even  right
[76:32] for  you  it  might  be  like  being  friends 
 with  this  friendship  group  that  are 
 always  going  out  and  taking  drugs  or 
 this  friendship  group  that  are  always
[76:38] playing  video  games  it's  about  the 
 situations  that  you  get  yourself  in  you 
 can  see  that  mine  it  seemed  kind  of
[76:43] productive  and  so  yours  might  too  you 
 might  feel  like  it's  productive  to  go 
 and  pursue  this  kind  of  situation  or
[76:48] environments  but  it's  only  when  you  get 
 there  you  realize  you  don't  actually 
 like  the  kind  of  person  you  are  when
[76:53] you're  there 
 so  six  months  of  my  entire  life  which  is 
 a  lot  that's  about  five  percent  of  my
[76:59] life 
 wasted  not  wasted  in  the  learning  sense 
 you  know  I  learned  things  about  myself
[77:05] but  wasted  in  like  the  goal  sense  of  you 
 know  getting  closer  to  the  things  that  I 
 I  want  out  of  life  six  months  of  my
[77:11] entire  life  wasted  because  I  was  putting 
 myself  into  an  environment  where  I
[77:16] didn't  do  best 
 because  I  didn't  have  the  realization
[77:22] that  you  might  be  getting  now 
 that  there's  an  environment  that  is 
 right  for  you
[77:28] now  for  me 
 it's  here  in  my  family's  home
[77:35] so  the  environment  that's  right  for  you 
 might  not  sound  as  cool  as  going 
 somewhere  else  across  the  world  and  move
[77:40] into  Dubai 
 because  mine  doesn't  it  doesn't  sound 
 very  cool  when  I  tell  you  yep  I  live  at
[77:45] home  with  my  family  and  it  almost  sounds 
 strange 
 when
[77:50] you  know  the  normal  I  mean  that's  a  side 
 topic  but  like  it's  it's  strange  to  like
[77:55] live  with  your  family  when  your  business 
 is  doing  very  very  well  and  you  can 
 afford  like  a  place  by  yourself  and  you
[78:01] know  people  find  that  it's  strange  in 
 some  ways 
 but  this  is  where  I'm  doing  best  this  is
[78:06] where  I  am  the  like  I  act  like  the  man 
 that  I  want  to  act
[78:11] this  is  where  the  environment  has  set  me 
 up  for  success  in  the  areas  that  I  care 
 about  so  why  change  that
[78:16] why  change  that  for  the  perceptions  of 
 other  people 
 so  I  ask  you  if  this  situations  and
[78:22] environments  that  you  keep  getting  into 
 where  you  don't  act  like  you  want  to
[78:28] where  your  traits  are  worse  or  poorer  or 
 weaker
[78:33] or  your  personality  is  you  know  much 
 more  reserved  maybe  insecure  then  why
[78:39] keep  putting  yourself  back  into  those 
 situations  you  need  to  find  your  hot 
 triggers  the  things  that  trigger  you
[78:44] into  letting  go  of  the  the  willpower
[78:49] and  start  to  consider  the  kind  of 
 environment  that  you  could  set  up  for 
 that  and  so  your  actionable  step  for
[78:55] this  part  of  the  video 
 it's  the  just  Journal  this  question 
 maybe  for  a  few  minutes  maybe  if  you
[79:00] want  you  can  write  it  as  a  comment  below 
 the  video  and  then  that  will  like  help 
 the  YouTube  algorithm  as  well  and  just
[79:05] answer  this  question  what  could  be  my 
 hot  triggers  how  could  I  set  up  an 
 environment  with  those  hot  triggers
[79:11] don't  bother  me  step  six  high  level 
 desires  this  is  the  part  of  the  full
[79:16] guide  which  I  think  might  save  you 
 Decades  of  your  life
[79:22] I'm  not  exaggerating  when  I  say  that 
 Decades  of  your  life  saved  because  high 
 level  desires  are  something  that  no
[79:28] one's  ever  spoke  to  you  about  will  say 
 the  low  level  desires  are  those  things 
 that  we've  been  talking  about  so  far
[79:33] it's  the  porn  it's  the  video  games  it's 
 the  sugar  the  things  that  we  all  know 
 are  wrong  for  us  the  high  level  desires
[79:38] are  the  things  that  seemingly  are 
 productive  and  yet  might  still  be  wrong 
 for  us
[79:44] overworking  too  much  ambition  how 
 different  is  the  depressed  millionaire
[79:49] who  needs  to  keep  working  working 
 working  working  from  the  fat  man  who 
 needs  to  keep  eating  eating  eating
[79:54] eating  they  both  have  this  incessant 
 desire  for  more  more  more  more  not  good 
 enough  unsatisfied  more  but  the
[80:01] depressed  millionaire  we  rank  so  highly 
 these  days  they're  both  as  soulless  as 
 each  other  they're  both  as  depressed  and
[80:08] unhappy  and  unhealthy  as  each  other  but 
 the  millionaire  we  will  regard  with  so
[80:13] much  Social  Status  these  days  the 
 millionaire  doesn't  want  to  be  alive
[80:18] only  with  everyone's  attention  to  his 
 ego  does  he  feel  anything  this  is  why
[80:25] these  guys  you  see  a  lot  as  like 
 influencers 
 more  attention  more  attention  more  money
[80:31] validation  please  please  please  please 
 please  you  might  think  that  I'm  going 
 crazy  at  what  I'm  getting  at  here
[80:36] I'm  saying  that  working  too  hard  making 
 money
[80:41] being  ambitious  setting  goals  might 
 actually  be  a  desire  that's  bad  for  you
[80:46] just  open  up  your  mind  to  this 
 realization  that  I've  had  okay  if  you 
 knew  that  the  next  level  of  your
[80:54] business  success  let's  say  you  know  it's 
 10  years  from  now  you're  happily  married 
 and  everything  and  you  knew  that  the 
 next  level  of  your  business  success  you
[81:00] pursuing  it  was  going  to  be  you  know 
 super  super  hard  work 
 that  you  would  literally  ruin  your
[81:05] family  that  you  would  literally  get 
 divorced  from  pursuing  the  next  level 
 because  of  how  much  harder  you  needed  to
[81:11] work  and  you  know  you  started  to  like 
 almost  resent  and  push  away  your  family 
 and  they  felt  so  withdrawn  from  you
[81:17] if  you  knew  that  Desiring  more  money  was 
 going  to  lead  you  to  getting  divorce  and
[81:22] being  unhappy  would  you  still  do  it 
 how  about  for  athletes  if  you  knew  that
[81:27] Desiring  to  win  that  upcoming  season  was 
 literally  going  to  get  you  divorced  and
[81:32] you  know  for  your  child  to  develop  like 
 this  weird  conditional  love  feeling  when
[81:37] now  they've  got  like  slight  trauma  for 
 the  rest  of  their  lives  and  they  don't 
 even  like  you  and  your  woman  wants  to 
 leave  you  if  you  knew  that  those  things
[81:43] were  gonna  happen 
 because  of  chasing  the  next  level  of 
 success  too  much  success  would  you  still
[81:49] Chase  it  I  don't  blame  you  for  not 
 wanting  to  listen  to  this  part  of  this 
 video  almost  it  seems  a  bit  crazy  at
[81:54] what  I'm  saying  because  everyone  online 
 every  influencer  that  you  see  these  days 
 has  gone  viral  it's  it's  so
[82:01] materialistic  so  like  everyone  just 
 wants  more  money  more  success  more  like 
 you  know  this  is  what  we're  covering  our
[82:06] soul  on  top  of  here  we  are  all  broken 
 inside  but  more  money  okay  you  know  we 
 can  go  get  the  car  and  the  watch  and  the
[82:11] fancy  subscribe  you  know  the  subscribers 
 the  likes  and  everything  this  is  all 
 what  we're  thinking  about  but  again  this
[82:17] is  like  a  low  level  of  ambition  you  know 
 why 
 because  constantly  Desiring  more  success
[82:22] and  more  money 
 it's  [ __ ]  normal 
 it's  mediocre  everyone  wants  this  right
[82:31] by  watching  a  full  guide  like  this  where 
 you're  studying  willpower  is  a  topic 
 you're  not  normal  you're  not  average  and
[82:39] yet  average  mediocre  people  including 
 those  which  who  seemingly  seem  very 
 successful  Rich  you  know  influencers  and
[82:46] everything  they're  all  here  they  just 
 want  more  success  more  success  more 
 success  they're  trapped  in  The  Matrix
[82:52] they're  trapped  in  The  Matrix  that  they 
 tell  you  that  they're  gonna  free  you 
 from  and  then  they  tell  you  to  make  more
[82:57] money  to  free  yourself  from  the  Matrix 
 as  if  making  money  wasn't  part  of  The 
 Matrix
[83:03] hmm 
 once  you  take  a  step  out  of  this  circle
[83:08] you  know  obviously  I'm  speaking  very 
 openly  now  of  the  kind  of  influences  who 
 are  in  the  men's  space  but  once  you  take
[83:14] a  step  out  and  you  like  detach  away  from 
 technology  I  can't  help  but  look  at  like 
 every  male  influencer  these  days  and
[83:20] think  of  how  pathetic  it  is  that  like 
 they're  all  at  level  one  they're  all 
 just  chasing  toys  fight  like  you  know
[83:26] fancy  cars  and  nice  handshakes  from  each 
 other  taking  pictures  in  shirts  and 
 thinking  Yep  this  is  the  life  you  know  I
[83:32] you  know  this  is  it  haha  just  more 
 materialistic  successes  if  that  was
[83:37] going  to  change  anything  now  we  need  to 
 integrate  more  of  our  soul  and 
 spirituality  into  our  lives  otherwise  we
[83:42] will  live  shallow  empty  lives  because 
 the  pursuit  for  more  success 
 makes  you  weak  greed  constantly  moves
[83:49] the  goal  post  the  goal  used  to  be  to 
 make  a  a  comfortable  living  then  it  went
[83:54] to  5K  a  month  then  it  went  to  10K  a 
 month  then  it's  at  100K  a  month  and  it's 
 still  not  enough  now  we  don't  need  to
[83:59] get  to  2  million  subscribers  in  three 
 and  four  and  five  when  does  it  stop 
 when  do  you  look  inwards  and  you  realize
[84:05] that  everything  that  you've  been  chasing 
 isn't  gonna  change  anything  because
[84:10] all  you  can  actually  change  with  your 
 life  is  in  the  internal  no  one  is  less
[84:15] free  than  these  businessmen  who  are  on 
 the  hedonic  treadmill  constantly  needing
[84:20] more  and  more  and  more 
 they  may  speak  about  Freedom  they  may
[84:25] tell  you  that  they  are  so  free 
 they're  not  they  have  to  be  in  Dubai  for
[84:30] six  months  a  year  and  they  don't  even 
 like  being  there  so  how  are  they  free 
 when  they're  literally  in  like  a  desert
[84:35] prison  which  they're  not  allowed  to 
 leave 
 they're  not  as  free  as  you  think  they
[84:41] are  their  lives  aren't  as  good  as  they 
 make  you  believe  it's  only  because 
 they're  trying  to  sell  you  their
[84:47] lifestyle  and  you  know  they've  got  a 
 nice  course  or  program  that  you  can  buy 
 to  have  the  nice  you  know  like  oh  I  look 
 at  me  I  I've  got  money  and  Status  I've
[84:53] got  a  shirt  and  look  here's  a  picture  of 
 me  and  a  girl  see  oh
[84:59] these  men  are  not  free 
 now  this  isn't  to  say  that  you  shouldn't
[85:05] make  money 
 that's  not  what  I'm  saying  it's  all  I 
 think  you  should  work  super  hard
[85:10] I  think  you  should  contribute  a  lot  to 
 the  marketing  to  help  people  and 
 naturally  the  market  will  pay  you  back
[85:17] for  that  and  you'll  make  a  lot  of  money 
 but  focusing  on  materialism
[85:23] focusing  on  on  these  like  high  level 
 desires  needing  to  make  more  money  more 
 validation  more  success
[85:31] that's  weakness 
 the  less  you  desire 
 the  stronger  you  become  this  book
[85:37] explains  the  way  that 
 we  could  live  our  lives
[85:47] this  is  a  complete  guide  to  masculinity
[85:53] and  inside  of  this  book  you  hear  about 
 the  concept  of  purpose  that  often  is 
 spoke  about  a  lot  these  days  a  lot  of
[85:59] our  influencers  are  talking  about  you 
 know  purpose  purpose  purpose  if  they're 
 not  spiritual  they  don't  understand  what 
 purpose  is
[86:05] your  purpose  is  your  Soul's  reason  for 
 being  on  this  Earth
[86:11] it  is  the  core  desire  that  you  have  so 
 imagine  inside  of  you  deep  inside  of  you
[86:16] there  is  a  core  desire  something  that 
 you  want  to  fulfill  to  be  able  to  live
[86:21] like  the  most  magical  best  life  possible 
 only  you  don't  actually  know  what  that
[86:28] core  desire  is  if  you  think  you  do 
 you're  probably  delusional  you  don't 
 know  what  it  is 
 we're  not  at  that  stage  just  yet
[86:35] so  we  don't  know  what  the  core  desire  is 
 but  we  generally  need  to  know  we  need  to 
 fulfill  this  core  desire  to  feel  like
[86:40] we're  living  right  in  our  lives  the 
 reason  why  is  because  all  the  desires 
 get  placed  on  top  of  you  you  are  born
[86:47] with  this  core  desire  and  then  your 
 parents  look  at  you  and  say  oh  I  really 
 hope  you  get  good  grades  in  school 
 really  hope  you  get  a  high  status  job
[86:53] that  makes  me  feel  good 
 because  I  worked  a  shitty  job  and  so  my
[86:58] son  you  will  work  a  high  status  job  so  I 
 can  live  vicariously  through  you  here  is
[87:03] a  desire  to  put  over  your  core  desire 
 then  your  teachers  has  more  desires  than 
 the  news  than  the  TV  shows  has  more
[87:09] desires  has  more  desires  put  that  over 
 your  your  one  that  you  were  meant  to 
 fulfill
[87:14] by  the  time  you're  10  years  old  you've 
 got  hundreds  of  desires  these  concentric
[87:19] circles  yours  is  right  in  the  middle 
 right  there  at  the  core  but  there's
[87:25] hundreds  that  have  been  placed  on  top  of 
 you  gotta  act  like  this  gotta  be  friends 
 with  this  guy  need  that  shirt  need  that
[87:30] like  earphone  thing  that  everyone  else 
 has  got  high  status  parents  want  you  to
[87:35] act  like  this  need  the  grades 
 of  the  movie
[87:40] more  desires  more  desires  more  desires 
 and  then  you  wake  up 
 then  you're  like  yeah  you  know  like
[87:45] watching  these  guys  on  YouTube's  really 
 good  you  know  watching  the  influencers 
 okay  men's  issues  yeah  yeah  yeah  I  feel
[87:51] free  now 
 and  the  people  who  you  think  are  helping
[87:56] you  right  now  probably  including  me 
 all  of  these  male  influences  they're
[88:01] putting  more  desires  onto  you 
 well  you  should  be  making  this  much 
 money  a  month  and  you  know  this  is  a
[88:06] Better  Business  the  top  seven  ways  to 
 make  money  online  the  top  three  ways  to 
 make  ten  thousand  a  month  they're  just
[88:11] putting  more  desires  more  desires  more 
 desires 
 so  you've  got  hundreds  of  desires  over
[88:17] your  core  heart  desire  right  now 
 this  is  why  I  don't  even  go  to  the  gym
[88:22] anymore 
 because  I  was  in  the  gym  one  day
[88:27] you  know  feeling  kind  of  like  purposeful 
 I'm  journaling  and  everything  and  then  I 
 go  up  I'm  on  the  assault  bike
[88:33] and  a  guy  walks  past 
 and  he's  bigger  than  me
[88:38] he's  more  muscular  than  me 
 he's  got  more  veins  than  I  do
[88:44] and  instantly  my  brain  and  my  heart 
 started  to  form  a  new  desire  maybe  I 
 should  bulk  and  make  more  muscle
[88:50] or  maybe  I  should  get  back  into  martial 
 arts  because  in  cases  me  and  this  guy 
 had  a  fight  then  I'd  be  able  to  whoop
[88:56] his  ass  and  I  start  actually  daydreaming 
 this  and  adding  it  to  like  my  perception 
 of  my  goals  the  direction  I  should  go  to
[89:01] in  life  it  takes  me  like  minutes  to 
 realize  wait
[89:06] I  just  set  like  a  plan  for  the  rest  of 
 my  life 
 you  have  to  take  martial  out  so
[89:11] seriously 
 based  on  some  guy  just  walking  past  me
[89:16] who  had  biceps  extra  centimeter  bigger 
 than  mine 
 and  then  I'm  looking  around  at  the
[89:22] entire  gym  thinking  about  how  many 
 random  desires  goals  get  formed  inside
[89:27] of  me  just  because  of  what  I'm  seeing  in 
 this  environment
[89:32] and  then  I  go  on  YouTube  and  it's  the 
 exact  same  thing  there  maybe  I  should
[89:37] move  to  Dubai  maybe  I  should  make  more 
 money  maybe  it's  this  business  model 
 maybe  it's  this  one  if  this  one  is  this
[89:42] one  it's  this  one 
 and  before  you  know  it  you've  got  so 
 many  desires  over  the  thing  that  you
[89:48] were  genuinely  supposed  to  do  in  life 
 you  have  a  core  desire  and  it  is  your
[89:54] duty  as  a  man  that  is  your  purpose 
 that's  that's  your  duty  as  a  man  to  try 
 and  fulfill  that  and  that  should  give
[89:59] you  apparently  like  the  greatest  life 
 that  you  could  have  as  a  man  that's  what
[90:04] every  spiritual  teacher  that  I  read 
 seems  to  say 
 but  these  days  purpose  when  you  hear
[90:10] about  it  online  but  that  word  purpose 
 has  been  bastardized  by  these  male  role
[90:15] models  including  myself  for  so  long 
 to  just  kind  of  mean  like  yeah  just  just
[90:20] work  hard  and  just  you  know  work  on  the 
 kind  of  business  that  I  recommend  you  to 
 do  do  you  see  why  what  we're  talking
[90:25] about  might  save  you  Decades  of  your 
 life  your  life  is  only  worthwhile  if
[90:30] you're  fulfilling  this  core  purpose  this 
 the  core  desire  inside  of  you  but
[90:35] there's  hundreds  maybe  even  thousands  of 
 extra  desires  put  on  top  of  that  which
[90:40] are  happening  because  of  like  the 
 external  influences  you  go  on  to 
 Instagram  and  Mike  thurston's  there  and
[90:46] he's  got  the  best  physique  in  the  entire 
 [ __ ]  world  you're  like  how  the  [ __ ] 
 can  I  compete  with  this  guy  bro 
 oh  maybe  I  should  do  it  his  quads  look
[90:52] really  big  maybe  I  should  do  some  leg 
 extensions  maybe  I  should  open  my  own 
 modeling  company  because  he's  he's  next
[90:57] to  some  high  level  people  right  now  and 
 before  you  know  it  there's  more  desires 
 more  desires  more  desires
[91:03] those  extra  desires  weren't  the  things 
 that  you  were  supposed  to  do  with  your 
 life  and  yet  you  will  pursue  them
[91:09] because  of  this  like  monkey  see  monkey 
 do  monkey  needs  status  life  that  we  live 
 in  these  days  so  imagine  spending  your
[91:15] life  your  valuable  time  chasing  and 
 fulfilling  desires
[91:20] that  someone  else  put  on  to  you  that 
 came  onto  you  in  such  stupid  ways  that
[91:26] there  was  a  guy  who  was  bigger  than  you 
 in  the  gym  and  he  walked  past  you  you 
 felt  insecure  and  you  felt  like  yep  I
[91:31] you  know  I'm  gonna  dedicate  myself  to  a 
 martial  art  then  just  in  case  as  if  he 
 said  anything  to  me  here  you  are  four
[91:37] years  later  you  know  you've  had  a  pretty 
 good  life  training  this  this  skill  fair 
 enough 
 but  that  wasn't  the  thing  that  you  were
[91:42] meant  to  do  that  wasn't  actually  totally 
 a  line  to  you  now  this  isn't  to  say 
 don't  do  martial  arts  because  it  might
[91:48] actually  be  the  the  core  real  desire 
 but  this  is  to  say  that  we  shouldn't  be 
 spending  our  life  in  our  time
[91:55] fulfilling  other  people's  desires 
 rather  we  should  look  inwards  and  figure
[92:00] out  like  what  is  authentic  to  us  and 
 Achieve  that
[92:06] that's  why  I've  included  this  section  in 
 this  willpower  guide  because  we  need  to 
 use  willpower  to  push  off  not  just  the
[92:13] low  level  desires  not  just  the  desire 
 for  video  games  and  for  porn  but  the
[92:18] seemingly  productive  desires  are  harder 
 to  restrain  from  the  seemingly 
 productive  desire  where  like  you  see  a
[92:24] tape  podcast  and  he's  talking  about 
 making  money  in  this  business  model 
 that's  forming  a  desire  in  your  heart
[92:29] which  wasn't  there  which  wasn't  supposed 
 to  be  there  that's  the  kind  of  Desire 
 that  you  need  to  strip  away  and  say  to
[92:36] yourself  that  didn't  form  from  my  own 
 hearts  or  my  own  mind  that  formed  from 
 social  media
[92:42] if  it  comes  from  social  media  it's 
 probably  not  a  good  thing 
 and  again  I'm  super  guilty  of  this
[92:48] because  not  only  have  I  you  know  this 
 happens  to  me  I  feel  the  desires  but 
 I've  put  these  desires  onto  you  with
[92:53] over  800  videos  where  I've  told  you  okay 
 be  like  this  act  like  this  do  this  thing 
 do  this  business  model  text  your  girl
[92:58] like  this  I've  put  all  these  extra 
 desires  onto  you 
 thinking  that  I've  been  helping  you  all
[93:04] this  time  and  rather  maybe  I've  been 
 wasting  your  life  that's  why  I've  been 
 making  these  full  guides  on  deeper  more
[93:10] mature  topics  rather  than  those  like 
 surface  level  top  seven  ways  to  message 
 girls  type  of  videos  which  they  get  a
[93:17] lot  of  views  those  videos  you  see  every 
 YouTuber  every  influencer  play  this  game
[93:22] where  they're  just  trying  to  get  as  many 
 views  as  possible  for  their  benefit  not 
 for  yours  and  so  every  [ __ ]  YouTuber
[93:27] is  making  these  top  seven  business 
 models  to  get  to  ten  thousand  dollars  a 
 month  is  [ __ ]  pathetic
[93:33] because  those  videos  they're  making  it 
 for  their  own  money  they  don't  give  a 
 [ __ ]  about  you  even  when  you're  watching
[93:38] it  with  full  intent  you're  not  learning 
 anything  real  from  these  [ __ ]  videos 
 these  listicles  these  random  little
[93:44] shallow  videos  but  worse  than  that  not 
 even  just  wasting  20  minutes  of  your 
 life  that's  bad  enough  but  like  worse
[93:50] than  that  is  like  that  this  influences 
 putting  on  desires  onto  you  you  should 
 live  like  this  you  should  be  like  this
[93:56] you  should  do  this  this  is  the  business 
 model  this  is  the  way  to  act
[94:02] when  they  don't  know  what  your  core 
 desire  is 
 worst  of  all  you  don't  even  know  what
[94:09] your  core  desire  is 
 perhaps  at  this  age  we  should  know  like 
 the  trajectory  ahead  and  actually  think
[94:15] to  ourselves  this  is  what  I  was 
 genuinely  born  to  do 
 but  we  can't  do  that  because  I  think
[94:22] there's  genuinely  thousands  of  desires 
 of  like  you  know  things  that  we  need  of
[94:28] We  crave  that  the  modern  world  has  told 
 us  that  it's  it's  needed  and  so  we  want
[94:33] a  nice  watch  we  want  that  oh  you  know 
 hamster  is  like  the  jumper  looks  good 
 hamster  where  did  you  get  that  little 
 necklace  from  Hamza  oh  you  know  oh  is
[94:39] that  the  whooping  did  you  use  the  whoop 
 or  the  the  aura  ring  and  before  you  know 
 it  here's  another  thing  that  you  need  to
[94:45] go  and  buy  here's  another  thing  you  know 
 that's  increasing  your  monthly  expenses 
 now  you  need  to  go  spend  your  time  like
[94:50] you  know  trading  time  for  money  wasting 
 part  of  your  life  just  to  afford  the 
 expenses  that  you  didn't  actually  need
[94:55] but  that  you  believe  that  you  do 
 when  really  like  you  should  be  doing 
 something  so  simple
[95:03] that  would  give  you  the  greatest  life 
 quality  that  there  is  which  is  pursuing
[95:08] your  purpose  how  do  you  find  your  core 
 desire  like  a  purpose  the  thing  you 
 should  be  doing
[95:14] first  of  all  you  need  to  limit  input  you 
 need  to  limit  the  things  all  of  this
[95:21] conditioning  that's  going  inside  of  your 
 brain  and  your  heart 
 means  no  TV  it  means  no  useless  garbage
[95:28] content  it  means  no  more  tape  podcasts 
 it  means  no  more  top  seven  ways  to  make
[95:33] money  online  type  of  videos 
 perhaps  it  means  not  watching  my  videos
[95:38] and  certainly  I  would  agree  with  you  for 
 most  of  the  videos  I've  ever  made  I  hope 
 that  the  new  videos  that  I'm  making
[95:43] would  actually  be  the  exception  because 
 they're  teaching  you  more  like  skills 
 and  mindsets  which  would  actually  use
[95:48] for  the  core  desire  for  example  the  this 
 video  and  the  previous  one  the
[95:53] discipline  full  guide  they'll  actually 
 help  you  find  your  authentic  self  and  to 
 fulfill  that  authentic  self
[96:00] but  I  promise  you 
 you  know  how  strange  this  is  I'm  a
[96:05] YouTuber 
 I  don't  watch  any  YouTube
[96:12] I  don't  watch  YouTube  videos 
 because  it's  garbage
[96:19] in  fact  you  know  what's  so  strange 
 for  a  lot  of  the  people  who  watch  my
[96:25] videos  and  who  are  coming  here  for 
 self-improvements  their  biggest  lever  of
[96:30] self-improvement  would  literally  be  to 
 stop  consuming  content
[96:37] think  about  how  crazy  that  is  my  entire 
 brand  my  entire  business  is  built  on  the 
 thing  that  you're  addicted  to
[96:43] I  do  believe  that  I've  been  able  to  have 
 more  of  a  positive  impact  on  the  world 
 than  a  negative  because  I  as  a  YouTuber
[96:49] don't  even  watch  YouTube  I  get  all  of  my 
 knowledge 
 from  books
[96:54] from  mentors  like  teachers 
 and  from  some  podcasts  long  unedited
[97:00] podcasts  Andrew  huberman  and  Alex  hamosi 
 Chris  Williamson  Ali  abdall  intelligent
[97:06] people  just  like  sort  of  brainwashing  me 
 for  an  hour  or  two  brainwashing  in  like 
 a  good  way  for  like  an  hour  or  two
[97:11] putting  their  words  and  thoughts  into 
 mine  amazing 
 but  you  go  and  watch  these  basic
[97:17] self-improvement  videos  top  seven  ways 
 to  text  girls  that's  not  helping  you  at 
 all  it  might  seem  like  it  is  because
[97:22] you're  texting  this  random  degenerate 
 girl  slightly  better 
 but  that  like  destroyed  the  the  desire
[97:29] to  improve  text  in  this  random 
 degenerate  girl  anyway 
 and  just  skip  that  whole  step  of  your
[97:35] life 
 you  must  understand  this 
 you'll  pursue  as  a  man  it's  not  about
[97:41] fulfilling  every  desire  that  pops  up 
 okay  so  Tate  says  money  is  really 
 important  maybe  I  should  buy  that  watch
[97:46] maybe  I  should  do  this  maybe  I  should  do 
 that  it's  not  about  fulfilling  every 
 desire  because  that's  slow  and
[97:51] inefficient  the  faster  way 
 is  to  destroy  the  desires  to  desire  less
[97:57] to  strip  us  away  as  many  as  possible  so 
 every  time  you  find  yourself  wanting 
 something  whether  it's  something  small
[98:03] the  low  level  desire  the  sugar  or 
 something  high  like  you  want  to  get  the 
 car  or  something  to  keep  stripping  away
[98:08] as  many  desires  as  possible  till  you  get 
 to  one  where  you're  like  you  know  what 
 I  actually  don't  think  I  should  strip
[98:13] this  one  away  I  actually  think  I  should 
 fulfill  this  one  maybe  your  desire  you 
 know  through  the  last  hour  has  been  like
[98:18] yeah  you  know  what  willpower  seems  like 
 a  really  important  skill  that's 
 something  I'm  Desiring  maybe  you're
[98:23] thinking  like  yeah  I'll  scrutinize  it 
 but  I  can  imagine  willpower  like  this 
 skill  actually  helping  me  for  the  rest
[98:28] of  my  life  I'll  desire  this  and  I'll 
 look  more  into  this  hamza's  mentioned 
 which  book  it  is  okay  I'll  go  read  that
[98:34] but  then  when  you  see  like  the  the  guy 
 on  Instagram  who's  got  a  the  better 
 watch  or  he's  got  a  slightly  better 
 six-pack  than  you
[98:40] and  you  think  to  yourself  yeah  you  know 
 like  I  would  get  some  kind  of  benefits 
 more  girls  would  like  me  my  status  would
[98:45] go  up  that's  kind  of  nice  but  is  that 
 really  what  I  was  born  to  do 
 is  that  really  genuinely  gonna  like  like
[98:52] be  the  best  thing  that  I  could  spend  my 
 time  doing 
 to  try  and  take  a  picture  as  good  as  one
[98:57] of  these  Fitness  influences  probably  not
[99:02] you  limit  inputs 
 you  limit  like  these  people  talking  into
[99:07] your  brain  especially  if  they're  quite 
 unintelligent  like  nobody's  or  that  you 
 know  they're  not  there  for  your  best
[99:12] intentions 
 if  you've  found  that  you've  followed
[99:17] someone's  advice  and  listened  to  their 
 content  but  it  hasn't  really  helped  you 
 or  in  fact  it's  made  your  life  like  very
[99:22] much  worse  and  it's  been  a  distraction 
 and  a  waste  of  time 
 stop  consuming  it  if  you  found  genuine
[99:29] real  improvements  to  your  life 
 continue  that's  a  wise  teacher  that
[99:34] you've  got  stay  vigilant  for  when  you 
 catch  yourself  wanting  something 
 Desiring  something  setting  a  goal  and
[99:41] scrutinize  that  goal  and  really  ask 
 yourself  why  do  you  genuinely  want  to 
 you  might  find  that  the  desire  that  you
[99:47] have  is  actually  authentic  and  it  makes 
 a  lot  of  sense  like  for  example  you 
 might  say  one  of  my  goals  is  to  make  a
[99:52] thousand  dollars  a  month  in  business  why 
 do  I  want  it  because  right  now  I've  got
[99:57] absolutely  no  money  and  I  can't  even 
 afford  like  the  bills  that  I  have  one  of 
 my  goals  is  to  make  five  thousand 
 dollars  a  month  in  business  why  do  I
[100:03] want  that  because  if  I  could  give  a 
 thousand  or  two  thousand  a  month  to  my
[100:08] family  that  would  genuinely  Save  Our 
 Lives  awesome
[100:13] but  ask  yourself  where  that  desire  came 
 from  because  when  you  find  yourself 
 wanting  a  particular  car  particular
[100:18] lifestyle 
 and  if  you're  honest  with  yourself  and 
 you  say  okay  where  did  this  desire  come
[100:23] from  from  something  I  saw  on  social 
 media 
 probably  not  a  good  idea  to  go  dedicate
[100:29] your  life  to  fulfilling  that  desire 
 because  it's  not  going  to  do  anything 
 other  than  just  take  time  away  from  you
[100:34] living  out  your  actual  purpose  that  you 
 were  supposed  to  do  using  the  skill  of 
 willpower  which  we've  discussed  in  this
[100:40] full  guide  on  these  high  level  desires 
 will  save  you  Decades  of  your  life
[100:46] because  imagine  the  life  of  a  normal 
 person  born  as  a  baby  and  shirt  away 
 desires  put  onto  the  baby  be  like  this
[100:52] you're  such  a  good  boy  when  you  do  this 
 when  you  sit  in  behave  you're  such  a
[100:57] good  boy  has  a  desire  onto  you  parents 
 are  telling  them  how  to  act  he  watches 
 these  little  children's  cartoon  shows
[101:03] then  eventually  he's  watching  like  TV 
 shows  and  you  know  the  teachers  putting 
 a  desires  okay  good  grades  grades  doing
[101:09] well  in  school  becomes  this  this  high 
 level  desire  for  the  next
[101:14] 12  years  of  his  life  he  wasn't  born  to 
 think  to  himself  yep  need  to  get  good
[101:19] grades  it  was  placed  onto  him  by  other 
 people 
 honestly  not  very  intelligent  people
[101:26] and  so  he  spends  12  15  years  of  his  life 
 in  an  education  system  that  doesn't 
 actually  prepare  him  for  life
[101:33] to  pursue  the  desire  of  someone  else 
 who's  put  it  onto  him
[101:38] you  know  parents  are  telling  him  yeah 
 here's  an  extra  desire  have  a  high 
 status  job  he's  trying  to  fulfill  all 
 that  he's  just  wasting  his  life  now  he's
[101:44] 30  years  old  now  he's  Desiring  the  car 
 that  one  of  his  co-workers  has  got  he's 
 35  years  old  and  the  other  female
[101:50] co-worker  he's  Desiring  her  maybe  he'll 
 cheat  on  his  wife  soon 
 doesn't  get  laid  for  the  next  you  know
[101:56] years  and  years  and  years  eventually  the 
 desire  gets  fulfilled  he's  41  he  ends  up 
 getting  a  divorce
[102:02] he  desires  a  lot  of  alcohol 
 he  desires  seeing  his  children  but  he's
[102:08] not  allowed  to  see  them  anymore 
 he  desires  killing  himself
[102:16] and  he  does  it
[102:26] the  things  you  desire  will  shape  your 
 life 
 just  be  careful  what  it  is  that  you're
[102:32] pursuing  this  is  the  most  important 
 actionable  step  that  I've  ever  given  out
[102:37] and  perhaps  that  I  ever  will 
 think  about  the  high  level  things  that
[102:44] you  desire 
 scrutinize  every  single  thing  that  you
[102:49] desire 
 and  just  ask  yourself  where  did  it  come 
 from
[102:54] ask  yourself  if  it's  truly  authentic  to 
 you  as  a  quick  final  tip  for  this 
 section  if  you're  super  interested  in
[102:59] everything  that  we've  just  spoke  about 
 I  have  a  full  guide  to  discovering  your
[103:04] purpose  your  core  desire  that  is  um 
 that's  on  my  channel  you  can  go  find  it
[103:09] but  what  I  will  say  is  I  made  that  about 
 six  months  ago  so  my  understanding  has 
 changed  which  is  how  you  want  tip  here
[103:15] I  believe  that  your  core  desire  in  life 
 will  be  linked  to  the  things  that  put
[103:20] you  into  a  flow  state 
 by  now  when  you're  watching  this  video 
 my  flow  State  full  guide  will  already  be
[103:27] released  flow  state  is  kind  of  like  this 
 moment  of  intense  focus  when  you're 
 doing  a  specific  task  that  for  some
[103:33] reason  puts  you  not  other  people  but  you 
 into  this  like  super  focused  mode  where
[103:38] you  have  no  thoughts  for  me  it's 
 speaking  every  single  time  that  I've 
 done  kind  of  like  a  speaking  like  task
[103:44] like  this  I  have  no  thoughts  in  my  mind 
 and  it's  inherently  like  pleasurable  to
[103:49] be  here 
 I  believe  that  your  core  desire  in  life 
 is  probably  related  to  the  thing  that
[103:55] gets  you  into  a  flow  State  and  so  that's 
 something  you  can  consider  my  flow 
 stateful  guide  you  can  go  and  watch  that
[104:01] you  can  discover  what  things  put  you 
 into  a  flow  State  and  how  to  be  more 
 likely  to  achieve  this  Flow  State  and
[104:08] produce  your  best  work  and  discover 
 yourself  one  last  point  about  this 
 section  of  high  level  desires  I  am  not
[104:14] saying  that  you  shouldn't  desire  things 
 like  money  your  work  or  success  or
[104:19] accomplishments  but  rather  those  things 
 like  let's  say  the  money  the  validation 
 the  the  YouTube  subscribers  these  things
[104:25] should  be  a  nice  reward  when  you're 
 actually  Desiring  the  right  thing  when 
 you  desire  the  wrong  thing  which  is  like
[104:31] you  know  Instagram  validation  YouTube 
 subscribers  even  money 
 you're  you're  off  center  you  know  you're
[104:37] not  you're  not  living  out  your  life  as 
 you're  supposed  to  but  for  example 
 if  you  desire  the  right  thing  which
[104:42] could  be  could  be  contribute  into 
 Humanity 
 for  me  for  example  think  about  think
[104:47] about  it  like  my  right  thing  is  like  I 
 love  to  speak  this  feels  totally  right
[104:52] for  me  this  is  like  a  core  desire  to 
 just  speak  out  and  explain  things  in  my 
 mind
[104:57] and  the  result  of  that  has  been 
 incredible  levels  of  of  money  of  wealth
[105:03] of  status  of  validation  so  that's  also 
 maybe  that's  the  better  way  that  we 
 pursue  our  work  and  our  goals  we  set  the
[105:10] goal  for  actually  the  task  that  we 
 desire  so  so  much 
 and  the  rewards  that  come  along  with  it
[105:16] is  just  extra  bonuses  this  way  you're 
 pursuing  the  thing  that  you  should 
 pursue  and  you're  super  happy  to  get  any
[105:22] level  of  reward  as  an  extra  rather  than 
 the  immature  people  who  were  pursuing
[105:27] just  the  reward  and  they  don't  even  like 
 the  task  that  they  are  doing  and  they
[105:32] don't  even  realize  that  the  reward 
 they're  Desiring  was  put  onto  them  it 
 wasn't  even  an  authentic  desire  anyway
[105:37] money  isn't  a  bad  thing 
 but  if  you're  trading  your  life  and  your
[105:42] purpose  if  you're  sacrificing  your 
 purpose  for  it  of  course  it  is  and  I 
 think  this  is  where  unfortunately  most
[105:48] young  men  including  like  the  influencers 
 the  leaders  of  young  men  I  think  they're
[105:53] in  the  states  where  they're  literally 
 sacrificing  purpose  for  money  and 
 validation  and  status  and  I  think  hordes
[105:59] of  young  men  are  looking  up  at  that 
 thinking  that  that's  the  right  way  to 
 live 
 start  with  purpose  start  with  your  why
[106:05] start  with  your  core  desire  and  then 
 enjoy  any  level  of  success  that  comes
[106:10] along  with  that  because  when  you  are 
 chasing  your  purpose  and  you're  working 
 super  hard  on  this  core  desire  you  know
[106:16] let's  say  the  core  desire  could  be  for 
 you  martial  arts  Muay  Thai  or  something 
 and  you  really  get  really  really  good  at
[106:22] it  well  then  you're  going  to  make  some 
 money  in  validation  from  it  courtesy  for 
 me  was  speaking  and  I  just  did  that  in  a
[106:27] high  leverage  format  of  YouTube  videos 
 and  so  it  made  like  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  money
[106:32] extra 
 but  I  wouldn't  be  happy  with  this 
 subscribers  and  money  if  I  wasn't
[106:38] fulfilling  my  core  desire  if  I  was 
 sacrificing  my  purpose  I'd  be  depressed 
 this  in  my  opinion
[106:43] is  the  higher  level  of  ambition  every 
 other  person  is  there  just  thinking  yep
[106:48] I  just  wanna  you  know  just  make  the 
 money  and  you  know  oh  yeah  be  on  your 
 purpose  guys  you  want  to  be  saying  the 
 word  but  they  don't  understand  it  make
[106:53] money  you  know  money  is  super  important 
 sure  sure 
 but  we're  more  ambitious  than  these
[106:59] people  that  you  see  online  even  though 
 they  seem  ambitious  we're  up  here
[107:04] let's  fulfill  our  purpose  our  core 
 desire  but  let's  also  get  the  external 
 material  Success  With  It
[107:11] I'm  not  sacrificing  my  purpose  for  money 
 like  most  people  are  doing  these  days  I
[107:16] want  both 
 start  with  purpose  start  with  your  real
[107:21] core  desire  the  way  you  find  that  is  by 
 limiting  input
[107:26] stare  at  your  wall  turn  everything  off 
 and  stare  at  your  wall  I'm  I'm  actually 
 speaking  literally  when  I  say  that  turn
[107:32] everything  off  and  stare  at  your  wall 
 perhaps  you  won't  do  this  practice  for
[107:37] the  next  six  months  when  I  keep 
 mentioning  it  perhaps  you'll  do  it  today 
 maybe  after  watching  this  video  if  you
[107:43] spend  some  time  staring  at  your  wall 
 with  no  distractions 
 and  you  limit  inputs  you  will  begin  to
[107:50] discover  who  you  are  and  you'll  realize 
 that  your  views  and  values  are  starting 
 to  differentiate  away  from  the
[107:57] influences  that  you've  been  watching 
 every  single  day 
 that's  a  good  thing  step  seven  a  quick
[108:02] 30  boost  in  willpower  I  found  this 
 experiment  so  interesting  so  I  wanted  to
[108:07] share  it  with  you  imagine  participants 
 are  put  into  a  brain  scanner 
 normal  people  are  asked  to  think  about
[108:14] their  future  self 
 and  their  brain  lights  up  as  if  they're
[108:19] thinking  about  a  stranger 
 people  on  self-improvement  people  who
[108:25] have  got  good  willpower  are  put  in  the 
 same  brain  scanner  and  they're  asked  to 
 think  about  their  future  selves  and  the
[108:31] part  of  their  brain  that  Lit  Up 
 shows  that  they're  actually  thinking 
 about  themselves  people  who  aren't  on
[108:36] self-improvements  can't  even  comprehend 
 that  their  future  self  is  them
[108:42] when  you  start  to  delay  gratification 
 everything  we  do  in  self-improvement  is 
 literally  just  delaying  gratification 
 for  our  future  self  that's  literally
[108:48] just  self-improvement  is  literally  just 
 like  making  life  better  for  your  future 
 self  you  start  to  like  integrate  and
[108:54] realize  that  you're  still  gonna  be  alive 
 and  you're  going  to  be  looking  back  and 
 hoping  that  you're  doing  the  right 
 things
[109:00] like  right  here  right  now  do  you  look 
 back  to  your  younger  self  and  kind  of 
 feel  like  yeah  you  did  kind  of  nice  in 
 that  thing  but  I  kind  of  wish  you  did
[109:06] some  more  good  things  maybe  you're 
 thinking  back  to  your  younger  self 
 thinking  I  wish  you  studied  harder  I
[109:11] wish  you  train  in  the  gym  more  I  wish 
 you  started  in  the  gym  early  I  wish  you 
 started  a  business  and  self-improvement
[109:16] and  productivity  when  you  were  younger 
 you  know  most  people  live  their  entire
[109:21] lives  like  that 
 most  people  in  my  opinion 
 are  rightly  so  and  they  deserve  to  be
[109:29] depressed  and  unhappy 
 because  they're  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  to
[109:35] their  future  selves 
 most  people  are  literally  cruel  to  their
[109:40] future  selves  they  know  that  if  they  do 
 something  bad  today  their  future  self
[109:45] tomorrow  or  a  week  or  a  month  from  now 
 is  gonna  dislike  it  and  they'll  keep 
 doing  it  they'll  keep  eating  the  junk
[109:51] food  playing  the  video  games  watching 
 porn  fapping  not  studying  not  working 
 hard  knowing  that  they're  literally
[109:57] hurting  their  future  self  and  then 
 surprised  when  it's  months  later  they're 
 taking  antidepressants  thinking  like
[110:02] yeah  but  you  know  you're  like  yeah  but 
 just  you  know  like  oh  but  you  being  mean 
 Hamza
[110:08] just  being  nice  to  your  future  self  and 
 you'll  live  a  good  life  because  you're 
 going  to  become  your  future  self  soon
[110:13] and  there  was  another  study  which  was 
 very  interesting  and  I've  set  it  up  on 
 my  own  phone  on  my  lock  screen
[110:20] can  you  recognize  who  this  is
[110:30] this  is  future  me 
 this  is  me  when  I'm  old  I  just  use  like 
 some  um  some  app  and  just  put  it  as  like
[110:37] old  age 
 the  idea  is
[110:42] if  you  keep  in  mind  your  future  self  you 
 will  be  30  more  likely  to  delay
[110:48] gratification  so  this  was  the  study  they 
 brought  in  participants  and  told  them 
 about  investing  for  their  future  you
[110:54] know  investing  money  so  they  could 
 retire  later  and  they  kind  of  asked  like 
 with  a  slider  to  you  know  okay  where  on
[111:00] the  slider  how  much  money  do  you  want 
 now  or  how  much  money  do  you  want  to 
 invest  for  your  future  self  one  group  of
[111:05] participants  are  shown  this  slider  and 
 it  just  shows  a  picture  of  them  as  they
[111:10] are  right  now 
 the  other  group  of  participants  are 
 showing  the  same  slider  but  it  shows  a
[111:16] picture  like  a  Photoshop  picture  of  them 
 looking  old  and  they  just  ask  how  much 
 money  do  you  want  to  save  for  retirement
[111:21] just  simple  as  that 
 and  what  do  you  think  would  happen  when 
 you  see  your  future  self  or  when  you
[111:27] think  about  your  future  self  you're 
 going  to  be  more  likely  to  delay 
 gratification  by  30  percent
[111:33] 30  increase  in  willpower  and  your 
 ability  to  delay  gratification  so  this 
 is  such  an  easy  actionable  step  like  a
[111:40] proactive  thing  that  you  can  start  doing 
 keep  your  future  self  in  mind  now  you 
 might  be  wondering  okay  what's  the  app  I
[111:46] just  searched  old  on  App  Store  I 
 actually  don't  think  you  need  a  picture 
 as  your  lock  screen  or  anything  I  like
[111:51] to  be  a  little  bit  obsessive  but  what 
 you  really  just  need  to  do  is  just  think 
 about  your  future  self  just  let's  do
[111:56] this  together  close  your  eyes 
 and  just  see  your  future  self  living  the
[112:02] kind  of  life  that  you  think  would  be 
 good  for  him  see  him  in  fantastic  shape 
 see  him  and  like  he  looks  so  like  aware
[112:10] and  and  free  in  his  body 
 what  are  the  things  that  he's  doing
[112:18] what  is  he  most  proud  and  grateful  of 
 you  doing  today
[112:24] what  are  the  actions  that  you  could  do 
 today  this  week  this  month  that  would 
 benefit  him  the  most
[112:31] open  your  eyes 
 this  is  the  better  way  to  live  it's  to
[112:37] keep  your  future  self  in  mind  and  to 
 constantly  make  their  life  better  most
[112:42] people  do  the  exact  opposite  they  try 
 they  over  indulge  in  pleasure  and  little 
 happiness  feeling  warm  feelings  today
[112:49] they  eat  the  cookie  the  junk  food  they 
 watch  the  porn  they  you  know  um  they 
 take  the  drugs  they  go  out  they  stay  up
[112:55] late  and  everything  to  try  and  maximize 
 happiness  and  pleasure  today
[113:00] but  then  before  they  know  it  they  become 
 their  future  selves  looking  back  at  them 
 thinking  like  why  didn't  you  just  like
[113:05] go  to  bed  on  time  now  I'm  waking  up 
 sleep  deprived
[113:11] it's  hard  not  to  like  yourself  when 
 you've  been  dedicating  your  actions  for
[113:16] your  future  self  and  then  you  become 
 your  future  self  you're  far  more  likely 
 to  become  a  man  of  character  of  good
[113:22] virtues  and  values  and  morals  if  you 
 think  about  your  future  self  rather  than
[113:27] today's  greed  so  this  is  your  actionable 
 step  which  you  can  actually  do  every  day 
 think  about  your  future  self  in  any  way
[113:33] that  you  want  you  can  visualize  him  you 
 can  even  do  like  coaching  or  journaling
[113:38] with  your  future  self  and  you  don't  have 
 a  name  for  him  wise  Grandpa  Hamza  and 
 it's  like  you  write  one  sentence  each
[113:43] Alexa  Mosey  says  he  does  this  you  write 
 one  sentence  as  you  you're  asking  like 
 your  future  self  for  advice  and  you  can
[113:48] just  reply  back  as  if  you  are  him  just 
 pretend  you  are  and  just  like  you 
 probably  be  more  wise  giving  yourself
[113:53] advice  if  you  put  yourself  in  that  frame 
 you  can  go  online  and  just  search  for 
 like  an  old  picture  editor  like  a
[113:58] middle-aged  women  on  Facebook  love  to  do 
 like  this  type  of  stuff  where  they'll
[114:03] use  like  little  photo  editors  and 
 they'll  be  like  whoa  look  has  you  with 
 red  hair  and  stuff  so  that's  why  I'm  not 
 gonna  like  say  yeah  you  absolutely  need
[114:09] to  do  that  I  can  I'm  certain  I  know  that 
 this  is  a  side  point  I  know  for  a  fact 
 that  like  25  of  the  viewers  have
[114:15] literally  just  gotten  distracted  and  now 
 they're  trying  out  like  apps  and  apps 
 and  different  apps  and  stuff  the  point
[114:20] is  you  don't  need  to  go  and  get  the 
 perfect  app  or  anything  or  the  perfect 
 picture  just  keeping  in  mind  your  future
[114:25] self  is  going  to  help  you  and  especially 
 for  important  decisions  if  you  can  just 
 ask  yourself  what  would  wise  Grandpa  me
[114:31] suggest  that  I  do  what  would  he  what 
 advice  would  he  give  to  me  and  just  like
[114:36] you  know  try  to  give  yourself  advice 
 from  that  frame 
 you'll  find  that  you'll  actually  give 
 yourself  very  good  advice
[114:42] when  you're  making  decisions  even  micro 
 ones  like  whether  you  should  you  know  ah 
 maybe  I'll  skip  the  the  workout  today
[114:48] just  look  at  your  future  self  just  think 
 about  him  and  think 
 what  would  make  his  life  better
[114:56] align  your  activities  your  decisions 
 your  relationships  to  that  because  this
[115:01] is  just  a  proactive  way  to  think  long 
 term  step  eight  willpower  fatigue
[115:06] participants  are  brought  into  a  study 
 and  there's  cookies  like  delicious
[115:12] cookies  there  and  also  radishes  like 
 these  disgusting  vegetables  and  one 
 group  of  participants  are  told  nope
[115:18] ignore  the  cookies  eat  the  radishes  the 
 other  group  of  participants  are  told  oh 
 yeah  just  eat  whatever  you  want  eat  the
[115:23] cookies  if  you  want  then  they're  brought 
 in  to  do  a  puzzle  which  is  like 
 impossible  to  do  the  researchers  are
[115:29] timing  how  long  they'll  try  to  do  the 
 puzzle  for  before  they  give  up
[115:34] what  they  found  which  is  went  viral  is 
 that  the  people  who  came  in  and  had  the
[115:40] radishes  and  essentially  you  know  they 
 had  to  use  their  willpower  not  to  eat 
 the  cookies  I  actually  gave  up  earlier
[115:46] the  conclusion  of  this  which  everyone 
 has  spoke  about  is  that  willpower  is
[115:51] something  that  fatigues  it's  something 
 that  is  limited  and  it  drains  and  so  we 
 shouldn't  use  it
[115:57] think  about  how  stupid  everyone  is  can 
 you  see  what's  wrong  with  this  study
[116:03] the  puzzle  is  stupid  the  task  that  they 
 did  was  stupid  this  was  one  study  that
[116:08] all  these  little  little  nerds  online 
 started  to  speak  about  saying  yep 
 willpower  is  limited  make  sure  you  don't
[116:13] use  your  willpower  you  can  go  search  up 
 and  it's  unfortunate  because  he's  very 
 smart  as  well  but  you  can  go  search  up  a 
 YouTube  video  called  willpower  is  for
[116:19] losers  and  it's  made  by  this  YouTuber 
 called  what  I've  learned  and  he's 
 actually  a  really  intelligent  guy  but  I 
 just  thought  the  video  was  stupid  as
[116:25] [ __ ]  because  you  take  this  one  study 
 which  essentially  put  participants  to  do 
 a  stupid  task  which  they  had  no
[116:31] incentive  for  and  then  we  just  conclude 
 yep  see  willpower's  you  know  limited  and 
 stuff 
 actually  when  you  really  think  about  it
[116:38] the  puzzle  was  impossible  to  do  right 
 so  the  participants  who  gave  up  earlier
[116:44] were  actually  smarter  because  it  was  a 
 stupid  waste  of  their  time  and  yet
[116:49] everyone  online  in  the  self-improvement 
 space  has  been  saying  this  for  years 
 that  willpower  is  not  something  you 
 should  rely  on  because  it  drains
[116:56] coming  from  a  weightlifting  background 
 I  knew  how  stupid  that  mindset  was  and
[117:01] you  probably  do  as  well  when  you  go  to 
 the  gym  you  know  this  right  people  are 
 saying  oh  but  if  you  use  willpower  it
[117:06] drains 
 when  you've  got  experience  of  the  gym 
 you  know  what  happens  when  you  use  your 
 muscles  it  fatigues
[117:12] but  then  we  go  to  sleep  and  it's  bigger 
 and  stronger  tomorrow  that's  exactly  how
[117:17] willpower  works  the  idea  is  that  we  need 
 to  use  our  willpower  like  a  muscle  and 
 understand  that  the  muscles  of  course
[117:23] their  fatigue  and  get  tired  but  when  you 
 sleep  and  recover  it  comes  back  stronger 
 and  stronger  and  stronger
[117:29] you  shouldn't  be  avoiding  fatiguing  your 
 willpower  muscle  you  should  be  training
[117:34] it  every  single  day  so  that  you're  able 
 to  resist  bigger  and  bigger  desires  and 
 plus  your  mindset  is  very  important  so
[117:40] Carol  dweck  is  a  very  famous  researcher 
 she  did  the  book  called  mindset  and  this
[117:45] study  had  the  exact  same  findings  as 
 another  study  on  stress  which  is 
 essentially  like  what  whatever  your
[117:51] mindset  of  something  is  that  is  what 
 will  happen  people  who  believed  that
[117:57] willpower  was  a  skill  like  a  muscle  that 
 they  wanted  to  level  up  and  it  was  good 
 for  them  to  use  actually  got
[118:03] consistently  better  at  using  willpower 
 people  who  believe  that  willpower  was
[118:08] something  that  they  shouldn't  use  and 
 that  it  was  something  that  drained  their 
 energy  got  more  and  more  tired  when  they
[118:14] used  it  so  it's  why  not  just  delude 
 yourself  into  having  the  more  empowering 
 mindset  and  think  to  yourself  yep
[118:19] willpower  is  a  muscle  just  like  muscles 
 are  in  the  gym  and  you  know  I'll  go 
 train  it  I'll  do  some  sets  today  and
[118:25] then  I'll  come  home  I'll  rest  and  it'll 
 be  bigger  and  better  tomorrow  in  this 
 mindset  study  those  students  who  believe 
 that  that  will  Powers  a  skill  that  they
[118:31] could  level  up  and  it  was  kind  of  like  a 
 muscle  they  performed  better  at  the  end 
 of  year  exams  than  the  students  who 
 didn't  want  to  use  their  willpower
[118:37] because  they  were  scared  of  draining  it 
 and  so  we  have  one  final  question  to  ask 
 when  do  you  reward  yourself
[118:43] you've  been  super  dedicated  on  your  diet 
 you've  been  resisting  the  desire  of  the
[118:48] sugar  of  the  junk  food  you've  not  been 
 watching  porn  you've  not  been  playing 
 video  games  when  do  you  enjoy  yourself 
 when  do  you  have  the  reward  when  do  you
[118:54] take  time  off 
 what  do  you  think  I'm  going  to  say  to 
 this
[118:59] do  I  seem  like  a  [ __ ]  who's  going  to 
 tell  you  the  same  thing  as  everyone  else 
 like  yeah  go  have  your  cheat  day  bro
[119:05] yeah  you  deserved  it 
 because  I  just  want  you  to  have  the  same 
 mindset  as  me
[119:10] cheat  days 
 rewarding  yourself
[119:15] is  actually  a  punishment  the  thing  that 
 you  think  is  rewarding  yourself  which
[119:20] you  know  that  everyone  else  would  think 
 you  know  oh  yeah  I'm  just  going  to 
 reward  myself 
 it's  a  punishment  when  you  really  think
[119:25] about  it  eating  sugar  is  a  punishment 
 it's  not  a  tree  it's  not  a  reward  it's
[119:30] our  punishment 
 playing  video  games  for  an  hour  and 
 worsening  your  mental  health  is  a
[119:36] punishment  we  need  to  destroy  this  idea 
 that  the  bad  habit  equals  reward  and  we
[119:43] need  to  just  stop  coping  and  just  say  to 
 ourselves  the  bad  habit  is  a  punishment 
 it's  something  we  do  when  we  don't  like
[119:49] ourselves  why  do  we  need  to  take  time 
 off  doing  things  that  are  good  for  us  we
[119:54] don't  know  certainly  for  example  you 
 know  we're  doing  so  many  sets  in  the  gym 
 so  we're  going  to  take  a  rest  day  sure 
 but  that's  like  that's  not  a  bad  thing
[120:01] to  do  but  to  eat  something  that  is 
 literally  poisonous  for  us  how  far  are 
 you  willing  to  go  should  we  reward
[120:07] ourselves  with  some  Pawn  then 
 alcohol  sugar  poison  how  far  are  you
[120:13] willing  to  go  because  everyone  who's 
 watching  this  will  understand  well  you 
 know  we're  not  going  to  reward  ourselves 
 with  porn  then  why  the  [ __ ]  would  you
[120:19] reward  yourself  with  sugar  or  with  video 
 games  or  with  little  snackies
[120:24] if  you  wouldn't  reward  yourself  with 
 some  porn  imagine  saying  that  bro 
 imagine  saying  that  go  comment  that
[120:30] below  my  video  imagine  you've  never  seen 
 someone  comment  that  because  of  how  how 
 absurd  it  would  be  I've  been  working  so
[120:36] hard  I've  been  doing  so  well  on  nofap  so 
 yeah  I've  scheduled  in  a  nice  fap 
 fapathon  on  yeah  yeah  I  have  a  fapathon
[120:42] on  Sundays  you  know  yeah  you  know  the 
 rest  days  are 
 it  would  seem  absurd  right  having  a
[120:48] cheat  day  from  nofap 
 unless  obviously  we  understand  that  you 
 might  still  mess  up  you  know  that  you're
[120:53] not  perfect  at  being  on  the  good  habits 
 of  course  you  might  mess  up  but  to 
 delude  yourself  into  thinking  it's  good
[120:59] for  you 
 remember  how  [ __ ]  our  lives  have  been 
 because  of  porn  and  masturbation  and
[121:04] like  like  those  like  I  don't  know 
 researchers  teachers  whatever  it  was  try 
 to  convince  us  that  porn  and
[121:09] masturbation  were  actually  good  for  you 
 because  they'll  lower  your  risk  of 
 prostate  cancer  or  some  [ __ ]
[121:14] it's  the  same  thing 
 and  the  worst  part  is  I  don't  even
[121:20] expect  you  to  believe  me  when  I  say  this 
 because  of  how  many  like  Fitness 
 influences  these  days  will  disagree  with
[121:26] this  and  say  like  oh  but  you  know  cheat 
 days  are  healthy  haha  like  you  know  you 
 gotta  have  some  sugar
[121:31] yeah  that's  the  most  disappointed  I've 
 ever  been  in  my  in  my  own  mother 
 one  day  when  I  was telling  her  about
[121:37] improving  her  diet  and  I  did  say  to  her 
 like  you  have  like  a  sugary  treat  every
[121:42] single  day  at  2PM  it's  kind  of  like  her 
 routine 
 and  I  said  oh  you  know  it's  probably  not 
 good  your  sugar  is  not  good  for  you  and
[121:48] she  looked  at  me  as  if  I  was  stupid  and 
 she  went 
 it  in  order  to  do  but  it  translates  it
[121:53] to  English  she  went  oh  but  you've  got  to 
 eat  some  sugar  no  you  just  have  to
[122:00] you've  just  got  to  you've  got  to  eat 
 some  sugar  you've  got  to  poison  yourself 
 guys
[122:05] oh  just  yeah  10  minutes  of  fapping 
 you've  got  to  watch  a  little  bit  of  of 
 dungeon  porn  why  do  we  have  a  belief  in
[122:12] our  minds  that  those  things  are  Rewards 
 because  when  you  think  about  it  a  reward
[122:18] is  something  that  should  be  good  for  you 
 right 
 so  the  reward  is
[122:24] the  workout  the  reward  is  the  Clean  Diet
[122:31] the  reward  is  the  good  habits  that 
 you're  doing  it  is  the  meditation  the 
 journaling  the  coal  showers  that  is  the
[122:37] reward  that's  those  are  gifts  that 
 you're  giving  to  yourself  to  your  future 
 self
[122:45] reframe  this  mindset  that  these  good 
 habits  are  the  good  things  we  still  have
[122:50] beliefs  inside  of  our  mind  from  normal 
 people  from  normal  life  before  we  got  on 
 to  self-improvement  that  are  deluding  us
[122:56] to  think  that  these  habits  are  like  the 
 hard  bad  things  that  we're  doing  and 
 that  you  know  but  you  know  you've  got  to
[123:02] reward  yourself  you've  got  to  have  some 
 time  off  certainly  you  can  have  some 
 time  off  you  know  you  don't  want  to  just 
 be  like  working  10  hours  straight
[123:07] certainly  you're  going  to  go  look  at 
 some  sun  and  go  out  for  a  war  and  you're 
 not  going  to  exercise  for  four  hours
[123:12] every  single  day  of  course  you're  gonna 
 have  rest  breaks  but  to  specifically  do 
 something  that  you  know  is  bad  for  you
[123:17] why  do  we  need  to  add  that  into  our 
 schedule  at  all
[123:24] why  don't  we  this  is  the  mindset  I  have 
 which  I  just  want  to  leave  you  with  why 
 don't  you  just  start  to  see  those  bad
[123:30] habits 
 as  self-harm
[123:36] the  porn  the  video  games  the  junk  food 
 that's  how  I  see  them 
 I  think  that  almost  everyone's
[123:42] self-harms  to  a  certain  level  when 
 there's  the  extreme  level  people  are 
 literally  like  suicidal  and  they're
[123:47] doing  crazy  things  and  you  know  to  a  to 
 a  moderate  level  they're  literally  like 
 hurting  themselves  physically  mentally
[123:52] but  to  the  mild  level  where  billions  of 
 people  are  at 
 that  play  in  video  games
[123:58] they're  eating  sugar  watching  porn  how 
 is  that  not  self-harm  when  we  know  it's 
 bad  for  us
[124:04] it's  just  like  a  mild  form  and  it's  not 
 as  like  brutal  and  gory  is  like  you  know 
 like  other  forms  of  it
[124:11] it's  all  self-harm 
 so  let's  rephrase  the  question  because 
 this  is  a  question  I'm  asked  Hamza  but
[124:18] when  do  when  do  we  get  to  self-harm 
 Hamza 
 once  a  week  you  know  can  I  can  I
[124:23] self-harm  once  a  week  I'm  sir  see  how 
 stupid  it  sounds  now 
 you  don't  need  to  you  should  view  those
[124:30] those  bad  habits  when  they  do  happen  you 
 should  view  that  as  like  [ __ ]  my  mental 
 health  was  so  bad  that  and  I  I  disliked
[124:35] myself  so  much  today  that  I  just 
 self-harmed  with  video  games  with  porn 
 with  good  because  that's  not  good  for
[124:41] you  right  like  that's  like  literally 
 harm  for  your  future  self 
 but  you  shouldn't  be  thinking  like  oh
[124:46] yeah  let's  you  know  okay  um Saturday  the 
 26th  let's  schedule  some  self-harm  in 
 the  okay  two  hours  there  we  go  or  maybe
[124:52] I'll  do  some  self-harm  with  my  friends 
 actually  yeah  you  know  at  9  00 p.m  till 
 3am  will  go  out  we'll  all  self-harm
[124:58] together  in  in  the  club  it's  gonna  be  a 
 really  nice  party  we'll  go  self-harm 
 there
[125:04] how  stupid  does  that  sound  if 
 something's  going  to  harm  yourself  if 
 it's  going  to  hurt  you  if  it's  going  to
[125:10] sacrifice  your  future  self's  happiness 
 and  health
[125:15] don't  schedule  it  in  don't  like  just  we 
 need  to  stop  believing  that  those  things
[125:21] need  to  stay  in  our  lives  we've  got  to 
 do  a  little  bit  don't  be  like  my  mother
[125:26] bro  she's  a  she's  a  beautiful  awesome 
 amazing  woman  but  like  they  don't  have 
 that  mindset  from  her  but  you've  you've
[125:31] got  to  self-harm  a  little  bit  you've  got 
 to  eat  some  sugar  you've  got  to  watch 
 some  porn  you've  got  to  take  some  crack
[125:37] right  so  last  and  final  actionable  step 
 destroy  the  idea  that  the  bad  habits  are
[125:43] the  reward  and  just  started  like  you 
 know  just  like  update  your  belief  system 
 and  just  think  yourself  yeah  I'm  not
[125:48] like  a  average  person  the  good  habits 
 are  the  reward  I  have  gave  a  five  part 
 series  it's  five  hours  long  I  gave  it
