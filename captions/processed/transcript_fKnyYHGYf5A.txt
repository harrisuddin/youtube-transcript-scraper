[00:00] in  cases  you  needed  someone  to  tell  you 
 this 
 they're  not  your  friends
[00:05] when  I  was  in  your  position  I  wish 
 someone  just  looked  at  me  and  said  How's 
 it  take  a  look  around
[00:10] look  at  them  really 
 look  at  their  interests  and  hobbies 
 compared  to  yours
[00:16] because  I  went  through  my  entire  years 
 at  high  school  with  the  same  group  of
[00:21] guys  around  me  who  I  considered  my  best 
 friends 
 you  know  every  single  day  we're  talking
[00:26] we'd  even  laugh  we'd  even  have  like  good 
 times  in  school 
 you  know  oftentimes  that  that  come  into
[00:33] school  in  the  morning  and  and  they'd  be 
 telling  stories  of  like  the  stuff  they 
 had  all  done  last  night  like  they  had
[00:38] all  made  plans  without  me  and  like  you 
 know  slept  around  each  other's  houses 
 and  stuff 
 I  wasn't  invited
[00:44] but  inside  of  school 
 would  still  be  laughing  together
[00:53] but  things  started  to  separate  when  I 
 actually  got  onto  self-improvements
[00:58] and  especially  when  I  started  to  go  to 
 the  gym 
 and  they  bullied  me  for  it
[01:04] and  I  bet  you  can  relate  to  this 
 the  person  or  the  people  that  you
[01:09] thought  of  when  you  clicked  on  this 
 video 
 they  actually  insults  you  and  bully  you
[01:16] and  harass  you  when  you're  doing  good 
 habits 
 they  don't  want  what's  best  for  you  they
[01:23] don't  want  to  see  you  grow 
 at  that  point  what  are  they  because 
 that's  not  friendship
[01:29] I'd  invite  you  now  to  do  something  that 
 you've  probably  never  done  before  feel 
 ready
[01:34] Define  friendship 
 what  do  you  want  think  about  how
[01:39] important  this  is  what  do  you  want 
 friendship  to  mean  to  you  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life
[01:45] because  you  know  we  we  went  through 
 school  for  years  and  so  we  were 
 conditioned  to  think  that  friendship  is
[01:51] sitting  in  the  same  class  as  someone  and 
 every  now  and  then  telling  a  joke  and
[01:56] laughing  together  that's  what  we  thought 
 friendship  was 
 but  it's  only  really  when  you  get  onto 
 self-improvement  and  especially  when  you
[02:02] improve  your  mental  health 
 that's  when  you  realize  that  friendship 
 like  we  want  we're  gonna  set  high
[02:08] standards  than  that  it's  no  longer  that 
 I  can  just  laugh  about  this  meme  that
[02:13] all  of  us  saw  together 
 or  that  we  can  maybe  go  home  and  play 
 some  video  games  so  that  when  you  grow
[02:18] up  a  little  bit  more  and  you  know  you 
 start  going  out  and  taking  drugs  and 
 getting  girls  together  it's  it's  past 
 all  of  these  bad  habits  these  instant
[02:24] gratification  you  know  that  this 
 pleasurable  dopamine-seeking  hedonistic 
 stuff
[02:29] and  you  start  to  realize  that  maybe  as  a 
 man  what  we  should  consider  friendship 
 is  Brotherhood  and  growth
[02:35] it's  men  who  actually  want  something 
 good  for  you 
 it's  men  who  are  around  you  who  have  got
[02:40] similar 
 not  exactly  the  same  but  similar  hobbies
[02:45] and  interests  but 
 probably  the  same  values
[02:50] it's  men  who  have  the  values  of 
 discipline  respect  politeness  positivity
[02:57] gratitude  meditate  like  mindfulness 
 these  are  the  values  that  you'd  want  in
[03:03] good  people  around  you  these  are  the 
 values  that  you'll  cultivating  yourself 
 and  so
[03:09] maybe  no  one  said  it  to  you 
 but  you  deserve  to  be  with  someone  like 
 that
[03:14] you  deserve  to  have  friends  who  have  got 
 these  good  values 
 you  deserve  to  have  friends  who  are
[03:20] better  than  those  guys  from  high  school 
 who  are  still  doing  all  of  the  bad 
 habits  who  you're  still  in  a  weird  way
[03:25] attached  to  even  though  that  you  know 
 it's  not  right  for  you  to  be  there
[03:30] because  it's  hard  to  detach  away  isn't 
 it  it's  hard  to  consider  thinking  to 
 leave  this  environment  it's  hard  to
[03:36] think 
 how  you  would  even  go  about  it  it  feels 
 so  awkward  because  you  know  not  only 
 does  it  feel  awkward  of  what  they  would
[03:41] say  for  some  reason  we  stay  stuck  in 
 these  situations  in  relationships  that
[03:46] aren't  good  for  us  because  there's 
 something  you  know  Primal  inside  of  us 
 isn't  that  is  you  know  it's  like 
 Evolution  that  if  you  imagine  like
[03:52] cavemen 
 how  many  cavemen  would  have  left  their 
 tribes  probably  not  that  many  because  it
[03:57] would  have  symbolized  death  you  don't 
 leave  your  tribe  because  you  usually 
 would  die  if  that  happened  to  you  know
[04:02] the  Lone  Wolf  is  a  myth  there  there  are 
 no  lone  wolfs  because  they  all  die  off 
 we  would  no  animal  like  really  survives
[04:08] by  itself  no  human  survives  by  himself 
 and  so  to  consider
[04:13] to  leave  the  tribe  leave  the  Friendship 
 group  leave  the  resources  and  the  social
[04:18] inclusion  and  you're  the  body  what  heat 
 of  other  people  to  go  out  there  and 
 Venture  alone  seems  so  scary
[04:25] but  I  promise  you  right  now 
 I  have  not  seen  it  any  other  way
[04:30] I  wish  that  I  could  tell  you  the  you 
 know  the  most  wholesome  answer  I  could 
 tell  you  is  bro  try  and  get  them  onto
[04:36] self-improvement  as  well  try  and  you 
 know  try  and  get  them  into  the  gym  and 
 there's  probably  one  friend  that  you 
 know  it's  a  little  bit  close  to  getting
[04:42] on  to  self-improvement  with  you  that's 
 awesome  but  for  most  of  the  friends 
 they're  simply  not  going  to
[04:48] I  hope  that  you  can  kind  of  trust  in  my 
 expertise  here  being  like  you  know  the 
 self-improvement  guy  for  a  lot  of  like
[04:54] young  men  who  who  have  watched  my  videos 
 trust  me  when  I  say  I've  tried  to  get 
 thousands  or  at  least  hundreds  of  guys
[05:00] to  get  their  friends  onto 
 self-improvement  and  it  usually  never 
 works
[05:05] because  I  can  help  you  I  think  because 
 of  the  fact  of  how  much  you  want  to
[05:10] improve  but  even  then  think  about  it  you 
 have  this  burning  desire  to  improve  your
[05:15] life  you  don't  feel  like  complacent  you 
 really  want  to  improve  you  really  don't 
 want  to  be  average  right 
 and  self-improvement  still  hard  isn't  it
[05:21] it's  still  really  really  hard  and  you 
 have  the  burning  desire  to  do  it  but 
 it's  still  difficult  so  imagine  the  guy
[05:26] who  doesn't  even  care  about  it  that  much 
 imagine  like  the  friend  of  yours  who 
 doesn't  even  like  think  about
[05:31] self-improvements  if  he  doesn't  even 
 have  that  burning  desire  it's  gonna  be 
 technically  impossible  for  him  it's  hard
[05:36] enough  for  us  and  when  we  rarely  value 
 growth  you  know  that's  our  values  we 
 value  growth  and  progress
[05:43] to  date  I've  never  seen  like  of  someone 
 convince  their  friend  to  get  onto
[05:49] self-improvement  when  that  friend 
 specifically  didn't  care  about  improving 
 I've  never  seen  that  before  when  you've
[05:54] got  maybe  the  one  friend  who  actually 
 was  a  little  bit  more  inclined  to 
 self-improvement  save  him  save  him  from
[05:59] the  modern  times  save  him  from 
 degeneracy  but  most  of  your  friends  you 
 will  not  be  able  to  save  now  you  can
[06:04] choose 
 you  can  choose 
 you  can  abandon  these  friends
[06:12] or  you  can  abandon  yourself
[06:17] which  one  is  it  going  to  be 
 because  you  see  the  pathway  that  these
[06:23] men  are  on 
 you  see  the  decisions  that  they're 
 making
[06:28] and  you  know  you  know  where  these 
 decisions  lead  you  felt  the  pain  of  the
[06:34] bad  habits  yourself  haven't  you  be 
 honest 
 you  know  how  bad  it  feels  to  be  addicted
[06:40] to  porn  you  don't  have  to  tell  anyone 
 else  but  like  I  know  that  you  know  that 
 and  you  know  that  I  know  that  because  of
[06:46] the  way  that  I'm  talking  right  now 
 friends  know  this  and  they  refuse  to
[06:51] change 
 that  means  that  they're  actually  nothing 
 like  you  that  means  that
[06:56] they're  not  even  your  friends 
 you  want  my  help  you  want
[07:02] you  know  what  I  would  say  to  you 
 for  that  question  I  asked  you  earlier  of 
 you  know  would  you  define  friendship
[07:07] what  does  a  friend  mean 
 friends  of  people
[07:12] who actually  want  you  to  grow  and  be 
 happy 
 friends  are  not  those  people  that  you
[07:18] just  indulge  in  bad  habits  with  those 
 are  not  friends 
 those  are  drug  taking  Partners  those  are
[07:26] instant  gratification  Partners  those  are 
 crabs  those  are  crabs  that  will  snip 
 your  legs  when  you  try  and  climb  out  of
[07:31] the  bucket 
 you've  heard  of  that  that  quote  to  the 
 analogy  having  your  crabs  in  a  bucket
[07:38] and  you've  also  heard  of  heard  of  the 
 very  powerful  quotes 
 you  know  the  average  of  the  five  people
[07:43] that  you  spend  time  with 
 you  want  to  know  something  absolutely
[07:48] beautiful  that's  so  overpowered 
 that  quotes
[07:53] also  includes 
 the  content  that  you  consume  and  the
[07:58] books  that  you  read 
 I  Have  Become 
 a  lot  like  my  my  role  models  by  just
[08:05] simply  consuming  their  content  you've 
 probably  become  a  lot  more  like  me  by 
 simply  consuming  my  content  these  days
[08:12] you  don't  actually  have  to  be  around 
 someone  to  be  influenced  by  him  which  is 
 like  that's  mind-blowing  you  know  we've
[08:18] grown  up  now  with  this  concept  of  the 
 internet  and  everything  but  think  about 
 that  if  the  average  of  the  five  people
[08:23] that  you  surround  yourself  with 
 but  now  if  you  consume  the  content  of 
 smart  intelligent  people  of  of  people
[08:29] who  are  doing  good  habits  of  people  who 
 have  got  good  values  of  discipline  and 
 and  progress  and  humility  and  gratitude
[08:35] and  you  know  peacefulness 
 you'll  become  more  like  them  this  is  our 
 superpower  and  it's  such  a  shame  that
[08:40] other  men  don't  want  to  wield  the 
 superpower  because  they  just  want  to 
 play  video  games
[08:45] but  you  can't  surround  yourself  with  men 
 like  that  because  you  will  be  more 
 likely  and  you  know  this  you  know  when  I
[08:51] have  this  discussion  with  a  bunch  of 
 young  men  who  ask  me  about  this  you  know 
 young  guys  in  high  school  and  they  ask 
 me  like  how  should  they  go  about  this
[08:56] situation  when  they're  friends  with 
 these  people  or  you  know  the  guys  who've 
 just  gotten  out  of  high  school  they 
 Wonder  this
[09:02] and  I  always  say  to  them  what's  the 
 benefit  that  you  get  how  do  you  actually 
 interact  with  these  people 
 and  they  always  say  something  like  oh
[09:08] yeah  sometimes  we  hop  onto  a  Discord 
 call  together 
 and  then  what
[09:13] and  then  I  just  I  just  watch  him  play 
 video  games  sometimes  or  sometimes  I'll 
 join  him  as  well  so  you're  telling  me
[09:19] that  the  only  time  that  you  spend  time 
 with  these  friends 
 are  when  you're  worsening  your  life
[09:26] when  you're  doing  bad  habits 
 that  doesn't  sound  like  good  friendship 
 to  me
[09:33] I  will  hope  and  and  wish  and  pray  for 
 you 
 to  find  the  kind  of  friendship  where  you
[09:38] surround  yourself  with  men 
 who  want  to  grow  alongside  you
[09:43] you  can  find  them  in  the  comments 
 underneath  this  very  video  you  could  go 
 and  write  down  like  a  paragraph  of  your
[09:48] life  story  where  you  are  how  old  you  are 
 how  much  money  you're  making  maybe
[09:53] you're  in  school  and  you  could  write 
 down  and  say  like  you  know  if  anyone 
 wants  to  connect  you  can  do  that  you 
 know  the  fastest  ways  if  you  want  some
[09:58] practical  advice  right  this  video  you 
 know  all  these  kinds  of  videos  sound 
 really  nice  and  stuff  and  then  you're 
 like  oh  yeah  this  is  cool  and  then
[10:03] you're  just  gonna  go  click  on  another 
 video  and  not  change  your  life  do  you 
 know  about  the  the  fastest  way  to  ditch
[10:08] these  old  friends  is  to  make  some  new 
 ones 
 so  how  about  you  try  and  make  some  new 
 ones  right  now  how  about  you  actually
[10:14] actively  think  to  yourself  okay  I'm 
 gonna  go  spend 
 five  hours  over  the  next  week  trying  to
[10:20] connect  with  people  if  you  write  a 
 comment  on  this  video  there's  someone 
 who's  already  wrote  a  comment  and  you 
 find  a  way  to  contact  them  you've
[10:25] comment  underneath  and  you  tell  them 
 your  Discord  username  or  you  tell  him 
 you  know  like  telegram  or  whatever  like
[10:30] the  kids  use  these  days  and  just 
 literally  why  not  just  hop  onto  a  video 
 call  with  someone  and  develop  a
[10:35] friendship  with  someone  in  this  space 
 who  actually  goes  to  the  gym  who  wants 
 to  build  an  aesthetic  physique  who  wants
[10:41] to  get  into  like  YouTube  and  posting 
 good  content  and  educational  content 
 like  this  who  is  a  good  man  who  is  the
[10:47] kind  of  guy  that  you  genuinely  would 
 want  around  your  children  because  if 
 your  current  friends  are  not  those  that
[10:53] you  would  want  around  your  children  then 
 why  are  you  friends  with  them  at  all
[10:59] there's  something  that  I'm  releasing 
 very  soon  and  maybe  it's  the  top  Link  in 
 the  description  if  you  are  interested 
 Adonis  school  and  that's  what  we're  all
[11:05] going  to  get  together  it's  going  to  be 
 like  my  go-to  Hub  to  teaching  you  online 
 everything  you  need  to  know  about
[11:10] self-improvement  and  you'll  be  able  to 
 make  a  lot  of  friends  in  there  so  you 
 can  click  the  top  Link  in  the 
 description  right  now  do  the  hard  work
[11:16] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 mwah
