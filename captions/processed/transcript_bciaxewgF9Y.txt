[00:00] Jeffrey  locks  his  eyes  onto  Jessica  his 
 palms  begin  to  drip  with  sweat  there  she
[00:05] is  she's  alone  now  is  my  chance  Jeffrey 
 awkwardly  stumbles  over  to  her  she  sees
[00:10] him  coming  and  she's  already  disgusted 
 just  to  Jessica  ah  but  Jessica  doesn't
[00:15] want  anything  to  do  with  him  he  keeps 
 staring  at  her  titties  come  on  Jeffrey
[00:20] Adonis  Adonis  enters  his  tribe's  dining 
 hall  when  the  most  beautiful  woman
[00:25] catches  his  eye  Anastasia  he  confidently 
 strides  towards  her  and  introduces
[00:30] himself  he  charms  her  with  his  words  and 
 Anastasia  can't  help  but  draw  closer  to
[00:35] him  he's  irresistible  usually  when  I 
 start  these  videos  I  give  you  the 
 Jeffrey  and  Adonis  intro  then  it'll  take
[00:40] some  time  to  think  of  a  story  where  I 
 have  done  the  mistake  so  I've  been 
 creepy  I've  just  sat  here  for  like  a
[00:46] minute  really  just  asking  myself  okay 
 when  have  I  been  really  really  creepy  to 
 a  girl  and  honestly  like  I  can't  really 
 think  of  one  at  least  for  me  like  I  was
[00:52] way  more  reserved  to  never  come  across 
 in  a  negative  way  to  a  girl  and  so  you
[00:57] know  for  example  if  there  was  a  girl 
 that  I  was  into  sure  you  know  I  might 
 like  stare  at her  you  know  a  little  bit 
 and  obsess  over  her  but  I  was  never  the
[01:02] guy  who  would  be  like  spamming  her  phone 
 when  she  didn't  reply  like  I  was  always 
 a  little  bit  too  scared  of  coming  across
[01:07] as  too  creepy  and  so  I  was  on  like  the 
 underside  of  this  but  I  have  seen  other 
 guys  who  have  been  far  too  creepy  and
[01:13] they've  followed  like  these  three  bad 
 habits  and  there's  been  so  many  times  so 
 for  example  when  I  used  to  go  to 
 nightclubs  when  I  was  about  18  19  you
[01:20] know  I  was  just  getting  into  like 
 partying  for  the  first  time  life  I  would 
 go  about  speaking  to  girls  in  more  of 
 like  a  cool  way  like  I  learned  from  this
[01:26] like  cool  black  guy  of  like  game  and  how 
 to  talk  to  girls  but  there  would  be 
 times  when  I  would  go  out  with  female
[01:31] friends  of  mine  and  they  would  run  over 
 to  our  groups  and  now  this  guy's  being 
 creepy  this  guy  won't  leave  me  alone 
 imagine  this  right  now  imagine  you're  in
[01:37] a  party  or  a  nightclub  or  something  and 
 a  female  friend  of  yours  runs  over  and 
 says  that  guy's  being  creepy  I  want  you
[01:42] to  visualize  that  guy  what  does  he  look 
 like  who  is  that  guy  if  you  visualize 
 that  guy  who's  being  creepy  right  now  I
[01:48] can  see  him  he's  pudgy  like  he's  got 
 like  higher  body  fat  he's  not  fat  butt 
 but  he's  got  like  probably  20  body  fat
[01:53] he's  holding  his  drink  like  his 
 alcoholic  drink  up  here  and  he's  already 
 like  drunk  like  stumbling  over  the  place
[01:58] anyway  oh  come  here  like  he  wants  like 
 speak  to  some  girl  he  just  has  no  social 
 mannerisms  he  probably  stinks  he's
[02:03] unhygienic  he's  got  like  you  know 
 alcohol  he's  in  the  party  environment 
 he's  like  drips  on  [ __ ] 
 this  is  an  anti-spill  bottle  but  like
[02:09] you  drop  some  alcohol  all  over  it's 
 still  making  stuff  you  know  all  over  his 
 shirt  and  he's  still  trying  to  like  go 
 and  approach  girls  now  I  mean  props  for
[02:15] his  confidence  I  guess  but  if  girls  are 
 literally  physically  running  away  from
[02:20] him  because  he's  being  obnoxiously 
 creepy  obnoxiously  just  weird  and  like 
 too  full  on  you  never  want  to  be  that
[02:26] guy  not  only  because  of  the  effect  that 
 you're  having  on  the  girl  that  you're 
 literally  scaring  her  and  she's  running 
 away  but  also  I'm  not  the  same  guy
[02:31] anymore  but  back  then  when  a  guy  would 
 have  this  effect  on  like  a  girl  that  I 
 actually  liked  you  know  we  were  just
[02:36] like  friends  or  whatever  like  it  would 
 piss  me  off  to  the  point  that  I  would 
 actually  like  start  on  this  guy  and  like 
 I'd  actually  get  aggressive  towards  him
[02:42] if  some  guy  like  didn't  get  this  social 
 cue  of  like  okay  leave  the  girl  if  she's 
 physically  running  away  from  you  bro  and
[02:47] he's  still  stumbling  over  trying  to 
 speak  to  her  some  like  trying  to  grab 
 her  and  stuff  I've  never  hit  a  guy  like 
 that  but  I've  been  very  close  to  him
[02:52] multiple  times  like  I'm  the  like  I  was 
 always  like  the  guy  who  the  girls  would 
 run  to  and  this  isn't  me  trying  to  oh
[02:57] I'm  so  strong  because  it's  stupid  as 
 [ __ ]  like  I  could  have  easily  been 
 knocked  out  I'm  so  surprised  that  I 
 never  once  got  sucker  punched  when  I  did
[03:03] this  but  anytime  I  would  see  this 
 happening  and  the  girl  would  come  and 
 tell  me  like  oh  this  guy's  been  creepy 
 you  won't  leave  me  alone  I'd  go  over  to 
 women  are  fully  like  [ __ ]
[03:09] intimidating  him  tell  him  like  turn 
 around  and  walk  like  walk  the  [ __ ]  away 
 right  now  it's  not  a  nice  situation  to 
 be  in  not  only  again  because  the  girls
[03:15] running  away  and  it's  going  to  hurt  your 
 self-esteem  to  think  that  you're  the 
 [ __ ]  weirdo  creep  that's  like 
 repelled  literally  repelled  the  girl
[03:20] away  but  also  because  then  she  is  gonna 
 go  and  like  tell  other  people  and  you 
 just  don't  want  that  you  do  not  want  to
[03:25] be  seen  as  the  creepy  guy  and  so  there's 
 three  bad  habits  that  will  make  you  seem 
 really  really  creepy  and  unfortunately
[03:30] I'm  gonna  do  something  a  little  bit 
 different  I'm  gonna  slightly  black  pill 
 you  and  if  you  don't  know  what  the  black 
 pill  is  it's  kind  of  like  this  belief
[03:36] that  attractiveness  is  the  only  thing 
 that  matters  when  it  comes  to  dating  as 
 a  guy  I'm  just  gonna  give  you  a  brutal
[03:42] truth  which  is  gonna  seem  really 
 negative  for  me  to  say  this  to  you  but 
 this  bad  habit  that  makes  you  really 
 [ __ ]  creepy  is  that  you  pursue  or  you
[03:48] really  want  to  have  sex  with  her  but 
 you're  just  not  that  attractive  you're 
 not  the  kind  of  guy  that  is  in  her  brain
[03:53] her  subconscious  brain  that  is  past  the 
 eligibility  line  to  have  sex  slash  data
[03:58] in  the  modern  day  with  these  like  really 
 [ __ ]  dating  standards  that  are 
 happening  right  now  like  this
[04:03] eligibility  line  in  women's  like  Supreme 
 you  know  like  they're  not  like 
 autistically  thinking  oh  this  is  this 
 eligible  ability  line  but  like  just
[04:08] imagine  like  their  standards  is  here 
 every  couple  of  months  it  keeps  going 
 higher  and  higher  and  higher  and  I  can
[04:13] you  know  do  a  full  50  minute  video 
 explaining  this  maybe  that'd  be 
 interesting  if  you  guys  want  me  to  like 
 do  a  video  of  explaining  why  exactly  in
[04:20] really  good  detail  why  standards  for 
 women  are  going  higher  and  white 
 standards  for  men  are  going  lower  but 
 essentially  her  standards  keep  going
[04:25] higher  and  now  the  issue  is  that  if  a 
 guy  who's  below  these  standards  which 
 are  in  her  brain  tries  to  pursue  having
[04:30] sex  with  her  he's  going  to  be  seen  as 
 repulsive  which  essentially  this  is  like 
 a  black  bill  because  essentially  this 
 just  means  you  need  to  be  hot  you  need
[04:36] to  be  attractive  you  you  cannot  navigate 
 this  normal  dating  world  now  without
[04:41] being  attractive  and  I've  never  once 
 told  you  that  the  opposite  of  this  is 
 true  I've  never  once  told  you  that  it's
[04:46] fine  to  be  ugly  I've  always  said  from 
 the  start  that  a  part  of  our 
 self-improvement  journey  should  be 
 improving  our  physical  attractiveness  so
[04:52] many  guys  you  don't  realize  how  much 
 criticism  in  my  face  because  of  this  so 
 many  guys  have  called  me  shadow  for  this
[04:57] so  many  like  little  intellectual  little 
 nerds  have  called  me  like  a  bad  person 
 for  telling  young  men  that  you  should
[05:02] try  to  improve  how  you  look  because 
 that's  seen  us  really  shallow  that  scene 
 is  like  you  know  so  vain  or  something 
 and  for  so  many  years  I  was  seen  as  the
[05:08] vain  guy  that  was  like  narcissistic  that 
 cared  too  much  about  how  he  looked 
 people  said  that  was  shallow  and  yet  it
[05:13] helped  me  to  cultivate  love  in  my  life 
 love  and  sex  are  literally  fundamental
[05:19] needs  for  humans  and  if  right  here  right 
 now  in  this  modern  day  in  world  the 
 thing  that's  gonna  get  you  you're  a  girl
[05:24] who's  interested  in  you  the  thing  that's 
 going  to  attract  your  future  wife  and 
 the  mother  of  your  children  is  for  you
[05:29] to  just  be  a  little  bit  more  in  shape 
 for  you  to  just  be  a  little  bit  more 
 well  groomed  and  more  handsome  is  that 
 really  shallow  I  don't  think  so  so  the
[05:35] first  bad  habit  that  makes  you  really 
 [ __ ]  creepy  which  seems  just  so  like 
 horrible  for  me  to  say  it's  just  you're
[05:40] not  attractive  because  this  is  this  is  a 
 brutal  black  pill  we  can  have  two  guys 
 who  do  the  exact  same  thing  to  a  girl  so
[05:46] you  know  two  guys  text  her  the  same 
 things  two  guys  act  in  exactly  the  same 
 way  but  one  guy's  more  attractive  and
[05:51] the  other  guy's  not  this  guy  is  going  to 
 be  seen  as  charming  and  this  guy's 
 actually  going  to  be  seen  as  creepy  even
[05:56] though  they  did  the  same  thing  simply 
 because  of  the  person  that  they  are  and 
 most  likely  because  of  how  attractive
[06:01] they  are  this  is  a  brutal  black  bill  but 
 it's  something  that  we  do  need  to  accept 
 because  I  think  it  is  like  just  the
[06:06] truth  and  it's  something  that  we  need  to 
 just  bring  in  into  our  self-improvement 
 journey  to  realize  the  more  attractive 
 that  you  become  physically  attractive
[06:12] but  also  you  know  like  attractive  in  the 
 social  charismatic  sense  and  also  the 
 attractiveness  that  comes  from  having
[06:17] clouds  and  having  followers  and  having 
 money  like  you're  not  just  attractive  in 
 general  the  more  attractive  that  you 
 actually  become  the  higher  the  barrier
[06:23] for  you  to  seem  creepy  let's  say  you're 
 a  grotesque  man  let's  say  you're  just 
 literally  a  one  out  of  ten  two  out  of
[06:28] ten  man  and  I  hate  using  this  phrase 
 like  one  out  of  ten  two  out  of  ten  but 
 like  I  think  it  you  know  it  helps  us 
 understand  what  we're  talking  about
[06:33] let's  say  you're  an  absolute  like  just 
 not  attractive  guy  at  all  you'd  smell 
 and  everything  you're  a  one  out  of  ten 
 guy  well  your  barrier  to  be  seeming  as
[06:39] creepy  is  going  to  be  very  low  isn't  it 
 so  a  one  out  of  ten  guy  could  literally 
 just  make  eye  contact  towards  a  girl  and
[06:44] she'd  actually  get  a  little  bit  repulsed 
 let's  say  that  one  out  of  ten  guy  you 
 know  he's  really  obese  or  something 
 let's  say  he  just  loses  all  the  way  and
[06:50] suddenly  he's  like  in  shape  he's  not 
 jacked  or  anything  he's  in  shape  and  now 
 he's  like  a  2.5  out  of  10.  so  you  know 
 he's  just  went  up  a  little  bit  he's
[06:56] still  not  attractive  but  you  know  a 
 little  bit  well  the  barrier  for  him 
 being  creepy  is  just  slightly  wet  a 
 little  bit  higher  let's  say  now  he
[07:02] dedicates  the  next  few  years  to 
 discipline  builds  up  an  aesthetic  body 
 builds  up  like  this  physique  that 
 actually  makes  him  look  like  a  [ __ ]
[07:08] fitness  model  maybe  his  face  isn't 
 attractive  but  he's  now  literally  shaped 
 like  a  [ __ ]  Greek  god  and  now  he
[07:13] takes  like  sexy  pictures  you  know  maybe 
 he  can  hide  his  face  a  little  bit  but 
 he's  like  literally  got  six  pack  abs  and 
 everything  now  he's  at  like  a  four  out
[07:18] of  ten  a  five  out  of  ten  him  being 
 creepy  now  it's  a  little  bit  higher  and 
 a  little  bit  higher  and  a  little  bit 
 higher  if  that  guy  now  goes  and  gets
[07:24] call  out  and  gets  a  level  of  Fame  gets 
 successful  gets  a  nice  car  Grooms 
 herself  now  he's  a  five  a  5.5  and  a  six
[07:30] his  barrier  to  being  creepy  is  just 
 increase  so  if  you're  really  scared  of 
 coming  across  as  being  creepy  this  is
[07:36] like  long-term  advice  and  I  know  it 
 seems  a  little  bit  like  sad  and  you  know 
 negative  that  the  world's  like  this  but
[07:41] how  creepy  you  are  is  quite  quite 
 heavily  correlated  to  simply  just  how
[07:46] attractive  you  are  become  more 
 attractive  and  also  become  more 
 confident  especially  sexually  with  girls
[07:51] and  you'll  be  seen  as  less  creepy  so 
 understand  and  remember  this  if  you  have 
 low  smv  sexual  market  value  like  the
[07:58] things  that  you  bring  to  the  table  that 
 are  attractive  if  you're  not  very 
 attractive  if  you're  not  very  confident
[08:03] especially  when  it  comes  to  the  sexual 
 stuff  honestly  especially  when  it  comes 
 to  bringing  her  into  the  bedroom  if
[08:09] you're  not  very  confident  or  experienced 
 and  you're  also  not  attractive  it  can 
 really  come  across  as  creepy  the  second
[08:14] bad  habit  that  will  make  you  seem  creepy 
 is  not  getting  the  subtle  signs  that 
 she's  not  interested  now  I  just  recently
[08:19] did  a  video  which  I'll  link  as  a  card 
 right  now  so  you  can  click  on  that  and  I 
 went  over  a  bunch  of  signs  that  she 
 doesn't  like  you  and  a  lot  of  guys  don't
[08:25] actually  pick  up  on  these  you  know 
 they're  just  not  very  clued  up  in  like 
 these  social  sexual  mannerisms  and  so
[08:30] they  don't  really  get  the  message  and  I 
 think  that  throws  perfectly  encapsulated 
 and  I  want  you  to  just  ask  yourself
[08:35] right  here  right  now  just  for  a  few 
 seconds  maybe  pause  the  video  and  just 
 ask  yourself  do  I  get  the  message  that 
 she's  not  into  me  has  there  been  a  time
[08:41] when  you've  somewhat  pursued  a  girl  who 
 seemed  like  she  was  into  you  not  really
[08:46] and  you  know  you  just  really  wanted  to 
 see  and  you  know  she  wasn't  like  being 
 very  direct  the  issue  with  me  asking  you 
 this  question  is  because  the  guys  who
[08:51] are  a  little  bit  more  experienced  in 
 this  will  be  able  to  look  back  with 
 humility  and  think  yeah  you  know  what
[08:56] like  there  was  a  bunch  of  times  when  it 
 was  kind  of  clear  that  girl  wasn't  into 
 me  but  I  didn't  really  see  the  sign  and 
 I  was  really  like  overly  invested  I
[09:01] really  really  wanted  to  get  her  so  I 
 just  didn't  really  pick  up  on  the  signs 
 the  issue  is  if  you  right  here  right  now
[09:06] need  to  hear  this  advice  probably  likely 
 that  your  brain  won't  accept  this  advice
[09:11] that  this  is  for  you  right  here  right 
 now  that  you're  probably  not  picking  up 
 on  the  signs  that  she  doesn't  like  you
[09:16] and  that's  what's  making  you  come  across 
 as  creepy  a  lot  of  girls  and  even  guys 
 don't  really  have  the  confidence  to
[09:21] reject  someone  in  a  very  upfront 
 straightforward  way  it's  quite  rare  for 
 a  girl  to  straight  up  look  at  you  or  you
[09:27] know  to  text  you  and  say  hey  sorry  I'm 
 not  interested  in  a  relationship  with 
 you  or  I  don't  want  to  have  sex  with  you
[09:32] wish  you  all  the  best  goodbye  it's  very 
 rare  that  a  girl  is  that  upfront  with  it 
 because  most  girls  and  even  most  guys
[09:38] doing  this  like  very  Smiley  way  where 
 they'll  just  start  like  ghosting  you  and 
 you  know  it  makes  you  like  paranoid  you 
 start  thinking  about  it  more  or  maybe
[09:43] they  start  sending  you  like  shorter 
 messages  or  maybe  they  tell  you  like  oh 
 they're  too  busy  most  people  will  just
[09:48] kind  of  string  you  along  mostly  because 
 they  don't  have  the  confidence  to  reject 
 you  in  a  very  secure  upfront  healthy  way
[09:53] and  also  because  they  kind  of  slightly 
 [ __ ]  in  the  head  and  they  kind  of  like 
 the  extra  you  know  the  game  of  you
[09:58] chasing  the  most  people  like  that  even 
 if  they're  not  interested  in  you  just 
 gives  them  a  feeling  of  importance  and 
 makes  them  feel  good  about  themselves
[10:03] and  I'm  bad  for  this  myself  I've  done 
 this  many  times  as  well  which  means  that 
 guys  often  I'm  not  getting  a  very  clear
[10:09] upfront  rejection  they're  getting  more 
 of  like  a  semi  small  rejection  which 
 most  guys  aren't  picking  up  after
[10:14] because  most  guys  are  simply  too  needy 
 and  too  desperate  and  too  too  clingy  to 
 realize  it  now  this  is  something  that  I
[10:20] really  improved  on  as  I  got  a  little  bit 
 older  I  have  this  attitude  that  if  it 
 isn't  extremely  clear  that  this  girl
[10:25] likes  me  then  I  just  take  that  as  a  no 
 for  me  personally  if  I'm  considering 
 like  you  know  dating  a  girl  or  something
[10:30] I  want  to  feel  like  in  her  mind  it's 
 like  absolutely  like  [ __ ]  yes  yes  hams 
 is  amazing  that's  like  the  standard  that
[10:35] I  have  if  she  doesn't  feel  that  way  and 
 it's  not  so  clear  that  she's  into  me 
 then  I'm  not  gonna  like  chase  after  some
[10:40] girl  who's  like  you  know  some  vague  oh 
 yeah  she  might  be  into  me  she  might  not 
 because  once  you  have  like  a  level  of
[10:45] respect  for  yourself  you  start  to 
 increase  the  standards  of  like  which  you 
 want  your  partners  to  be  able  to  show 
 affection  and  attraction  towards  you
[10:51] chances  are  right  now  you  might  not  be 
 at  that  level  of  you  know  security  and 
 abundance  and  so  any  attention  that  a
[10:56] girl  gives  you  and  you  know  she  replies 
 back  to  your  text  messages  kind  of  feels 
 like  oh  well  she  she  kind  of  likes  me
[11:01] she  must  like  to  me  no  no  Hamilton  is 
 not  talking  about  me  here  he  must  be 
 talking  about  someone  else  I'm  talking
[11:06] about  you  bro  I'm  talking  about  you  and 
 the  girl  that  you're  into  and  you  just 
 don't  realize  that  she's  already 
 rejected  you  because  she  gives  like  this
[11:12] subtle  rejection  you  need  to  have  this 
 kind  of  personality  going  forward  where 
 if  a  girl  isn't  very  clearly  into  you
[11:18] you  just  kind  of  take  that  as  a 
 rejection  as  it  is  but  not  like  a  bad 
 one  not  where  you  know  you're  getting 
 pissed  off or  something  but  just  like  if
[11:23] she's  not  very  forward  that  with  the 
 fact  that  she  likes  you  or  at  least 
 she's  interested  in  pursuing  something
[11:28] then  you  just  kind  of  take  that  as  like 
 okay  whatever  boom  so  many  guys  get  the 
 smallest  little  bait  Bros  like  you  know 
 they  carry  it  on  a  stick  analogy  it's
[11:34] like  girls  are  just  dangling  like  not 
 even  the  whole  carrot  broke  like  a  tiny 
 [ __ ]  little  like  the  [ __ ]  stem  of 
 a  carrot  girls  are  just  dangling  like
[11:40] [ __ ]  Karen  and  a  bunch  of  desperate 
 guys  are  still  trying  to  get  it  because 
 that's  the  most  carrot  that  they've  ever 
 been  able  to  get  it  so  far  no  go  for  the
[11:46] full  carrot  bro  you  deserve  the  [ __ ] 
 full  well  you  know  what  I  was  gonna  give 
 you  like  this  little  false  hype  so  maybe
[11:51] you'll  like  me  more  maybe  you'll 
 appreciate  my  videos  and  you  know  you'd 
 feel  good  about  this  video  so  hopefully 
 you  click  on  my  videos  more  after  this
[11:56] bro  I'm  not  gonna  falsely  hype  you  up  I 
 was  gonna  say  like  you  deserve  the  full 
 carrot  bro  chances  are  you  probably 
 don't  I'm  sorry  to  be  [ __ ]  horrible
[12:02] but  chances  are  you  probably  don't 
 deserve  the  [ __ ]  full  carrot  you'd 
 probably  don't  deserve  her  like  full 
 attention  and  admiration  just  yet  I
[12:09] don't  want  to  be  an  [ __ ]  but 
 sometimes  you  need  someone  to  just  look 
 at  you  like  almost  like  this  older 
 brother  figure  and  just  look  at  you  and
[12:14] say  bro  you're  not  that  great  you're  not 
 that  attractive  you're  not  that 
 confident  you  don't  bring  that  much  to 
 the  table  if  he  got  in  a  relationship
[12:19] with  you  you  wouldn't  even  improve  her 
 life  in  any  way  now  you  think  you  would 
 you  think  it'd  be  awesome  dating  you  the
[12:24] thing  is  like  you're  not  that  great  as  a 
 man  it  takes  some  time  to  build  up  and 
 show  you  know  some  little  Tick  Tock  boy 
 with  the  perfect  hair  and  little
[12:29] six-pack  sure  he  might  be  able  to  get 
 more  girls  than  you  because  he's  young 
 and  attractive  right  now  but  for  most
[12:34] men  we  don't  have  amazing  genetics  for 
 most  men  it  comes  from  how  we  build 
 ourselves  the  best  thing  things  you  can
[12:39] build  is  your  physique  because  that 
 leads  to  so  many  better  benefits  and 
 then  also  your  success  because  if  you
[12:44] build  your  physique  and  you're 
 Successful  by  success  I  mean  like  in  a 
 work  success  business  success  grades
[12:49] these  two  things  give  you  an 
 astronomical  amount  of  confidence  they 
 actually  make  you  feel  good  about
[12:55] yourself  and  then  your  standards  for  the 
 people  who  come  into  your  life  increase 
 the  fact  that  you're  watching  this  video
[13:00] right  now  and  you're  hooked  onto  my 
 words  and  that  analogy  of  like  you  know 
 she's  just  beating  the  [ __ ]  stem  of 
 the  carrot  actually  meant  something  to
[13:05] you  means  that  you're  not  ready  yet  you 
 don't  deserve  the  full  carrot  you  don't 
 deserve  her  attraction  yet  now  you  can
[13:11] get  sad  about  this  you  can  get  upset  you 
 can  get  nihilistic  and  depressed  and  you 
 can  go  over  to  some  black  pill  videos  if
[13:16] you  want  or  you  can  you  know  get  pissed 
 off  at  women  and  get  angry  and  get 
 better  or  you  can  get  better  you  can
[13:21] think  to  yourself  right  now  without  any 
 level  of  hatred  and  think  you  know  what 
 as  much  as  it  is  kind  of  you  know  sad
[13:26] and  frustrating  to  not  really  attract 
 any  girls  the  thing  is  like  I  can't 
 really  blame  them  because  of  course
[13:31] they're  gonna  choose  the  guy  that  they 
 really  want  they're  going  to  choose  the 
 guy  who's  the  best  and  I'm  not  the  best
[13:37] yet  I  haven't  built  myself  up  to  that 
 point  the  same  the  greatest  thing  you 
 can  do  which  it  is  hard  it  takes  some 
 time  but  like  get  into  the  top  10  of  men
[13:43] in  your  area  the  top  10  now  obviously 
 this  depends  on  the  city  you  live  in  how
[13:48] old  you  are  and  everything  but 
 relatively  if  you're  lean  and  you  have  a 
 pretty  good  body  and  you  also  a  little
[13:53] bit  more  successful  than  every  other  guy 
 around  you  and  you  also  don't  do  a  bunch 
 of  like  the  really  bad  habits  like
[13:58] you're  watching  porn  and  jacking  off 
 every  day  you're  probably  going  to  be  in 
 the  top  10  percent  now  chances  are 
 you're  probably  not  even  there  just  yet 
 to  get  into  the  top  10  percent  of  men
[14:04] only  take  honestly  only  takes  two  years 
 like  it  took  me  two  years  honestly  it 
 takes  two  years  and  that's  if  like  I  was
[14:10] already  you  know  like  20  uh  23  so  23  to 
 25  right  if  you're  broke  you're  like  if 
 you're  younger  than  me  if  you're  16  17
[14:15] 18  bro  for  you  to  be  better  than  the 
 guys  around  you  go  to  the  gym  really 
 hard  and  discipline  yourself  for  six
[14:20] months  stop  eating  all  this  [ __ ]  [ __ ] 
 Western  food  that's  [ __ ]  up  your 
 brain  and  your  diet  and  your  body  fat
[14:25] percentage  start  pursuing  a  business 
 start  learning  how  to  make  more  money  as 
 soon  as  you're  making  like  a  thousand 
 dollars  a  month  bro  you're  like  if
[14:31] you're  18  years  old  and  you're  making  it 
 online  from  like  a  nice  little  business 
 that  you've  built  in  the  top  10  take 
 some  good  shirtless  pictures  you'll  be
[14:36] getting  girls  on  on  Tinder  on  Instagram 
 or  even  in  real  life  you're  walking 
 around  and  you  know  your  fit  is  looking 
 like  nice  snug  shirt  on  your  biceps  boom
[14:43] I'm  not  going  to  sugarcoat  things  for 
 you  and  I  need  you  right  here  right  now 
 to  listen  to  my  words  carefully  if  you
[14:48] want  to  keep  subscribed  to  my  channel 
 this  is  not  the  place  that  you  come  to 
 to  feel  good  about  yourself  with  this 
 false  hype  that  you'll  see  from  like
[14:54] school  and  every  other  [ __ ]  YouTube 
 channel  that  you'll  see  out  there 
 because  I  care  about  you  I  will 
 criticize  you  it's  in  the  masculine  way
[15:00] of  men  to  criticize  each  other's 
 weaknesses  and  to  point  them  out  so  that 
 we  can  improve  if  that  hurts  your
[15:05] feelings  good  I'm  sorry  that  you're  so 
 sensitive  that's  another  thing  that  we 
 need  to  work  on  you  can  stick  around  if
[15:10] you  want  right  here  right  now  and  just 
 hold  your  hand  up  and  say  you  know  what 
 I  will  keep  coming  to  hamster's  videos 
 because  he  actually  criticizes  my
[15:16] weaknesses  and  that's  something  that  I 
 need  even  though  it  offends  me  and 
 pisses  me  off  slightly  and  if  you  don't 
 want  to  do  that  then  you  can  go  find
[15:21] another  [ __ ]  I  don't  even  know  you 
 can  go  back  to  school  and  listen  to  the 
 like  oh  yeah  participation  trophies  and
[15:26] we're  all  amazing  like  how's  that  been 
 for  you  bro  you  need  to  hear  sometimes 
 again  you're  not  that  great  you're
[15:31] really  not  that  great  you  need  to  get 
 exposed  to  someone  who's  50  times  more 
 successful  to  you  I  don't  want  to  be  a 
 dick  I  really  don't  want  to  be  a  dick
[15:36] okay  this  is  what  I'm  about  to  say  is 
 going  to  sound  really  bad  but  bro  you 
 monthly  income  I  make  it  whilst  I  sleep
[15:41] and  I  don't  say  this  like  big  me  up  I 
 say  this  in  a  really  weird  way  to 
 slightly  put  you  down  a  little  bit  to 
 expose  you  to  a  level  of  success  that
[15:47] you  haven't  seen  the  amount  of  matches 
 that  you  get  per  month  on  Tinder  I  get 
 in  the  first  two  hours  of  after  creating
[15:52] an  account  and  I'm  not  bro  I'm  not  even 
 that  that  amazing  these  guys  who  are 
 above  me  who  literally  like  you  know  my
[15:58] monthly  income  or  something  they  make 
 overnight  you  can  see  this  [ __ ]  like 
 levels  to  this  [ __ ]  you  need  to  be
[16:03] exposed  this  is  the  issue  with  like  you 
 know  me  kind  of  telling  you  about  my 
 success  to  show  it  relative  to  yours  so
[16:08] you  can  think  oh  [ __ ]  that  guy's  so  much 
 more  successful  than  me  so  I  want  to  be 
 more  like  that  all  of  the  weak  people 
 are  gonna  get  offended  of  this  you  know 
 the  clean  the  guys  who  wear  like  clean
[16:13] shirts  and  they'll  be  watching  this 
 thinking  oh  that's  a  very  intellectual 
 you  should  be  have  humidity  like 
 humility  is  a  [ __ ]  awesome  thing  but
[16:18] people  confuse  it  bro  humility  and 
 humbleness  are  not  the  same  thing  I  am 
 not  a  humble  man  I  don't  think  being
[16:23] humble  is  a  good  thing  I  don't  think 
 being  humble  is  a  masculine  trait  being 
 humble  is  you  just  downplaying  your  real
[16:28] objective  success  of  the  world  humility 
 is  an  awesome  thing  humility  is  just 
 having  this  mindset  of  knowing  that
[16:33] there's  a  lot  more  progress  you  can  make 
 to  stay  a  student  to  keep  learning  have 
 lots  of  humility  sometimes  you  need  a 
 little  slap  in  the  face  to  just  tell  you
[16:38] bro  like  there's  so  much  more  that  you 
 need  to  improve  on  if  you're  struggling 
 with  girls  right  now  it's  not  because  of
[16:43] any  [ __ ]  circumstances  that  you  want 
 to  say  it's  not  because  you  live  in 
 India  and  it's  just  like  this  here  it's
[16:48] not  because  of  this  like  random  [ __ ] 
 circumstance  or  whatever  like  traits  you 
 want  to  bring  it  down  to  it's  simply 
 that  you  haven't  worked  hard  enough  in
[16:54] two  main  things  your  physique  and  your 
 success  build  them  too  and  also  you  know 
 with  that  comes  confidence  that's  an
[17:00] important  thing  to  build  up  but  build 
 them  too  and  you'll  be  doing  just  fine 
 so  the  fact  that  you're  watching  this 
 video  shows  me  that  you  haven't  done
[17:06] them  too  another  third  habit  that's 
 making  you  creepy  is  just  staring  and 
 this  is  particularly  true  if  you  stare
[17:12] at  her  body  now  I  think  if  you  hold 
 their  eye  contact  I  don't  really  think 
 that's  staring  like  it  could  be  you  know
[17:17] if  you  just  like  just  look  at  her  this 
 is  how  brown  guys  look  at  me  when  I  walk 
 past  them  like 
 no  smile  or  nothing
[17:23] and  then  when  I  get  like  sometimes  I'll 
 remember  okay  let  me  smile  I  smile  and 
 then  they  go 
 like  this  then  they'll  get  all  happy
[17:28] like  stuff  like  some  guys  will  literally 
 just  [ __ ]  stare  the  thing  is  if 
 you're  just  holding  your  eye  contact
[17:33] that's  a  good  thing  but  staring  looking 
 too  much  at  her  body  that  is  when  it 
 gets  creepy  and  that's  when  like  your
[17:38] attraction  lowers  and  again  this  is  so 
 interesting  because  a  Chad  a  really 
 attractive  guy  can  stare  at  a  woman's
[17:43] body  and  it  can  be  really  sexual  if  you 
 imagine  like  this  child  in  like  the  club 
 right  now  he  sees  some  girl  that  he's 
 attracted  to  he'll  like  he'll  I  [ __ ]  her
[17:49] body  bro  this  is  what  I  used  to  do  to 
 like  attract  girls  and  clubs  if  there 
 was  a  girl  that  I  liked  and  she  was 
 dressed  in  like  you  know  in  a  dress  or
[17:54] something  you  you  literally  make  it 
 known  that  you're  like  looking  up  and 
 down  and  that  can  seem  as  creepy  for 
 like  you  know  some  unattractive  guy  but
[18:00] if  you're  the  guy  who  she's  attracted  to 
 and  you  do  that  and  you  give  like  a 
 certain  little  look  where  you're  showing 
 oh  yeah  she's  she's  hot  that  honestly
[18:06] melts  some  girls  I  don't  think  this 
 video  is  that  good  because  honestly  in 
 the  end  all  it  just  matters  is  just  how
[18:11] attractive  you  are  the  barrier  to  the 
 actions  that  you  do  being  perceived  is 
 creepy  it's  just  linear  to  how  much  more
[18:17] self-improvement  you've  done  and  also 
 just  how  much  of  like  a  Chad  that  you 
 become  and  you  don't  have  to  become  the 
 ultimate  total  charge  you  don't  have  to
[18:22] become  like  this  10  out  of  10  guy  but  as 
 you  improve  your  looks  as  you  build  your 
 body  as  you  get  more  like  successful
[18:27] more  confident  as  you  get  better  at  like 
 grooming  yourself  through  all  the  other 
 things  that  I've  talked  about  I've  done
[18:32] like  a  full  Lux  maxing  guide  as  well 
 that  I'll  have  uh  linked  as  a  card  so 
 I've  done  like  a  full  40  minute  video  on
[18:37] like  how  to  improve  your  looks  the  more 
 you  improve  your  looks  the  more  things 
 you  can  do  which  are  actually  seen  as 
 attractive  instead  of  creepy  and
[18:42] throughout  this  video  I've  mentioned  the 
 importance  of  building  your  aesthetic 
 physique  if  you  want  to  get  the  workout 
 routine  that  will  build  the  most  sexy
[18:48] attractive  physique  they're  Linked  In 
 the  description  too  quick  and  watch  this 
 video  right  now  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
