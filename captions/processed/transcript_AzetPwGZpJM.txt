[00:00] uh  oh  jeffy's  getting  horny  you  know 
 what  that  means 
 nah  Jeffrey  doesn't  go  on  porno  he's  too
[00:06] far  gone  for  that  basic  Jeffrey  goes  on 
 to  4chan  to  find  his  special  videos  he 
 doesn't  realize  how  much  better  off  he'd
[00:11] be  if  he  got  onto  nofa  but  some  men  just 
 like  Jeffrey  don't  want  to  improve  let 
 me  walk  you  through  my  unfiltered
[00:17] jackathons  I'd  wake  up  late  on  the 
 weekends  and  immediately  grab  my  phone  I 
 start  scrolling  through  Reddit  with
[00:22] morning  breath  and  I'd  go  through  the 
 memes  and  political  posts  the  funny 
 videos  and  the  interesting  articles  and 
 oh  look  I'm  not  safe  for  work  post  Don't
[00:29] Mind  If  I  Do  ah  yes  the  r  stacked 
 subreddit  a  gentleman's  classic  I'm
[00:34] going  in  I  go  on  the  subreddit  post 
 after  post  I'm  dry  humping  my  bed  sheets 
 at  this  point  someone's  linked  this  porn
[00:40] star's  own  subreddit  I'm  going  deeper 
 into  the  rabbit  hole  first  nut  of  the 
 day  conquered  within  20  minutes  a  week
[00:45] in  I  [ __ ]  around  for  a  while scrolling 
 on  Reddit  playing  summoner's  war  on  my 
 phone  looking  at  gym  girls  glute
[00:50] workouts  on  Instagram  time  for  round  two 
 straight  on  to  Pornhub  remember  that
[00:55] Latina  made  video  with  a  guy  just  keeps 
 handing  her  money  to  undress  yeah  let  me 
 spend  30  minutes  trying  to  find  that  one
[01:00] particular  video  and  it  ended  up  being 
 in  360p  still  like  the  second  nut  of  the
[01:05] day  and  of  course  the  third  nut  comes  at 
 night  time  following  Jeffrey's  nighttime 
 routine  I  can't  sleep  without  fapping
[01:10] What  a  Sad  life  Adonis 
 Adonis  looks  around  in  shame  at  the  men
[01:15] of  today  he  sees  fat  lazy  undisciplined 
 unambitious  weak  men  who  over  indulge  in
[01:21] instant  gratification  he's  let  down  but 
 there  is  hope  Adonis  notices  a  small
[01:26] group  of  men  growing  larger  and  larger 
 this  group  of  men  say  [ __ ]  you  to  the 
 researcher  when  they're  offered  the
[01:31] first  marshmallow  in  the  experiments  and 
 even  the  second  marshmallow  we  don't 
 want  that  sugary  [ __ ]  we're  fasting
[01:37] we're  on  a  dopamine  detox  we  do  nofap 
 and  we  meditate  and  we  read  and  we 
 Journal  at  honest  Smiles  he's  impressed
[01:43] I've  jacked  off  twice  in  the  last  18 
 months  I  walk  around  and  I  look  at  some 
 guys  and  I  know  for  a  fact  that  some  of
[01:49] these  men  have  jacked  off  twice  this 
 morning  so  like  the  majority  of 
 teenagers  obviously  I  was  busting  a  lot 
 of  nuts  and  I  get  to  about  age  17  or  18
[01:56] and  a  lot  of  people  are  talking  about  no 
 fat  It's  Gonna  Make  You  levitate  and  you 
 can  hold  eye  contact  with  girls  and  you 
 really  want  to  hold  eye  contact  then
[02:01] girls  will  know  woman  attraction  and 
 [ __ ]  and  obviously  I'm  not  okay  that 
 sounds  sick  bro  let's  go  and  of  course  I
[02:06] get  to  like  day  one  or  two  and  I  relapse 
 and  I  go  again  I'm  okay  come  on  day  19 
 got  to  do  a  19  day  recycle  I  got  to  day
[02:11] three  okay  90  day  reset  okay  to  like  day 
 one  just  kept  on  resetting  kept  on 
 relapsing  kept  on  relapsing  I  remember
[02:16] that  I  would  always  relapse  because  I 
 never  really  changed  the  habit  of  when  I 
 would  fat  so  I'd  wake  up  and  I'd  be  on
[02:22] no  fat  but  I'd  just  scroll  on  Reddit  as 
 always  and  it's  almost  like  I  knew  what 
 I  was  searching  for  I  knew  what  I  was
[02:27] scrolling  for  hoping  to  see  but  I  didn't 
 want  to  like  consciously  admit  it  and 
 you'd  keep  scrolling  you  know  just  her
[02:32] I'm  just  looking  at  memes  I'm  just  oh 
 ass  I  mean  you  can  click  and  oh  look  and 
 I  would  like  just  pretty  much  try 
 humping  the  bed  sheets  and  [ __ ]  and  you
[02:37] know  like  essentially  acting  like  I'm 
 not  doing  the  thing  that  I'm  doing 
 because  I  didn't  have  like  the 
 accountability  for  it  and  so  I  failed  a
[02:43] bunch  of  times  like  I  literally  failed 
 for  a  while  on  nofap  but  I  started 
 making  some  changes  I  never  quit  I  knew
[02:49] for  a  fact  that  this  was  the  way  forward 
 and  it  literally  would  take  me  years  to 
 make  good  progress  on  nofap  and  that's
[02:55] one  of  the things  that  we're  going  to 
 discuss  later  in  this  video  but  that's 
 one  of  the  things  that  these  YouTubers 
 don't  tell  you  about  they  don't  give  you 
 like  realistic  expectations  they  sell
[03:01] you  this  [ __ ]  dream  of  like  the  nofap 
 benefits  timeline  but  they  don't  tell 
 you  that  to  be  good  on  nofap  takes  years
[03:06] and  so  I'm  gonna  give  you  like  a  mindset 
 lesson  later  on  So  eventually  I  started 
 getting  into  double  digit  IQ  and  I
[03:11] delete  Reddit  all  right  like  I  blocked 
 the  not  safe  for  work  posts  on  Reddit 
 until  now  I  can't  see  and  it's  like  one
[03:16] more  barrier  but  then  obviously  I  go 
 onto  Instagram  and  start  like  going 
 through  like  the  Instagram  models  when 
 you  click  on  a  model's  profile  you  like
[03:21] jack  off  to  the  pictures  for  a  bit  and 
 scroll  back  up  and  then  click  on  the 
 suggested  models  profile  and  you  ended 
 up  looking  at  some  like  Serbian  woman
[03:27] who's  posting  slightly  pictures  of 
 herself  because  her  family's  hungry  it's 
 kind  of  a  dark  road  to  go  down  bro  I'm 
 so  glad  that  I'm  not  a  [ __ ]  wanker
[03:33] anymore  like  some  a  big  Improvement  for 
 me  came  when  I  started  going  out  to
[03:38] nightclubs  and  parties  around  age  18  to 
 19.  I'm  actively  going  out  I'm  actively 
 like  kissing  girls  in  clubs  and
[03:43] everything  and  it  was  just  a  nice 
 mindset  switch  where  I  was  like  okay  I 
 can  be  the  little  loser  who  like  touches 
 himself  at  home  and  like  you  know
[03:49] busting  that  home  or  I  can  literally 
 just  save  up  for  the  girls  that  I  go  and 
 meet  outside  and  I  was  like  that  just
[03:54] got  me  like  way  more  motivated  for  it  I 
 got  into  this  idea  of  okay  I  want  to 
 have  like  a  full-on  like  massive  load
[03:59] bro  massive  load  when  I  like  bust  with  a 
 girl  that's  why  I  just  stopped  touching 
 myself  like  at  all  obviously  every  now
[04:04] and  then  every  few  days  I'll  still  be 
 doing  it  but  at  least  it  helps  push  me 
 in  the  right  direction  through  uni  it 
 was  pretty  much  the  same  thing  that  when
[04:09] I  was  actively  sleeping  with  girls  I 
 would  purposely  like  get  onto  nofap 
 absolutely  no  problem  and  so  this  was
[04:14] the  first  time  after  about  three  years 
 of  being  on  nofap  that  I  could  literally 
 get  weeks  at  a  time  no  problem  and  I
[04:21] wouldn't  like  actually  fap  of  course  I 
 could  not  have  sex  in  the  middle  and 
 everything  and  it  was  pretty  much  the 
 same  thing  for  a  long  time  whilst  I  was
[04:26] in  university  I  was  hooking  up  with  a 
 girl  like  every  few  weeks  or  so  so  I  was 
 just  kind  of  like  saving  my  nut  for  that
[04:31] and  I  remember  eventually  it  got  to  the 
 point  when  the  amount  of  girls  that  I 
 was  attracting  decreased  quite  a  lot
[04:36] because  I  gained  like  a  lot  of  weight 
 got  like  depression  and  anxiety  and  like 
 you  know  I  was  going  through  some  like 
 bad  started  going  out  less  and
[04:41] everything  and  so  of  course  I  almost 
 automatically  started  fapping  more  it's 
 like  a  very  interesting  like  linear
[04:46] correlation  with  that  interestingly  like 
 I  was  jacking  off  a  lot  when  I  was  like 
 living  with  a  girl  who  I  was  like
[04:51] sleeping  with  and  like  dating  and 
 everything  as  well  bro  when  you've  got 
 mental  health  problems  just  know  like 
 you're  a  wanker  like  you  are  100  gonna
[04:56] fat  more  it's  just  how  it  works  it's 
 very  interesting  like  even  if  you've  got 
 a  woman  to  sleep  with  in  literally  in
[05:01] the  same  room  or  the  next  room  to  you 
 you're  just  gonna  end  up  being  way  more 
 drawn  to  the  validation  and  the  intimacy
[05:06] the  fake  virtual  pixel  intimacy  that 
 porn  gives  you  because  you  can  get  an 
 unlimited  amount  of  like  variance  and
[05:12] it's  like  each  woman  you  watch  who's  you 
 know  undressing  and  looking  at  the 
 camera  who's  getting  pounded  and
[05:17] everything  and  you  visualize  yourself 
 pounding  her  that  feels  like  it  fills 
 the  gap  of  like  the  lack  of  love  that
[05:22] you  didn't  get  from  your  parents  or 
 whatever  your  trauma  is  wrong  we  went 
 kind  of  deep  there  but  it  is  the  truth 
 100  like  you  you  jack  off  because  you've
[05:28] got  some  mental  health  problems  100  is 
 the  truth  boys  eventually  I  move  out  of 
 the  city  that  you  know  I've  been  in  for
[05:33] the  last  few  years  for  University  I 
 moved  back  home  to  my  parents  house  I'm 
 on  full-on  dopamine  detox  monkey  mode 
 style  [ __ ]  I've  literally  did  not  touch
[05:39] my  dick  for  like  six  months  straight  I 
 started  sleeping  with  a  girl  and  I  buy 
 some  condoms  and  I  wanted  to  like  fully
[05:45] like  get  into  using  condoms  I  don't  know 
 some  people  say  it's  a  cult  honestly 
 like  because  I  had  been  on  nofap  six 
 months  straight  like  I  did  not  bust  for
[05:51] six  months  I  feel  like  I  had  the 
 conscious  like  strength  not  to  but  I  it 
 was  like  a  conscious  decision  too  fap
[05:56] that  day  with  a  condom  on  to  make  sure 
 it  was  a  completely  perfect  and  people 
 can  say  it's  a  quote  but  I  personally 
 don't  think  it  is  because  then  I  lasted
[06:02] about  another  six  months  without  fapping 
 so  I  don't  think  it  was  like  out  of 
 weakness  or  discipline  or  whatever  the
[06:07] condoms  it  was  actually  [ __ ]  sick 
 doing  this  and  it's  a  practice  I 
 recommend  kind  of  side  note  but  if 
 you're  gonna  start  [ __ ]  you've  never 
 been  given  sex  education  slow  that's
[06:14] weird  isn't  it  you've  never  been  given 
 sex  education  from  a  [ __ ]  you've  been 
 given  sex  education  from  like  the  60
[06:19] year  old  woman  who  comes  into  your 
 school  she's  had  sex  like  three  times  or 
 once  in  the  last  year  when  her  husband's
[06:24] behaved  and  done  all  of  his  chores  like 
 a  [ __ ]  mule  she  gives  like  Duty  sex 
 to  her  husband  once  a  year  or  something 
 for  his  birthday  you  need  to  be  given
[06:30] sex  education  from  like  an  actual  person 
 who  and  one  of  the  things  that  I  was 
 never  taught  in  school  in  the  sex
[06:35] education  class  or  even  like  read  it  or 
 anything  is  how  to  actually  find  the 
 right  condom  size  and  once  you  do  it's
[06:40] like  all  of  the  excuses  you  have  to  use 
 one  go  away  you  should  happily  use  one 
 the  reason  why  we  as  guys  don't  is 
 because  it's  just  kind  of  like  you  know
[06:45] it's  a  boner  kill  and  it's 
 psychologically  it's  just  kind  of  you 
 know  the  packaging  stick  it  on  and  stuff
[06:50] and  two  it's  like  a  physical  thing  of 
 like  it  doesn't  feel  as  good  when  you 
 find  your  right  size  both  of  those 
 problems  get  reversed  you  become  the  guy
[06:56] who's  like  it's  completely  vast  and 
 normal  for  you  to  put  one  on  fully 
 changes  your  mental  state  when  you're 
 actually  having  casual  sex  with  girls
[07:02] because  you  don't  feel  like  you're  at 
 risk  anymore  kind  of  off  track  if  you 
 want  to  find  out  your  condom  size 
 literally  just  like  Google  it  it's  like
[07:07] this  guides  and  everything  how  to  find 
 out  my  condom  size  you'll  find  out  like 
 the  nominal  Within  by  the  right  size  my 
 size  is  60  mm  in  the  nominal  with  so  you
[07:14] can  like  go  online  and  see  what  that  is 
 it's  too  big  for  some 
 that  sounded  way  way  more  gay  than  it
[07:20] had  to  be  should  I  do  I  have to  explain 
 oh  I'm  60  mm  boys  you'll  find  it  in  the
[07:25] extra  large  Department 
 so  I  tried  it  on  that  time  and  I  was
[07:30] like  fully  think  okay  I'm  gonna  bust  to 
 like  you  know  make  sure  it  feels  okay 
 and  it  did  it's  fine  then  I  literally 
 went  about  another  sort  of  like  six
[07:35] months  not  like  plan  myth  to  be  six 
 months  it  just  kind  of  happened  in  the 
 sense  that  I  then  had  phone  sex  with  a 
 girl  that  I  was  dating  so  we  were  fully
[07:41] like  in  a  relationship  and  everything 
 and  so  it  was  like  she  was  we  had 
 distance  between  us  while  she  was  on 
 like  a  trip  or  something  so  it's  like
[07:46] that  to  me  it's  like  you  can  see  it  as 
 like  fapping  but  it's  like  I  don't  feel 
 bad  about  those  moments  at  all  so  it's
[07:51] two  times  in  the  last  18  months  but  it 
 felt  like  it  was  under  my  control  in 
 this  sense  imagine  there's  two  men  in  a
[07:56] cage  and  there's  a  nice  juicy  steak 
 which  guy's  gonna  fight  harder  for  it 
 the  one  who's  full  on  McDonald's  the  guy
[08:02] who's  been  saving  up  that  hunger  the  guy 
 who's  fasting  of  course  the  guy's 
 fasting  if  you've  ever  fasted  before  if
[08:07] you've  done  intermittent  fasting  or 
 you've  done  like  if  it's  badass  if 
 you've  done  like  a  whole  day  water  fast 
 even  though  you  know  we  know  grilling
[08:12] works  you  get  less  hungry  and  everything 
 but  it's  like  it's  weird  you  turn  into 
 like  almost  Primal  in  a  sense  and  you
[08:18] like  it's  like  your  scent  your  ability 
 to  smell  and  salivate  literally  goes  up
[08:23] I  don't  know  about  anyone  else  but  when 
 I'm  smelling  so  I'm  like  paying  food 
 when  I'm  fasting  I  almost  envisioned 
 like  very  slightly  like  fighting  that
[08:29] person  for  that  food  like  it's  a  very 
 primal  thing  when  you  fasted  what  about 
 if  you  fast  from  ejaculation  from  porn
[08:34] from  sex  it's  the  exact  same  thing  if  as 
 men  we  do  most  if  not  all  of  our  actions
[08:39] to  reproduce  to  have  sex  right  a  lot  of 
 guys  oh  no  I  weight  lift  I  lift  weights
[08:44] for  me  Shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  okay  just 
 you're  a  dumbass  you  don't  even  like 
 have  the  level  of  awareness  to  know  that 
 you  have  like  subconscious  motivations
[08:50] of  course  you  you  dumbass  we  do  things 
 to  have  sex  to  reproduce  to  spread  our 
 seed  100  we  do  maybe  not  at  all  things
[08:56] but  it's  like  in  a  weird  way  me  making 
 this  nofap  video  right  now  is  still 
 somewhat  for  the  purpose  of  reproduction
[09:02] because  this  will  get  uploaded  to  my 
 YouTube  channel  the  YouTube  channel  will 
 grow  I'll  make  more  money  I'll  get  more 
 successful  I'll  be  able  to  attract  a
[09:07] meat  to  spread  my  seed  to  everything  we 
 do  is  somehow  linked  to  that  what  if 
 you've  simply  just  cut  off  the  last
[09:13] points  the  biggest  motivation  for  man 
 what  if  you  curse  it  off  because  when 
 you  jack  off  and  you  watch  porn  you  take
[09:19] that  huge  motivation  a  huge  drive  away 
 from  yourself  There's  an  actual  sexual 
 transmutation  which  it's  like  you  know
[09:25] it's  a  very  like  big  word  and  it's  like 
 defined  really  the  simple  thing  is  that 
 when  we  have  Sexual  Energy  we  use  it  if
[09:32] we  don't  have  someone  to  have  sex  with 
 right  now  when  we  feel  horny  if  you're 
 doing  the  right  things  it's  like  you
[09:37] start  to  work  on  the  things  that  would 
 eventually  get  you  that  person  to  have 
 sex  with  the  issue  with  fapping  and 
 having  sex  especially  casual  sex  is  that
[09:44] you  cut  off  that  ability  to  work  for 
 anything  you  don't  need  to  you've 
 already  achieved  the  height  of  like  male
[09:49] life  once  we've  achieved  this  pursuit  of 
 ejaculating  and  spreading  our  seed  it's 
 like  we  get  comfy  this  is  like  why  so
[09:54] many  guys  will  jack  off  last  thing  in 
 the  night  because  it  literally  makes  you 
 feel  lazy  it's  like  you  feel
[09:59] accomplished  it's  like  this  idea  of  like 
 yeah  like  I've  already  done  my  job  I 
 don't  need  to  like  do  anymore  I'm  tired
[10:04] I'm  fatigued  I'm  lethargic  you  get 
 depleted  you  get  drained  imagine  a  bull 
 like  the  bull  [ __ ]  what  happens  after
[10:09] it  gets  castrated  it  turns  into  like  a 
 docile  weak  pushover  you're  castrating
[10:14] yourself  it's  the  exact  same  thing  like 
 when  an  animal  gets  castrated  think 
 about  any  animal  right  now  any  pets  or
[10:19] anything  when  it  gets  castrated  its 
 balls  gets  chopped  off  it  stops  his 
 production  of  testosterone  it  stops  his
[10:24] ability  to  have  sex  and  to  reproduce  it 
 turns  into  like  a  dog  style  animal  it 
 turns  into  just  a  weak  pushover  feminine
[10:31] version  of  what  it  was  that's  what 
 you're  doing  to  yourself  you  are 
 castrating  yourself  if  you  have
[10:36] potential  which  you  hopefully  do  if 
 you're  watching  my  videos  but  most  men 
 do  have  potential  that's  the  thing  even
[10:41] if  you're  like  an  average  Chef  for  the 
 thing  is  most  men  have  potential  the 
 issue  is  that  most  men  don't  put  in  the 
 work  to  achieve  that  potential  because
[10:47] you  don't  need  to  because  our  potential 
 is  supposed  to  be  used  to  eventually 
 attract  the  mates  that  we  can  sleep  with
[10:52] that  we  can  reproduce  with  but  what  if 
 you  fooled  your  mind  and  your  body  to 
 already  think  that  you've  been
[10:57] reproducing  like  every  day  three  times  a 
 day  since  you're  like  13  years  old  and 
 the  way  that  it  seems  to  mess  up  your
[11:02] mind  with  the  dopamine  receptors  I  don't 
 know  I  don't  know  the  science  [ __ ]  okay 
 I'll  tell  you  the  truth  but  the  way  that 
 I  understand  it  is  that  we  have  only  a
[11:08] limited  amount  of  energy  and  sort  of 
 like  feel  good  hormone  in  us  we  want  to
[11:14] get  that  feel-good  hormone  from 
 something  productive  from  doing  our  work 
 when  you  hyper  trigger  this  feel-good
[11:20] home  or  this  dopamine  hormone  there's 
 like  less  of  it  available  to  motivate 
 you  to  then  do  that  hard  work  it's  the
[11:26] simple  concept  of  like  doing  a  bunch  of 
 easy  stuff  makes  the  hard  stuff  harder 
 even  though  it  stayed  exactly  the  same
[11:32] the  first  workout  after  a  long  time  off 
 always  feels  harder  than  like  the  70th
[11:37] workout  when  you've  been  going 
 consistently  you're  just  in  the  flow  of 
 things  it  doesn't  feel  exactly  hard 
 anymore  and  I'm  not  gonna  lie  fapid
[11:42] watching  porn  it  fully  gives  you  like 
 the  personality  of  a  loser  like  you 
 literally  feel  like  a  loser  like  there
[11:47] was  this  Dynamic  that  I  would  always 
 experience  when  I  used  to  go  out  to 
 nightclubs  and  parties  and  obviously
[11:52] everyone's  lying  if  they  say  that  the 
 ghost  of  those  places  to  not  [ __ ]  right 
 100  Bro  [ __ ]  you  right  [ __ ]  the  people
[11:58] who  lie  about this  if  you're  going  to 
 like  clubs  as  a  guy  bro  you're  trying  to 
 you  want  to  hook  up  with  a  girl  that 
 night  I'm  just  going  for  the  shutdown
[12:03] bro  just  go  for  the  music  go  for  the  DJ 
 like  that's  what  girls  say  bro  I'm  not 
 like  the  other  girls  I  dress  up  for
[12:09] myself  in  my  phone  shut  up  Eve  so  I'd  go 
 out  to  the  club  obviously  hoping  to  hook
[12:14] up  with  a  girl  that  day  you  know  I've 
 flirt  with  some  girls  oftentimes  I  would 
 make  up  with  them  and  everything  but 
 sometimes  like  a  fair  amount  of  times
[12:19] maybe  50  maybe  even  more  you  go  to  the 
 club  and  you  wouldn't  come  back  with  a 
 girl  you're  horny  it's  3am  you  really
[12:24] really  wanted  to  like  have  sex  tonight 
 you  remember  speaking  to  a  bunch  of 
 girls  you  you  had  the  sense  of 
 uncomfortability  when  you  saw  that  a
[12:30] girl  that  you  had  spoken  to  was  like 
 leaving  the  club  with  a  guy  so  what  do 
 you  do  now  well  of  course  you  know  the 
 last  call  on  Tinder  maybe  it's  3am  4am
[12:36] you  know  see  if  any  girls  are  active  on 
 there  and  maybe  message  a  few  girls  on 
 Instagram  depending  on  how  desperate  you
[12:41] are  but  eventually  you  end  up  checking 
 off  and  the  exact  same  Dynamic  happens 
 to  a  guy  who  for  example  like  you  know 
 sees  a  pretty  girl  on  Instagram  he
[12:46] messages  her  she  doesn't  reply  and  he 
 ends  up  like  jacking  off  to  her  pictures 
 I  think  about  what  that's  sending  in
[12:51] your  mind  like  oh  if  she  doesn't  want  me 
 I'll  just  myself  to  her  pictures  it  like
[12:56] fully  just  think  like  picture  this  in 
 your  mind  of  like  you  know  all  the  guys 
 have  been  out  tonight  to  try  and  get  a
[13:01] girl  some  of  the  guys  pull  you  know  some 
 like  tall  chats  or  whatever  they  end  up 
 taking  a  girl  home  and  it's  all  these
[13:06] like  little  loser  guys  who  come  home 
 dark  in  crusty  room  and  they  like  touch 
 themselves  instead  because  they  didn't
[13:11] get  managed  to  like  get  the  success 
 tonight  do  you  want  your  personality  to 
 get  closer  to  those  type  of  guys  because
[13:17] I'm  not  gonna  lie  bro  that's  some 
 [ __ ]  that's  cringe  like  beta  male 
 type  of  [ __ ]  and  I  know  some  people
[13:23] really  hate  the  phrase  beta  male  and 
 they're  like  oh  I'm  saying  bml's  cringe 
 you're  not  allowed  to  say  that  bro  I
[13:28] don't  give  a  [ __ ]  me  like  if  there's  a 
 beta  male  action  it's  masturbation  of 
 course  it  is  if  there's  one  thing  that
[13:34] fully  defines  the  beta  and  the  alpha  is 
 that  the  alpha  sleeps  with  the  girl  and 
 the  beta  jacks  off  whilst  watching  them
[13:39] through  like  the  little  people  just 
 watching  porn  and  jacking  off  bro  it's 
 [ __ ]  cringe  you're  literally  watching 
 a  video  of  the  woman  that  you  once  get
[13:46] [ __ ]  by  someone  else  I  wish  that  was 
 me  what  the  [ __ ]  is  like  exactly  the 
 same  as  watching  sports  you're  just  at
[13:52] the  displacing  yourself  visualizing  that 
 yourself  like  imagining  and  hoping  that 
 you  wear  this  other  guy  on  screen  stop
[13:58] displacing  yourself  stop  trying  to 
 imagine  I  wish  that  was  me  stop  trying 
 to  imagine  that  you're  the  guy  who's
[14:03] winning  putting  the  work  and  start 
 winning  yourself  what  a  disgusting  way 
 that  some  guys  are  living  life  in  the
[14:08] fingers  if  you're  watching  this  video 
 I'm  kind  of  ranting  against  you  but  the 
 chances  are  you  probably  already  know 
 about  nofap  and  stuff  I  just  had  a  bit
[14:14] of  a  rant  in  my  mind  I  was  sat  in  like  a 
 coffee  shop  and  I  was  literally  just 
 like  watching  people  go  by  and  it  was 
 quite  a  weird  time  because  I'm  a
[14:20] YouTuber  I  can  work  whenever  I  want  so 
 it  was  like  11  A.M  on  a  weekday  all  the
[14:25] young  people  of  course  are  like  in 
 University  in  schools  and  whatever  so  we 
 didn't  really  see  many  young  people  and
[14:30] there  was  just  like  older  people  40  50 
 60  70  whatever  of  you  know  age  people 
 going  past  and  I  was  literally  looking
[14:35] at  every  single  guy  and  I  was  thinking 
 like  100  of  these  guys  jack  off  100 
 there  was  one  attractive  guy  who  went
[14:41] past  and  you  know  what  I  guarantee  that 
 he  jacks  off  too  that's  this  is  what's 
 very  interesting  if  you  had  to  think
[14:46] what  type  of  guy  jacks  off  you  of  course 
 we  would  say  you  know  the  losers  the 
 betas  and  stuff  what's  very  very 
 interesting  you  might  see  this  is  that
[14:52] even  the  attractive  Chad  looking  type  of 
 guys  even  they  do  as  well  it's  very 
 interesting  isn't  it  even  the  type  of
[14:58] guys  who  for  example  would  have  a 
 girlfriend  even  the  type  of  guys  who  for 
 example  go  out  and  still  like  you  know 
 they  hook  up  with  girls  it's  like  a
[15:04] plague  that's  infested  all  types  of  men 
 apart  from  those  men  who  have  found 
 nofap  and  who  have  gotten  into  this
[15:09] culture  but  there  is  a  huge  huge  issue 
 with  being  in  this  like  community  of
[15:14] nofap  and  if  you're  watching  this  video 
 you're  probably  suffering  from  that  I 
 want  to  give  you  advice  on  nofap  because
[15:19] I'm  not  gonna  lie  like  when  I  see  these 
 videos  online  I'm  like  yo  these 
 YouTubers  don't  know  what  the  [ __ ] 
 they're  talking  about  they're  giving  you
[15:24] some  trash  advice  I  don't  think  these 
 YouTubers  practice  what  they  preach 
 whatsoever  when  I  I  look  at  nofap  advice 
 and  when  people  ask  me  advice  and
[15:29] they're  like  oh  but  this  guy's  video 
 says  this  I'm  like  what  the  f  people  are 
 coming  to  me  my  boys  are  coming  to  me 
 with  worse  mental  health  because  they
[15:35] got  onto  nofa  how  does  that  make  sense 
 because  you  got  onto  nofap  you  feel 
 worse  because  of  the  way  that  these  guys
[15:41] explain  it  online  the  nofaps  benefit 
 timeline  go  [ __ ]  yourself  there's  no 
 such  thing  as  a  notified  benefit  time
[15:46] like  that  date  96  or  the  day  13  I  [ __ ] 
 you  you  do  you  think  the  body  works  like 
 that  a  day  seven  and  a  half  you'll  get  a
[15:52] three  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  you'd  [ __ ] 
 dumb  I'm  tired  like  Rob  said  this  I've 
 raged  about  these  nofap  YouTubers  many
[15:58] times  because  they're  literally  giving 
 you  a  mental  illness  that  they  are  so 
 [ __ ]  toxic  with  this  idea  that  they
[16:03] do  it's  like  ah  I'm  on  day  7  000  and  if 
 you  relapse  then  you're  like  that's  what
[16:08] they  say  if  you  relapse  here's  all  these 
 benefits  here's  your  the  day  90  benefits 
 day  90  you'll  you'll  be  able  to  levitate
[16:14] but  if  you  relapse  you'll  lose 
 everything  think  about  how  disgusting 
 that  advice  is  if  you  relapse  you'll
[16:20] have  to  start  again  from  the  Nova 
 benefit  timeline  go  [ __ ]  yourself 
 imagine  how  deep  this  gets  into  the  mind 
 of  a  young  person  who's  watching  this
[16:26] imagine  saying  and  actually  she  making 
 an  obese  guy  believe  this  and  you  say 
 this  obese  fat  guy  use  okay  so  here's
[16:31] all  the  benefits  to  working  out  you'll 
 get  to  live  and  people  will  like  you  and 
 you  know  you'll  get  confidence  and  and
[16:36] your  heart  will  start  working  right  and 
 if  you  miss  a  workout  you  lose  all  of 
 these  benefits  imagine  saying  that  if
[16:42] you  go  one  day  without  working  out  you 
 lose  all  these  benefits  how  [ __ ]  does
[16:47] that  sound  that's  what  these  little 
 cringy  YouTubers  are  telling  you  these 
 nofap  YouTubers  every  single  one  that
[16:52] I've  seen  just  they  say  this  [ __ ]  to 
 you  that  if  you  relapse  you've  lost  all 
 the  benefits  it's  like  literally  it's
[16:57] like  saying  if  you  take  a  day  from  the 
 gym  you've  lost  all  of  the  gains  how 
 [ __ ]  stupid  is  that  and  it's  like
[17:02] it's  such  a  toxic  the  amount  of  young 
 guys  who  came  to  me  and  they  get  like 
 almost  in  tears  where  they're  like  I
[17:08] can't  get  to  day  90  it's  been  like  day 
 three  day  I  got  to  day  seven  and  like 
 they  start  getting  annoyed  I  got  to  day
[17:13] seven  and  I  relapsed  all  right  day  seven 
 is  an  accomplishment  so  you're  telling 
 me  in  the  last  eight  days  you  fap  once
[17:19] they're  like  yeah  how  many  times  did  you 
 use  the  fat  per  week  like  every  day 
 twice  a  day  do  you  not  see  like  the  huge
[17:24] [ __ ]  progress  that  you've  just  made 
 that  is  huge  progress  you  used  to  jack 
 off  every  single  day  let's  say  you  got
[17:29] to  day  three  and  you  relapse  right 
 [ __ ]  these  horrible  [ __ ] 
 will  tell  you  that  you  failed  and  you
[17:35] have  to  reset  your  progress  I  will  tell 
 you  any  good-hearted  person  will  tell 
 you  that  if  you've  got  to  day  three  and
[17:40] you've  relapse  on  day  three  that  means 
 that  over  three  days  you  [ __ ]  once 
 just  six  months  ago  over  three  days  you
[17:46] were  fapping  three  times  maybe  four 
 maybe  five  progress  you  have  to 
 understand  this  is  like  pawn  and
[17:52] masturbation  is  a  habit  that  you've  been 
 building  up  for  years  it  takes  months  if
[17:57] not  years  to  destroy  that  habit  it  took 
 me  five  years  to  destroy  it  for  a  solid 
 I  think  two  years  after  I  found  nofap  I
[18:04] could  barely  get  to  like  day  seven  it 
 was  only  when  I  stopped  counting  the 
 days  in  University  and  I  wasn't  sat
[18:09] there  like 
 etching  it  into  my  wall  with  a  knife  I'm 
 on  day  seven  I'm  so  close  to  the  nofap
[18:14] benefit  it's  time  like  [ __ ]  you  that's 
 when  it  started  getting  closer  and 
 closer  to  the  golden  point  of  no  fat
[18:19] that's  something  I've  mentioned  which  no 
 one  else  has  there  is  a  golden  point  of 
 no  fat  it's  the  ultimate  goal  to  get  to 
 the  golden  point  of  nofap  is  where  you
[18:26] forget  that  nofap  exists  it's  where  you 
 forget  the  porn  and  masturbation  is  like 
 even  a  thing  it's  like  every  now  and 
 then  when  I  see  the  word  nofap  and
[18:32] pulling  a  message  I'm  like  oh  yeah  like 
 that's  that's  the  thing  like  I 
 completely  forget  that  it's  like  a  thing 
 that  you  can  do  to  like  masturbate
[18:38] that's  the  best  case  scenario  the  issue 
 is  that  when  you  watch  all  these 
 YouTubers  you're  watching  this  video
[18:43] right  now  you  are  obsessed  with  this 
 you're  so  obsessed  that  you  can't  you're 
 literally  stopping  yourself  from  getting
[18:48] to  this  golden  Point  what  was  the 
 ultimate  goal  of  all  this  it  was  you 
 know  you  wanted  to  make  progress  you 
 wanted  to  get  the  nofap  benefits  right
[18:54] but  you  didn't  want  to  be  sat  there 
 constantly  overthinking  about  this  did 
 you  you  don't  want  to  be  sat  there 
 almost  feeling  like  a  full-time  job  in
[19:01] your  mind  like  don't  fap  today  I  wonder 
 when  the  next  time  I'm  gonna  relapse 
 don't  fap  today  don't  fap  today  or  when 
 I  wonder  when  I'm  gonna  see  a  trigger
[19:06] that  was  never  the  goal  we  wanted  to 
 almost  feel  immune  to  this  way  even  if 
 we  end  up  literally  being  faced  with
[19:11] porn  we  kind  of  like  don't  associate  it 
 with  jacking  off  the  issue  is  that  when 
 you're  in  the  middle  of  this  Cult  of
[19:16] nofa  and  I  say  my  server  on  my  channel 
 and  everything  I'm  doing  here  is  a  cult 
 like  I  openly  say  to  you  we're  literally
[19:21] in  a  cult  but  they're  Cults  like  the 
 nofap  cult  is  a  very  like  dirty  one 
 compared  to  what's  just  trying  to  be
[19:27] more  like  Adonis  that's  like  a  cult  that 
 they're  pushing  you  on  which  is  like  a 
 very  negative  one  where  they  make  you 
 feel  worse  when  you've  like  regressed  on
[19:33] their  [ __ ]  no  fat  benefit  timeline 
 [ __ ]  you  the  [ __ ]  cringy  videos  bro 
 like  anyone  with  a  like  I'm  not  even
[19:39] smart  bro  I'm  literally  I'm  not  even 
 smart  but  anyone  with  like  double  digit 
 IQ  knows  that  the  body  doesn't  work  on  a
[19:45] benefits  timeline  if  you  get  to  day  16 
 you'll  be  able  to  hold  eye  contact  a 
 woman  attraction  [ __ ]  you  woman
[19:50] attraction  women  can  tell  you  know  women 
 can  tell  that  you  feel  like  a  spurg  all
[19:55] of  it  is  almost  like  a  placebo  like 
 that's  the  biggest  part  of  it  right 
 there  is  absolutely  some  part  in  your
[20:00] physiological  system  that  changes  when 
 you  master  of  course  there  is  but  it's 
 not  anywhere  near  as  much  as  people  say
[20:05] now  I'm  literally  still  preaching  nofap 
 to  you  I'm  still  telling  you  to  get  onto 
 I'm  telling  you  that  we're  never  gonna 
 watch  porn  again  every  time  I  sort  of
[20:11] criticize  nofap  YouTubers  some  Spirit 
 comes  to  me  he's  like  oh  Hamza  is  wrong 
 because  because  porn's  really  bad  for
[20:16] you  yeah  no  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  we're 
 never  watching  porn  again  we're 
 preferably  going  to  drastically  or
[20:21] eliminate  our  fapping  too  but  you  need 
 to  understand  what  the  real  benefits  are 
 because  then  when  you  don't  experience
[20:27] the  [ __ ]  levitation  on  day  16  and  the 
 woman  attraction  and  like  every  woman's 
 wet  for  you  you  feel  weird  it's  like  the
[20:33] dynamic  of  when  you  start  lifting 
 weights  and  you  see  all  these 
 [ __ ]  lying  to  you  on  YouTube 
 it's  like  one  year  buddy  transformation
[20:38] in  these  [ __ ]  full-on  bodybuilder  at 
 this  point  and  you're  like  oh  that's 
 weird  because  I'm  six  months  in  and  I
[20:43] don't  really  look  that  difference 
 because  follow  me  with  the  same  example 
 it  would  be  so  useful  for  you  when  you 
 start  weightlifting  to  find  a  very
[20:49] realistic  natural  weight  lifters  body 
 transformation  because  sometimes  you'll 
 click  on  these  body  Transformations  and
[20:55] people  have  said  this  to  me  like  Sam  our 
 own  videos  has  said  this  but  he  would 
 see  other  people's  body  Transformations 
 and  they'd  get  [ __ ]  huge  in  the  first
[21:01] year  and  two  years  and  three  years  and 
 of  course  then  you're  gonna  feel  worse 
 you're  gonna  start  questioning  things 
 your  mind's  gonna  start  like  playing  on
[21:06] you  you're  gonna  literally  give  yourself 
 like  so  much  extra  stress  the  issue  with 
 all  these  YouTubers  and  they  say  in  this
[21:12] [ __ ]  like  all  the  women  will  know 
 and  stuff  it's  like  you  absolutely  will 
 give  off  a  different  vibe  compared  to
[21:17] the  guy  who's  like  watching  porn  is  you 
 know  he's  got  a  [ __ ]  up  mental  health 
 of  course  you  will  but  the  biggest 
 benefit  of  nofap  I  promise  you  people
[21:23] are  going  to  disagree  with  this  but  I 
 promise  you  the  biggest  benefit  is  the 
 placebo  it's  that  you  think  it's  going
[21:29] to  make  women  hold  eye  contact  with  you 
 you've  been  told  so  many  times  women 
 attraction  women  gonna  hold  eye  contact
[21:34] so  when  you  get  to  day  three  you  just 
 notice  it  more  it's  almost  like  you're 
 looking  out  for  it  more  and  you  end  up
[21:39] of  course  holding  eye  contact  with  more 
 girls  because  you're  actually  trying  to 
 do  it  because  you  almost  feel  like  you
[21:44] deserve  it  at  that  point  what  if  we 
 shortcut  the  process  what  if  we  give  you 
 that  Placebo  right  now  I'm  telling  you
[21:49] right  now  like  no  woman  on  the  street  is 
 like  sensing  that  you  haven't  bust  a  nut 
 it  would  be  the  other  way  around  if  it 
 had  to  be  something  like  this  then  in  an
[21:55] evolutionary  standard  the  women  wouldn't 
 pay  more  attention  to  the  guy  who  seems 
 to  have  already  been  drained  because
[22:01] it's  almost  like  oh  like  why  is  he 
 busting  that  like  some  woman's  you  know 
 taking  his  seed  which  must  mean  that 
 he's  got  like  The  evolutionary  like
[22:07] traits  that  is  good  enough  for  one  woman 
 so  it  might  be  good  enough  for  me  like 
 having  a  built-up  amount  of  semen  would
[22:13] be  an  evolution  very  disadvantage  for 
 men  so  busting  would  make  you  more
[22:18] attractive  to  girls  I've  just  disproved 
 them  but  I'm  just  saying  real  fast  at 
 home  I'm  not  saying  no  Fabs  bad  you 
 [ __ ]  dumbass  right  I'm  saying  to
[22:23] still  get  onto  it  still  absolutely  never 
 ever  watch  porn  never  watching  that  ever
[22:28] again  bro  but  just  have  way  more 
 realistic  standards  maybe  I  have  to  do 
 my  own  [ __ ]  no  Fabs  benefit  time  on
[22:33] the  timeline  but  honestly  it's  kind  of  a 
 mood  kill  because  you  know  everyone's 
 told  you  that  it's  gonna  make  you  money
[22:38] and  everything  but  really  the  biggest 
 benefit  practically  is  the  time  saved 
 that  it's  just  the  truth  you  save  a
[22:44] solid  few  hours  a  week  which  is 
 extremely  valuable  you'll  probably  save 
 about  five  hours  every  single  week  which
[22:49] is  actually  like  a  ridiculous  amount  of 
 time  that  you'll  save  obviously  like 
 you're  combust  the  nut  within  like  a 
 minute  but  like  oftentimes  you'll
[22:55] probably  agree  with  this  when  you're 
 jacking  off  you  don't  like  just  do  it 
 fast  as  possible  you  kind  of  edge  out  a 
 bit  you  that  you  search  for  the  proper
[23:00] video  you  end  up  scrolling  way  more  if 
 it's  completely  out  of  your  life  you 
 save  a  solid  few  hours  a  week  which  is  a 
 huge  advantage  that's  probably  the  best
[23:06] advantage  that  there  is  now  there  is
