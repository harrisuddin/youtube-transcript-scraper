[00:00] he's  finally  texted  me  after  four  days 
 yes  I'm  gonna  respond  straight  away 
 that'll  get  her  I'll  do  it  Jeffrey  don't
[00:05] do  it  no  response  yet  and  so  Jeffrey 
 starts  to  stalk  her  Instagram  story 
 she's  with  another  guy  oh  yeah  he  he's
[00:12] just  they're  just  friends  yeah  they're 
 just  friends 
 oh  [ __ ]  that  just  that  just  gave  me  a
[00:19] [ __ ]  redfill  bro  I'm  gonna  stop  the 
 [ __ ]  intro  right  here  there  was  a 
 girl  like  I  sound  horrible  by  saying 
 this  but  she  had  like  more  of  a  beta
[00:25] male  version  of  me  like  he  looked  like 
 me  but  less  attractive  and  less 
 confident  and  he  and  her  had  a  48  day
[00:32] Snapchat  streak  like  story  thing  like  so 
 they  had  texted  each  other  every  single 
 day  for  48  days  which  is  like  what  two
[00:38] months  almost  and  every  single  time  she 
 would  put  me  on  her  story  at  night  time 
 in  the  back  of  her  car  he  would  start
[00:44] blown  up  if  I  was  there  and  every  single 
 time  I  would  see  her  even  be  repulsed  by
[00:49] this  guy's  messages  and  send  him  the 
 same  messages  back  what  tanza  he's  just 
 my  friend  I  was  just  her  friend  and  she
[00:54] was  naked  when  she  sent  that  message  to 
 him  Adonis 
 Adonis  notices  Anastasia  walking  past
[01:00] him  he  gives  her  a  confident  smile  even 
 a  little  wing  and  then  he  goes  right
[01:05] back  to  his  work  Anastasia  is  left 
 wondering  why  he  isn't  running  up  to  her 
 like  all  of  the  Jeffries  but  it  makes
[01:11] sense  he  is  the  ultimate  male  after  all 
 and  work  is  his  priority  she's  waiting
[01:16] and  waiting  and  waiting  for  his  text 
 message  and  when  it  finally  comes  my  God 
 what  a  text  that  is  instantly  she  is  so
[01:22] excited  to  see  him  how  did  Adonis 
 command  this  much  attraction  from
[01:27] Anastasia  just  from  his  singular  text 
 message  that's  what  Adonis  is  going  to 
 teach  us  today  before  we  begin  you  need
[01:33] to  admit  that  you  are  someone  who 
 probably  needs  this  advice  in  this  video 
 you  need  to  hold  your  hand  up  right  now
[01:38] because  most  guys  can't  do  this  most 
 guys  are  Jeffries  and  they  can't  even 
 admit  that  they're  not  like  excellent  in 
 a  certain  area  you  need  to  hold  your
[01:44] hand  up  and  say  you  know  what  I  often  do 
 get  into  dry  conversations  through  text 
 I  often  do  text  the  girl  and  the
[01:49] attraction  that  we  may  have  had  just 
 diminishes  because  I'm  not  amazing  at 
 texting  before  I've  never  really
[01:54] actively  improved  my  texting  game  I  just 
 text  however  my  default  Jeffrey  brain
[01:59] tells  me  to  do  and  it's  not  been  that 
 effective  so  far  if  you  can  relate  to 
 that  experience  you  need  to  hold  your
[02:04] hand  up  and  just  kind  of  say  like  yeah 
 you  know  what  I  kind  of  need  this  video 
 most  guys  will  never  do  this  they've  got 
 this  arrogant  sense  of  like  yeah  I'm  so
[02:10] sick  a  girl  should  like  me  and  they're 
 lonely  they  stay  like  that  forever  when 
 I  was  17  18  19  21  22  I  totally  admitted
[02:16] to  myself  that  I  wasn't  good  with  girls 
 and  that  I  need  to  constantly  keep 
 improving  so  that  I  could  get  what  I
[02:21] want  which  was  love  and  relationships  I 
 had  that  humility  to  hold  my  hand  up  and
[02:26] say  I  need  to  improve  this  area  of  my 
 life  and  that's  why  I  made  progress  the 
 three  secrets  that  we're  gonna  cover  and
[02:31] one  of  these  is  my  best  one  my  personal 
 one  that  no  one  has  ever  told  you  about 
 because  it's  gonna  seem  so  silly  that
[02:37] every  other  YouTuber  every  other  person 
 you've  ever  asked  for  dating  advice 
 they'll  think  that  it's  weird  you  try  it 
 once  and  you'll  be  like  oh  [ __ ]  okay
[02:42] this  is  how  I'm  gonna  text  for  the  rest 
 of  my  life  my  friend  Sam  has  done  this 
 and  every  single  time  he  uses  this
[02:47] certain  like  tactic  that  I  taught  him  he 
 always  comes  to  me  like  we  always  laugh 
 about  how  stupid  it  is  but  how  it  just 
 has  worked  to  actually  get  what  we  want
[02:54] most  guys  will  never  have  the  confidence 
 to  do  it  because  it  seems  a  bit  weird 
 but  first  of  all  the  first  secret  to 
 avoiding  dry  conversations  and  this  was
[03:00] something  that  I  did  so  many  times  stop 
 asking  boring  ass  questions  never  ever 
 will  you  ever  ask  a  girl  trust  me  never
[03:06] ask  a  girl  ever  again  what  are  you  up  to 
 haha  that  used  to  be  my  first  message
[03:11] that  I  would  send  to  girls  on  Tinder  I 
 remember  that  I  finally  got  two  matches 
 on  Cinder  bro  I  made  my  account  it  took 
 me  like  three  days  this  was  you  know  16
[03:17] 17  years  old  I  got  two  matches  of  girls 
 that  weren't  even  attractive  and  I  sent 
 them  both  what  you  up  to  haha  both  of
[03:23] them  disappeared  the  next  time  I  opened 
 the  app  and  I  was  like  no  no  you  know  if 
 one  disappeared  she  could  have  unmatched
[03:28] me  but  there's  no  way  that  both  of  them 
 would  match  me  broke  I  went  on  to  the 
 other  little  Cog  icon  I  clicked  on  that
[03:33] went  on  to  the  help  I  sent  their  tech 
 support  a  ticket  saying  that  I've 
 mysteriously  lost  my  matches  I'm  gonna
[03:39] say  that  again  my  texting  was  so  dry 
 that  I  lost  both  of  my  matches  in  an
[03:44] event  that  felt  like  there  was  a  tech 
 issue  never  ever  will  you  ever  ask  the 
 girl  hey  what  you  doing  haha  there  was
[03:50] another  girl  that  I  met  from  Tinder  I 
 told  this  story  just  recently  and  my 
 friend  helped  me  to  get  her  phone  number 
 like  I  asked  them  what  to  say  I  got  a
[03:55] phone  number  and  our  conversation  like 
 it  actually  like  you  know  was  very  for  a 
 long  period  of  time  because  she  kept  she
[04:00] never  rejected  me  she  just  you  know  gave 
 me  dry  conversation  and  every  single  day 
 I  would  message  her  hey  what  are  you 
 doing  and  she  would  literally  reply  TV
[04:06] space  you  the  letter  U  question  mark 
 XXX
[04:12] do  you  think  I  ever  even  met  her  in 
 person  never  mind  even  dating  her  or 
 sleeping  with  her  obviously  not  the  guy
[04:18] that  these  girls  are  sleeping  with  are 
 not  asking  them  these  boring  ass 
 questions  like  taking  an  interest  in 
 their  lives  I  know  that  seems  silly
[04:23] because  I  know  that  every  other  piece  of 
 advice  that  you've  probably  seen  online 
 what's  like  that  the  blue  pill  good  boy
[04:28] feeling  that  all  these  other  people  have 
 told  you  on  how  to  attract  girls 
 no  absolutely  not  I'm  telling  you right
[04:34] now  that's  not  the  way  to  attract  a  girl 
 at  all  think  about  it  what  is  the  usual 
 common  experience  of  a  girl  who's  kind
[04:39] of  annoyed  at  the  guy  who  keeps  [ __ ] 
 her  and  won't  commit  that  kind  of  guy  is 
 he  there  like  taking  an  interest  oh  my
[04:44] God  okay  so  you've  got  science  class  and 
 then  Matt's  class  and  then  you've  got  to 
 watch  Steve  no  he's  literally  just
[04:49] taking  an  interest  in  himself  that  kind 
 of  guy  is  quite  selfish  and  the  thing  is 
 women  will  ever  be  able  to  openly  admit
[04:54] these  things  this  is  why  we  don't  ever 
 take  advice  from  women  in  terms  of 
 dating  because  most  women  I  say  about  99 
 can't  really  pinpoint  what  they're
[05:00] actually  attracted  to  women  will  say  oh 
 you  know  I  really  want  the  guy  who  cares 
 about  me  every  guy  that  they're  [ __ ] 
 is  quite  selfish  and  self-interested  so
[05:06] asking  these  questions  to  take  an 
 interest  in  their  life  it's  not  what  the 
 guys  are  doing  that  she's  actually 
 falling  for  so  what  are  they  doing  well
[05:11] they're  using  secret  number  two  which  is 
 to  be  playful  flirty  and  sexual  these
[05:16] guys  are  not  asking  her  these  dry 
 questions  like  oh  wait  what  are  you 
 gonna  do  after  science  club  the  kind  of 
 guys  that  are  actually  sleeping  with
[05:22] these  girls  actually  dating  these  girls 
 these  girls  are  obsessed  with  these 
 girls  are  like  crying  because  this  guy's 
 not  replying  guess  what  these  guys
[05:27] actually  are  like  they  don't  care  about 
 what  she's  doing  they're  just  having 
 like  a  fun  time  messaging  her  and  like
[05:32] playing  around  with  her  so  so  far  we've 
 covered  that  you're  not  gonna  act  like 
 the  guys  who  get  left  on  red  which  are 
 taking  an  interest  in  life  because
[05:37] that's  not  attractive  even  though  every 
 girl  will  tell  you  it  is  it's  so  weird 
 because  it's  like  I'm  telling  you  to  do 
 something  which  girls  will  tell  you
[05:42] doesn't  work  and  yeah  it  will  work 
 you'll  never  find  a  girl  who's  totally 
 obsessed  with  the  guy  who  takes  an 
 interest  in  their  lives  just  as  simple
[05:47] as  that  if  there  is  anyone  like  that  if 
 there  is  any  relationships  like  that 
 it's  usually  that  the  guy's  really 
 feminine  the  girl's  really  masculine  and
[05:52] the  guy's  just  obsessed  with  her  and 
 while  she  wants  to  go  and  do  her  career 
 and  [ __ ]  which  probably  isn't  the  kind 
 of  relationship  that  you  want  if  you're
[05:57] a  masculine  guy  when  a  feminine  woman  if 
 you  want  a  woman  who's  more  taking  an 
 interest  in  you  whilst  you  take  an 
 interest  in  your  work  so  the  way  to  then
[06:03] text  the  girl  is  to  always  hold  this 
 kind  of  like  funny  flirty  playful 
 attitude  when  you  text  that  there's  no
[06:09] dry  oh  what  are  you gonna  do  it's  more 
 like  I  bet  you're  stepping  on  snails 
 right  now  that's  a  [ __ ]  random  one  I
[06:14] bet  like  that's  let's  just  just  try  that 
 bro  instead  of  ever  asking  to  go  oh  what 
 are  you  doing  right  now  literally  just
[06:19] send  another  message  I  bet  you're 
 stepping  on  snails  right  now  I'm  gonna 
 send  that  as  your  first  Tinder  message  I
[06:24] guarantee  you'll  get  more  responses  then 
 hey  how  are  you  doing  to  attract  a  woman 
 it  isn't  even  about  making  her  like  you
[06:30] every  guy  who's  actually  successful  with 
 women  knows  this  and  every  guy  who's  not 
 good  with  women  maybe  you  doesn't  know 
 this  every  [ __ ]  boy  every  player  the
[06:37] guys  who  have  been  Ultra  successful  with 
 women  know  what  it  is  you  don't  have  to 
 make  a  woman  like  you  you  just  have  to 
 make  a  woman  emotionally  invested  into
[06:43] you  you  have  to  Simply  make  her  think 
 more  about  you  and  she  will  fall  for  you
[06:48] it's  as  simple  as  that  you  have  to  take 
 up  more  brain  space  for  her  the  little 
 chump  who's  one  dimensional  and  takes  an
[06:53] interest  in  her  and  just  asks  her  how 
 she's  doing  well  he  doesn't  take  up  that 
 space  because  she's  just  thinking  oh 
 yeah  it's  boring  Chomp  he's  not
[06:58] mysterious  is  yep  that's  what  I  expected 
 him  to  say  I  expected  him  to  send  me  a 
 chumpy  message  he  did  okay  sweet  so 
 you're  not  confirmed  no  need  to  think
[07:04] about  him  anymore  but  Chad  why  won't  he 
 reply  back  and  why  did  he  just  reply 
 back  with  like  a  seemingly  insult  now
[07:10] she's  thinking  about  this  Chad  guy  and 
 she's  taking  a  screenshot  sending  it  to 
 her  friends  like  what  does  this  mean  did 
 she  say  he  said  that  I'm  stepping  on
[07:15] snails  what  does  he  mean  you  make  her 
 think  about  something  you  act  playful 
 and  flirty  and  a  little  bit  sexual  I  bet
[07:21] you're  watching  step  brother  porn  right 
 now  now  obviously  you've  got  to  kind  of 
 know  your  audience  and  you  don't  want  to
[07:26] do  this  with  some  girls  offended  or 
 something  but  the  thing  is  the  guy  who's 
 actually  getting  this  girl  doesn't  even
[07:31] give  a  [ __ ]  if  she's  offended  you  don't 
 need  to  like  steal  my  lines  but  you  need 
 to  just  come  up  with  something  that 
 actually  makes  you  laugh  the  whole  point
[07:36] of  this  is  that  you're  this  like 
 authentic  high  value  guy  who's  literally 
 just  doing  whatever  you  want  so  don't
[07:41] just  completely  copy  my  sentences  but 
 find  something  that  literally  makes  you 
 laugh  like  you  can't  stop  laughing  as
[07:46] you're  about  to  send  it  to  her  like 
 you're  just  playing  with  it  you're  just 
 teasing  her  and  when  you've  done  that  I 
 guarantee  that  if  this  girl  is  actually
[07:51] attracted  to  your  normal  natural 
 masculine  energy  she's  gonna  be  totally 
 into  you  she's  gonna  text  you  back
[07:56] something  great  and  she's  gonna  take  an 
 interest  in  you  and  this  is  actually 
 where  most  guys  [ __ ]  up  so  you  may  have
[08:01] done  this  before  you  may  have  actually 
 been  quite  attractive  to  a  girl  she's 
 actually  texting  you  she's  interested  in 
 you  it  seems  all  great  you  might  even  go
[08:07] meet  up  and  then  she  just  kind  of 
 disappears  she  stops  replying  she  starts 
 ghosting  you  so  many  guys  have  been
[08:12] through  this  and  they  don't  realize  the 
 most  important  secret  that  we  need  to 
 cover  which  is  my  special  one  which  will
[08:17] save  you  from  this  experience  of  you 
 know  actually  doing  well  with  a  girl  and 
 then  falling  off  the  guys  who  know  what
[08:22] to  do  at  this  point  usually  won't  tell 
 you  because  you  know  if  I  tell  you  this 
 you're  gonna  start  like  taking  more 
 girls  and  I  don't  want  you  to  do  that 
 but  you  know  what  I'm  gonna  tell  you  and
[08:28] it's  gonna  seem  weird  and  you're  not 
 going  to  implement  it  but  maybe  one 
 percent  of  people  who  watch  this  video 
 are  gonna  implemented  actually  think 
 okay  [ __ ]  I'm  gonna  use  this  tactic  for
[08:33] the  rest  of  my  life  and  are  you  ready 
 secret  number  three  and  the  most 
 important  most  weird  that  you're 
 probably  not  going  to  implement  because
[08:38] you're  too  soft  for  this  do  not  let  her 
 burn  the  conversation  to  the  ground
[08:43] quite  frankly  a  lot  of  girls  are  boring 
 as  [ __ ]  most  guys  will  let  a  woman  take
[08:48] the  lead  a  girl  will  take  interest  in 
 them  you  know  the  guy  said  something 
 nice  so  the  guys  look  attractive  and  the
[08:53] girl  will  send  them  a  message  like  also 
 what  are  you  up  to  right  now  hey  how  you 
 doing  the  girl  will  ask  these  questions 
 and  guys  will  get  they  oh  my  God  guys
[08:59] she's  asking  me  a  question  well  she's 
 taking  it  inside  yeah  I'm  good  how  are 
 you  no  reply  she  sent  you  a  message
[09:04] asking  how  you  are  you  reply  because  you 
 know  she's  just  taking  an  interest  in 
 you  and  then  she  doesn't  reply  to  you
[09:09] what  most  guys  don't  understand  what  the 
 [ __ ]  just  happened  because  some  girls 
 when  they  start  to  lead  the  text  message
[09:14] conversation  and  they  start  to  ask  you 
 the  question  and  it's  natural  for  you  to 
 answer  and  then  ask  them  oh  what  are  you
[09:19] what  do  you  think  about  the  same  topic 
 it  is  boring  guess  what  most  guys  would 
 do  and  it's  the  worst  thing  possible  to
[09:24] do  to  maintain  or  even  grow  her 
 attraction  it's  something  that  you  do 
 all  the  time  even  though  it  seems  Common 
 Sense  she  asks  a  question  guess  what
[09:30] most  guys  do  they  answer  the  question 
 most  guys  by  answering  her  shitty  boring
[09:35] question  will  make  the  conversation  just 
 die  out  because  now  you're  in  this 
 boring  conversation  about  oh  how  are  you
[09:40] do  you  want  to  know  what  secret  number 
 three  actually  looks  like  in  a  practical 
 sense  and  you  might  not  even  have  the 
 confidence  to  do  this  because  it  seems
[09:45] quite  socially  abnormal  she  will  ask  you 
 a  boring  ass  question  this  will  come  up 
 it's  almost  a  trap  and  you  move  on  as  if
[09:50] she  hasn't  even  said  that  you  just  move 
 on  to  the  next  thing  that  you  wanted  to 
 say  what  are  you doing  tonight  are  you 
 free  at  6pm  it's  gonna  seem  a  little  bit
[09:56] like  you're  autistic  this  is  why  most 
 guys  don't  have  the  confidence  for  this 
 she's  going  to  ask  you  a  question  and 
 the  normal  social  thing  to  do  is  to
[10:01] respond  to  the  question  and  move  on  no 
 no  she's  going  to  ask  this  boring  ass 
 question  and  you're  going  to  reply  with
[10:06] something  that's  just  instantly  more 
 exciting  and  attractive  even  though  it 
 seems  like  it's  so  weird  like  you've  not
[10:11] answered  this  question  girls  are  so 
 attracted  to  a  guy  who  does  this  that 
 they  don't  even  usually  pick  up  on  this 
 sometimes  a  girl  will  play  oh  you  didn't
[10:17] ask  my  question  secret  number  three 
 which  I'm  sure  that  most  guys  are  never 
 going  to  use  because  you  need  a  level  of
[10:22] confidence  for  this  most  guys  are 
 [ __ ]  honestly  it's  probably  you  I'm 
 not  gonna  lie  it  probably  is  you  right 
 just  probably  this  but  if  you  weren't  a
[10:28] [ __ ]  and  if  you  really  wanted  to  get 
 this  girl  you  wouldn't  allow  her  to  burn 
 the  conversation  to  the  ground  and  she
[10:33] doesn't  really  mean  to  do  this  when  a 
 girl  takes  an  interest  in  you  and  asks 
 you questions  that's  a  good  sign  but 
 most  guys  take  that  good  sign  and  they
[10:38] ruin  it  by  answering  her  question  and 
 then  the  conversation  just  stands  out 
 the  best  thing  you  can  do  when  she  asks 
 you  a  question  that's  gonna  lead  to  a
[10:44] boring  part  of  the  conversation  just 
 ignore  it  completely  ignore  it 
 completely  send  a  message  as  if  you've
[10:49] not  even  seen  that  straight  away  when 
 she  sent  you  some  boring  ass  [ __ ]  a 
 question  you  reply  with  the  secret 
 number  two  like  a  quick  statement
[10:54] accusation  like  a  little  playful  thing 
 like  hey  how  are  you  I  bet  you're 
 watching  Step  Brothers  porn  right  now
[10:59] just  because  it's  literally  she's  gonna 
 remember  you  so  much  more  than  the 
 [ __ ]  Dewey  who  replies  yeah  I'm  good
[11:05] how  are  you  honestly  you  want  the  best 
 secrets  for  getting  girls  secret  number 
 four  bonus  secret  just  make  her
[11:10] emotionally  invested  in  you  do  whatever 
 it  takes  to  make  her  think  about  you  the 
 most  most  guys  most  girls  will  never  be
[11:16] able  to  tell  you  this  even  the  guys  who 
 do  this  themselves  don't  even  know  what 
 they're  doing  I'm  telling  you  right  now 
 there  is  one  secret  way  one  absolute  way
[11:21] to  make  a  girl  obsessed  with  you  just 
 make  her  think  about  you  all  the  time 
 most  guys  are  too  impossy  for  this  and

 Chads  the  real  [ __ ]  boys  the  real 
 players  the  guy  who  gets  so  many  girls
