[00:00] Jeffrey  neurotically  cares  what  other 
 people  think  of  him  he  keeps  posting 
 support  on  his  social  media  for  the
[00:05] current  thing  even  though  he  doesn't 
 even  believe  in  it  if  I  don't  show  my 
 support  for  this  trend  then  people  will
[00:10] stop  talking  to  me  but  Jeffrey  those 
 people  don't  even  like  you  anyway  now 
 fair  enough  if  you  are  gonna  change
[00:15] yourself  for  those  that  love  you  like 
 your  family  or  your  close  friends  fine 
 but  caring  so  much  about  these  random
[00:21] strangers  who  not  only  don't  even  like 
 you  some  of  them  actually  dislike  you 
 you're  wasting  your  time  Jeffrey  Adonis
[00:29] I  thought  I  just  couldn't  care  less  what 
 a  stranger  thinks  of  him  he  is  only 
 concerned  with  the  criticism  and
[00:34] feedback  of  his  tribe  a  fat  ugly  British 
 man  shouted  Adonis  from  the  pub  but  why 
 would  Adonis  care  that  man  has  achieved
[00:40] nothing  he  keeps  on  walking  I  don't  know 
 about  you  bro  but  I've  gave  far  too  many 
 to  my  life  and  this  is  how  we're  gonna
[00:46] organize  it  because  you  know  there's 
 like  this  community  online  of  guys  who 
 don't  care  you  know  Sigma  male  guys 
 obviously  they're  like  they're  [ __ ]
[00:51] cringe  bro  there's  a  way  to  not  care 
 about  what  people  think  and  most  people 
 haven't  done  this  right  most  people  try
[00:56] to  think  like  oh  yeah  I  want  to  stop 
 caring  what  the  people  think  that's 
 psychotic  that's  actually  like  there's 
 got  to  be  something  wrong  with  you  this
[01:01] seems  weird  for  this  video  but  it's  got 
 to  be  something  wrong  with  you  if  you 
 have  this  desire  to  not  care  what  anyone
[01:06] thinks  of  you  in  this  video  is  not  that 
 we're  trying  to  not  care  about  what 
 anyone  thinks  of  us  it's  that  we're 
 trying  to  not  care  of  what  these  random
[01:12] quite  frankly  irrelevant  Strangers  think 
 of  us  you  will  always  and  you  should 
 always  care  about  what  the  people  in
[01:18] your  tribe  think  of  you  and  that's  a 
 fantastic  mechanism  built  inside  of 
 humans  we're  naturally  just  aligned  to
[01:23] what  our  tribe  our  family  friends  our 
 close  people  think  of  us  and  with  that 
 we  calibrate  and  start  becoming  more
[01:28] valuable  to  the  try  right  that's  a 
 really  good  thing  never  ever  get  upset 
 that  you  care  about  someone  in  your
[01:34] tribe  the  reason  why  like  I've  built 
 this  success  is  because  I  genuinely  care 
 what  you  think  of  me  I  might  be  the
[01:39] first  like  man  that  you've  ever  seen  say 
 this  I  genuinely  care  what  my  like 
 YouTube  viewers  think  of  me  so  I  may  be
[01:45] an  exception  to  this  because  I  care 
 about  what  like  a  million  guys  think  of 
 me  but  that's  a  part  of  my  tribe  that
[01:51] I'm  leading  if  I  wasn't  like  the 
 YouTuber  that  I  am  and  I  was  more  like 
 you  know  a  guy  who  worked  like  a  normal 
 job  for  example  you  know  like  not  with
[01:57] the  masses  watching  him  my  tribe  who  I 
 would  care  about  would  be  some  of  my 
 co-workers  you  know  the  guys  that  I
[02:02] really  liked  and  you  know  the  girls  who 
 work  there  and  you  know  you're  close  to 
 them  my  family  my  friends  maybe  some
[02:07] important  people  from  my  childhood  you 
 know  some  good  friends  or  something  the 
 thing  is  most  likely  that's  relatable  to
[02:12] you  right  now  most  likely  they're  the 
 people  that  you've  built  this  desire 
 from  this  like  Jeffrey  propaganda  that
[02:17] spreads  around  which  is  that  you  know 
 you  shouldn't  care  what  anyone  thinks  of 
 you  I  just  want  to  give  you  this  warning 
 because  too  many  guys  get  into  this
[02:23] pathway  and  you  might  be  one  of  them  who 
 don't  want  to  care  what  anyone  thinks 
 and  trust  me  if  that  actually  happens 
 the  reason  why  I'm  giving  you  this  one
[02:29] is  because  because  I've  been  there  was  a 
 time  when  I  didn't  care  about  what 
 anyone  in  my  tribe  thoughts  I  blocked
[02:34] each  and  every  one  of  my  family  on 
 WhatsApp  like  I  blocked  all  their 
 numbers  I  took  a  taxi  like  an  Uber  from
[02:39] my  family  house  back  to  the  city  so  I 
 moved  home  and  I  was  home  for  you  know  a 
 few  days  and  I  didn't  like  my  family  but
[02:44] this  was  bad  times  for  me  and  after  we 
 had  like  this  massive  argument  and  I 
 swore  on  my  dad's  face  you  know  he's
[02:49] screaming  at  me  everything  it's  just 
 aggressive  you  know  maybe  20  years  old 
 21  22  years  old  and  I'm  pissed  off that
[02:54] you  know  my  family  is  still  like  this 
 and  still  being  abusive  I  just  left  an 
 apartment  in  Manchester  UK  where  I  was
[02:59] living  like  a  degenerate  just  smoking 
 weed  all  day  and  everything  and  you  know 
 moved  back  home  for  trying  to  fix  my 
 life  and  this  was  before  I  officially
[03:05] moved  back  home  and  after  having  this 
 shitty  like  argument  with  my  family  I 
 remember  literally  just  packing  one  bag 
 like  one  big  duffel  bag  got  into  an  Uber
[03:11] on  the  way  back  to  Manchester  unless  she 
 went  on  my  phone  blocked  all  of  their 
 numbers  you  know  on  WhatsApp  on  phone 
 numbers  everything  right  I  get  to
[03:17] Manchester  and  like  I  had  no  one  like  I 
 had  this  one  girl  who  I  lived  with  who 
 you  know  was  like  kind  of  like  my
[03:22] girlfriend  but  we  didn't  even  get  along 
 that  nicely  honestly  and  so  hopefully 
 you  can  believe  this  when  I  tell  you 
 that  I  may  be  one  of  the  only  people
[03:28] that  you've  actually  persons  who 
 genuinely  did  not  care  what  anyone  in 
 this  tribe  thoughts  because  I  had  no  one
[03:35] in  my  tribe  because  at  this  moment  when 
 I  moved  back  home  for  a  solid  one  year  I 
 spoke  to  no  one  for  one  year  I  had  my
[03:41] family  blocked  I  did  not  speak  to  them 
 for  one  year  the  only  person  I  had  to  my 
 side  was  this  girl  that  like  it  was  a
[03:46] toxic  relationship  I  was  constantly 
 anxious  that  she  was  cheating  on  me  we 
 weren't  even  like  Partners  in  a  sense
[03:51] for  one  year  I  spoke  to  no  one  for  one 
 year  I  had  no  one  in  my  tribe  for  one 
 year  I  didn't  give  a  [ __ ]  just  exactly
[03:56] what  you  wanted  right  I  didn't  give  a 
 [ __ ]  and  guess  how  good  my  life  was  I 
 smoked  weed  every  single  day  I  went  to
[04:02] the  gym  Max  two  times  a  week  Max  when  I 
 was  on  a  possible  leg  like  six  days  a 
 week  split  and  I'd  go  two  times  a  week
[04:07] Max  I  cheat  on  my  diet  every  single  day 
 I'd  eat  junk  food  every  single  day  bro
[04:12] with  a  girl  with  a  [ __ ]  girlfriend 
 that  I  was  in  love  with  in  the  same 
 apartment  I  had  a  porn  addiction  when
[04:17] you  don't  care  what  people  in  your  tribe 
 think  you  become  sub-human  please 
 understand  this  if  there  is  a  person  out
[04:23] there  who  doesn't  give  a  [ __ ]  what 
 anyone  thinks  that  person  is  subhuman 
 because  the  human  part  of  us  is  tribal
[04:28] the  human  part  of  us  is  so  like 
 consciously  connected  to  each  other  like 
 the  fellow  man  that  we're  supposed  to
[04:33] care  and  cooperate  with  each  other  and 
 so  many  young  guys  are  on  this  Pursuit 
 wanting  to  care  less  without  actually 
 hearing  this  from  anyone  else  now  having
[04:39] said  that  at  the  same  time  so  many  young 
 guys  need  to  be  on  this  Pursuit  because 
 they  care  too  much  about  what  that
[04:44] random  [ __ ]  in  high  school  says 
 about  them  and  you're  probably  like  that 
 too  I  just  wanted  to  give  you  that
[04:49] warning  I  know  for  a  fact  that  by  me 
 telling  you  that  instead  of  just  jumping 
 straight  into  number  one  number  two  the 
 YouTube  retention  has  went  down  I've
[04:55] literally  just  sacrificed  some  like 
 performance  and  like  revenue  and  [ __ ] 
 for  this  video  but  I  really  wanted  to 
 just  say  that  let's  move  on  to  the 
 actual  video  before  I  tell  you  about
[05:01] these  seven  ways  to  stop  giving  up  but  I 
 want  to  start  with  some  words  of  Adonis 
 your  time  is  limited  do  not  waste  it
[05:08] living  someone  else's  life  the  first  way 
 to  stop  giving  a  [ __ ]  is  to  realize  that 
 most  people  don't  actually  care  about
[05:14] you  they're  not  even  thinking  about  you 
 this  may  be  slightly  hard  to  believe  in 
 you  may  be  so  sure  that  people  are
[05:19] thinking  about  you  why  really  question 
 this  right  now  because  you've  probably 
 never  done  this  question  why  most  of  us
[05:24] think  that  everyone  else  is  looking  and 
 thinking  about  us  why  is  that  such  a 
 common  trait  these  days  in  these  modern
[05:30] times  maybe  because  of  the  conditioning 
 that  we've  been  brought  up  with  you're  a 
 superstar  yay  oh  here  you  go
[05:35] participation  trophy  you're  so  important 
 you're  so  special  oh  look  the  nerd  who's
[05:40] exactly  like  you  in  the  Hollywood  movie 
 everyone's  looking  at  him  oh  my  God  he 
 keeps  getting  bullied  everyone's 
 thinking  about  him  bro  news  flash  unless
[05:46] you're  like  Andrew  take  no  one's  really 
 thinking  about  you  honestly  and  you 
 might  not  believe  this  because  you've 
 got  this  like  huge  inflated  ego  and  it's
[05:52] not  your  fault  that  you  have  that  the 
 modern  times  is  really  [ __ ]  it's  like 
 the  things  that  sound  like  good  ideas 
 like  you  know  inflating  kids  Egos  and
[05:57] telling  them  yeah  you're  really  special 
 like  it  hasn't  really  turned  out  that 
 well  because  now  these  kids  are  just 
 like  brain  dead  and  they  just  think  that
[06:02] they  don't  need  to  work  hard  anymore  at 
 the  same  time  you  probably  agree  you've 
 been  conditioned  to  think  that  you're  so 
 important  to  everyone  else  and  the  thing
[06:07] is  like  they  don't  care  guess  why 
 because  they're  thinking  about 
 themselves  because  they've  went  through
[06:12] the  same  conditioning  as  you  so  we're 
 all  sat  here  thinking  about  ourselves 
 and  also  thinking  that  everyone  else  is 
 thinking  about  us  when  everyone  else  is
[06:18] just  thinking  about  themselves  you're 
 not  that  important  once  you  realize  that 
 most  people  don't  actually  care  about 
 you  or  don't  even  think  about  you  that
[06:23] much  you  start  to  feel  a  little  bit  more 
 free  and  say  okay  [ __ ]  it  like  they're 
 not  even  thinking  about  me  anyway  so  I 
 can  live  the  way  that  I  want  to  live  the
[06:29] second  way  to  stop  giving  a  [ __ ]  my 
 favorite  which  changed  my  life 
 personally  improve  your  mental  health  I
[06:34] have  a  full  mental  health  guide  it's 
 like  two  hours  long  where  I  literally 
 sat  down  and  I  walked  through  like  the
[06:39] exact  process  of  improving  your  mental 
 health  they'll  be  linked  as  a  card  and 
 in  the  description  I  highly  recommend  if 
 you  haven't  already  just  go  watch  that
[06:44] when  you  improve  your  mental  health  you 
 stop  getting  these  neurotic  anxious 
 thoughts  that  you  know  people  are
[06:49] thinking  about  you  that  people  are 
 judging  you  basically  that  thought  that 
 we  get  that  you  know  people  are  judging 
 us  and  that's  why  we  care  too  much  right
[06:54] it's  a  symptom  of  poor  mental  health 
 that's  why  we  get  it  because  it's  in  the 
 mind  so  why  don't  we  just  go  through
[06:59] this  step-by-step  process  of  improving 
 our  mental  health  and  you  can  do  this  by 
 yourself  for  free  there's  nothing  to  buy
[07:05] you  can  do  it  completely  for  free  today 
 and  it  takes  literally  just  two  weeks  to 
 improve  your  mental  health  I  promise  you
[07:10] if  you  follow  the  advice  in  that  big 
 guide  that  I've  just  linked  on  Mental 
 Health  guide  for  two  weeks  you'll 
 actually  be  so  amazed  of  how  much  just
[07:16] better  your  mind  feels  so  you're  no 
 longer  getting  these  [ __ ]  negative 
 hateful  thoughts  in  your  mind  that
[07:21] you'll  be  spreading  the  word  of  mental 
 health  to  everyone  else  around  you  just 
 like  I  am  once  you  realize  that  it  takes 
 two  weeks  to  improve  your  mental  health
[07:27] you'll  be  like  a  missionary  honestly 
 just  like  I  am  just  wanting  to  spread 
 this  message  because  you  realize  how
[07:32] quick  it  is  and  you  realize  that 
 everyone  else  has  been  living  with  poor 
 mental  health  for  years  and  all  they've 
 got  to  do  is  meditate  for  like  half  an
[07:37] hour  over  the  next  two  weeks  click  on 
 that  full  mental  health  guide  right  now 
 and  add  it  into  one  of  your  YouTube 
 watch  later  playlists  I'm  not  sure  if
[07:43] this  one's  going  to be  relatable  to  you 
 because  you're  already  on 
 self-improvement  so  you've  probably 
 already  done  this  but  it  will  be
[07:48] valuable  for  us  to  discuss  and  hopefully 
 you'll  want  to  just  take  an  act  of 
 leadership  and  just  tell  one  of  your 
 friends  about  this  the  third  way  to  stop
[07:53] caring  so  much  and  stop  giving  a  [ __ ] 
 get  off  social  media  now  YouTube  is 
 technically  a  social  media  every  time
[07:58] bro  every  single  time  I  say  get  off 
 social  media  so  many  people  comment  oh 
 perhaps  if  you're  on  social  media  right 
 now  I  thought  it  was common  sense  or
[08:04] maybe  it's  not  but  I'd  say  educational 
 content  like  this  on  YouTube  is 
 different  wouldn't  you  I'd  say  that  what 
 you're  watching  right  now  where  I'm
[08:09] literally  just  giving  you  life  advice 
 and  maybe  your  life  is  literally  getting 
 improved  from  this  this  is  very 
 different  from  Tick  Tock  isn't  it  I
[08:15] thought  that  was  common  sense  to  begin 
 with  so  I  never  explained  like  oh  yeah 
 like  when  I  say  I  get  off  social  media 
 it  doesn't  really  include  you  know 
 podcasts  or  like  country  videos  on
[08:21] YouTube  stop  watching  Mr  Beast  video 
 stop  watching  like  [ __ ]  uh  I  turned 
 the  penny  into  that  just  shut  the  [ __ ]
[08:26] up  stop  watching  that  entertainment 
 videos  on  YouTube  bro  stop  watching  that 
 and  start  watch  actually  just  [ __ ] 
 mindless  content  on  Tick  Tock  and
[08:31] Instagram  there  is  kind  of  one  that  I 
 have  and  that's  Discord  so  I  don't  know 
 if  you've  joined  already  but  we  have  a 
 big  Discord  server  that's  Linked  In  the
[08:37] description  it's  got  like  150  000  of  our 
 bullies  in  there  talking  about 
 self-improvement  talking  about  like  oh
[08:42] how  I  got  to  date  90  of  novap  and 
 everything  you  can  go  join  completely 
 for  free  I  don't  think  it's  like  totally 
 a  social  media  but  it  pretty  much  is
[08:47] because  you  know  it's  a  chat  Forum  thing 
 right  I  don't  really  use  it  that  much 
 but  when  I  do  use  it  especially  when  I
[08:53] look  into  more  of  the  moderator  admin 
 kind  of  things  of  it  you  know  you've  got 
 a  big  server  so  I'll  go  see  what  the
[08:58] mods  are  saying  everything  it  makes  me 
 give  a  [ __ ]  in  the  worst  way  possible 
 there'll  be  a  random  guy  who's  like  not
[09:04] followed  one  of  our  rules  and  I'll  be 
 pissed  off  for  hours  later  and  you  know 
 I  have  to  recalibrate  myself  and  say  bro
[09:09] it's  probably  like  a  [ __ ]  13  year  old 
 who  didn't  even  read  like  The  Rules  page 
 who  cares  that  sounds  like  a  dick  bro
[09:14] but  one  hour  of  my  thinking  one  hour  of 
 me  just  you  know  having  good  mental 
 health  is  worth  about  ten  thousand 
 dollars  honestly  like  one  hour  of  me
[09:19] just  thinking  of  brainstorming  ideas 
 because  it's  literally  worth  tens  of 
 thousands  of  dollars  if  I've  wasted  an
[09:24] hour  thinking  about  some  [ __ ]  I've 
 just  lost  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars 
 honestly  like  I  know  that  seems  silly 
 for  like  an  hour  times  worth  thousands
[09:30] now  right  and  I  literally  sometimes  I'll 
 spend  an  hour  just  like  triggered  over 
 like  some  random  13  year  old  who's  like
[09:35] not  followed  one  of  our  rules  like  you 
 know  who's  posted  some  [ __ ]  and  I'm 
 just  I  have  to  stop  myself  I'm  like  well 
 what's  wrong  with  you  and  then  I
[09:40] realized  I  know  this  sounds  silly  maybe 
 it's  not  really  self-improvement  I 
 realize  that  the  problem  isn't  me 
 honestly  I  realize  that  this  is  like  a
[09:46] defect  in  the  human  brain  that  we  aren't 
 supposed  to  feel  okay  on  these  platforms
[09:51] that  connect  us  with  someone  who's  far 
 across  the  world  we're  not  supposed  to 
 be  fine  with  that  there's  a  book  I've
[09:56] been  reading  recently  called  sapiens  and 
 it  talks  about  the  history  of  humans  you 
 know  especially  from  like  the  early 
 caveman  Neanderthal  days  and  it  tells
[10:02] the  story  of  the  transition  from  us 
 being  hunter-gatherers  so  that  you  know 
 the  kind  of  human  who  literally  just
[10:07] kept  on  walking  trying  to  like  hunt  some 
 [ __ ]  or  set  up  camp  for  the  night  then 
 we'll  walk  them  all  to  try  and  find  more 
 food  and  stuff  the  transition  from  that
[10:12] to  the  transition  of  the  Agricultural 
 Revolution  and  becoming  farmers  and  you
[10:17] know  I  actually  said  that  Mankind's 
 biggest  mistake  was  planting  a  seed 
 because  as  soon  as  we  did  that  as  soon
[10:22] as  we  planted  seeds  even  though  we  were 
 able  to  become  more  successful  sexually
[10:27] because  you  know  we  reproduce  so  much 
 more  in  the  human  population  really  grew 
 so  much  when  we  became  Farmers  because 
 you  know  we  had  more  food  instability
[10:33] human  misery  skyrocketed  because  I  don't 
 humans  are  not  really  supposed  to  live
[10:38] in  like  big  cities  what  happened  at  this 
 point  if  you're  interested  you  know 
 after  the  first  human  planted  the  seed 
 and  we  started  farming  instead  of  you
[10:44] know  like  it's  so  much  easier  to  just 
 Farm  instead  of  going  to  hunt  right  it's 
 safer  right  then  we  totally  rely  on  luck 
 on  the  elements  on  the  drought  or  the
[10:51] famine  or  the  you  know  the  Reigns  we 
 need  that  [ __ ]  now  now  we  need  to  stay 
 right  here  on  this  Farm  all  of  our 
 family  needs  to  come  and  help  us  let's
[10:56] go  have  more  children  and  since  we're 
 all  living  in  tight-knit  communities 
 disease  is  going  to  spread  like  crazy
[11:01] sure  we  got  to  breed  more  and  have  more 
 children  and  you  know  that's  led  us  to 
 the  Modern  Life  that  we're  in  now  but  we
[11:06] became  miserable  kind  of  because  we  got 
 more  social  now  fair  enough  you  know 
 there  was  like  tribes  of  roaming  bands
[11:11] beforehand  and  that  was  like  the  kind  of 
 healthy  community  that  we  needed  as  like 
 Hunters  but  the  advancements  of  huge
[11:18] communities  especially  those  with 
 randomers  who  don't  even  share  any 
 interest  with  you  may  just  care  too  much
[11:24] and  it  just  [ __ ]  our  minds 
 psychologically  that's  why  there's  a  new 
 update  coming  to  my  server  we're  gonna 
 set  separate  everyone  into  tribes  tribes
[11:31] of  150  500  like  a  small  amount  the 
 surface  got  150  000  people  right  a  small
[11:36] amount  of  tight-knit  people  and  you're 
 in  like  a  tribe  that  you're  actually 
 dedicated  to  there's  a  tribe  leader  that
[11:41] I've  elected  and  with  that  we're  going 
 to  do  challenges  and  I  want  I  actually 
 want  there  like  I  said  this  to  Sam  who's 
 organizing  you  know  all  the  like  Discord
[11:47] [ __ ]  with  this  I  said  this  to  him  in 
 this  Discord  update  coming  to  our  server 
 where  we're  gonna  make  tribes  right  I 
 actually  wanted  to  get  a  little  bit
[11:52] toxic  I  know  like  all  the  mods  my 
 complainers  when  they  brought  I  wanted 
 to  get  a  little  bit  tribal  because 
 that's  what  human  nature  is  supposed  to
[11:58] be  like  we're  gonna  start  to  compete 
 with  each  other  but  it's  gonna  be  some 
 big  movements  in  our  Discord  server  and 
 as  soon  as  you  get  put  into  a  tribe  that
[12:04] you  actually  care  about  and  a  tribe 
 leader  you  actually  respect  and  you're 
 thinking  oh  [ __ ]  you  know  are  the  three 
 tribe  Alpha  is  so  sick  like  tried  betas
[12:10] like  oh  yeah  they're  all  trash  you're 
 actually  gonna  get  a  feeling  of  what 
 it's  supposed  to  be  like  being  like  a
[12:15] natural  human  again  where  you  have  a 
 tribe  of  people  that  you  care  about  the 
 other  tribes  they  might  not  be  that
[12:20] friendly  that's  how  humans  are  supposed 
 to  live  and  I'm  so  glad  that  we  can 
 recreate  that  that's  in  the  Discord  Link
[12:25] in  the  description  just  go  join  right 
 now  the  fourth  way  to  stop  giving  a  [ __ ] 
 and  actually  one  of  them  the  most 
 practical  ways  which  I  got  from  the  book
[12:31] this  was  a  lot  of  not  giving  a  [ __ ]  by 
 Mark  Manson  have  something  else  to  give
[12:36] a  [ __ ]  about  now  the  thing  is  you're 
 most  likely  always  gonna  have  something 
 to  think  about  aren't  you  like  the  human
[12:41] mind  doesn't  really  switch  off  even  with 
 meditation  and  stuff  like  the  thing  is 
 you  usually  do  think  60  000  thoughts
[12:47] every  single  day  you're  gonna  think 
 about  things  you're  gonna  care  about 
 something  why  don't  we  just  choose  what
[12:52] to  care  about  because  right  now  we're 
 caring  about  [ __ ]  aren't  we  we're 
 caring  about  what  that  [ __ ]  in  our 
 class  or  you  know  our  workplace  said  to
[12:58] us  three  weeks  ago  and  we're  still 
 thinking  about  it  we're  thinking  about 
 this  and  that  it's  things  that  aren't 
 actually  serving  us  right  so  why  don't
[13:03] we  flip  this  around  understand  that 
 we're  gonna  think  about  something  so  why 
 don't  we  choose  something  important  to 
 think  about  why  don't  we  have  some  big
[13:09] masculine  Mission  a  purpose  to  think 
 about  you  want  to  know  the  biggest  thing 
 that  really  helped  me  is  to  stop  like
[13:14] being  a  little  [ __ ]  and  just  caring  so 
 much  about  every  little  thing  about 
 these  Randomness  starting  this  movements
[13:19] leading  this  movement  my  brain's  too 
 full  of  the  thoughts  here  that  now  like
[13:24] what  some  [ __ ]  in  high  school  thinks 
 of  me  like  it  doesn't  even  cross  my  mind 
 anymore  maybe  you're  not  like  yeah  maybe
[13:29] you  don't  really  have  a  priority  and  in 
 your  mind  you've  already  started  coping 
 thinking  oh  yeah  well  you  know  my 
 studies  are  like  the  thing  is  you  need
[13:35] something  where  your  brain  is  actively 
 just  thinking  about  it  all  day  if  that 
 is  your  studies  fantastic  but  for  me
[13:40] personally  it  couldn't  have  been  even 
 though  that  might  have  been  the  right 
 thing  it  couldn't  have  been  because  I 
 simply  didn't  care  enough  for  that  I
[13:45] didn't  care  enough  for  school  it's 
 actually  like  give  a  [ __ ]  about  that 
 instead  of  something  else  you  need 
 something  that  you  genuinely  care  so
[13:50] much  about  that  you  can  start  to 
 prioritize  that  over  other  things  the 
 first  thing  for  me  was  weight  lifting  I
[13:55] would  literally  go  about  my  day  thinking 
 about  weightlifting  and  building  muscle 
 in  my  diet  and  stuff  instead  of  the
[14:00] [ __ ]  that  was  happening  day  to  day 
 that  gave  me  something  to  think  about 
 and  it  was  practical  it  was  valuable  it
[14:05] was  growth  orientated  it  was  going  to 
 serve  me  you  need  something  important  in 
 your  life  right  now  and  honestly  like
[14:10] this  can  go  to  a  deeper  issue  because  I 
 know  for  a  fact  the  reason  why  most 
 young  men  are  struggling  is  because  your
[14:15] lives  are  worthless  I  know  that  that 
 seems  so  harsh  but  most  young  men  are 
 struggling  because  they  have  nothing  to
[14:20] live  for  they  don't  care  about  their 
 studies  they  don't  care  about  some  like 
 shitty  future  job  that  they  might  be 
 eligible  to  get  if  they're  a  good  boy
[14:26] for  five  to  ten  more  years  they  don't 
 even  feel  connected  to  their  own 
 families  anymore  their  friends  are
[14:31] [ __ ]  most  young  men  have  nothing  to 
 live  for  and  so  all  they  do  is  just 
 scroll  mindlessly  and  watch  porn  and
[14:36] play  video  games  if  you  really  want  to 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  the  right  things  you 
 need  something  important  in  your  life
[14:42] you  need  something  that  makes  you  feel 
 valuable  to  the  world  it  has  to  be 
 something  that's  like  giving  to  the
[14:48] world  to  someone  else  it  has  to  be  we're 
 supposed  to  be  connected  with  each  other 
 it  can't  be  the  solo  Journey  trust  me
[14:53] when  I  say  you  need  to  do  something  that 
 serves  the  world  and  Entrepreneurship  is 
 the  best  way  to  do  that  because  then  you 
 get  paid  whilst  doing  it  you  can  do
[14:59] charity  work  and  that's  nice  but  the 
 thing  is  in  my  opinion  the  best  thing  to 
 do  is  just  to  be  an  entrepreneur  who 
 really  thinks  like  value  service  to  the
[15:05] people  you're  trying  to  serve  and  also 
 get  like  a  good  amount  of  money  back 
 because  I  want  to  do  it's  also  fun  to 
 just  make  money  and  then  you  know  to
[15:10] hire  people  and  to  keep  scaling  up  and 
 now  it's  like  I've  got  so  much  to  think 
 about  that  I  don't  give  a  [ __ ]  about 
 anything  small  bro  I've  got  like  more
[15:16] than  10  employees  I'm  thinking  about 
 them  instead  of  like  some  random  you 
 know  person  or  some  [ __ ]  happened 
 you  know  yesterday  we  wanted  to  go
[15:22] skydiving  and  the  weather  like  the  guy 
 said  the  weather  was  like  oh  yes  it's 
 really  dangerous  we  look  outside  there 
 was  a  bit  of  wind  bro  it  wasn't  that  bad
[15:28] right  I  could  have 
 I  could  have  been  so  upset  I  could  have 
 cared  so  much  I  could  have  given  such  a
[15:33] big  [ __ ]  guess  what  I  was  okay  fair 
 enough  I'll  just  go  home  and  just  work 
 again  I'll  go  home  and  work  on  the  thing 
 that's  really  important  to  me  that  I
[15:39] actually  give  a  [ __ ]  about  you  need  to 
 develop  something  of  this  yourself  I've 
 got  videos  on  my  channel  which  tells  you 
 how  to  develop  a  purpose  go  watch  those
[15:44] right  now  number  five  know  that  no  one 
 really  remembers  the  awkward  or
[15:49] embarrassing  things  that  you  did  a  lot 
 of  people  live  in  the  past  and  so  if 
 you're  like  this  bro  you're  probably
[15:54] constantly  thinking  about  this  time  that 
 you  [ __ ]  up  and  everyone  like  you  know 
 laughed  at  you  and  you're  thinking  that 
 everyone  else  is  judging  you  based  on
[15:59] that  in  the  presence  I  realize  one  day  I 
 think  I  read  it  somewhere  no  one 
 remembers  the  shitty  things  that  we  did
[16:05] previously  no  one's  thinking  about  them 
 we  are  but  only  because  we  think  that 
 other  people  are  and  I  realized  that  I
[16:10] had  this  belief  myself  and  maybe  you  do 
 maybe  you've  been  living  in  the  past  too 
 much  and  you've  been  literally  worrying 
 about  something  that  you  did  a  little
[16:16] while  ago  days  ago  weeks  ago  maybe  years 
 ago  and  the  reason  why  you're  taking  it 
 so  important  why  you're  caring  so  much
[16:21] while  you're  giving  a  [ __ ]  about  it  is 
 because  you  think  other  people  are  too 
 but  again  just  like  the  first  point  that 
 we  made  here  they're  probably  not  if  we
[16:27] really  did  you  know  if  we  like 
 investigated  them  brains  and  we  really 
 could  see  it  okay  how  many  times  they 
 thought  about  you  over  the  last  year
[16:32] it'd  probably  literally  be  like  five 
 honestly  I  want  you  to  think  about  this 
 do  you  wake  up  and  think  about  that
[16:37] cringe  thing  that  random  guy  from  your 
 class  two  years  ago  did  you  don't  like 
 you  might  have  just  remembered  something
[16:42] now  and  be  like  oh  yeah  well  I  just  did 
 now  but  like  on  average  in  a  normal 
 day-to-day  life  without  a  prompt  you
[16:47] don't  think  about  that  random  thing  that 
 that  guy  did  oh  you  know  that  kid  when 
 he  was  seven  years  old  he  fired  like  if
[16:52] you're  living  in  the  past  you're  gonna 
 just  care  about  too  much  [ __ ]  which 
 you  can't  even  change  anyway  now  it  is 
 great  to  investigate  the  past  to  journal
[16:59] to  write  out  about  your  mistakes  and 
 think  to  yourself  okay  how  can  I  escape 
 that  mistake  next  time  how  can  I  learn 
 from  that  fantastic  I'm  constantly  just
[17:05] replaying  negative  memories  that  doesn't 
 even  make  you  feel  good  or  anything  that 
 doesn't  even  help  you  to  perform  better
[17:10] next  time  it's  absolutely  useless  isn't 
 it  and  I  don't  know  if  anyone's  told  you 
 this  but  you  can  literally  choose  what
[17:16] to  think  and  how  to  feel  this  is  like 
 the  greatest  superpower  that  men  have 
 you  can  choose  what  to  think  and  how  to
[17:21] feel  so  why  don't  you  just  feel  great 
 you  can  literally  turn  on  the  feeling  of
[17:26] Happiness  like  this  you  just  need  to 
 choose  to  right  now  you  may  be  feel  with 
 limiting  beliefs  and  say  no  no  I  can't 
 you  can  choose  right  here  right  now  to
[17:32] stop  thinking  about  the  past  simple  as 
 that  you  literally  just  have  to  make  the 
 conscious  choice  but  first  you  have  to 
 start  with  the  belief  that  yep  I  can
[17:37] control  my  emotions  too  many  guys  think 
 that  their  emotions  their  feelings  are 
 dictated  by  something  else  and  so  they
[17:42] go  and  pop  [ __ ]  pills  and  medication 
 and  [ __ ]  instead  of  just  realizing  like 
 you  can  literally  just  control  your  mind 
 as  a  man  that's  your  greatest  like
[17:48] god-giving  gift  just  control  your  mind  I 
 know  it's  like  it's  condescending  but 
 it's  that  simple  if  you've  been  getting 
 negative  thoughts  for  a  while  just
[17:53] decide  not  to  think  negatively  if  you've 
 been  feeling  [ __ ]  decide  not  to  feel 
 [ __ ]  that  you  can  control  everything
[17:58] about  like  your  mind  and  your  brain  so 
 why  wouldn't  you  the  reason  why  quite 
 frankly  is  because  so  many  guys  actually
[18:03] enjoy  living  and  wallowing  pity  so  many 
 guys  just  are  happy  there  because  that 
 means  that  that's  their  excuse  this  is
[18:08] why  I  respect  it  even  though  I  speak  so 
 much  about  the  issues  of  mental  health  I 
 respect  when  he  said  that  depression
[18:13] isn't  real  because  the  thing  is  it  does 
 not  even  serve  you  to  think  that  it  is 
 the  amount  of  guys  limiting  beliefs  that
[18:18] I've  had  to  destroy  to  tell  them  that 
 all  this  [ __ ]  that  you've  been  [ __ ] 
 taking  from  your  doctor  you  don't  even 
 have  to  all  you  need  is  two  weeks  of
[18:23] meditating  actually  going  outside  into 
 the  sunlight  picking  a  leaf  from  a  tree 
 climbing  a  tree  people  don't  realize
[18:28] that  the  king  sure  to  mental  health  and 
 feeling  [ __ ]  it's  just  climbing  a  tree 
 like  you  used  to  as  a  kid  you've  not
[18:33] done  that  in  years  and  then  you  expect 
 why  you're  so  depressed  and  why  why 
 you're  so  anxious  when  all  you  do  is 
 just  go  on  to  [ __ ]  Twitter  and  get
[18:38] into  arguments  with  people  about 
 religion  and  politics  you  care  so  much 
 because  you're  living  like  a  sub-human
[18:43] you  care  so  much  because  you're  so 
 paranoid  and  anxious  and  neurotic  about 
 the  past  and  also  the  future  when  in  the
[18:49] presence  nothing  is  happening  other  than 
 you're  just  watching  a  guy  on  YouTube  in 
 the  present  I'm  sat  there  in  an  empty
[18:54] room  just  recording  this  video  for  my 
 boys  in  the  present  there's  nothing 
 wrong  happening  almost  ever  maybe  maybe
[18:59] once  every  couple  of  weeks  there's 
 something  bad  that  happens  maybe  every 
 couple  of  days  one  of  your  parents  are
[19:04] just  being  mean  to  you  okay  fine  but 
 that  negative  thing  that  we  obsess  over 
 that  was  in  the  past  of  the  future  that
[19:09] negative  thing  happens  for  just  a  blimp 
 of  time  for  a  couple  of  minutes  your 
 parents  get  angry  at  you  for  a  couple  of
[19:14] minutes  this  guy's  been  a  [ __ ]  for 
 you  and  yet  we'll  allow  our  own  brains 
 to  think  about  that  thing  and  make  us
[19:19] feel  like  [ __ ]  for  days  after  you're 
 holding  resentments  for  something  that 
 your  parents  did  a  year  ago  why  because
[19:25] you're  being  a  dick  to  yourself  right 
 now  you  may  the  kind  of  person  I'm 
 talking  to  you  may  feel  the  resentment
[19:31] towards  me  and  anger  towards  me  as  if 
 it's  me  virtue  and  yet  what  I'm  saying 
 would  serve  you  what  you're  doing  to
[19:36] yourself  does  not  serve  you  holding 
 resentment  for  something  that  happened 
 in  the  past  embarrassing  awkward  being
[19:41] neurotically  anxious  for  something  in 
 the  future  it  doesn't  help  you 
 whatsoever  and  so  many  guys  will  just
[19:46] stay  here  anyway  just  because  it's  like 
 oh  but  that's  the  way  to  live  like  no  no 
 no  just  because  your  default  brain  goes
[19:51] there  doesn't  mean  that  you  can't 
 manually  force  your  brain  to  just  not 
 think  of  this  [ __ ]  thought  again
[19:56] this  accidentally  led  us  to  the  six 
 points  of  not  giving  a  [ __ ]  which  is  to 
 practice  stoicism  now  stoicism  is  a
[20:02] philosophy  which  I'm  not  gonna  lie  it's 
 so  broad  that  I  I  don't  really  like  it 
 so  much  though  I  think  it's  important
[20:07] but  I  think  the  most  important  part  of 
 it  is  actually  the  emotional  stability 
 the  emotional  control  the  emotional
[20:13] resilience  once  you  research  stoicism 
 you  look  into  it  at  least  for  me 
 personally  bro  I  could  never  really  get 
 into  it  I  think  being  stoic  is  deeply
[20:19] important  but  I  think  the  philosophy  of 
 stoicism  it's  just  too  like  I  don't 
 personally  understand  too  much  of  it  you
[20:24] know  it's  emotional  stability  yeah 
 fantastic  that's  masculine  okay  I'm  down 
 for  it  but  the  rest  of  it  when  they 
 start  talking  about  random  [ __ ]  and  it's
[20:29] like  oh  go  read  Marcus  or  Aurelius 
 meditations  well  I've  tried  I've  tried 
 so  many  times  I've  literally  tried  to
[20:34] Flat  down  read  the  entire  book  twice  did 
 not  even  [ __ ]  understand  it  bro 
 honestly  like  half  of  that  [ __ ]  I  didn't 
 understand  it's  just  me  maybe  you'd  be
[20:40] better  for  you  but  the  best  part  of 
 stoicism  is  the  emotional  control  that 
 you  get  from  it  essentially  you  don't
[20:45] need  to  be  a  stoic  for  this  you  just 
 need  to  practice  emotional  stability 
 emotional  resilience  that's  what  we've
[20:50] just  covered  before  it's  understanding 
 with  this  belief  that  you  can  choose 
 what  emotions  to  have  you  can  literally 
 just  choose  to  be  angry  like  this  as  a
[20:55] man  you  can  do  that  you  can  choose  to  be 
 depressed  like  this  quite  frankly  you're 
 allowing  yourself  to  feel  like  [ __ ]  most
[21:02] guys  I  will  say  that  again  most  guys  are 
 allowing  themselves  to  feel  like  [ __ ]  as 
 a  man  you  have  a  superpower  you  can
[21:07] choose  how  to  feel  that  means  that  if 
 you  feel  bad  you  chose  to  feel  bad  maybe
[21:12] you  disagree  with  this  right  now  because 
 you're  not  that  masculine  so  you  haven't 
 tapped  into  this  god-given  superpower 
 that  we  have  but  I'm  telling  you right
[21:17] now  that  any  masculine  man  who  hasn't 
 been  castrating  his  masculine  Sexual 
 Energy  through  [ __ ]  spraying  the  seed
[21:23] for  [ __ ]  disgusting  porn  star  oh  but 
 protect  sex  workers  any  man  who  hasn't 
 been  depleting  his  masculine  energy  has
[21:29] total  control  over  his  emotions  if  you 
 feel  bad  it's  because  you're  making 
 yourself  feel  bad  if  you  feel  depressed
[21:34] because  you  are  making  you're  choosing 
 to  be  depressed  I  need  to  make  a  whole 
 video  on  this  and  I  know  it's  going  to 
 trigger  so  many  [ __ ]  people  but  it's
[21:40] so  [ __ ]  important  they  want  you  to 
 feel  bad  they  want  you  to  feel  depressed 
 they  want  you  to  be  triggered  at  what  I
[21:45] say  even  though  what  I'm  saying  is 
 serving  you  and  what  they're  saying  is 
 destroying  you  and  they  want  you  to
[21:50] think  that  I'm  the  enemy  but  I  am  saying 
 the  thing  that's  going  to  help  you  more 
 and  they're  saying  the  thing  that's
[21:55] going  to  destroy  you  so  who's  your  real 
 enemy  and  finally  the  seventh  way  to 
 stop  giving  a  [ __ ]  is  to  not  compare
[22:01] yourself  to  other  people  but  instead  to 
 choose  to  compete  there's  a  subtle 
 difference  between  these  and  most  people
[22:07] get  this  wrong  most  of  like  the 
 castrated  men  of  the  modern  generation 
 they  say  that  they're  not  going  to
[22:12] compete  against  anyone  else  and  you've 
 probably  said  this  yourself  haven't  you 
 be  honest  you've  probably  said  that  oh  I 
 don't  compete  against  anyone  else  you
[22:17] probably  said  that  most  guys  have  said 
 this  and  they  don't  even  realize  where 
 this  thought  has  come  from  because  your 
 ancestors  when  you  say  oh  I'm  not
[22:22] competing  against  anyone  else  your 
 ancestors  are  looking  down  at  you 
 thinking  what  the  [ __ ]  the  Gladiator  in 
 your  bloodline  is  looking  at  you  and
[22:28] thinking  what  a  [ __ ]  he's  probably 
 saying  it  in  Latin  they're  seeing  you 
 right  now  with  [ __ ]  man  boobs  saying
[22:33] I  don't  compete  with  anyone  else  the 
 [ __ ]  Hunters  of  your  bloodline  that 
 could  run  20  miles  to  chase  down  a  Borah
[22:38] looking  at  you  and  thinking  what  a  [ __ ] 
 all  of  the  men  of  our  Bloodlines  of  our 
 previous  generations  are  looking  down  at
[22:44] us  with  shame  when  we  say  [ __ ]  like  oh 
 but  I'm  not  masculine  I  don't  compete 
 with  anyone  else  yes  we  do  as  a  man  life
[22:49] is  a  competition  of  course  it  is  that's 
 all  we  do  all  we  do  is  compete  with  each 
 other  for  status  and  for  women  if  you
[22:55] don't  tap  into  this  energy  if  you  don't 
 realize  this  if  this  isn't  consciously 
 in  your  mind  that's  because  you're  not 
 the  competition  that's  because  we
[23:00] defeated  you  myself  and  other  men  have 
 literally  overtaken  you  miles  ago  so 
 that's  why  you  don't  feel  like  you're
[23:05] competing  against  anyone  else  because 
 you've  already  lost  but  men  who  are 
 actually  doing  well  in  life  know  every
[23:10] second  of  the  day  is  a  competition  and 
 this  has  been  destroyed  from  men  this 
 has  been  called  toxic  there  is  a  way  to
[23:16] compete  in  a  healthy  way  and  to  not 
 compare  yourself  which  it  [ __ ]  your 
 brain  a  little  bit  right  there's  a  way
[23:21] to  do  this  and  I've  realized  this  now 
 competing  is  when  you  and  another  man 
 are  going  for  the  same  goal  and  you  want
[23:27] to  get  there  first  or  or  do  it  better 
 than  him  comparing  because  when  you  see 
 someone  else  and  you  just  think  okay  he
[23:32] has  this  thing  that  I  don't  that  makes 
 me  a  bad  person  most  people  compare  just 
 because  that's  what  the  nature  of  social
[23:37] media  you  know  you  scroll  you  see 
 someone  who's  got  so  many  followers  oh 
 you  know  he's  better  than  me  because 
 he's  got  more  followers  or  he's  got  a
[23:42] better  six-pack  than  me  so  he's  he's 
 better  than  me  oh  that  [ __ ]  your  mind 
 we  don't  want  to  do  that  this  is  why  you 
 don't  want  to  use  social  media  to
[23:47] consume  content  we  don't  want  to  compare 
 but  we  want  to  compete  competing  comes 
 with  a  goal  it  comes  with  a  mission  it
[23:53] comes  going  for  that  medal  going  for 
 first  place  wanting  to  hit  1  million 
 subscribers  the  thing  is  Right  me  and 
 Iman  you  know  Iman  got  you  me  and  him
[23:59] didn't  even  speak  about  this  me  and  him 
 did  not  have  one  single  conversation 
 with  this  talking  about  who's  gonna  hit 
 one  million  first  we  were  both  getting
[24:05] very  very  close  did  he  hit  I  think  I  I 
 hit  the  first  year  we  me  and  him  did  not 
 have  one  single  conversation  but  I'm 
 telling  you  right  now  he's  a  masculine
[24:11] man  I  know  for  a  fact  that  he  was 
 looking  at  some  of  our  numbers  looking 
 at  his  and  actually  thinking  okay  we're 
 in  some  kind  of  subtle  competition  here
[24:16] a  masculine  man  will  always  think  that 
 and  then  I  saw  I  was  already  further 
 ahead  and  you  know  like  I  said  first
[24:21] when  he  hits  after  me  but  his  rate  of 
 growth  was  faster  I  saw  a  video  of  his 
 where  he  said  oh  yeah  and  this  is  the 
 fastest  growth  of  anyone  in  this  space
[24:27] on  YouTube  before  I  was  like  oh  is  it 
 just  away  from  just  wait  me  and  him  have
[24:34] not  even  spoke  about  this  but  we  are  in 
 a  social  competition  to  1.5  2  million 
 subscribers  on  YouTube  a  masculine  man
[24:40] always  competes  because  we  know  one  that 
 the  rewards  are  amazing  but  two  what 
 else  are  you  gonna  do  with  your  life  you
[24:46] can  see  like  my  biggest  smile  in  this 
 entire  video  is  at  the  thoughts  of 
 competing  for  another  guy  like  racing
[24:51] ahead  like  we  both  have  the  same  goal 
 growth  on  YouTube  and  maybe  there's  a 
 particular  Milestone  right  we  both  have 
 the  same  goal  but  who's  gonna  reach
[24:56] there  first  competition  is  what  brings 
 men  alive  it's  the  thing  that  we  should 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  comparing  yourself  to
[25:02] someone  else  purely  toxic  hope  I've 
 explained  the  difference  quite  well 
 because  I've  never  really  went  into  it
[25:07] as  much  detail  before  click  and  watch 
 this  video  right  now  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 mwah
