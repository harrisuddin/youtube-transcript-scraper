[00:00] [Music] 
 you  don't  even  know  where  you've  went 
 wrong  do  you  picture  your  personality  in
[00:05] terms  of  how  feminine  or  masculine  you 
 are  you're  a  modern  young  man  that 
 probably  means  you're  way  more  feminine
[00:10] than  you'd  like  to  be  jeffrey  and  jess 
 says  that  it's  okay  that  you  should  be 
 even  more  feminine  but  they  don't
[00:15] realize  that  quite  frankly  one  of  your 
 biggest  goals  is  to  attract  more  women 
 to  have  more  sex  and  to  eventually  have
[00:20] an  amazing  wife  and  children  you  will 
 only  get  to  that  point  if  you  rebalance 
 your  masculine  and  your  feminine  energy
[00:25] jeffrey  and  jess  are  gonna  get  offended 
 at  this  pursuit  of  ours  select  them
[00:30] adonis  on  the  other  hand  understands  the 
 importance  of  this  pursuit  for  young  men 
 to  be  less  feminine  he  looks  around  at
[00:35] you  and  your  friends  and  wonders  why  are 
 men  so  emotional  these  days  why  do  men 
 spend  so  much  time  playing  and  enjoying
[00:41] themselves  with  this  weird  stimulating 
 rectangle  screen  instead  of  conquering
[00:46] the  mission  like  men  are  supposed  to 
 there's  no  short  supply  of  insecure  men 
 with  [ __ ]  tits  these  days  and  you  know
[00:52] that's  [ __ ]  broke  i've  got  a  [ __ ] 
 gyno  do  you  know  what  that  is  i've  got 
 [ __ ]  gyno  gynecomastia  it's  like  a
[00:57] somewhat  of  a  medical  condition  that  can 
 happen  to  like  10  20  30  of  of  teenagers
[01:02] of  boys  who  will  have  elevated  levels  of 
 estrogen  through  puberty  and  they'll 
 develop  like  titty-like  substance  we're
[01:09] not  supposed  to  talk  about  this  [ __ ]  you 
 know  this  is  weird  as  [ __ ]  to  talk  about 
 right  how  weird  is  that  that  a  large 
 number  of  young  male  teenagers  literally
[01:15] develop  breasts  we  live  in  a  time  where 
 like  males  are  a  lot  more  feminine  than
[01:20] they  should  be  your  testosterone  is 
 about  30  less  than  what  it  would  have 
 been  if  we  were  born  20  30  years  earlier
[01:27] your  sperm  count  is  50  percent  less 
 there's  a  shockingly  high  number  of  men 
 who  are  no  longer  fertile  imagine  that
[01:33] bro  imagine  you  go  your  entire  life 
 thinking  that  you're  going  to  be  a 
 father  that  you  know  you're  going  to 
 have  children  you're  going to  have  a 
 wife  and  then  you  realize  that  your
[01:38] sperm  are  all  like  deformed  and  they 
 can't  even  like  swim  properly  men  being
[01:43] less  masculine  and  more  feminine  is 
 deeper  than  we  think  it  is  and  it  starts 
 with  our  societal  conditioning  because
[01:49] when  you  were  a  little  boy  and  you  went 
 to  school  and  you  were  raised  secondhand 
 by  these  female  teachers  who  didn't
[01:54] understand  masculinity  you  were  raised 
 in  the  feminine  structure  of  the 
 education  system  this  sounds  like  really
[01:59] dark  so  we're  talking  about  conspiracy 
 theories  and  stuff  but  it's  the  truth  if 
 you're  raised  by  a  bunch  of  women  who 
 don't  really  research  you  know  your
[02:04] female  teachers  in  primary  school  in 
 high  school  didn't  read  books  on 
 masculinity  they  didn't  think  how  can  i 
 develop  these  men  to  be  more  masculine
[02:10] they  thought  okay  how  can  i  silence  this 
 class  so  that  i  can  talk  uninterrupted 
 how  can  i  make  sure  none  of  the  boys  are
[02:15] playing  too  aggressively  how  can  i  make 
 sure  they're  not  fighting  each  other  but 
 that's  what  we  do  as  men  the  words  that
[02:20] i'm  saying  here  in  this  video  and  the 
 way  that  this  video  is  packaged  it's 
 titled  how  to  be  less  feminine  i 
 literally  have  to  take  a  minute  before
[02:25] recording  this  video  just  thinking  ah  is 
 it  worth  it  because  the  message  is  kind 
 of  important  but  i  might  get  cancelled
[02:30] for  this  we're  not  allowed  to  speak 
 about  this  topic  that  like  men  should  be 
 less  masculine  that  you  haven't  been
[02:36] raised  in  the  best  way  and  the  truth  is 
 as  a  young  man  you  know  that  you  don't 
 even  need  me  to  tell  you  you  know  that
[02:41] you  have  this  like  ill  balance  of  energy 
 inside  of  you  and  it  literally  seeps 
 outwards  into  the  way  that  you  look  why
[02:47] are  so  many  young  men  so  fluffy  like  you 
 can  say  this  this  is  body  dysmorphia  or 
 body  shaming  or  something  but  why  are  so
[02:52] many  young  men  literally  starting  to 
 shape  like  women  without  even  meaning  to
[02:57] the  majority  of  young  men  have  like  fat 
 hips  like  breast  fat  soft  voices  low
[03:02] testosterone  higher  estrogen  what  does 
 that  lead  to  well  it  leads  to  a  young 
 man  who's  way  more  emotional  and  the
[03:07] modern  day  will  tell  you  well 
 men  should  be  more  emotional  but 
 you  know  100  the  thing  is  i  promote
[03:14] positive  emotions  i  promote  gratitude 
 love  mindfulness  100  that's  amazing  but
[03:20] telling  people  you  should  be  more 
 emotional  especially  their  lens  of 
 emotions  is  the  negative  ones  it's  about 
 like  crying  it's  about  like  feelings  of
[03:26] insecurity  like  why  would  you  want  to 
 feel  more  negative  emotions  why  do  they
[03:31] want  to  normalize  weakness  inside  of  you 
 because  that  is  not  allowed  in  adonis's 
 tribe  if  you  want  to  join  our  cult  of
[03:36] young  men  on  holistic  self-improvement 
 striving  to  be  more  like  adonis  you  can
[03:41] be  weak  but  there  is  one  requirement  to 
 join  this  cult  you  must  want  to  improve
[03:46] you  can  be  weak  but  you  must  strive  for 
 strength  the  only  thing  that  we  care 
 about  in  this  cult  this  brotherhood  is
[03:51] that  we  all  want  to  improve  ourselves 
 saying  that  it's  okay  to  be  weak  saying 
 that  you  know  you  should  you  should  be
[03:56] fine  just  how  you  are  you  should  love 
 yourself  it  doesn't  work  for  us  as  many 
 times  as  these  jeffries  want  to  say  to
[04:02] young  man  like  oh  you  know  he  just  be 
 yourself  it's  like  bro  that  advice  has 
 never  worked  for  us  we  don't  feel  good
[04:07] when  we  follow  it  because  just  being 
 ourselves  is  being  a  pathetic  loser 
 who's  addicted  to  video  games  who's
[04:12] watching  porn  who's  literally  watching 
 porn  watching  some  other  man  have  sex 
 with  the  woman  that  we're  attracted  to
[04:18] with  negative  thoughts  in  our  mind  and 
 these  people  are  telling  us  well  just  be 
 yourself  that's  okay  well  no  it's  not
[04:24] okay  we  are  not  happy  living  like  that 
 anymore  so  we  need  to  be  more  masculine 
 and  so  we  need  to  be  less  feminine
[04:30] explained  in  my  how  to  be  more  masculine 
 video  you  should  watch  that  on  my 
 channel  that  the  masculine  energy  is  all
[04:35] about  the  mission  the  objective  the  goal 
 it's  all  about  striving  to  conquer  the 
 goal  and  then  move  on  to  the  next  one
[04:40] and  the  next  one  and  the  next  one  the 
 feminine  energy  is  all  about  the  flow  of 
 love  of  joy  community  empathy  nurturing
[04:46] now  we  all  have  both  energies  inside  of 
 us  but  what  matters  is  the  split  the 
 ratio  inside  of  us  i  found  that  on
[04:52] average  like  most  men  my  age  in  this 
 modern  day  have  about  a  50  50  split 
 sometimes  it's  60  40  sometimes  it's  40
[04:58] 60  but  it's  about  50  50  for  most  men  but 
 i  found  with  the  men  who  really  feel 
 actualized  the  men  who  really  feel  like
[05:03] happy  with  themselves  who  feel  like 
 they're  conquering  goals  that  are 
 worthwhile  who  like  who  are  sleeping
[05:08] with  a  good  amount  of  like  beautiful 
 girls  bro  they're  more  like  80  20.  we're 
 always  gonna  have  some  feminine  energy
[05:13] inside  of  us  and  that's  like  that's  a 
 good  thing  our  ability  to  love  and  to  be 
 loved  our  ability  to  be  empathetic
[05:18] towards  other  people  that's  actually 
 very  very  important  what  you  see  in 
 front  of  you  right  now  you  might  think 
 oh  yeah  like  hums  is  a  masculine  man
[05:23] like  he  has  a  good  body  and  he  sounds 
 really  confident  but  the  truth  is  i 
 actually  have  a  fair  amount  of  feminine
[05:29] energy  and  i  wouldn't  even  change  that 
 because  the  amount  that  i  have  is  very 
 like  controlled  it's  very  like  i've  set
[05:34] it  with  intention  the  work  that  you  see 
 which  i'm  doing  in  front  of  you  is  quite 
 feminine  because  i'm  using  empathy  to
[05:39] understand  your  problems  and  to  give  you 
 advice  for  that  so  feminine  energy  is 
 valuable  but  you  don't  want  a  surplus  on
[05:44] it  you  don't  want  an  excess  of  feminine 
 energy  inside  of  you  so  how  do  you  be 
 less  feminine  and  i  want  to  give  you
[05:50] advice  which  is  better  than  just  saying 
 oh  well  be  more  masculine  how  do  you 
 specifically  reduce  the  feminine  parts
[05:55] inside  of  you  this  is  going  to  sound 
 crazy  because  pretty  much  no  one  in  the 
 modern  world  will  actually  tell  you  this 
 you  need  to  devalue
[06:01] love  and  joy 
 love  and  joy  are  kind  of  like  the  two 
 like  most  but  you know  love  is
[06:06] everything  that's  that's  what  the  modern 
 day  like  that's  the  the  dynamic  we  have 
 that's  what  these  hollywood  movies  have
[06:11] always  tried  to  convince  you  and  we've 
 believed  it  love  is  everything  it's  it's 
 the  most  important  force  in  the  world  if
[06:16] you're  not  having  fun  then  it  doesn't 
 happiness  is  the  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  next 
 time  you  see  those  movies  trying  to 
 brainwash  you  tell  them  shut  the  [ __ ]  up
[06:21] i  don't  want  to  be  feminine  anymore 
 that's  what  all  these  books  that's  all 
 all  these  jeffries  with  skinny  necks  and
[06:26] skinny  wrists  will  tell  you  is  like  oh 
 happiness  is  the  most  no  it's  not  not 
 for  a  masculine  man  the  most  important
[06:31] thing  in  the  world  is  the  mission 
 happiness  is  just  a  fleeting  emotion  if 
 you've  ever  looked  into  stoicism  you
[06:36] know  that  we  cannot  base  our  big 
 decisions  our  like  our  life  of  emotions 
 happiness  and  joy  our  emotions  they  are
[06:41] nice  to  have  this  isn't  saying  like  oh 
 yeah  we're  going  to  be  dark  oh  we're 
 trying  to  feel  like  [ __ ]  like  no  we're
[06:46] not  trying  to  feel  like  [ __ ]  we'd  like 
 to  feel  good  if  we  could  but  if  we  don't 
 feel  good  we  are  still  going  to  conquer
[06:51] that  mission  trying  to  prioritize  love 
 joy  and  happiness  oh  yeah  you  know  good 
 vibes  like  that's  the  modern  [ __ ]  that
[06:57] people  talk  about  like  good  vibes  only 
 trying  to  just  prioritize  those  emotions 
 will  keep  you  kind  of  like  fleeting  to
[07:02] substances  to  instant  gratification  to 
 people  that  you  shouldn't  be  around 
 masculine  men  are  more  like  rocks  they
[07:07] don't  budge  easily  you  need  to  devalue 
 these  like  feel  good  emotions  that 
 you've  been  told  are  the  most  important
[07:12] things  in  the  world  and  instead  you  need 
 to  start  valuing  goals  the  mission  your 
 objective  what  is  okay  what  is  the
[07:18] current  goal  right  now  maybe  for  you 
 it's  to  finish  watching  this  video  and 
 have  a  good  understanding  of  masculine
[07:23] feminine  energy  then  that  goal  will  be 
 checked  off  the  next  goal  is  oh  i'm 
 running  late  on  my  muscle  protein
[07:28] synthesis  let  me  go  downstairs  and  make 
 that  food  conquer  that  goal  then  the 
 goal  is  okay  let  me  eat  this  conquer 
 that  goal  then  the  next  goal  is  let  me
[07:34] read  for  two  hours  conquer  that  goal  you 
 focus  on  the  goal  the  objective  the 
 mission  you  focus  on  these  tasks  that
[07:39] need  to  be  checked  off  you  focus  on 
 purpose  the  greater  vision  for  your  work 
 you  focus  on  being  a  man  instead  of  just
[07:45] feeling  the  flow  i've  really  noticed 
 like  the  feminine  energy  inside  one  of 
 my  best  friends  sam  he's  my  first  video
[07:50] editor  for  this  channel  and  i'm 
 traveling  with  him  we're  in  thailand 
 right  now  i'm  traveling  with  him  and 
 another  best  friend  nabeel  and  there's  a
[07:56] key  moment  i  didn't  really  say  this  too 
 much  to  him  but  we  were  all  bringing 
 back  like  bags  of  like  heavy  stuff  like
[08:01] heavy  water  bottles  and  everything  and 
 it  was  kind  of  annoying  because  there 
 was  a  lot  of  flies  like  big  ass  [ __ ]
[08:06] flies  just  flying  everything  like  a  lot 
 of  them  imagine  like  they're  like 
 literally  everywhere  we  get  out  of  the 
 taxi  here  we're  walking  up  we  come  up  to
[08:12] our  villa  and  i  saw  the  masculine  energy 
 inside  of  me  and  nabil  it  was  like  i 
 could  so  clearly  see  that  inside  of  our
[08:18] minds  was  okay  it's  uncomfortable  here 
 grab  like  the  bags  and  take  them  inside 
 that's  the  current  mission  whereas  i  saw
[08:24] the  feminine  energy  inside  of  sam 
 because  we  walk  in  and  he  sees  like  how 
 beautiful  this  place  is  he  sees  like  how
[08:29] like  beautiful  the  sunset  is  and  the 
 first  thing  he  does  is  like  drop  the 
 bags  and  he's  like  just  like  in  or  he's 
 like  enjoying  the  view  and  like  taking  a
[08:35] picture  of  it  and  everything  that's 
 quite  a  specific  example  wanting  to  take 
 a  picture  of  the  sunset  it doesn't  just 
 automatically  make  you  feminine  but
[08:40] being  too  feminine  is  one  of  sam's  like 
 biggest  problems  that  he's  really 
 journaled  about  he's  really  been  talking
[08:45] to  us  about  and  so  i  really  saw  this 
 inside  of  him  and  why  do  you  think  that 
 is  you  may  not  know  my  friend  sam  you
[08:50] may  have  seen  him  in  some  of  my  videos 
 but  why  would  a  young  man's  biggest 
 problem  be  too  much  feminine  energy
[08:56] inside  of  him  well  sam  says  it's  because 
 he's  been  raised  by  a  single  mother  he 
 hasn't  really  had  that  much  of  his  like
[09:01] father's  masculine  guidance  around  him 
 and 
 truthfully  like  me  too  i  wasn't  raised
[09:06] by  a  single  mother  my  father  was  always 
 in  the  home  but  like  i  wasn't  that  close 
 to  him  so  i  didn't  have  like  a  masculine
[09:11] role  model  to  really  look  up  to  to 
 imitate  you  may  have  not  had  one  either 
 see  this  is  where  it  gets  like  really
[09:17] deep  and  controversial  to  talk  about 
 masculinity  and  femininity  in  like  more 
 of  a  political  situation  i  am  not  like  a
[09:23] political  guy  at  all  i'm  totally  like 
 ignorant  on  these  things  but  it  does 
 seem  to  me  that  there  is  more  of  like  a
[09:28] political  stance  against  masculinity  and 
 especially  against  fatherhood  there's  a
[09:34] lot  of  like  social  justice  against 
 fathers  and  four  mothers  i  believe
[09:39] fathers  get  custody  of  their  children 
 only 
 nine  percent  of  the  time  and  that  means
[09:44] that  we  are  the  first  generation  of  boys 
 without  fathers  so  is  it  any  wonder  that 
 our  generation  of  boys  are  so  feminine
[09:51] that's  something  for  you  to  decide  if 
 you  want  to  like  you  know  look  into  this 
 politically  i  don't  really  care  for  that 
 thing  i  don't  really  care  for  that  but
[09:56] there  is  a  salvation  to  this  join  a 
 tribe  be  surrounded  by  a  brotherhood  of
[10:01] masculinity  be  surrounded  by  a 
 brotherhood  of  like-minded  men  who  want 
 to  improve  themselves  in  adonis's  tribe
[10:07] you  will  find  a  place  where  you  feel 
 important  this  is  the  first  and  only
[10:12] modern  cult  that  is  holistically  good 
 for  you  you  have  in  front  of  you  that 
 offer  to  join  a  cult  of  young  men  who
[10:18] are  no  longer  fine  with  being  weak  and 
 feminine  this  doesn't  mean  like  you  know 
 we're  toxic  and  we  hate  women  and  [ __ ]
[10:23] like  [ __ ]  no  bro  bro  i  love  women  maybe 
 a  little  bit  too  much 
 but  this  is  a  cult  like  a  brotherhood  a
[10:28] group  of  men  who  say  you  know  what  bro 
 i'm  tired  of  watching  porn  and  feeling 
 like  [ __ ]  because  of  it  and  i  think  you
[10:33] should  stop  as  well  you  know  what  like 
 i've  seen  you  recently  bro  like  you're 
 looking  a  bit  weak  let's  go  to  the  gym
[10:38] let's  go  eat  some  my  protein  bro  let's 
 read  let's  let's  develop  ourselves  let's 
 start  business  together  me  and  my  best
[10:44] friend  nabeel  he's  downstairs  right  now 
 we're  going  to  start  a  business  together 
 we're  going  to  make  a  product  that  we're 
 both  going  to  sell  together  how  fun  is
[10:49] that  we've  literally  all  three  of  us 
 have  been  going  to  muay  thai  in  the  gym 
 together  since  we  got  to  thailand  i've
[10:54] seen  these  guys  they  see  punch  bags  like 
 we  all  have  like  some  scars  on  you  see 
 that  we  all  have  like  some  form  of  like
[10:59] scars  of  like  blood  and  like  tears  are 
 on  us  i  can't  tell  you  how  important 
 that's  been  for  our  growth  you  need  to
[11:05] surround  yourself  with  brothers  who  will 
 test  your  masculinity  and  there's  one 
 final  thing  that  will  make  you  a  lot
[11:10] less  feminine  and  way  more  masculine  and 
 that  is  to  enjoy  your  friends  criticism 
 there  is  a  book  that  is  like  the
[11:15] absolute  bible  for  masculinity  i  promise 
 you  that  this  book  will  change  your  life 
 it  is  called  the  way  of  the  superior  man
[11:21] by  david  dieter  and  one  of  the  chapters 
 in  this  book  is  titled  enjoy  your 
 friends  criticism
[11:26] i  was  always  way  too  sensitive  for  this 
 when  i  was  growing  up  i  didn't  realize 
 that  this  was  a  part  of  masculinity  i
[11:31] thought  my  friends  were  just  being  mean 
 to  me  i  realized  now  that  masculinity 
 and  brotherhood  we  constantly  test  each
[11:36] other  we  constantly  criticize  and  tease 
 each  other  can  you  guess  why  can  you 
 guess  why  a  group  of  guys  who  are
[11:41] masculine  would  tease  each  other  because 
 that  seems  like  a  little  bit  of  like  a 
 little  [ __ ]  move  or  something  why  would
[11:46] like  a  friend  of  yours  who  cares  about 
 you  tease  you  well  he  would  do  it  to 
 test  your  security  in  that  thing  so  sam
[11:53] puts  on  a  shirt  and  i  will  tease  him  and 
 say  like  oh  bro  like  you're  kind  of 
 skinny  in  that  shirt  because  i'm  testing
[11:58] to  see  is  he  securing  himself  because  if 
 he  goes  oh  am  i  looking  am  i  looking 
 skinny  i  might  change  how  am  i  changed
[12:03] that  shows  okay  well  he's  got  no 
 confidence  he's  not  securing  himself  i 
 can't  be  around  a  man  who's  not  securing 
 himself  if  i  say  sam  you  look  skinny  in
[12:09] that  shirt  i  want  him  to  be  like  go  go 
 [ __ ]  yourself  hamza  and  give  me  a  front 
 double  bicep  you  need  to  be  surrounded 
 by  men  who  test  you  and  hold  you  to  a
