[00:00] jeffrey's  phone  notification  goes  off 
 again  it's  her 
 he's  so  happy  that  she's  replying  she
[00:05] seems  so  interested  in  him 
 jeffrey's  finally  happy  but  she  keeps
[00:10] making  excuses  not  to  meet  him 
 jeffrey  sees  her  snapchat  story  and  and 
 she's  with  another  guy
[00:15] it's  been  weeks  it's  been  months  and 
 eventually  the  girl  that  jeffrey's  been 
 texting  gets  into  a  relationship  with
[00:20] the  guy  that  she's  been  [ __ ]  all  this 
 time 
 adonis  adonis  texts  girls  in  the  proper
[00:26] way  adonis  is  the  guy  in  the  girl's 
 snapchat  stories 
 and  he's  the  only  one  in  her  mind
[00:48] [Music]
[00:54] all  of  the  advice  that  i  see  online  for 
 texting  girls  is  absolute  trash  normal 
 simpy  little  spurgy  people  tell  you  to
[01:00] do  meme  sensing  her  memes  make  her  laugh 
 ugh  and  the  red  pills  alpha  males  text 
 game
[01:05] is  is  too  avoidant  it  doesn't  kill  a 
 connection  and  it's  too  much 
 it  just  only  focuses  on  texting  for
[01:11] logistics  both  ways  are  trash  i'm  going 
 to  teach  you  my  way  which  is  far  better 
 than  all  of  them  first  of  all  my  name  is 
 hamza
[01:16] i  help  young  men  go  through  the  jeffree 
 2  adonis  transformation  through 
 self-improvement  you're  clearly 
 interested  in  that  scroll  down  right  now
[01:22] click  on  the  subscribe  and  the  post 
 notification  button  and  it's  a  win-win 
 for  both  of  us  so  i  have  personally
[01:27] tried  all  the  different  styles  of 
 texting  when  i  was  in  college  and  i  was 
 about  17  to  18  i  was  doing  the  whole
[01:33] funny  memes  message  her  all  day  make  her 
 feel  good  and  and  send  her  like  all  the 
 funny  stuff  and  make  jokes  with  her
[01:38] and  text  her  and  write  x  next  to  the 
 message  and  stuff  when  i  was  in 
 university  and  i  was  going  through  my 
 degenerate  years  i  was  doing  the  full  on
[01:45] just  read  a  pill  text  for  logistics  my 
 first  message  to  a  new  girl  with  deadass 
 be 
 meet  me  tonight  and  so  it  was  a  numbers
[01:51] game  and  and  it  did  technically  work  but 
 not 
 as  effective  as  my  current  way  to  text
[01:56] my  current  way  to  text  i'd  say  the  most 
 mature  way  that  i've  actually  been  a  guy 
 who  uses  text  to  communicate
[02:01] is  i  i  text  in  a  very  like  business 
 somewhat  formal  manner  but  i  also  send
[02:08] emotional  connecting  messages  to  and 
 we're  gonna  break  that  down  so  here 
 is  the  step-by-step  strategy  to  turn  a
[02:14] stranger 
 into  a  lover  step  number  one  is  the 
 initial  connection 
 it's  when  you  match  with  a  girl  on  a
[02:20] dating  app  it's  when  you  maybe  she 
 follows 
 you  on  instagram  or  when  you  approach 
 her  and  you  get  her  number  step  number
[02:25] two  is  the  first  message  that  you're 
 going  to  send  her 
 and  it's  a  simple  hi  plus  a  genuine 
 compliment  now  all  the
[02:30] although  the  red  pill  guys  especially 
 i've  never  complimented  them  never 
 never  validate  her  bro  i  don't  give  a
[02:35] [ __ ]  bro  if  i  think  a  girl 
 is  cute  i'm  going  to  tell  her  that 
 authenticity  and  that  genuine
[02:41] genuine  indianity  is  why  i'm  attractive 
 and  why  i  seem  confident 
 i'm  not  going  to  hold  back  if  i  feel  a
[02:47] certain  way  about  someone  i'm  not  going 
 to  hold  back  and  telling  them  forget  the 
 rest  of  this  video  forget  most  of  the 
 advice  you've  ever  seen  in  terms  of
[02:52] interacting  with  women  when  your  brain 
 generates  a  thought  and  you  don't 
 express  that  thought  you've  already  lost
[02:57] that  authenticity 
 is  how  you  automatically  polarize  women 
 the  women  who  would  actually  be
[03:03] compatible  with  you 
 that's  all  you  need  to  know  like  i  could 
 end  the  video  right  here  text  out  what 
 your  brain  says  if  your  brain  says  some
[03:08] stupid 
 trust  me  when  i  say  that  if  you  actually 
 texted  that  sort  of  stuff  to  every  girl
[03:13] you  would  eventually  find  the  girl  who 
 who  truly  truly  is  compatible  with  you 
 all  of  the  texan  advice  is  such  trash
[03:19] because  it's  too  different  from  what 
 your  natural  brain 
 is  like  and  so  eventually  you  start
[03:24] matching  with  girls  for  your  nothing 
 like  and  of  course  that  just  kind  of 
 dies  down  because  you  can't  keep  up  this 
 false  like  charade  so  in  this  first
[03:30] message  it's  just  a  simple  hi 
 hey  whatever  and  a  genuine  compliment 
 that  my  brain 
 automatically  generates  for  her  i'm
[03:36] telling  you  this  is  the  reason  why  i 
 seem  spontaneous  and  attractive 
 i  have  the  confidence  to  just  express
[03:41] how  i  feel  about  someone  and  if 
 if  she's  anything  like  me  if  she's 
 compatible  with  me  she's  attracted  to
[03:46] that 
 step  number  three  after  your  first 
 message  this  is  this  is  one  of  the  most 
 important  parts  of  this
[03:51] is  to  not  let  her  lead  the  conversation 
 now  let's  say 
 you  send  the  message  hi  you're  cute  very
[03:57] very  simple  right  and  she  says  oh  hi 
 thank  you  her 
 how  are  you  pause  jeffrey's  and  all  of 
 those  perks  will  be  like
[04:03] i  i'm  good  how  are  you  conversation  dead 
 she  thinks  you're  boring
[04:08] most  girls  are  boring  most  girls  are  bad 
 like  we  can  say  they're  bad  at  texting 
 because  they  don't  actually  have  to  be 
 good  at  texting  because  they've  got  the
[04:13] god  level  abundance 
 most  girls  are  pretty  boring  and  they've 
 got  very  very  basic  social  skills  you
[04:18] can  call  me  sexist  but  it  is  the  truth 
 she's  going  to  text  you  some  boring 
 [ __ ]  it's  like  hey 
 how  are  you  now  if  you're  a  sperg  if
[04:24] you're  a  jeffrey 
 let  her  lead  the  conversation  and  reply 
 to  her  questions  now 
 i  text  in  almost  a  weirdly  autistic  way
[04:31] no  it  is  a  business  you  know  formal  way 
 emotional  connection  like  i  said  before 
 but  it's  almost  autistic  in  the  sense 
 that
[04:36] when  she  texts  me  a  message  like  how  are 
 you  i  respond  as  if  i  haven't  even  read 
 that  she's  wrote  that  because  i  will
[04:41] not  let  her  lead  the  conversation 
 straight  into  the  garbage 
 i  don't  answer  boring  questions  like
[04:46] that  she  texts  me  hey  hamza 
 how  are  you  what's  it  to  you  [ __ ]  why 
 are you  asking  me  for  personal
[04:51] information  i'm  not  telling  you  so  keep 
 that  in  mind  and  then  step  four  is  that 
 you  lead  the  conversation  to  where  you
[04:56] want  it  which  it  should  be 
 to  meet  up  within  a  maximum  of  a  couple 
 of  days  if  you  cannot  meet  up
[05:01] i  don't  really  respect  you  personally 
 i'm  just  going  to  give  you  my  personal 
 opinion  here  if  you  can't  meet  her
[05:06] within  a  few  days  chances  are  you  are 
 very  low  value  and  you're  texting  her 
 because
[05:11] she's  the  only  girl  that  you  currently 
 can  get  and  so  oh  you  know  she  lives  in 
 a  different  country  and 
 and  um  you  can't  see  her  for  three  weeks
[05:17] or  whatever  it  kind  of  shows  me 
 at  least  and  it  shows  everyone  else  and 
 it  shows  you  and  it  shows  her  that  you
[05:22] don't  exactly  have 
 much  respect  for  yourself  because  you 
 didn't  want  a  texting  body  did  you  you
[05:27] wanted  to  connect  with  this  girl  and 
 quite  frankly  especially  for  men 
 even  for  women  the  physical  elements  of
[05:33] our  relationship  with  a  woman  and  our 
 love  of  the  woman  is 
 incredibly  important  and  if  you  cannot
[05:38] meet  her  within  a  few  days 
 it  just  dies  so  in  step  four  you  are 
 going  to  lead  the  conversation  to  where
[05:43] you  want  it  which  is  to  organize  a  date 
 within  the  next  few  days 
 and  so  let's  talk  about  that  date  so 
 step  five  is  to  structure  this  date  and
[05:50] it's  going  to  be  something  specifically 
 that  you  were  going  to  do  anyway  that 
 makes  it  incredibly  easy  and  also  more
[05:56] attractive  to  invite  this  girl  to  do 
 that  and  this  is  where  the  sexiness  of 
 this  guide  goes  away  and  all  the  spurgs
[06:01] will  start  getting  disinterested  because 
 they  don't  do  anything  fun  that's  like 
 that  that's  the  sad  fact  is
[06:06] if  you're  only  doing  fun  stuff  if  you're 
 only  planning  fun  stuff  when  you  meet 
 with  a  girl  and  if  you  probably  don't
[06:11] even  do  fun  stuff  with  girls 
 then  you're  not  going  to  be  attractive 
 anyway  this  is  why  most  young  guys  are 
 so  repulsive  to  women  because  you  don't
[06:17] do  anything  of  them  watch  these  dumb 
 self-improvement  videos  what  are you 
 going  to  texas  go  like  hey  do  you  want 
 to  watch  hamza's  new
[06:22] new  video  like  that  that  would  be  a 
 basically  i'm  not  going  to  lie  but 
 she  wants  to  enter  your  life  she  doesn't
[06:27] want  your  life 
 to  be  changed  because  of  her  so  you 
 should  already  be  doing  fun
[06:33] cool  adventurous  stuff  but  the  thing  is 
 you  don't  that's  why  you're  watching 
 this  type 
 autistic  level  video  right  now  how  to
[06:38] text  girls  if  you  were  doing  fun  stuff 
 you  wouldn't  need  this  guide  but  my 
 videos  are  for  jefferies  and  so  i  will
[06:43] help  you  through  this  okay  what  you  need 
 to  start  doing  which  is  stupid  like 
 basic  ass  advice  they're  gonna  get 
 pissed  off  at  you  have  to  leave  your
[06:48] house  and  actually  go  try  new  things 
 like  how  many  times  have  you  heard  that 
 piece  of 
 one  piece  of  advice  from  your  mother  and
[06:53] from  me  try 
 new  things  like  it's  a  simple  i'll  give 
 you  the  basic  autistic  level
[06:59] help  here  it's  as  simple  as  going  onto 
 google  going  onto  google  maps  maybe  and 
 just  seeing  a  few  different  places
[07:04] around  you 
 oh  there's  a  there's  a  bar  over  here 
 there's  a  park  over  here  there's  a 
 comedy  club  here  that's  what  you're
[07:10] going  to  invite  her  to  but  first 
 you're  going  to  go  to  those  places 
 anyway  and  so  for  step  five  how  you're
[07:15] gonna  invite  her  onto  the  date  this  is 
 the  message  you're  gonna  send 
 i'm  going  to  do  x  would  you  like  to  join
[07:20] me  that's  instantly 
 ten  times  more  attractive  than  the 
 standards  that  guy  said  which  is  like  oh 
 do  you  wanna 
 do  when  i  hang  out  sometimes  you  wanna
[07:26] netflix  and  chill  do  you wanna  like 
 do  do  something  now  step  six  in  cases 
 she  wasn't  very
[07:31] extremely  responsive  to  that  and  she 
 didn't  immediately  say  yes  is  to 
 rearrange  the  date  a  couple  of  times
[07:36] i'll  leave  it  up  to  you  i  would  suggest 
 once  a 
 maximum  of  three  times  that  if  she  says
[07:42] oh  uh  i  can't  do  that  or  i'm  not  really 
 into  that  she  mostly  she'll  say  oh  i'm 
 sorry  i  can't  do  um
[07:47] friday  night  and  so  you  say  okay  no 
 worries  what's  your  schedule  looking 
 like 
 she  should  make  it  easy  for  you  to  get
[07:52] this  date  booked  in  if  it  feels 
 difficult  to  get  it  booked  in 
 she's  not  really  that  interested  in  you
[07:57] and  if  you  do  somehow  like  trick  her 
 into 
 coming  out  on  the  day  she's  going  to  be 
 like  the  type  of  girl  because  she's  not
[08:02] interested  in  you  she's  not  even 
 attracted  to  you  she's  just  going  to  be 
 on  our  phone  whilst 
 you're  out  together  you  only  want  to  be
[08:07] meeting  girls  who  actually  are  really 
 attracted  to  you  which  is  again  this 
 unsexy  answer
[08:12] because  you  have  to  go  and  do  a  few 
 years  of  self-improvement  first  before 
 women  are  actually  attracted  to  you  and 
 all  the  black  people's  bugs  like
[08:17] what  about  genetics  what  about  oh  what 
 about  looks  how  your  navel  can  voltage 
 shut  up  so  after  you've  tried  to  book  in
[08:22] a  date  let's  say  two 
 to  one  to  three  times  if  it's  still  not 
 working  cut  your  losses  stop  messaging
[08:27] her 
 maybe  potentially  in  like  a  month  when 
 you  randomly  see  the  messages  again 
 because  you've  been  scrolling  down  your
[08:32] phone  for  some  reason 
 maybe  send  another  message  then  and  go 
 from  there  but  generally  if  i  can't  get
[08:37] a  date  booked  for  the  same  week  i  know 
 that  we're  never  gonna  meet  and  it's 
 easier  for  me  to  just  kind  of 
 forget  this  girl  exists  then  to  continue
[08:43] trying  to  set  it  up  for  the  future 
 so  step  seven  is  like  the  date  is  now 
 booked  you're  planning  to  meet
[08:48] at  you  know  7  p.m  on  friday  up  until 
 then 
 every  now  and  then  when  your  your  brain
[08:53] expresses  it  to  you 
 you're  now  going  to  send  what  i  just 
 call  emotional  connection
[08:58] texts  which  is  a  simple  at  this  stage 
 let's  say  you  know  you've  just  kind  of 
 met  this  girl  through  a  dating  app  and
[09:03] you  spoke  to  her  literally  just  10 
 messages 
 it's  as  simple  as  just  randomly  the  next 
 day  just  texting  are  like
[09:08] excited  to  see  you  tomorrow  as  simple  as 
 that  it's  it's  something 
 that  if  you  feel  that  way  text  her
[09:14] because  it  makes  people  feel  good  when 
 you  do  this  and  think  about  it  for 
 yourself  if  a  girl  texted  you  like  that 
 you  would  feel  awesome  now  if  a  girl  has
[09:20] actually  booked  a  date  with  you  and 
 she's  going  to  meet  you 
 she's  attracted  to  you  she's  interested
[09:25] in  you  she  likes  something  about  you  now 
 if 
 she  considers  you  somewhat  high  value 
 she's  like  she  doesn't  know  you  like  i 
 do  i  know  you're  a  spoke  but
[09:31] and  that  means  that  if  you  send  her  one 
 of  these  like  emotional  connecting  text 
 messages  it's
[09:36] actually  going  to  make  her  feel  good  and 
 all  the  the 
 like  the  pill  guys  black  pill  red  pill
[09:41] whatever  all  these  like  little  weirdly 
 internet  people  will  disagree  with  me 
 and  say  no  no  don't  make  us  feel  good
[09:46] whatever  but  why  not  make  someone  feel 
 good  especially  the  thing  is  if  she's 
 into  you  which  if
[09:51] she's  got  to  be  if  she's  booking  like 
 you  know  she  can  book  the  date  and  i 
 obviously  like  have  other  guys  booked 
 and  not  meet  you  and  stuff  but  we're
[09:56] gonna  assume  that  she's  into  us  because 
 it's  only  way  that  we  can 
 truly  operate  if  she's  into  you  then  why
[10:01] not  make  her  feel  good  so  up  until 
 you're  gonna  meet  maybe  you'll  send  one 
 to  two  messages  per  day  which  is  just 
 kind  of  like  this  emotional  connection
[10:07] you're  not  gonna  send 
 funny  memes  or  anything  or  stuff  to  try 
 and  make  her  laugh  it's  only  about 
 building  up  a  little  bit  of  a  connection
[10:13] where  you  just  kind  of  express  what  your 
 brain  is  genuinely  saying  about  her 
 so  in  your  mind  through  the  next  day
[10:18] you'll  get  a  thing  like  oh 
 i'm  meeting  her  meeting  that  girl  on 
 friday  you  can  literally  just
[10:23] like  tell  her  i  just  got  this  thought  in 
 my  mind  like  oh  oh  i  mean  that  girl  on 
 fridays  that  is
[10:28] authentic  now  straight  away  all  the  guys 
 will  disagree  with  me  again  but  the 
 thing  is 
 if  that  is  the  type  of  person  you  are  if
[10:33] that  is  what  your  brain  if  that  is  what 
 you  have  genuinely  thought 
 then  if  you  express  that  genuine  thought
[10:40] you  will 
 filter  out  anyone  who's  not  compatible 
 with  you  so  if  you  let's  say  you  send  it 
 to  like  a  bad  [ __ ]
[10:45] and  she's  like  wait  this  guy  is  kind  of 
 weird  like  he's  he's  sending  me  these 
 these  loving 
 lovey-dovey  texts  but  like  i  usually
[10:51] just  sleep  with  guys  who 
 who  spit  in  my  mouth  well  then  you're 
 clearly  not  compatible  with  her  as  men 
 you  have  to  realize  that  we  still  need
[10:56] standards  and  the  standards  that  we  need 
 because  we  would  sleep  with 
 anyone  the  standards  that  we  need  is
[11:02] that  we  will  only  want  to  continue 
 things  with  girls  who  are  gen 
 who  are  attracted  to  our  genuine
[11:07] authenticity 
 like  that's  the  standard  if  you  if  you 
 show  your  authentic  self
[11:12] and  a  woman  isn't  attracted  to  that  then 
 she  isn't  up  to  your  standard  so  step 
 eight  of  this  texting  process  is  then  to
[11:18] meet  for  the  day  to  have  a  fun  time 
 maybe  you'll  even  sleep  with  her 
 and  especially  if  you  do  sleep  with  or 
 even  if  if  you  just  kind  of  connect  in
[11:24] any  other  way  here  right  now  is  when 
 it's  very  important  to  express  that  same 
 type  of  texting  behavior  that  you've
[11:29] been  doing 
 so  let's  say  you  meet  for  the  day  you 
 have  a  good  time  after  that  you're  still 
 going  to  text  an  exact  same  somewhat
[11:35] business 
 formal  manner  with  also  the  emotional 
 connecting  text  in  between  so  the 
 business  formal  manner  is  how  you  get
[11:41] the  dates  booked 
 and  the  emotional  connection  text  is  how 
 you  just  kind  of  express  how  you're 
 feeling  about  her
[11:46] it's  so  important  to  do  those  emotional 
 texts  because  that  is  how  you  filter  out 
 the  women  who  are  actually 
 for  you  so  this  texting  strategy  kind  of
[11:53] like  cringy  insult  to  color  strategy  but 
 if  that's  what  it  is  it  is  it  invokes 
 your  honesty  your  authenticity  and  your
[11:59] confidence  and  that's  why  it  works 
 that's  why  it  works  better  than  every 
 other  guy  that  i've 
 personally  followed  let's  go  through
[12:05] some  frequently  asked  questions  now  the 
 best  question  that  you  could  ask  which 
 no  one  asks 
 is  what  is  the  best  mindset  that  i
[12:11] should  hold  when  texting  girls 
 if  you  can  get  the  mindset  nailed  down 
 honestly  you'll  be  successful  but  no  one
[12:16] asks  about  that 
 everyone's  like  oh  which  meme  should  i 
 send  how  should  i  send  her  a  message 
 three  days  or  five  days  later
[12:22] 17  minutes  so  no  just  shut  up  bro  the 
 mindset  is  all  that  matters  what  is  the 
 best  mindset  that  you  can  have  it's
[12:27] number  one  to  know  that  for  men  it  is 
 always  a  numbers  game  which  means  that 
 in  the  beginning  stages  you  need  quite  a
[12:33] low  emotional  investment  into  this  one 
 particular  girl  you  need  to  convey 
 abundance
[12:38] what  that  means  is  that  you  either  need 
 to  have  other  women  in  your  life 
 or  you  need  to  pretend  like  you  have
[12:44] other  women  in  your  life  you  need  to 
 just  kind  of  like  act 
 like  you  do  the  reason  for  this  mindset
[12:49] is  because  quite  frankly 
 you're  not  going  to  meet  up  99  of  the
[12:54] girls  that  you  ever  interact  with  let's 
 just  be  honest 
 99  of  the  girls  that  you  you  match  with 
 on  tinder  that  you  meet  in  public  and
[13:00] whatever  you 
 you're  never  actually  going  to  meet  them 
 you're  probably  going  to  be  about  one 
 percent  of  them  because  put  it  this  way
[13:05] you've you've  come  across  probably 
 hundreds  probably  thousands 
 of  girls  on  social  media  day  in  apps  and 
 everything  and  how  many  girls  have  you
[13:11] actually  like  truly  truly  met  up 
 over  the  last  few  years  probably  like 
 tens  right 
 so  it's  about  one  percent  and  so  you
[13:18] need  to  have  that  in  mind  that  there  is 
 about  a  one  percent  chance  that  you  meet 
 this  girl  and  don't  let  that  you  know 
 kind  of  like  depress  you  or  anything
[13:23] just  think  to  yourself  okay 
 there's  probably  a  one  percent  chance 
 like  i'm  not  really  gonna  care  so  much 
 right  now  you  still  if  you  end  up  you
[13:29] know 
 thinking  about  her  then  you're  gonna 
 express  that  thought  but  you're  also 
 gonna  think  yeah  there  was  a  one  percent
[13:34] chance  anyway  so  if  she  for  example 
 ignores  your  message  or  she  says  you 
 know  she  can't  meet  you  whatever  she's 
 not
[13:39] interested  in  you  there's  only  a  one 
 percent  chance  you're  gonna  meet  her 
 anyway  so  you  just  get  on  to  the  next 
 one  and  the  second  probably  more
[13:44] important  mindset  that  you  should  really 
 really  note  down  is  that  girls  just  want 
 to  have  fun 
 girls  go  where  the  fun  is  now  if  you're
[13:50] living  a  fun  life 
 girls  will  automatically  enter  your  life 
 now  if  you're  trying  to  have
[13:55] fun  through  texts  girls  will 
 automatically  leave  your  life 
 she  can't  be  your  fun  she  has  to  be
[14:01] invited 
 into  the  fun  again  this  is  why  most 
 young  guys  are  terrible  with  girls
[14:06] because  you're  not  actually  living  a  fun 
 life  you're  not  actually  doing  anything 
 like  good  with  your  life  quite  frankly
[14:11] you're  trying  to  have  fun 
 texting  girls  girls  don't  want  to  have 
 fun  texting  they  just  want  to  enter 
 an  already  fun  lifestyle  the  second
[14:17] probably  most  asked  question  is  how 
 often  should  i  text  how  long  should  i 
 wait 
 between  my  text  that  tells  me  you're  a
[14:22] bit  of  a  sperg  and  you're  just 
 overthinking  it  when  you  see  her  message 
 and  you're  currently  in  a  personal  life
[14:28] mood  reply 
 so  what  i  mean  by  personal  life  is  that 
 you're  currently  not  for  example
[14:33] studying  you're  currently  not  for 
 example  working  so  in  my  specific 
 example 
 i'm  i'm  working  i'm  doing  my  business
[14:38] work  till  probably  about  five 
 till  eight  pm  or  something  and  i'm  in 
 business  mode  for  my  business  i  go  on  to
[14:43] whatsapp  a  lot  to  message  my  clients 
 and  whatsapp  is  generally  where  i  also 
 message  girls  too  i  will  see  her  message
[14:49] and  i  won't  reply  because  i'm  not 
 currently  in  a  personal  life  mode  but  as 
 soon  as  i'm  in  a  personal  life  mode  and
[14:54] she  sent  me  a  message 
 i'm  gonna  reply  don't  do  the  the 
 internet  of  like  oh  double  her  time  and
[14:59] and  stuff  because 
 it  takes  away  from  your  authenticity  now 
 preferably
[15:04] you're  already  like  too  busy  to  be 
 replying  quickly  now  if  you  see  her 
 message  all  the  time  and  you're  if
[15:09] you're 
 almost  always  in  a  personal  life  mode  to 
 the  point  that  you  feel  like  you  can 
 reply  constantly
[15:14] that  shows  me  that  you're  a  loser  and 
 that  shows  me  that  you've  got  bigger 
 problems  than 
 learning  how  to  text  if  it  sounds  like
[15:19] you  you're  probably  getting  pissed  off 
 that  i  just  insulted  you  you  should 
 consider  a  dopamine  detox  and  it  will 
 change  your  life  but 
 i  think  you're  probably  not  going  to  do
[15:25] that  because  you  sound  like  a  spur  third 
 very  important  question  is  what  if  we 
 can't  meet  because  of 
 x  what  if  we  can't  meet  because  she
[15:32] lives  in  a  different  country 
 or  because  she  lives  really  far  away  or 
 because  of  the  covered  lockdown  rules  or
[15:37] anything  and  to  that  i  want  to  respond 
 with  a  question  to  you 
 do  you  really  want  a  text  in  buddy  now
[15:42] you  might  think  oh  yes  uh  like  texting 
 is  kind  of  fun  i've  enjoyed  texting  her 
 [ __ ]  you've  enjoyed  texting  her  but
[15:48] it  isn't  the  texting 
 that  you  actually  wanted  to  do  you've 
 just  enjoyed  connecting  with  a  woman  but
[15:53] this  level  of  connection  through 
 text  messages  is  nothing  compared  to  the 
 the  real  life  connection
[15:59] like  an  internet  relationship  is  not  a 
 substitute  for  a  real  relationship 
 high  value  men  do  not  have  relationships
[16:05] through  the  internet  so  again 
 if  you're  considering  something  like 
 this  you  really  do  have  to  take  like  a
[16:10] look  at  yourself  and  think 
 why  am  i  settling  for  this  finally  the 
 last  major  question  is  what  if  i
[16:15] truly  truly  enjoy  texting  can  i  send  her 
 memes  you  know  that's  mutual  interest  we 
 like  memes  and  to  that  i  want  to  bring
[16:21] back  the  formal 
 point  that  i  had  that  girls  just  want  to 
 have  fun  and  the  issue  is  that  if  she's 
 having
[16:26] a  fun  text  conversation  with  what  seems 
 like  a  boring  guy 
 and  boring  guys  like  you're  a  boring  guy
[16:31] if  you're  talking  about  memes  and  let's 
 be  honest  your  life's  not  that  great 
 she's  then  going  to  keep  you  at  that 
 level  of  just  texting  think  about  what
[16:36] you're  conveying  to  her 
 your  life's  not  that  interesting  you're 
 over  investing  into  this  girl
[16:41] you're  spending  your  own  time  trying  to 
 make  her  laugh  and  sending  memes  and 
 funny  pictures  and  stuff
[16:46] she's  actually  getting  some  fun  out  of 
 the  conversation  she's  messaging  you 
 back  and  everything  it's  so 
 exciting  for  you  to  get  this  this
[16:51] connection  with  a  woman  the  issue  is 
 that  she's 
 essentially  getting  the  best  of  you 
 already  which  is  that  she  knows  you're
[16:56] not  gonna  be  much  better  in  person  and 
 so  she's  never  gonna  actually  meet  you 
 you've  just  reduced  yourself  to  a
[17:01] notification  on  her  phone  now  you're 
 happy 
 with  that  in  terms  of  what  you  get  from 
 her  which  is  her  notification  on  your
[17:07] phone 
 because  that's  you  know  if  it  validates 
 you  getting  this  this  cute  girl's 
 like  name  on  pop-up  on  your  phone  but
[17:13] that  was  never  what  you  wanted  anyway 
 the  issue  with  these  fun  text 
 conversations  that  the  younger  guys  say
[17:18] like  oh  you  know  text  games  absolutely 
 necessary  she  won't  meet  you  unless  you 
 text  her  for  17  days  first 
 it  shows  what  type  of  guy  you  are  she  is
[17:25] going  to  enjoy  those  conversations  she 
 is  going  to  enjoy  those  memes 
 but  she's  never  then  gonna  actually
[17:30] think  oh  let  me  go  meet  this  guy  she 
 wants  to  meet  the  guy  who  she's  one 
 attracted  to 
 who  she's  interested  in  and  three  that
[17:35] she  wants  to  see  more  of  she  wants  to 
 figure  you  out  if  you're  already  giving 
 her 
 everything  through  text  she  doesn't  need
[17:41] to  meet  you  you'll  be  reduced  to  just 
 that  texting  buddy  for  her  and  she's  got 
 a  lot  of  those  sexy  buddies  like  maybe
[17:46] it's  my 
 ego  something  bro  when  i  and  my  heart 
 goes  out  when  i  meet  a  girl  and
[17:51] always  the  same  thing  where  she's  got  10 
 guys  unopened  on  her  snapchat  and  her 
 instagram  and  her  text
[17:56] my  heart  goes  out  to  these  losers 
 because  they're  sending  her  paragraphs 
 on  paragraphs 
 on  paragraphs  they've  been  having  such
[18:01] deep  conversations  and 
 these  girls  meet  me  when  i  send  them  a 
 sentence  if  you  think  that  i'm  boasting
[18:06] this  this  channel  is  probably  not  for 
 you  i'm  just  telling  you 
 what  has  truly  worked  for  me  over  the 
 last  year  of  of  this  type  of  development
[18:12] over  the  last  like  five  six  years  of 
 this  developments  the  business  formal 
 manner 
 sending  emotional  connection  text  in  the
[18:19] middle  now  since  you've  watched  all  this 
 video  what  i'll  do  is  i'll  give  you  a 
 little  extra  treat 
 and  i'll  just  have  a  bunch  of 
 screenshots  of  my  real  text  to  go  so  you
[18:25] can  just  have  a  look  for  some  like 
 inspiration  do  not  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
