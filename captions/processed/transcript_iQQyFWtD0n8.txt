[00:00] i'm  a  failure  i  fail 
 all  the  time  and  i  love  failing
[00:07] do  you  know  how  many  pr  attempts  i've 
 failed  how  many  business  ideas  i  tried
[00:12] and  failed 
 how  many  diets  i  went  on  how  many  times 
 i  tried  to  stop 
 binge  eating  i  failed  more  times  than
[00:19] the  lazy  version  of  me  has  even  tried 
 i  even  tried  to  be  a  rapper  at  one  point
[00:24] who  gonna  have  my  back  i'm  out  here  by 
 myself 
 [Laughter]
[00:31] i  tried  learning  to  code  i  tried  joining 
 the  air  force  i  technically  failed  in 
 university
[00:36] i  tried  game  developing  i  made  my  own 
 little  pc  game  when  i  was  14  years  old
[00:41] i  tried  to  become  a  writer  a  dropshipper 
 a  fitness  influencer 
 i  tried  and  gave  up  many  different
[00:47] sports  and  habits 
 and  because  of  these  failures  i  have 
 succeeded  in  many  areas  of  life
[01:06] [Music]
[01:12] [Music]
[01:20] it  took  me  more  than  three  months  and 
 hundreds  of  failures  to  hit  my  first 
 gymnastic  rings  muscle  up
[01:55] you  in  the  danger  zone  you  shouldn't  be 
 alone  hold  hands  and  say  it  like  me
[02:00] the  most  shady  frankie  baby  fantastic 
 graphic  trying  to  make  dough  like
[02:05] jurassic  park
[02:10] and  i  had  so  many  shitty  workouts  but  i 
 never  quit 
 i  kept  on  failing  and  now  look  at  me
[02:24] i  was  never  able  to  stay  consistent  in 
 my  productivity  i  kept  on  failing  the 
 goals  i  set  for  myself
[02:30] and  now  look  at  this  six-month 
 comparison  i  don't  even  have  exercise  as 
 a  header  here
[02:35] because  i  haven't  missed  a  workout  in 
 around  four  months 
 show  me  a  man  who  hasn't  failed  and
[02:41] you'll  be  showing  me  a  man  who  hasn't 
 tried 
 failure  is  progress  and  that  means
[02:46] failure 
 is  success  don't  be  afraid  to  admit 
 i  failed  future  growth  relies  on
[02:53] accepting  failures 
 and  learning  from  them  if  you  want  to  be 
 like  me  and  start  enjoying  failures
[02:59] there's  just  one  thing  you  need  to  do 
 one  skill  you  need  accountability
[03:06] you  cannot  fail  if  you  don't  hold 
 yourself  accountable  to  that  failure 
 you  must  admit  the  failure  you  must  say
[03:13] out  loud  you  must  write  it  down  this  is 
 the  biggest 
 ego  crushing  activity  i  have  ever  done
[03:20] nothing  knocks  you  down  a  peg  more  than 
 writing  the  words  on  paper
[03:25] i  have  failed 
 and  nothing  creates  you  into  a  man  with
[03:31] purpose 
 more  than  writing  the  words  on  paper  but 
 i  will  try  again  tomorrow
