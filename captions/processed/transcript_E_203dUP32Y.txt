[00:48] i  remember  being  about  13  14  years  old 
 and  playing  minecraft  and  we  would  all 
 hop  on  skype  and  have  like  skype  calls
[00:54] whilst  we  play  and  i  would  literally 
 practice  like  train  my  voice  to  be
[00:59] deeper  and  i  did  that  because  i  was  the 
 oldest  of  all  the  guys  that  i  would  play 
 with  and  so  i  wanted  to  seem  like  you
[01:04] know  the  leader  like  the  the  most  mature 
 one  the  one  who's  going  through  puberty 
 and  so  i  would  literally  talk  in  more  of
[01:10] a  deep  sort  of  unnatural  voice  but  i 
 didn't  realize  at  the  time  is  that  that 
 is  actually  how  you  train  your  voice  to
[01:16] be  deeper  it's  simple  as  that  i  won't 
 even  make  you  wait  like  15  minutes  into 
 the  video  after  like  trying  to  sell  you 
 some  dollar  shave  club  or  like
[01:22] what's  the  what's  the  shitty  sponsors 
 that  everyone's  like  doing  these  days 
 like  lumen  skip  bro  anyone  who  does
[01:27] these  sponsors  just  know  that  they're 
  waste  men  like 
 skin  care  products  like  just  halfway
[01:32] through  a  youtube  video  you're  trying  to 
 watch  to  get  some  advice  and  these 
  will  just  pull  out  like 
 and  that's  why  i  use  dollar  shave  got
[01:37] like  some  shitty  watch  like  that's  why 
 i'm  i'm  sponsored  by  like  why  are  you 
 trying  to  sell  me  something  a 
 youtube  video  you're  pathetic
[01:43] but  yeah  you  want  the  no  bs  way  of 
 making  your  voice  deeper  you  literally 
 just  practice  just  practice  just  speak
[01:48] more  with  the  deep  voice  so  here  i  am 
 speaking  with  my  normal  just  absolutely 
 authentic  voice  i'm  not  doing  anything
[01:54] to  it  what  i  would  do  if  i  wanted  to 
 practice  making  my  voice  deeper  i  would 
 literally  just  speak  in  a  deeper  way
[01:59] like  i  am  right  now  because  if  you 
 compare  the  way  that  i'm  speaking  i'm 
 just  using  more  of  like  the  back  of  my
[02:05] throat  to  speak  it's  literally  as  simple 
 as  just  telling  yourself  okay  speak 
 these  words  in  a  deeper  tone  than  usual
[02:13] and  the  more  that  you  do  that  the  more 
 that  you  will  get  into  the  habit  of 
 speaking  like  that  and  now  i'll 
 transition  back  to  my  normal  voice  so
[02:19] don't  do  it  at  times  where  it'll  be  like 
  cringe  but  you  should  practice 
 speaking  in  your  deep  masculine  voice
[02:26] especially  with  girls  this  is  so 
 you  don't  realize  how  important  it  is  if 
 you  speak  in  your  normal  way  like  i  am
[02:31] right  now  i'm  speaking  to  the  boys  i'm 
 not  trying  to  think  like  oh  yeah  let  me 
 try  and  this  guy  am  i  but  when  i'm 
 flirting  with  a  girl  100
[02:38] you  need  to  activate  that  slow  residence 
 masculine  voice  you  like  stare  at  her  in 
 her  eyes  and  you  talk  like  this  and  you
[02:45] move  real  slow  you're  getting  turned  on 
 aren't  you  bro  so  this  is  exactly  what 
 you  do  you  put  deep  voice  training
[02:52] somewhere  in  your  schedule  maybe  you're 
 working  on  something  maybe  it's  your 
 morning  routine  you  just  speak  outwards
[02:57] like  you  need  to  speak  out  loud  with 
 more  of  a  deeper  resonant  voice  you 
 literally  just  need  to  train  it  it's  as
[03:03] simple  as  that  bro  like  all  this  advice 
 that  i  see  on  youtube  of  all  this  like 
 weird  exercises  that  you  can  do
[03:08] all  that  but  i'm  like  what  the  bro 
 it's  as  simple  as  just  speaking  more 
 with  your  deep  voice  the  more  you  speak
[03:14] like  this  the  more  that  you'll  really  be 
 able  to  like  articulate  yourself  the 
 more  that  it  will  feel  natural  it's  just
[03:19] kind  of  like  a  habit  you  speak  like  a 
 little  because  you  have  been 
 speaking  like  a  little  for  so  long
[03:25] if  you  want  to  speak  in  a  more  resonant 
 more  deeper  tone  more  masculine  way  then 
 you  simply  just  need  to  practice  it  so
[03:31] that  eventually  it  becomes  a  habit  and 
 eventually  it's  like  your  new  voice  and 
 so  when  i  used  to  do  this  when  i  was  13
[03:36] or  14  we'd  be  playing  like  the  minecraft 
 hunger  games  servers  there  was  this 
 particular  server  called  mcpvp  which  was
[03:42] like  this  hunger  game  server  where  if 
 you  wanted  to  you  could  make  friends  you 
 could  hop  on  skype  and  your  team  up  and
[03:47] try  and  like  kill  everyone  else  and  so 
 there  was  a  lot  of  like  communication 
 needed  oh  my  god  you  know  there's 
 someone  coming  in  we've  got  to  kill  him
[03:52] like  they  oh  this  one  there  he's  got  a 
 full  eye  and  watch  out  guys  wait  i  need 
 more  health  you  know  you  say  all  this 
  as  i  would  speak  those  words  to  the
[03:59] friends  that  i  was  speaking  to  i  would 
 purposely  be  just  thinking  to  myself 
 okay  make  your  voice  deeper  make  your 
 voice  deeper  make  your  voice  deeper  and
[04:05] of  course  sometimes  i'd  mess  up  you  know 
 something  like  crazy  has  just  happened  i 
 just  got  killed  out  of  nowhere  so  of 
 course  i  then  i'd  squeak  back  to  my
[04:11] normal  like  squeaky  little  minecrafter 
 voice  but  i'd  regulate  myself  just  keep 
 practicing  with  a  deeper  voice  and  it
[04:17] really  made  a  big  difference  i  know  that 
 this  video  topics  kind  of  cringe  like 
 wait  why  would  you  try  to  make  your
[04:22] voice  deeper  but  the  truth  is  like  so 
 many  young  men  want  this  young  men  want 
 to  be  more  masculine  so  the  specific
[04:28] thing  we're  talking  about  is  like  yeah 
 make  your  voice  deeper  and  sound  more 
 masculine  but  the  truth  is  this  is  so 
 important  for  young  men  we  want  to  be
[04:34] more  like  men  we  don't  want  to  sound 
 like  boys  anymore  we  don't  want  to  look 
 like  boys  this  is  so  interesting  i
[04:39] didn't  even  think  the  video  would  go  in 
 this  angle  but  i  am  really  seeing  like 
 our  generation  of  men  really  really
[04:44] trying  to  reclaim  our  masculinity  our 
 strength  we  didn't  start  off  with  this 
 for  the  majority  of  us  we  didn't  start
[04:50] off  with  like  that  healthy  masculine 
 male  role  model  because  that  should  have 
 been  our  father  but  maybe  our  father
[04:55] wasn't  around  maybe  he  was  abusive  maybe 
 he  was  taken  out  of  the  home  by  like  the 
 societal  political  structures  which  are
[05:01] against  men  or  either  way  it's  kind  of 
 beautiful  to  see  that  we  as  a  generation
[05:06] of  young  men  are  coming  online  to  like 
 learn  the  things  that  we  should  have 
 been  taught  from  childhood  i  really
[05:12] didn't  think  the  video  would  go  this  way 
 i  thought  i  was  literally  just  going  to 
 speak  about  like  how  to  make  your  voice 
 deeper  and  you  know  to  be  cringe  or
[05:17] whatever  it's  making  me  kind  of 
 visualize  myself  almost  like  a  second 
 father  figure  for  you  where  or  maybe  a
[05:22] big  brother  where  i'm  i'm  going  out 
 there  learning  experience  in  life  and 
 i'm  coming  back  to  just  teach  you  what
[05:28] i've  learned  the  best  things  trying  to 
 give  you  like  the  best  advice  and  the 
 best  wisdom  that  i  have  and  that's
[05:33] exactly  what  a  father  should  do  you  know 
 one  of  my  editors  leon  he  actually  told 
 me  that  the  purpose  of  this  channel  like
[05:38] the  thing  i  should  keep  in  mind  is  that 
 i  should  be  filling  the  shoes  that 
 fatherlessness  has  left  empty  for  our
[05:45] generation  of  men  that  i  should  see 
 myself  as 
 your  father  that  i  should  come  onto
[05:50] these  videos  and  speak  to  you  in  like 
 the  very  sort  of  like  unconditionally 
 loving  way  that
[05:56] we  all  needed  so  much  when  we  were 
 children 
 i  think
[06:01] it's  not  even  something  that  i  think 
 it's  something  that  we  all  know  there  is 
 a  masculinity  crisis
[06:06] men  just  aren't  really  muslim  anymore 
 and  some  people  make  fun  of  this  on 
 people  saying  you  know  oh  that's  that's
[06:11] cringe  and  you  don't  need  to  be 
 masculine  meant  to  be  more  feminine  and 
 everything  but  the  truth  is 
 when  a  guy  isn't  masculine  he  feels  like
[06:17] don't  you  like  i  do  when  we've 
 grown  up  and  we've  grown  up  with  being
[06:22] way  more  feminine  and  not  being 
 masculine  we've  looked  over  at  those 
 guys  who  are  masculine  and  they're 
 getting  the  parts  of  life  that  we  wanted
[06:27] like  attraction  from  women  and  success 
 and  we're  here  with  our  hte's
[06:32] and  low  testosterone  yeah  of  course 
 we're  upset  by  that  this  is  our 
 manhood  that  we're  talking  about  our
[06:37] manhood  in  this  modern  day  has  been  like 
 cut  off  that's  why  i  think  it's  so 
 important  like  maybe  it's  my  ego
[06:42] whatever  but  like  i  think  the  work  that 
 i  do  here  and  my  team  as  well  is  so  damn
[06:47] important  to  like  to  cultivate  a  sense 
 of  masculinity  and  brotherhood  inside  of 
 us  because  you  see  videos  like  the  title
[06:53] for  this  one  how  to  be  how  to  get  a 
 deeper  voice  these  videos  pop  off  they 
 get  millions  of  views  why  because  this
[06:58] is  so  in  demand  that  men  want  to  learn 
 how  to  be  more  masculine  men  want  to 
 learn  these  things  that  they  should  have
[07:03] been  taught  by  their  fathers  but  for  a 
 hundred  different  reasons  aren't  anymore
[07:08] i  feel  so  proud  that  i'm  like  taking 
 responsibility  for  that  and  i'm  coming 
 here  and  actually  like  maybe  filling  the
[07:13] shoes  it's  a  beautiful  mindset  man 
 i  think  what  we're  cultivating  here  in
[07:18] this  cult  this  brotherhood 
 is  so  so  valuable  i  don't  think  that 
 this  is  being  done  anywhere  else  like
[07:25] this  is  not  just  a  simple  youtube  video 
 this  is  literally  like  a  cult  of 
 movement  of  young  men  wanting  to  be  more
[07:30] like  adonis  we  hear  adonis's  wisdom 
 being  passed  down  to  us  and  we  try  our
[07:35] best  through  holistic  self-improvement 
 to  get  to  that  crucial  stage  of 
 self-actualization  to  get  to  that  point
[07:41] of  like  where  we're  living  the  good  life 
 to  save  our  brothers  from  being  down  bad 
 and  a  huge  part  of  this  a  huge  part  of
[07:47] this  is  masculinity  it  is  a  sense  of 
 brotherhood  it  is  a  sense  of  developing
[07:52] your  manhood  that  is  so  incredibly 
 important  for  us  never  let  these 
 jeffries  convince  you  otherwise  never
[07:58] let  them  tell  you  that  oh  well  you  don't 
 need  to  be  more  masculine  now  look  at 
 these  alpha  never  let  them  talk  to  you
[08:03] like  that  never  let  them  say  some 
  to  you  like  men  need  to  be  more 
 feminine  men  need  to  be  less  masculine
[08:08] being  masculine  is  like  a  bad  shut  up 
  up  bro  i'm  very  proud  of  the  work 
 that  we're  doing  here  and  i  think  you
[08:13] should  be  too  you  can  subscribe  to  our 
 channel  if  you  want  to 
 welcome  to  the  cult  do  the  hard  work
[08:18] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
