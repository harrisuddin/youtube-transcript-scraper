[01:34] something  about  me 
 i  was  in  the  same  position  as  you
[01:39] no  one  was  able  to  help  i  had  to  come 
 out  of  the  deep  end  by  myself
[01:45] i  researched  a  lot  i  pursued  this  like 
 it  was  my  full-time  job  on  how  to  fix 
 your  life
[01:51] i  tried  so  many  different  things  some

[02:02] minutes  from  now  watch  this  video  in 
 order  don't  skip  around  the  video  i  have
[02:07] purposely  put  everything  in  order  for  a 
 reason 
 so  if  you  want  to  maximize  your 
 improvement  from  this  video  watch  it  all
[02:14] in  order  you'll  understand  why  soon 
 chapter  one 
 taking  action  taking  action  must  be
[02:20] addressed  first  you're  going  to  learn 
 how  to  proactively  take  action  so  that
[02:25] the  other  things  you  learn  in  this  video 
 you  can  actually  do  taking  action  is  a
[02:30] skill  like  a  skill  in  a  video  game  you 
 have  to  level  up  this  skill  but  real 
 life  is  like  hard  mode  and  when  you
[02:36] don't  level  up  your  skills  in  real  life 
 you  actually  lose  levels  so  that  means 
 you  currently  have  a  low  level  in  the
[02:42] taking  action  skill  you're  a  noob  so 
 what  does  a  noob  do  to  level  up  his
[02:47] skill  does  he  come  and  train  with  the 
 big  boys  and  slays  and  beasts  no 
 the  noob  starts  on  level  one  chickens  in
[02:54] other  words  start  by  taking  action  with 
 stuff  that's  easy  now  these  things  are
[02:59] going  to  seem  like  they're  below  you 
 like  you're  better  than  doing  them  you 
 don't  need  to  waste  your  time  doing  such
[03:05] easy  things  you  don't  need  to  kill  level 
 one  chickens  that's  your  ego  your  big 
 fat  ego  is  stopping  you  from  taking
[03:11] action  because  you  think  you're  better 
 than  you  actually  are  you've  fallen  off 
 the  wagon  for  so  long  that  you  need  to
[03:16] now  recalibrate  and  drop  the  bar  so  much 
 lower  so  that  you  can  get  back  into
[03:21] grinding  and  get  back  into  taking  action 
 so  start  small  start  easy  this  is  why
[03:27] all  of  those  motivational  videos  you 
 watch  say  start  with  making  your  bed
[03:33] start  with  making  your  bed 
 seriously 
 pause  this  video  and  go  and  make  your
[03:38] bed  and  go  and  make  it  look  10  nicer  if 
 you  want  some  improvements  from  this 
 video  and  you  want  this  video  to  start
[03:44] changing  your  life  pause  the  video  and 
 go  make  your  bed 
 this  is  how  you  start  getting  xp  in  the
[03:50] taking  action  skill  go  and  do  this 
 literally  right  now  with  starting  easy 
 so  that  you  get  used  to  pausing  this
[03:56] video  and  doing  something  that  i 
 recommend  well  done  you  probably  weren't 
 planning  to  make  your  bed  just  then  this
[04:02] is  actually  a  very  important  concept 
 doing  the  work  when  you  don't  feel  like
[04:07] it  this  is  what  i  have  stated  is  the 
 most  important  sentence  i  have  ever 
 wrote  down  in  my  entire  life  do  the  hard
[04:14] work  even  if  you  don't  feel  like  it  that 
 is  the  secret  to  taking  action  it's
[04:19] acting  without  motivation  not  waiting 
 for  the  right  emotions  the  right 
 feelings  to  do  the  action  and  just  doing
[04:26] it  anyway  we're  so  used  to  waiting  until 
 we  are  motivated  to  do  something  but  did
[04:31] you  know  that  you  can  actually  do 
 something  without  feeling  like  doing  it
[04:36] taking  action  is  easy  when  you  feel  like 
 it  but  we  don't  feel  like  it  most  of  the
[04:42] time  so  we  need  to  practice  the  skill 
 that  better  enables  us  to  take  action 
 when  we  don't  feel  like  it  because
[04:49] that's  when  we're  failing  it's  when  we 
 don't  feel  like  it's  when  we  say  oh  you 
 know  what  our  emotions  aren't  lining  up
[04:55] with  our  good  values  and  i'm  gonna 
 listen  to  my  emotions  instead  of  being  a 
 logical  masculine  person  so  we  do  things
[05:01] that  we  feel  like  doing  and  most  of  the 
 time  we  feel  like  sitting  there  just
[05:06] scrolling  on  your  phone  looking  at 
 instagram  models  gain  xp  in  your  taking 
 action  skill  by  doing  the  hard  work  even
[05:12] when  you  don't  feel  like  it  a  fantastic 
 way  to  do  this  is  doing  any  form  of 
 exercise  first  thing  in  the  morning  i'm
[05:19] talking  literally  two  seconds  after 
 waking  up  after  your  eyes  open  you  burst 
 out  of  bed  you  explode  out  of  bed
[05:25] straight  into  some  push-ups  we're  not 
 trying  to  build  muscle  here  you're  not 
 going  to  get  gains  this  is  about
[05:30] training  you're  taking  action  skill  your 
 mind  is  going  to  tell  you  wait  i  don't 
 want  to  do  that  push-up  thing  today  it's
[05:36] kind  of  cold  outside  and  i'd  rather  stay 
 underneath  the  covers 
 get  exp  and  you're  taking  action  skill
[05:41] by  not  listening  to  your  mind  not 
 listening  to  your  emotions  explode  out 
 of  bed
[05:46] do  a  couple  push-ups  you've  just  got  10 
 taking  action  xp  so  this  is  motivating
[05:52] if  you  can  understand  this  concept 
 you'll  realize  that  anytime  you  feel 
 somewhat  weak  you  feel  like  not  doing
[05:58] the  hard  work  that  will  get  you  to  your 
 goals 
 that  moment  actually  becomes  an
[06:03] opportunity 
 these  are  just  opportunities  for  you  to 
 get  xp  in  the  taking  action  skill  when
[06:09] you  don't  feel  like  doing  the  hard  work 
 so  look  forward  to  not  feeling  like
[06:14] doing  the  hard  work  because  that  is 
 actually  a  good  thing  because  now 
 you're  going  to  try  and  override  that  so
[06:20] you  aren't  going  to  let  your  emotions 
 dictate  your  actions 
 therefore  we  need  a  new  determinator  of
[06:28] actions 
 chapter  2 
 100  responsibility  you  are  responsible
[06:34] for  100  of  the  things  that  happen  in 
 your  life  internalize  this  belief  and
[06:39] you  will  become  successful  masculine 
 happy  fit  strong  and  social 
 say  it  with  me
[06:44] i  am  responsible  for  100  of  the  things 
 that  happen  in  my  life  if  it's  in  your
[06:49] life  it's  your  responsibility 
 that  obviously  means  things  like  going 
 to  the  gym  keeping  fit  is  your
[06:55] responsibility  but  let's  use  some  weird 
 examples  let's  say  someone  spills  their
[07:00] drink  on  you  by  accident  it's  their 
 fault  it's  their  responsibility  right  no 
 it's  their  fault  but  in  the  end  it's
[07:07] always  your  responsibility  on  how  you 
 react  to  things  that  happen  in  life  keep 
 all  of  the  responsibility  on  yourself
[07:13] and  then  you  have  to  personally  overcome 
 every  single  situation  that  arises
[07:18] instead  of  letting  someone  else  take 
 charge  you  may  wonder  why  you  would  even 
 want  to  do  this  letting  someone  else
[07:24] take  charge  is  easier  and  it's  less  work 
 especially  if  it's  their  fault  and  it's
[07:29] for  unimportant  things  like  someone  just 
 spilled  their  drink  on  you  that's  the 
 wrong  mentality  to  have  this  is  all
[07:35] practice  like  training  it's  all  about 
 gaining  xp  in  our  responsibility  skill
[07:41] the  higher  our  responsibility  skill 
 level  the  easier  it  is  for  us  to  change 
 our  lives  your  responsibility  skill  is
[07:48] at  a  low  level  right  now  because  you 
 haven't  been  given  an  opportunity  by 
 society  parents  or  teachers  to  actually
[07:54] be  responsible  for  important  parts  of 
 your  life  when  something  arises  in  your 
 life  whatever  situation  or  problem  that
[08:01] comes  up  remember  that  you  are  100 
 responsible  for  it 
 so  don't  let  anyone  else  claim  the  xp  to
[08:07] level  up  their  responsibility  skill 
 figure  it  out  and  try  to  fix  it  to  claim
[08:12] the  xp  yourself  that  doesn't  mean  not  to 
 accept  help  because  accepting  help  and
[08:17] learning  how  to  fix  something  is  still 
 taking  responsibility  to  overcome  that
[08:22] situation  so  your  phone  stops  working 
 making  it  your  responsibility  would  mean
[08:27] that  you  take  the  time  to  research  it 
 try  to  fix  it  yourself  or  you  take  it  to
[08:33] the  phone  shop  that  can  repair  it  for 
 you  taking  responsibility  for  100  of  the
[08:38] things  that  happen  in  your  life  is 
 uncomfortable  there's  just  more  work  for 
 us  to  do  but  it's  exactly  this  act  of
[08:44] dealing  with  random  problems  that 
 creates  you  into  a  man  that's  actually 
 good  at  problem  solving  this  mentality
[08:50] will  create  you  into  an  independent 
 confident  person  who's  actually  done 
 things  who  feels  competent  in  himself
[08:57] you  must  feel  responsible  for  everything 
 so  that  you  can  be  responsible  for  the
[09:02] things  that  matter  the  opposite  of  that 
 is  feeling  like  you  aren't  responsible 
 for  anything  like  everything  that
[09:07] happens  to  you  is  someone  else's  fault 
 so  someone  else  should  fix  it  someone 
 else  made  you  stressed  and  that  caused
[09:13] you  to  stress  it  so  the  real  reason  why 
 you're  overweight  is  because  of  someone 
 else  and  so  they  should  fix  this  problem
[09:18] for  you  if  this  is  your  mentality  then 
 you  probably  won't  lose  that  weight 
 because  you've  stripped  the
[09:23] responsibility  from  yourself  and  put  it 
 onto  someone  else  but  there's  certain 
 things  in  life  that  other  people  cannot
[09:29] do  for  us  if  you  do  not  remain 
 responsible  for  your  life  you  won't  be 
 able  to  change  for  the  better  take
[09:35] responsibility  over  everything  that 
 happens  and  it's  like  you  give  yourself 
 permission  to  change  so  the  actionable
[09:41] step  for  this  chapter 
 is  to  just  keep  this  in  mind 
 just  try  to  remember  this  phrase  100
[09:48] responsibility  anytime  some  random 
 happens  remember  that  i  am  responsible
[09:53] for  100  of  the  things  that  happen  in  my 
 life  if  it's  in  your  life  if  you've  seen
[09:58] it  you've  heard  it 
 try  and  fix  it  yourself  but  what  if  you 
 can't  cope
[10:03] what  if  life  seems  too  hard  to  bother 
 with  being  responsible  for  100  of  the
[10:08] things  that  happen  what  if  you're  too 
 stressed  anxious  what  if  you've  got 
 negative  thoughts
[10:13] just  battles  going  on  in  your  mind 
 we're  going  to  move  on  to  the  most
[10:18] important  chapter  chapter  3 
 mental  health  this  chapter  is  where 
 we're  going  to  begin  to  take  practical
[10:24] steps  so  i'll  have  you  pause  the  video 
 multiple  times  and  go  and  do  an 
 actionable  step  if  you  want  this  video
[10:31] to  help  you  improve  your  life  make  sure 
 you  do  these  steps  even  if  you  don't 
 feel  like  it  good  mental  health  will
[10:37] make  everything  line  up 
 let's  imagine  a  scenario  let's  say  you
[10:43] had  the  most  perfect  mental  health  you 
 were  happy  almost  all  day  every  day  you
[10:49] were  grateful  for  all  of  the 
 relationships  you  had  you  felt  so  proud 
 of  all  of  the  achievements  that  you've
[10:55] gotten  in  this  perfect  mental  health 
 scenario  do  you  think  you  would  have  an 
 issue  with  nofap  would  you  be  jacking
[11:01] off  three  times  a  day 
 probably  not  would  you  be  scrolling  on
[11:06] your  phone  and  just  over  indulging  on 
 instant  gratification 
 again  it's  unlikely  in  this  perfect
[11:12] mental  health  scenario  do  you  think  you 
 would  struggle  to  go  to  the  gym 
 nah
[11:17] it  would  be  pretty  easy  and  i  bet  you'd 
 actually  feel  quite  excited  to  go  and 
 exercise  flip  the  script
[11:23] what  if  you  have  poor  mental  health  what 
 if  you  have  symptoms  of  major  depression
[11:28] would  it  be  easy  to  go  to  the  gym  nah 
 i  think  it  might  literally  be  impossible
[11:33] you  can  see  that  mental  health  really 
 changes  everything  in  your  life
[11:38] what  is  life  if  not  for  what  we  process 
 in  here  good  mental  health  will  make  you
[11:43] feel  like  a  child  again  like  everything 
 is  just  enjoyable  not  having  negative
[11:48] thoughts  and  being  able  to  enjoy  the 
 random  things  in  life  is  actually  a 
 privilege  that  not  many  guys  are
[11:54] experiencing  the  good  thing  is  that  we 
 can  improve  our  mental  health  with 
 practical  techniques  and  the  even  better
[12:00] thing  for  you 
 is  that  you  are  watching  a  video  made  by 
 a  guy  who  has  been  so  focused  on  this
[12:07] goal  of  improving  mental  health  for  many 
 months  now  i  have  put  in  some  serious 
 intention  in  learning  and  trying  so  many
[12:13] different  techniques  and  i've  even  put 
 them  on  to  other  people  i'm  going  to 
 tell  you  exactly  what  to  do  and  i've
[12:19] concluded  that  there  are  four  steps  to 
 improving  your  mental  health  number  one
[12:24] watch  the  science  of  well-being  course 
 by  yale  professor  laurie  santos  you  can
[12:30] watch  it  for  free  on  course  era 
 seriously  go  to  the  description  right 
 now  it's  link  one  enroll  for  free  maybe
[12:37] even  watch  the  first  lecture  this  is  a 
 life-changing  course  if  you  make  this
[12:42] your  main  focus  and  go  through  at  least 
 one  lecture  a  day  you  will  be  so  glad
[12:47] you  did  i  could  teach  you  so  much  about 
 mental  health  but  laurie  santos  does  it 
 so  much  better  than  i  ever  could  she
[12:53] goes  through  so  much  scientific 
 literature  to  show  you  the  quantified
[12:58] data  to  improve  your  mental  health  and 
 you  would  never  believe  what  the 
 research  actually  says  because  our
[13:03] entire  lives  we've  been  focused  on 
 getting  good  grades  good  job  more  money 
 a  better  house  but  in  terms  of
[13:09] well-being  there  are  other  things  that 
 are  significantly  more  vital  if  there's 
 just  one  thing  you  do  from  my  video  make
[13:15] it  this  go  and  enroll  into  this  class 
 again  it's  completely  free  and  just  go
[13:20] through  this  lecture  with  intents  go 
 through  it  with  focus  get  obsessed  with 
 this  course  get  addicted  to  it  anytime
[13:27] she  tells  you  to  do  some  kind  of 
 practical  technique  or  whatever  just  do 
 it  all  it  will  change  your  mental  health
[13:33] it  did  for  me  i  was  classified  as  having 
 major  depression  20  plus  points  on  the
[13:38] self-assessment  scales  and  it  went  down 
 by  literally  10  times  i  scored  just  one
[13:44] or  two  points  now 
 my  anxiety  was  so  bad  it  was  literally 
 like  life-changing  when  i  took  this
[13:50] course 
 it's  just  you  need  the  knowledge  you 
 need  the  data  and  this  course  will  teach
[13:55] you  exactly  the  the  steps  to  improve 
 your  mental  health  so  the  next  two  steps
[14:00] to  improve  your  mental  health  branch  off 
 pretty  much  the  two  most  important 
 practices  that  you  learn  about  in  the
[14:06] science  of  well-being  course  and  that  is 
 mindfulness  and  gratitude  these  are
[14:11] practices  that  you  can  spend  literally  a 
 few  days  on  that  will  make  everything  in
[14:16] here  so  much  better  your  thoughts  will 
 just  feel  nicer  to  you  your  mind  won't
[14:22] be  all  bumbled  up  and  negative 
 mindfulness  helps  with  nofap  and  all 
 other  addictions  gratitude  is  the  secret
[14:29] to  happiness  so  how  do  you  increase 
 mindfulness 
 the  most  common  way  is  meditating  you've
[14:36] probably  heard  a  lot  about  meditation 
 already  and  you  probably  aren't 
 consistently  meditating  i  understand  i
[14:42] was  in  the  same  place  and  that's  because 
 you  don't  really  understand  this  concept 
 of  mindfulness  i  explain  it  in  a  very
[14:48] different  way  than  anyone  you've  ever 
 heard  before  i  made  a  skillshare  class
[14:53] and  so  far  people  have  said  that  it  it 
 has  been  quite  helpful  that  i  gave  a 
 framework  a  logical  step-by-step  process
[15:01] of  improving  your  mindfulness 
 and  what  i'll  do  is  i'll  put  a  free  link 
 so  you  don't  even  need  to  put  card
[15:06] details  in  it'll  be  link  number  two  to 
 watch  this  skillshare  class  to  improve 
 your  mindfulness mindfulness
[15:12] is  a  whole  grind  by  itself  but  it  is 
 extremely  important  especially  in  this
[15:17] digital  age 
 we  all  suffer  from  mind  wandering  that's
[15:22] where  your  thoughts  and  your  focus  drift 
 away  from  what  you're  currently  doing  so 
 you  find  yourself  being  sometimes  you
[15:28] have  to  like  reread  something  that  you 
 just  read  you're  trying  to  read  a  book 
 and  you  can  only  read  like  one  sentence
[15:33] and  you  start  thinking  about  from 
 high  school  or  this  instagram  post 
 that's  mind  wondering  it's  caused  by
[15:40] excessive  internet  usage  i  think 
 specifically  social  media  because  when
[15:45] you're  just  scrolling  on  your  phone 
 every  0.2  seconds  you're  seeing  another
[15:50] post  another  piece  of  data  something 
 that  just  spikes  something  inside  of  you 
 and  our  brain  isn't  supposed  to  process
[15:56] new  information  that  quickly  this  is  my 
 belief  and  so  what  happens  is  now  our 
 thoughts  are  quite  similar  to  these
[16:02] instagram  posts  where  they're  just 
 random  every  few  seconds  you  just  think 
 about  some  random  that  isn't
[16:07] about  the  task  at  hand  and  this  is 
 killing  your  productivity  mindfulness 
 will  reduce  this  and  help  you  get  in
[16:13] what's  called  flow  flow  is  like  a 
 deepened  state  of  focus  it's  what
[16:18] athletes  call  being  in  the  zone  you  want 
 to  be  experiencing  flow  every  single  day
[16:23] for  the  rest  of  your  life  if  possible 
 and  mindfulness  will  help  you  get  that 
 if  you  want  to  improve  your  mindfulness
[16:29] go  to  link  to  right  now  just  enroll  into 
 the  class  you  don't  have  to  watch  it  yet 
 but  you  can  maybe  watch  it's  only  like
[16:35] 20  minutes  so  you  can  watch  some  of  it 
 if  you  want  otherwise  just  meditate  make 
 it  a  daily  habit  try  and  do  a  bit  of
[16:41] research  onto  mindfulness  every  day  and 
 you'll  find  that  over  time  over  a  few 
 months  or  so  you'll  just  get  more  and
[16:46] more  knowledge  of  this  area  how  do  you 
 improve  gratitude 
 there's  a  bunch  of  different  methods  but
[16:52] i  think  gratitude  journaling  is  the  best 
 you  literally  just  get  a  piece  of  paper 
 or  your  phone  and  just  write  a  couple
[16:58] bullet  points  of  things  that  you  are 
 grateful  for  let's  do  this  right  now 
 this  is  the  actionable  step  so  make  sure
[17:03] you  do  this  right  now  i  did  this  kind  of 
 video  just  recently  as  well  so  if  you 
 did  it  then  that's  good  do  it  again
[17:09] right  now  get  a  piece  of  paper  get  a 
 notepad  get  your  phone  on  the  notes
[17:14] right  i  am  grateful  for  and  just  write 
 one  thing  i'm  grateful  for  this  water 
 bottle
[17:19] there's  mine  you  can  see  how  quick  this 
 was  and  when  you  really  focus  on 
 gratitude  journaling  you'll  find  that
[17:25] it  will  literally  always  make  you  smile 
 because  you're  recalling  you're  savoring
[17:30] memories  that  actually  are  pleasant  we 
 spend  so  much  of  our  time  thinking  about 
 what  we  don't  have
[17:36] even  in  the  self-improvement  community 
 all  we  do  is  just  think  about  achieving 
 more  getting  more  practicing  gratitude
[17:42] is  just  a  bit  of  time  where  you  sit 
 there  and  you  express  appreciation  for
[17:47] what  you  have  right  now 
 that's  powerful  that  is  what  makes
[17:52] people  happy  if  you  watch  the  science  of 
 well-being  course  and  you  see  the 
 research  on  gratitude  it's  it's
[17:57] mind-blowing  it's  like  a  mental  health 
 hack  and  it  literally  takes  a  few
[18:02] minutes  a  day  finally  the  fourth  step  to 
 improving  mental  health  is  to  reduce
[18:07] social  media  including  reddit  this  stuff 
 is  not  good  for  us  you  can't  argue
[18:12] against  this  points  all  of  the  data  all 
 of  the  research  shows  that  social  media
[18:17] is  just  toxic  for  your  mental  health 
 even  if  you're  one  of  those  guys  who  are 
 like  oh  you  know  but  i  barely  use  it  i  i
[18:22] only  scroll  for  like  four  hours  a  day 
 that's  that  is  what's  more  realistic 
 like  everyone  says  they  don't  use  it  but
[18:29] if  you  actually  tracked  your  time  it 
 would  be  at  least  double  or  triple  what 
 you  actually  think  it  is
[18:34] this  is  a  difficult  step  to  quit  social 
 media  like  many  people  have  struggled 
 here  i  did  too  the  only  way  i've  been
[18:40] able  to  reduce  my  social  media  usage  is 
 through  a  long  term  dopamine  detox
[18:46] another  thing  i've  made  a  skillshare 
 class  about  it's  pretty  much  changing  up 
 your  lifestyle  so  that  you  prioritize
[18:51] delayed  gratification  instead  of  instant 
 gratification  so  you  reduce  social  media
[18:56] netflix  video  games  and  instead  add  in  a 
 bunch  of  delayed  gratification
[19:01] activities  like  exercise  meditation  and 
 hard  work  for  any  kind  of  business  so
[19:06] this  is  again  another  life-changing 
 practice  i  have  made  a  skillshare  class 
 on  if  you  want  to  learn  more  about  it
[19:11] it'll  be  link  3  and  you  can  just  watch 
 exactly  why  and  how  i  have  done  this
[19:16] dopamine  detox  which  has  resulted  in  me 
 not  using  social  media  and  honestly  if
[19:21] you've  watched  this  far  a  dopamine  detox 
 is  probably  exactly  what  you  need
[19:26] you  should  consider  it  every  young  guy 
 could  benefit  from  this  so  you  can  see 
 that  there's  a  lot  of  knowledge  here  the
[19:32] science  of  well-being  course  my  video 
 classes  on  skillshare  this  is  what  you
[19:37] should  be  using  the  internet  for  watch 
 these  things  and  you'll  actually  feel 
 productive  with  tactics  and  practices
[19:43] that  will  actually  give  you  some  kind  of 
 improvement  in  life  don't  just  keep 
 mindlessly  watching  youtube  video  after
[19:49] youtube  video  that  includes  my  videos 
 this  is  how  you  know  i'm  being  like  real 
 and  honest  and  that  i  actually  want  you
[19:55] to  improve  areas  of  your  life 
 it  would  benefit  me  if  you  kept  on 
 watching  all  of  my  videos  and  you  watch
[20:01] all  of  them  in  a  row  and  you  binge  watch 
 my  content  but  if  you're  doing  that 
 you're  doing  it  wrong  and  you're
[20:07] disappointing  me 
 if  you 
 these  videos  are  for  young  men  like  18
[20:12] 20  year  old  me  to  improve  their  lives 
 it's  not  for  you  to  binge  watch  it's  for 
 you  to  watch  one  of  my  videos  and
[20:17] whatever  the  topic  is  to  go  and  practice 
 that  so  if  you're  planning  to  binge 
 watch  all  of  the  lectures  on  the  science
[20:22] of  well-being  course 
 take  a  second  and  just  think  that  is  not
[20:27] the  right  way  you  don't  binge  watch  this 
 stuff  you  you  do  one  lesson  two  lessons 
 and  then  you  go  and  practice  what  you
[20:32] just  learned  you  recall  you  write  you 
 make  notes 
 don't  binge  watch  content  it's  never
[20:38] worked  for  you  it  never  will  because  it 
 isn't  a  method  of  actually  learning 
 these  four  steps  will  transform  your
[20:45] mental  health  and  it  will  probably  take 
 you  around  25  minutes  a  day  you  could  do
[20:50] more  you  could  meditate  more  you  could 
 watch  more  lectures  of  the  science 
 well-being  course  you  could  do  more
[20:55] points  of  the  gratitude  journaling 
 that's  nice  but  just  do  the  bare  minimum
[21:00] just  show  up  and  you  will  make  major 
 progress  that's  the  thing  with  mental 
 health  is  that  you  don't  really  have  the
[21:06] capacity  to  do  more  when  i  first  started 
 with  this  stuff  i  literally  couldn't 
 stay  focused  on  the  science  of
[21:12] well-being  course  for  about  half  of  the 
 lecture  like  i  needed  to  stop  take  a
[21:17] break  and  smoke  up  and
[21:22] that's  the  tricky  thing  with  mental 
 health  but  if  you  brave  through  it  if 
 you  just  go  back  just  specifically  go  to
[21:28] the  science  of  well-being  course  because 
 that  is  what  changed  it  all  for  me 
 that's  how  i  found  mindfulness  and
[21:34] gratitude  i  had  been  meditating 
 previously  but  that's  how  i  really  saw 
 the  research  that  mindfulness  and
[21:40] gratitude  are  literally  the  mental 
 health  tactics  that  you  should  be  doing 
 every  single  day  for  the  rest  of  your
[21:46] life  it's  just  a  shame  that  no  one  has 
 drilled  this  into  us  yet  because
[21:51] we  it  would  have  been  really  nice  to 
 benefit  from  this  for  the  last  few  years 
 but  all  you  can  do  is  start  today  if
[21:58] you're  a  young  man  and  you  think  you're 
 anything  like  me 
 this  this  stuff  will  change  your  life
[22:03] honestly  the  science  of  well-being 
 course  gratitude  mindfulness  quizzing 
 social  media
[22:10] i  can't  explain  how  different  my  mental 
 health  how 
 positive  and  how  much  self-love  and  how
[22:15] much  humor  and  laughter  i  have 
 now  that  i've  committed  to  all  these
[22:20] practices  and  how  different  this  is  just 
 compared  to  a  few  months  ago
[22:25] commit  to  these  practices  and
[22:30] it's  like  you'll  have  two  lives  so 
 therefore  with  increased  mental  health
[22:35] you'll  feel  more  competent  to  do  things 
 so  that's  why  we've  covered  mental 
 health  first
[22:40] so  now  let's  move  on  to  my  favorite 
 chapter  and  what  started  my
[22:45] self-improvement  journey  chapter  four 
 physical  health  and  building  an 
 aesthetic  physique  it  is  a  shame  for  a
[22:52] man  to  grow  old  without  seeing  the 
 beauty  and  strength  of  which  his  body  is 
 capable  you  put  in  the  work
[22:58] the  literal  blood  sweat  and  tears  and 
 you  are  rewarded  with  a  sense  of  pride
[23:03] that  very  few  men  feel  you  will  smile 
 every  single  time  you  see  yourself  every
[23:08] time  you're  reminded  how  much  progress 
 you've  made  exercising  specifically
[23:13] building  muscle  through  resistance 
 training  gives  you  and  the  entire  world
[23:18] a  physical  indicator  of  the  efforts  you 
 have  put  in  everyone  can  see  this  and
[23:23] everyone  whether  or  not  they  have  the 
 confidence  to  admit  it  respects  that
[23:28] effort  there's  two  parts  to  this  chapter 
 one  focuses  on  improving  our  physical 
 health  and  the  other  focuses  on  building
[23:34] an  aesthetic  physique  through  resistance 
 training  physical  health
[23:39] young  guys  frankly  don't  care  about 
 their  physical  health  i  know  because 
 i've  been  in  the  same  position  we're  so
[23:45] focused  on  making  money 
 getting  girls  playing  video  games  that
[23:50] we  overlook  our  health  health  should  be 
 a  priority  above  everything  else
[23:55] because  if  you  don't  have  your  health 
 you  don't  have  anything  else  so  how  can
[24:00] we  maximize  our  physical  health  like 
 anything  it  requires  intention  that
[24:06] means  it  requires 
 time 
 and  effort 
 so  the  most  practical  way  for  you  to
[24:12] optimize  your  physical  health  for  the 
 rest  of  your  life 
 is  to  carve  out  some sometime
[24:18] maybe  every  day  maybe  in  the  allotted 
 week  to  literally  sit  there  and  think 
 about  how  to  optimize  your  physical
[24:24] health  this  is  why  i've  got  a  health 
 block  in  my  daily  timetable  i  sit  there
[24:29] and  i  think  what  kind  of  symptoms  have  i 
 been  experiencing  spend  some  time  and 
 effort  thinking  about  what
[24:35] health  things  you  could  improve  on 
 because  we've  all  got  some  kind  of 
 symptoms  of  ill  health  that  we've  just
[24:41] been  putting  off  and  if  you  just  set 
 aside  the  time  and  energy  to  sit  there
[24:46] think  about  what  random  experiences 
 you've  been  feeling  do  you  have  an  upset 
 stomach  quite  often  is  your  shoulder
[24:53] joint  just  really  painful  do  your  knees 
 keep  clicking  do  you  have  a  blocked  nose
[24:58] 24  7. 
 think  about  it  research  it  try  and  fix 
 it  yourself  if  not  book  a  doctor's
[25:04] appointment  this  is  a  foolproof  way  of 
 making  sure  that  your  health  is
[25:09] optimized  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 literally  carve  out  some  time  out  of 
 your  schedule  to  sit  and  think  about
[25:16] what  is  your  ill  health  symptoms 
 we  live  in  such  a  distracted  world  that
[25:21] we  just  live  with  these  type  of  symptoms 
 instead  of  actually  doing  something 
 about  it  because  it's  easier  to  just
[25:27] scroll  on  instagram  and  then  keep 
 forgetting  about  making  that  doctor's 
 appointment  for  something  one  of  the 
 best  ways  to  improve  your  physical
[25:33] health  is  to  eat  for  nutrition  not  taste 
 tasty  food  and  snacks  should  be  like
[25:38] treats  we  should  enjoy  maybe  a  handful 
 every  day  but  we  should  not  fill  up  on
[25:44] this  junk  food  this  is  very  difficult 
 because  you  only  see  the  negatives  of  a 
 diet  when  you  get  older  and  then  the
[25:50] older  version  of  you  will  look  back  at 
 you  today  wishing  that  you  eat  for 
 nutrition  instead  of  taste  so  i  like  to
[25:56] think  of  it  as  investing  for  future 
 hamza  so  that  i  can  look  back  and  feel 
 grateful  for  my  dietary  choices  today
[26:03] and  before  you  know  it  because  i've 
 committed  enough  time  to  this  practice  i 
 am  future  hamza  looking  back  at  younger
[26:10] me  who  has  been  eating  for  nutrition  for 
 the  past  few  months  and  now  i'm  in  the 
 best  shape  of  my  life  it's  delayed
[26:16] gratification  it  makes  your  life  better 
 tomorrow  it  makes  the  older  version  of 
 you  grateful  improve  your  physical
[26:22] health  by  exercising  now  resistance 
 training  will  improve  your  health  but
[26:28] slightly 
 it's  cardio  aerobic  exercise  that  will 
 make  a  big  difference  to  your  health
[26:34] it's  like  training  your  heart  and  in  the 
 most  simple  way  move  more
[26:39] walk  more  run  more  skip  more  go  swimming 
 hike  play  sports  it  doesn't  matter  just
[26:45] do  some  kind  of  aerobic  exercise  a  few 
 days  a  week  there's  a  reason  why  you 
 haven't  just  recently  been  doing  cardio
[26:52] two  to  three  days  a  week  that's  because 
 you  don't  enjoy  cardio  because  if  you 
 enjoyed  it  you  probably  would  be  doing
[26:58] it  so  in  a  practical  sense  you  need  to 
 spend  time  and  effort  just  sat  there 
 thinking  and  planning  and  researching
[27:04] types  of  cardio  that  you  may  enjoy  it's 
 different  for  everyone  so  you  have  to
[27:09] put  in  some  intention  to  find  out  what 
 form  of  cardio  you  enjoy  for  me  it's 
 running  and  cycling  and  recently  i've
[27:15] been  getting  into  skipping  do  not  be 
 like  one  of  those  internet  bodybuilders 
 who  think  that  skipping  cardio  is  funny
[27:21] the  older  you  will  not  find  it  funny 
 find  a  form  of  cardio  that  you  enjoy  and
[27:26] the  older  version  of  you  and  you  today 
 will  benefit  so  now  i'm  going  to  ask  you
[27:31] to  pause  the  video  in  a  second  you're 
 gonna  pause  the  video  for  about  one 
 minute  you're  just  gonna  sit  and  let
[27:36] yourself  think 
 this  is  a  valuable  practice  just  sit  and
[27:41] let  your  mind  think  and  just  think  what 
 form  of  cardio  did  i  used  to  enjoy
[27:46] there'll  be  some  kind  where  you  can 
 actually  remember  yourself  just  smiling 
 and  laughing  through  it  but  you'll  only
[27:51] be  able  to  do  this  practice 
 if  you  do  it  distraction  free  so  sit  for
[27:57] literally  one  minute  just  don't  grab 
 your  phone  don't  switch  tabs  don't  do 
 anything  else  pause  the  video  right  now
[28:02] and  just  think  what  form  of  cardio  did  i 
 seem  to  enjoy  okay  i've  just  done  my 
 minute  for  me  it  was  boxing
[28:09] so  i'm  gonna  start  doing  boxing  again 
 building  an  aesthetic  physique  through 
 resistance  training
[28:14] it's  said  that  we  make  our  first 
 impressions  of  each  other  in  just  seven 
 seconds  in  just  seven  seconds  do  they
[28:21] know  your  story  do  they  know  your  good 
 intentions  no 
 in  just  seven  seconds  they  have  seen
[28:27] what  you  look  like  and  what  your  body 
 language  is  like  maybe  you've  said  two
[28:32] words  physical  attractiveness  is 
 becoming  ever  more  important  i  think 
 it's  like  your  lens  in  the  world  the  way
[28:38] you  see  the  world  if  you're  attractive 
 you  see  the  world  very  very  differently
[28:43] than  if  you're  unattractive  this  hurts 
 we  should  be  judged  on  our  core  values
[28:49] but  that  just  isn't  how  life  is 
 and  so  you  either  play  the  game  or  you
[28:54] automatically  lose 
 so  let's  win  the  game  so  in  this  part 
 we're  going  to  go  over  building  an
[29:00] aesthetic  physique  that  will  improve 
 your  physical  attractiveness  and 
 it  will  improve  your  facial
[29:05] attractiveness  as  well  which  i  know  some 
 guys  say  you  can't  change  your  face 
 that's  bs  they  haven't  put  in  enough
[29:11] work  you  improve  your  body  you  increase 
 muscle  you  lower  fat  and  i  guarantee  you
[29:16] that  your  face  will  look  different  too  i 
 hope  you  agree  that  physical 
 attractiveness  is  important  and  it
[29:21] deserves  to  be  improved  it  also  serves 
 as  a  great  feedback  loop  to  increase
[29:26] confidence  the  more  attractive  you  are 
 the  better  the  world  treats  you  the 
 better  the  world  treats  you  the  happier
[29:32] and  more  confident  you  are  you  get 
 opportunities  and  experiences  that  you 
 would  have  never  imagined  were  possible
[29:38] before  and  improving  your  physical 
 attractiveness  is  not  even  difficult  it 
 just  takes  consistency  forget  everything
[29:45] about  trying  to  find  the  most  perfect 
 training  routine  or  what  your  diet  split 
 or  anything  should  look  like  if  you
[29:51] aren't  currently  going  to  the  gym  and 
 lifting  weights  for  three  months  just 
 show  up  and  do  a  bunch  of  different
[29:56] exercises  find  some  random  routine 
 online  and  stick  to  it  four  times  a  week
[30:01] that's  your  goal  just  this  action  of 
 going  to  the  gym  four  times  a  week  is 
 going  to  massively  improve  your  physical
[30:07] attractiveness  and  confidence  over  time 
 and  that's  the  important  word  it's  over
[30:12] time  it  takes  consistency  not  intensity 
 don't  believe  those  videos  where  they
[30:18] say  oh  make  sure  you  go  all  out  make 
 sure  i  i  work  as  hard  as  i  can  in  the 
 gym  no  no  the  gym  weightlifting
[30:24] specifically  is  not  about  pushing  as 
 hard  as  you  can  it's  about  calculated 
 performance  in  other  words  for  complete
[30:30] beginners  don't  push  as  hard  as  you  can 
 you  want  to  be  leaving  the  gym  thinking 
 you  could  have  done  more  that's  a
[30:36] fantastic  mentality  because  then  you're 
 excited  for  the  next  workout  if  you  keep
[30:41] leaving  the  gym  just  completely  depleted 
 then 
 you're  likely  just  going  to  quit  because
[30:47] it's  too  hard  and  as  soon  as  the  the 
 circumstances  of  your  life  change  and  it
[30:52] starts  raining  outside  and  you  wake  up 
 late  and  you  didn't  really  sleep  well 
 and  you've  got  like  a  blocked  nose  and
[30:57] you  just  feel  tired  you're  too  tired  to 
 go  to  the  gym  because  you  just  pushed  so 
 hard  and  then  you'll  quit  and  then
[31:03] you'll  spend  a  couple  more  months 
 messing  around  until  you  get  back  into 
 the  gym  don't  do  that  do  four  easy
[31:09] workouts  a  week  for  three  months  and 
 then  consider  upping  the  intensity  but 
 let  me  give  you  more  information
[31:15] specifically  building  an  aesthetic  body 
 i  actually  made  a  complete  guide  of  this 
 it  was  a  while  ago  but  it  still  holds
[31:21] true  there's  a  few  certain  muscles  you 
 should  focus  on  if  you  want  to  improve 
 your  physical  attractiveness  these  are
[31:27] the  ones  that  will  give  you  the  most 
 bang  for  your  buck  and  they  are  neck 
 upper  chest
[31:33] lateral  delts 
 and  lats  it's  quite  a  weird  set  of 
 muscles  which  are  kind  of  hit  in  a
[31:39] normal  routine  but  if  you  just  add  in  a 
 couple  extra  sets  of  these  muscles
[31:44] you'll  find  that  your  physique  becomes 
 so  much  more  attractive  because  these 
 muscles  focus  on  the  v  taper  which  is
[31:50] incredibly  attractive  on  a  man  the  v 
 taper  on  a  man  is  like  the  hourglass
[31:55] shape  on  a  woman  and  you  get  the  v  taper 
 by  training  these  muscles  but  the  most
[32:00] important  thing  you  should  learn  about 
 in  this  chapter  is  building  an  exercise 
 mentality  a  thought  process  that  leads
[32:06] to  a  lifetime  of  exercise  because  once 
 you  start  you  start  making  progress  you
[32:11] start  making  muscle  you  never  want  to 
 quit  you  never  want  to  lose  that  muscle 
 this  exercise  mentality  is  priceless  so
[32:18] how  do  you  build  one 
 it's  built  up  over  time  and  so  the 
 biggest  most  important  factor  is
[32:25] consistency  and  consistency  is  such  a 
 thrown  around  word  so  exactly  what  does 
 that  mean  how  do  you  get  consistent
[32:32] you  get  consistent  with  two  things 
 firstly  you  have  to  want  to  go  to  the 
 gym  you  have  to  create  the  routine  and
[32:39] the  whole  schedule  the  whole  block  of 
 exercise  to  be  something  that  you 
 actively  look  forward  to  so  that  means
[32:45] choosing  the  music  that  you  actually 
 want  to  listen  to  in  the  gym  customizing 
 it  making  a  playlist  getting  the  gym
[32:51] workout  clothes  that  you're  excited  to 
 wear  going  to  the  actual  gym  or  doing 
 the  specific  workout  that  you  actually
[32:57] seem  to  enjoy  and  you're  excited  the 
 night  before  to  go  and  hit  that  workout 
 and  two  it's  doing  all  of  this
[33:04] for  years  it's  knowing  that  this  is  a 
 grind  that  is  worthwhile  till  the  day 
 you  die  you  want  to  exercise  find  the
[33:11] exercise  that  you  genuinely  enjoy  that 
 you  look  forward  to  which  also  yields
[33:16] the  results  that  you  want 
 so  if  you  want  an  aesthetic  body  then 
 resistance  training  specifically  weight
[33:22] lifting 
 is  the  way  forward  and  if  you  can  learn 
 to  enjoy  weightlifting  you  can  learn  to
[33:27] like  look  forward  to  the  next  workout 
 thinking  that  you  might  be  able  to  lift 
 some  more  weight  then  good  on  you  you've
[33:32] cheated  the  system 
 keep  it  up  don't  quit  and  you  will  build
[33:37] that  dream  body  of  yours  with  enough 
 time  find  humor  and  a  massive  interest
[33:43] in  this  form  of  exercise  merge  it  with 
 your  personality  become  addicted  with  it 
 obsess  with  it  do  research  optimize  your
[33:50] training  find  a  form  of  cardio  that  you 
 actually  enjoy  and  do  it  two  to  three 
 times  a  week  get  into  the  gym  and  lift
[33:56] some  weights  four  days  a  week  it  seems 
 easy  and  simple  enough  but  you  will 
 struggle  to  maintain  this  why
[34:03] because  you  are  addicted  to  things  that 
 are  ruining  your  productivity  chapter  5
[34:08] addictions  and  productivity  you  are 
 addicted  to  the  internet  i  don't  think  i
[34:13] need  to  know  who's  watching  this  if 
 you're  a  young  man  you  are  addicted  to 
 the  internet  you're  probably  spending
[34:18] most  of  your  day  just  mindlessly 
 scrolling  on  your  phone  watching 
 self-improvement  youtube  videos  or  just
[34:24] playing  video  games  the  young  men  who 
 are  leveling  up  in  real  life 
 are  not  leveling  up  in  video  games  think
[34:31] about  why  every  young  guy's 
 transformation  starts  with  oh  i  used  to 
 spend  all  day  on  video  games  but  then  i
[34:37] quit  and  then  everything  in  my  life 
 improved  there's  a  reason  why  this  act 
 of  quitting  video  games  or  netflix  or
[34:42] whatever 
 results  in  major  progress  to  make 
 improvements  in  your  life  requires  time
[34:48] and  effort  both  of  which  video  games 
 drain  i  know  playing  games  seems  easy
[34:54] and  comfortable  but  they  often  leave  you 
 feeling  fatigued  unable  to  think 
 straight
[34:59] feeling  weak  physically  after  a  long 
 gaming  session  it's  like  video  games  sap
[35:05] your  testosterone  your  masculine  energy 
 video  games  are  carefully  designed  to  be
[35:10] addictive  they've  made  them  to  reflect 
 real  life  achievements  working  hard 
 getting  xp  to  level  up  your  skills
[35:16] making  money  climbing  the  ranks  to  a 
 higher  level  when  you're  getting  these 
 virtual  achievements  real  life
[35:22] achievements  seem  less  important  because 
 you're  already  getting  that  dopamine 
 spike  that  reward  system  is  already
[35:28] getting  fired  up  because  you  feel  like 
 you've  accomplished  something  when  you 
 level  up  in  a  video  game  and  that  is
[35:34] taking  your  drive  away  to  level  up  in 
 real  life  let's  think  how  and  why  some 
 guys  like  me  have  quit  video  games
[35:41] whereas  others  have  wanted  to  quit  but 
 just  feel  unable  to  essentially  how  do
[35:46] you  overcome  an  addiction  correctly  the 
 first  thing  that  comes  to  mind  is  making 
 sure  that  you  replace  the  addiction  with
[35:53] something  else  for  me  i  replaced  video 
 games  with  weightlifting  this  seems  to 
 be  the  case  with  so  many  guys  you'd  find
[35:59] speaking  about  this  online  they  quit 
 video  games  because  they  found  something 
 else  to  do  in  that  time  something  that
[36:06] actually  benefits  their  lives  and  you'll 
 always  find  them  say  that  then  they  just 
 got  addicted  to  this  new  thing  this  new
[36:11] delayed  gratification  activity  and  it 
 makes  sense  maybe  there's  just  some
[36:16] people  amongst  us  who  have  an  addictive 
 personality  and  so  if  you're  going  to  be 
 addicted  to  something  why  not  make  sure
[36:22] that  something  is  something  that  really 
 improves  your  life  over  the  long  run 
 instead  of  just  gives  instant
[36:27] gratification  the  general  concept  i've 
 been  teaching  on  my  channel  is  reducing
[36:32] instant  gratification  and  increasing 
 delayed  gratification  netflix  video
[36:37] games  porn  junk  food  weed  they're  all 
 instant  gratification  they  feel  easy  fun
[36:43] and  comfortable  right  now  but  they  lead 
 to  long-term  detriments  your  life  gets 
 worse  every  day  that  you  consume  these
[36:49] substances  playing  an  hour  of  video 
 games  isn't  a  problem  but  there  is  no
[36:54] one  who  is  playing  an  hour  of  video 
 games  imagine  playing  six  hours  of  video 
 games  every  day  for  a  month  is  it  likely
[37:00] that  at  the  end  of  the  month  you  would 
 have  felt  fantastic  and  you  would  have 
 felt  like  you  had  better  mental  health
[37:05] and  more  pride  because  of  this  month 
 probably  not  delayed  gratification  on 
 the  other  hand  is  activities  that  make
[37:10] your  life  better  in  the  long  run  imagine 
 a  month  of  exercising  for  the  first  time
[37:15] in  a  while 
 at  the  end  of  this  month  would  you  feel 
 proud  yes
[37:20] at  the  end  of  this  month  do  you  think 
 you'd  have  better  mental  health  yes 
 reducing  instant  gratification  and
[37:25] increasing  delayed  gratification  is  an 
 investment  to  your  future  mental  health 
 and  success  the  thing  is  you  have
[37:31] probably  wanted  to  commit  to  delayed 
 gratification  you've  wanted  to  exercise 
 consistently  but  you've  just  felt  unable
[37:38] to  stick  to  that  that's  because  we 
 struggle  to  commit  to  delayed 
 gratification  when  our  minds  are  in  a
[37:43] haze  due  to  instant  gratification  it's 
 hard  to  go  to  the  gym  after  a  long
[37:48] gaming  session  it's  hard  to  stay  on  your 
 diet  when  you've  got  the  munchies  it's 
 like  instant  gratification  makes  you
[37:54] forget  the  delayed  gratification  goals 
 you  have  what  we  need  is  structure  we
[37:59] should  consider  structuring  our  day  in  a 
 way  that  prioritizes  our  goal  but  still
[38:04] has  the  instant  gratification  activities 
 that  we  find  the  most  fun  i  tried  so
[38:09] many  productivity  tactics  and  i'm 
 telling  you  this  one  is  the  most  optimum 
 one  for  guys  like  us
[38:14] make  your  own  timetable  remember  the 
 timetables  we  used  to  have  in  school
[38:19] it  was  also  organized  you  just  knew  what 
 lesson  was  next 
 this  is  what  we're  trying  to  recreate
[38:24] because  timetables  work  and  they  work 
 better  than  any  productivity  tactic
[38:29] including  things  like  the  pomodoro 
 technique  and  so  many  others  i've  made 
 separate  videos  explaining  this
[38:34] timetable  and  how  it  has  skyrocketed  my 
 productivity  i'll  have  the  card  up  so
[38:39] you  can  watch  and  hear  me  explain  why 
 give  this  a  try  and  it  might  help  your 
 life  as  much  as  it  has  helped  mine
[38:45] here's  my  timetable  just  copy  how  i've 
 structured  it  and  then  just  change  the 
 timings  be  sure  to  include  the  delayed
[38:51] gratification  activities  that  will  get 
 you  to  your  goals  like  exercise  and 
 university  work  and  also  one  or  two
[38:57] blocks  for  instant  gratification  just 
 relaxing  unwinding  time  make  this
[39:02] timetable  right  now  this  is  your  call  to 
 action  don't  watch  anymore  pause  the 
 video  and  just  imitate  this  timetable
[39:08] great  so  now  we  all  have  a  timetable 
 wrote  up  get  addicted  to  it  read  this
[39:14] timetable  a  thousand  times  read  it  10  20 
 30  times  a  day  just  know  exactly  what  is
[39:20] at  what  time  then  start  to  follow  the 
 timetable  as  best  as  you  can  it's 
 inevitable  that  you'll  get  away  from  the
[39:26] time  you'll  mess  up  a  little  bit 
 something  will  take  a  little  longer  than 
 expected  you'll  forget  about  it  doesn't
[39:31] matter  if  you  just  try  to  stick  to  it  as 
 best  as  you  can  you'll  find  that  you'll 
 be  doing  so  much  more  than  normal  which
[39:37] is  progress  over  time  change  up  the 
 timetable  and  optimize  it  the  mentality
[39:42] i  want  you  to  have  is  to  think  that  this 
 timetable  is  your  ideal  day  a  day  you 
 could  imagine  sticking  to  forever  so  it
[39:49] has  the  necessary  work  for  you  to  get  to 
 your  goals  of  success  but  it  also  has 
 enough  time  to  unwind  and  relax  so  that
[39:56] it  doesn't  feel  like  a  challenge  it  just 
 feels  like  a  day  which  has  a  little  bit 
 more  work  than  what  you  currently  have
[40:02] now  specifically  onto  addictive  drugs 
 having  a  physical  addiction  to  any  drug
[40:07] is  probably  twice  as  harmful  as  you 
 actually  think  it  is  if  you're  satya  and
[40:12] straight  away  the  thought  of  the  drug 
 that  you're  addicted  to  popped  up 
 and  then  you  convince  yourself  that
[40:17] you're  not  actually  addicted  to  this 
 drug  you're  probably  addicted  to  it  so 
 how  do  you  cure  any  addiction
[40:23] mindfulness  mindfulness  is  the  most 
 effective  addiction  therapy  ever  known
[40:28] to  man  i  don't  know  why  more  people 
 don't  talk  about  this  it's  three  times 
 as  effective  as  a  gold  standard  stopping
[40:34] smoking  program  or  in  fact  i  do  know  why 
 people  don't  talk  about  this  it's
[40:39] because  the  companies  and  therapists  and 
 businesses  that  profits  from  people  with
[40:44] addictions  don't  get  a  profit  from 
 mindfulness  but  you  improving  your 
 mindfulness  doesn't  cost  you  anything  so
[40:51] no  one  gets  to  make  money  so  make  this 
 your  goal  if  you  have  any  addiction  if 
 you  spend  two  out  of  the  last  seven  days
[40:58] taking  any  kind  of  substance 
 meditate  for  just  a  couple  minutes  a  day 
 and  try  to  learn  something  new  about
[41:03] mindfulness  it's  fascinating  the  more 
 and  more  you  research  mindfulness  the 
 more  and  more  your  jaw  will  drop  and
[41:09] you'll  be  wondering  why  no  one  else  is 
 talking  about  this  magical  cure  to 
 literally  everything  bad  in  life  i  might
[41:15] seem  crazy  i  might  seem  like  one  of 
 those  spiritual  people  who  are 
 suggesting  meditation  all  the  time
[41:22] get  into  it  and  you  will  understand  why 
 i'm  saying  this  the  increased  levels  of 
 mindfulness  that  you  gain  from
[41:28] consistently  meditating  will  make  you  so 
 much  more  aware  of  your  addiction  and 
 the  negative  aspects  that  arise  from  it
[41:35] i  know  it  seems  like  i've  simplified 
 this  so  much  that  mindfulness  and 
 meditation  is  the  cure  to  everything  but
[41:40] just 
 if  you  can  trust  me  if  you  don't  even 
 trust  me  but  you're  just  interested  if 
 you  just  commit  to  a  meditation  practice
[41:47] do  it  for  three  months  every  single  day 
 you  will  realize  why  the  previous 
 chapters  have  so  far  focused  on  getting
[41:53] you  to  improve  your  life  becoming  the 
 best  version  of  yourself  now  it's  time
[41:58] to  start  meeting  new  people  so  that 
 these  people  meet  the  best  version  of 
 you  chapter  six
[42:04] social  skills  and  relationships 
 the  reason  why  this  chapter  is  last  is
[42:09] because  you  will  make  the  best 
 friendships  and  relationships  when 
 you've  already  committed  to  the  previous
[42:14] chapters  you  want  to  meet  new  people 
 when  you've  already  improved  your  mental 
 and  physical  health  when  you  aren't
[42:20] addicted  to  stuff  so  it's  like  we're 
 making  you  into  the  best  version  of 
 yourself
[42:25] so  you  meet  people  who  now  align  with 
 your  current  goals  and  values  to  make
[42:30] quality  relationships  with  friends 
 family  or  romantically  you  should
[42:35] consider  leveling  up  your  social  skills 
 it's  right  there  in  the  name  social 
 skills  it's  something  you  can  level  up
[42:41] you  can  learn  practice  and  improve  your 
 social  skills  and  it  is  a  very
[42:46] worthwhile  grind  it's  something  you 
 should  put  effort  into  so  straight  away 
 i'm  going  to  recommend  the  cheat  code  to
[42:53] improving  your  social  skills 
 this  book 
 if  you  do  nothing  else  just  read  this
[42:58] book  or  watch  a  youtube  summary  of  it 
 you  can  read  it  on  kindle  you  can  buy
[43:03] the  paperback  copy  that  i've  got  here 
 there's  an  amazon  link  in  the 
 description  to  buy  your  own  paper  copy
[43:08] it's  like  five  pounds  personally  i 
 prefer  to  read  paperbacks  and  i  use  it 
 as  a  time  just  away  from  the  screens
[43:14] specifically  this  chapter  on  six  ways  to 
 make  people  like  you  these  are  the  six
[43:19] principles  that  seem  so  obvious  when  you 
 read  them  you  won't  even  think  that 
 you've  learned  anything  new  but  when  you
[43:26] actually  read  the  chapter  and  you  read 
 the  examples  that  he  gives  this  is  what 
 will  transform  your  social  life  this  is
[43:31] what  will  make  you  into  one  of  those 
 people  who  seems  to  have  friends 
 everywhere  he  goes  i'm  sure  you've  met
[43:36] someone  like  that  a  guy  who  just  seems 
 to  make  friends  anywhere  he  goes  he's
[43:41] such  a  charming  confident  guy  i  bet  he's 
 internalizing  these  principles  whether
[43:46] or  not  he's  read  the  book  maybe  he's 
 just  one  of  the  people  who  just 
 naturally  knew  this  stuff  this  should  be
[43:51] like  a  superpower  because  any  of  the 
 people  you  meet  through  using  the  six 
 principles  from  this  book  could  be  a
[43:58] future  best  friend  girlfriend  or 
 business  partner  seriously  this  is  the 
 action  step  right  now  pause  the  video
[44:04] and  either  go  buy  this  book  or  go  watch 
 a  youtube  summary  or  go  read  it  online
[44:09] in  some  kind  of  pdf  format  come  back  to 
 this  video  of  mine  when  you're  done  if 
 you  took  that  action  step  and  have
[44:14] either  ordered  your  own  copy  or  have 
 just  watched  the  summary  online  that's
[44:19] brilliant  you  will  be  grateful  that  you 
 did  be  sure  to  attempt  the  principles  in 
 real  life  just  testing  the  theory  me  and
[44:25] one  of  my  best  friends  have  said  that 
 this  is  a  book  that  we're  going  to  read 
 every  single  year  for  the  rest  of  our
[44:30] lives  i  suggest  you  do  the  same  thing 
 now  i  can  add  something  from  my  own
[44:35] personal  experience  to  improve  your 
 social  skills 
 practice  approaching  initiate
[44:41] conversation  with  strangers  it's  this 
 exact  phrase  that  has  leveled  up  my 
 social  skills  and  given  me  the
[44:47] opportunity  to  meet  new  people  this 
 phrase  practice  approaching  and  initiate
[44:52] conversation  with  strangers  refers  to 
 walking  up  to  someone  you  don't  know  and 
 starting  a  conversation  with  them  i  made
[44:58] a  whole  video  on  this  so  you  can  watch 
 it  clicking  the  card  right  now  but  in 
 general  see  approaching  people  as
[45:04] practice  you  shouldn't  just  approach 
 people  who  you  think  you  may  become 
 friends  with  or  girls  that  you're
[45:09] attracted  to  because  then  when  the 
 opportunity  does  arise  when  you  meet 
 these  kinds  of  people  you  probably
[45:14] haven't  practiced  this  skill  well  enough 
 you  see  a  cute  girl  and  you  don't  have 
 the  confidence  or  the  ability  to  go  and
[45:20] speak  to  her  what  you  want  is  to  already 
 be  practicing  this  approach  so  that  when
[45:25] there  is  someone  who  you  really  want  to 
 approach  you're  already  used  to  it  it 
 will  feel  like  just  another  approach
[45:31] when  you  see  an  attractive  woman  or  a 
 guy  who  could  potentially  be  a  new 
 friend  this  is  old  man  vibe  speaking  to
[45:37] everyone  and  feeling  confident  in  doing 
 so  be  interested  in  everyone  know  that
[45:42] each  and  every  person  you  see  has 
 something  to  be  admired  something  that 
 you  could  learn  from  this  is  what  makes
[45:48] you  into  a  social  butterfly  you  might 
 think  what  do  you  even  get  out  of 
 talking  to  people  you  aren't  even
[45:53] attracted  to 
 here's  what  dale  carnegie  has  to  say 
 level  up  your  social  skills  and  you  will
[45:58] live  a  much  happier  life  we  have  the 
 data  in  the  research  that  shows  that
[46:03] loneliness  is  a  killer  in  the 
 self-improvement  community  especially 
 with  men  we  have  this  idea  that  the  lone
[46:09] wolf  is  the  cool  one  the  lone  ranger  i'm 
 gonna  go  it  alone  because  other  people 
 don't  matter
[46:15] the  lone  wolf  dies  alone  think  back  to 
 the  times  that  you  felt  the  most  happy
[46:20] i'm  willing  to  bet  that  that  moment  was 
 when  you  had  a  lively  social  circle
[46:25] you  had  close  family  members  close 
 friends  think  back  to  the  time  that  you 
 were  the  most  depressed
[46:30] it  was  probably  after  a  period  of 
 loneliness  or  after  a  breakup  so  what
[46:35] about  romantic  relationships  getting  a 
 girlfriend  this  is  quite  a  important
[46:40] topic  for  young  men  something  that  a  lot 
 of  us  have  struggled  with  we  have  an
[46:45] innate  desire  to  be  loved  we  want  to  be 
 loved  it  shouldn't  be  this  hard  but
[46:51] modern  society  has  made  it  this  way 
 social  media  and  online  dating  is 
 fiercely  competitive  you're  going
[46:58] against  every  guy  in  a  30  40  50  mile 
 radius  this  is  why  i  suggest  to
[47:03] drastically  lower  your  social  media  use 
 and  if  you  want  a  girlfriend  to  start
[47:08] approaching  in  person  that  is  the  most 
 natural  the  most  respectable  way  to  meet
[47:13] someone  and  it's  the  way  that  makes  you 
 stick  out  because  it  is  terrifying  it  is 
 scary  it's  challenging  and  people
[47:19] respect  that  people  admire  that 
 confidence  there  will  be  someone  who
[47:24] laughs  at  you  there  will  be  someone  who 
 thinks  is  weird  and  funny  and  whatever 
 but  i'm  willing  to  bet  the  type  of  woman
[47:29] you  want  to  meet  you  actually  want  her 
 to  be  more  receptive  to  an  in-person
[47:34] friendly  approach  compared  to  meeting 
 someone  on  tinder  or  on  an  instagram  dm
[47:39] on  the  topic  of  romantic  relationships 
 comes  a  bunch  of  different  online 
 communities  that  we  as  young  men  have
[47:45] invested  into 
 specifically  in-cell 
 involuntary  celibates  and  black  pill  are
[47:53] the  ones  that  i 
 very  very  much  disagree  with  these  are 
 essentially  like
[47:58] the  loser  mentality  oh  it  doesn't  work 
 for  us  so  we're  going  to  give  up  and  the
[48:03] rest  of  the  world  is  wrong  we  are  kind 
 of  right  i  can  understand  why  a  young
[48:09] man  watching  this  could  be  subscribed  to 
 this  in-cell  or  black  pill  or  whatever
[48:14] words  they  use  why  not  just  make  your 
 life  as  best  as  possible  if  there  are 
 people  with  the  same  insecurities  as  you
[48:20] still  achieving  the  things  that  you  want 
 then  it's  all  a  mentality  it's  all  about
[48:25] how  much  work  you've  put  in 
 i  found  that  there's  no  hard-working
[48:30] person  in  these  type  of  groups  they're 
 just  defeatists 
 oh  like  i'm  not  getting  everything
[48:35] handed  to  me  so  there's  no  chance 
 which  is  bs  we  know  that  if  you  work
[48:40] hard  you  can  literally  achieve  anything 
 in  this  world  capitalism  has  made  it
[48:45] that  way  whether  or  not  you  agree  with 
 it  you  can  become  a  millionaire  you  can 
 become
[48:50] at  least  an  8  out  of  10  in  physical 
 attractiveness  if  we're  going  to  use 
 this  numbers  you  can  maybe  your
[48:56] face  is  ugly 
 but  you  can  still  go  and  achieve  a  10 
 out  of  10  model  body  and  i'm  sure  that
[49:02] if  you  had  that  type  of  body  you  would 
 be  more  physically  attractive  than  you 
 currently  are  so  what's  with  this 
 defeatist  mentality  and  so  really  if  you
[49:09] find  yourself  struggling  to  get  romance 
 in  your  life  which  so  many  young  guys 
 are  consider  investing  into  the  previous
[49:16] five  chapters 
 they  will  make  your  life  so  much  better 
 they  will  make  you  more  attractive  more
[49:21] confident  really  to  get  a  girl 
 one  of  the  biggest  things  you  need  is 
 high  self-esteem
[49:27] and  if  you  struggle  with  women  it's 
 because  you  have  low  self-esteem  and 
 that's  because  you  haven't  done  much  in
[49:33] life  yet  and  you  want  the  reward  without 
 putting  in  the  work
[49:38] you  build  your  self-esteem  by  doing 
 things  by  having  self-love  for  the 
 delayed  classification  activities  commit
[49:43] to  the  previous  five  chapters  and  i'm 
 sure  you  will  find  it  significantly 
 easier  and  more  natural  to  get  more
[49:51] romantic  relationships  in  your  life  and 
 i  want  to  remind  you
[49:56] social  skills  are  a  skill  i  want  to  keep 
 drilling  in  this  idea  of  this  video  game 
 skill  that  we  can  level  this  up  we  can
[50:03] get  xp  in  the  skills  that  i've  mentioned 
 in  this  video  through  just  doing  the 
 actions  doing  the  grind  and  you  get  xp
[50:10] in  your  social  skills  by  practicing  by 
 reading  material  like  this  maybe  there's
[50:15] other  stuff  online  but  this  is  the  one  i 
 personally  recommend  reading  it  trying
[50:20] it  making  notes  and  then  going  outside 
 and  actually  testing  it  you  just  have  to 
 put  in  the  work  first  you  can't  be  a
[50:26] level  one  and  then  be  angry  that  you're 
 not  a  level  10  in  a  game  without 
 actually  doing  the  actions  that  makes
[50:32] you  into  a  level  10.  that's  just  weird 
 you  can't  expect  a  higher  level  without
[50:37] getting  the  xp 
 and  too  many  young  guys  seem  to  struggle 
 with  this  concept  so  that's  why  i've
[50:42] been  trying  to  drill  it  into  this  video 
 that  real  life  is  very  similar  to  these 
 games  that  you  have  to  put  in  the  work
[50:47] you  have  to  get  the  xp  and  then  your 
 level  goes  up  don't  expect  your  level  to 
 go  up  without  actually  getting  the  xp
[50:53] chapter  seven 
 purpose 
 this  may  be  one  of  the  most  important
[50:58] things  in  your  life 
 i  am  very  grateful 
 to  have  realized
[51:03] identified  and  defined  my  purpose 
 recently
[51:08] my  purpose  is  to  help  young  men  improve 
 their  physical  and  mental  health  when
[51:13] you  can  define  your  purpose  so 
 straightforward  like  that
[51:18] it's  it  changes  your  life 
 it  gives  you  a  reason  to  wake  up  it 
 gives  you  a  reason  to  go  to  bed  to  rest
[51:25] i've  only  just  recently  gotten  into  this 
 idea  of  defining  my  purpose  and 
 there's  been  a  very  big  difference  in  my
[51:31] life  due  to  this  so  i  want  you  guys  to 
 be  able  to  experience  the  same  thing  the
[51:36] best  advice  that  i  could  give  you  right 
 now 
 is  to  cut  out  the  distractions  if  you
[51:41] don't  know  what  your  purpose  is  and  you 
 haven't  been  able  to  think  of  one 
 i  am  sure  that  that  is  because  you  are
[51:48] spending  all  of  your  time  distracted 
 to  be  able  to  think  about  these  this  is 
 a  big  philosophical  topic  to  be  able  to
[51:55] think  and  actually  have  this  defined 
 purpose  you  must  allow  yourself  to  think
[52:00] distraction  free  how  many  hours  are  you 
 spending  sitting  there  thinking  about 
 this
[52:06] zero  because  what  you're  actually  doing 
 is  thinking  about  this  while  scrolling 
 on  instagram  whilst  on  reddit  whilst
[52:11] watching  self-improvement  videos  if  you 
 want  to  be  able  to  define  your  purpose
[52:16] here's  the  action  step  take  some  time 
 minutes  hours  days  weeks
[52:21] with  not  even  a  screen  in  front  of  you 
 no  distractions  in  front  of  you  and 
 think  about  this
[52:27] that  is  the  first  big  step  you  cannot 
 have  a  defined  purpose  if  you  are
[52:32] distracted  you  can't  think  these  type  of 
 in-depth 
 thoughts 
 if  you  are  scrolling  on  instagram  what
[52:38] you  need  to  do  practically  is  take  away 
 every  screen  sit  there  with  nothing  in 
 front  of  you  apart  from  a  piece  of  paper
[52:44] and  a  pen 
 that  is  how  you  will  come  to  find  your 
 purpose  there  are  also  some  cues  that  i
[52:49] can  tell  you  that  will  help  here  are 
 seven  questions  to  ask  yourself  i  found 
 these  questions  from  a  course  on  purpose
[52:56] it's  on  the  website  coursera  so  i  will 
 link  that  below  and  if  you  go  through 
 this  course  i  am  pretty  sure  that  you
[53:01] will  have  a  defined  purpose  very  soon 
 but  one  of  the  first  exercises  he
[53:06] instructs  you  to  do  is  to  go  through 
 these  seven  questions
[53:11] for  example  the  first  question  what 
 matters  most  here's  my  answer  what
[53:16] matters  most 
 happiness  coupled  with  longevity  safety
[53:21] health 
 in  other  words  mental  and  physical 
 health  happiness  is  a  byproduct  of  good
[53:27] mental  health 
 i  think  fulfillment  relationships  are 
 very  important  but  these  come  after  good
[53:33] physical  and  mental  health  so  what 
 matters  most  is  physical  and  mental 
 health  that  makes  me  feel  amazing
[53:40] i'm  teaching  as  important  knowledge  as 
 they  can  be 
 you  can  see  how  in  the  first  question  i
[53:45] have  already  solidified  my  idea  that 
 this  what  i'm  doing  right  now  when  i'm
[53:50] talking  to  you  this  is  my  purpose  that 
 in  my  opinion  there's  nothing  more 
 important  than  physical  and  mental
[53:55] health  if  you  don't  have  health  you 
 don't  have  anything  else  and  if  this  is
[54:00] what  i'm  teaching  to  people  hopefully 
 you  can  see  some  kind  of  like  link  here 
 of  why  i  feel  so  happy  and  fulfilled  in
[54:06] the  last  few  months  since  i  have  found 
 this  purpose  this  outlet  for  me  to  help
[54:11] people  improve  their  physical  and  mental 
 health  find  your  purpose  and  your  life 
 will  just  seem  so  much  more  fulfilling
[54:18] and 
 if  you  can  create  or  find  a  purpose  that 
 is  bigger  than  yourself  which  i  would
[54:23] recommend  that  your  purpose  should  be 
 something  bigger  than  you  because  then 
 it  just  grounds  you  more  it  makes  you
[54:29] needed 
 it  makes  you  appreciate  it  it  links  you 
 socially  and  romantically  with  other
[54:35] people 
 it  makes  other  people  grateful  for  you 
 which  is  a  fantastic  feeling
[54:41] and 
 and  in  this  day  and  age 
 this  is  kind  of  related  to  purpose
[54:46] because 
 our  modern  society  isn't  so  great  in  the 
 sense  that  we  are  so
[54:53] focused  on  money  and  needing  to  work 
 shitty  jobs  and  that  essentially 
 distracts  you  away  from  your  purpose  and
[54:59] that  is  why  i  would  say  99  of 
 i  was  going  to  say  young  people  but  i 
 think  99  of  people  do  not  have  a  clear
[55:05] purpose  because  they  spend  all  their 
 time  in  work  which  is  obviously  not
[55:10] their  purpose  the  internet  has  equalized 
 a  lot  of  stuff
[55:15] no  matter  what  your  purpose  is 
 it's  very  likely  that
[55:20] you  will  be  able  to  make  a  living  from 
 your  purpose 
 if  you  just  have  some  kind  of
[55:25] entrepreneurial  mindset 
 it  all  starts  with  giving  away  free 
 value  if  your  purpose  is  something  to  do
[55:31] with  helping  people  say  your  purpose  is 
 similar  to  mine  wanting  to  be  some  kind 
 of  coach  some  kind  of  mentor  to  help
[55:37] people  online  you  have  to  start  by 
 giving  free  value 
 you  have  to  start  it's  consistency  over
[55:43] intensity  your  first  platform  that  you 
 make  videos  on  or  content  on  it's  going
[55:48] to  be 
 subpar 
 if  you  are  unwilling  to  accept  that  you 
 will  never  start  if  you  want  if  you  want
[55:55] your  first  workout  ever  in  the  gym  to  be 
 as  good  as  mine  are  six  years  in  you
[56:00] will  never  start  you  have  to  start  with 
 a  beginner's  routine  a  beginner's 
 workout  and  then  you  also  have  to  start
[56:06] with  like  a  beginner's  production 
 quality  low  level  youtube  video  content
[56:11] if  you're  scared  of  that  you  will  not 
 start 
 start  with  giving  free  value  let  me  just
[56:17] repeat 
 if  you  do  not  know  your  purpose  it  is 
 worth  finding  it  and  it's  not  difficult
[56:24] to  find  it 
 it  just  requires  intention  it  requires 
 time  and  effort  time  and  effort  away
[56:30] from  these  screens 
 so  with  that  i  will  close  off  this 
 youtube  video  and  the  last  actionable
[56:35] step  is  for  you  to  just  spend  a  few 
 minutes  with  nothing  else  in  front  of 
 you  turn  the  screen  off  on  your  phone
[56:41] turn  the  screen  off  on  your  computer  and 
 just  think 
 what  do  i  want  for  the  rest  of  my  life
[56:48] what  is  the  end  goal 
 if  i  was  given  more  money  than  i  ever 
 needed
[56:53] what  would  i  be  doing 
 for  me  i  wanted  to  be  traveling  and  then
[57:00] i  think  a  lot  of  us  would  still  be 
 wanting  some  kind  of  project  to  work  on 
 it's  just  something  to  grow  something
[57:06] more  fun  and  for  me  that  was  always 
 going  to  be  a  youtube  channel  i  wanted 
 to  travel  and  just  speak  my  mind  to  the
[57:11] camera 
 and  now  i've  found  such  a  purpose  that 
 actually  helps  other  people
[57:17] if  i  won  10  million  pounds  if  i  never 
 needed  money  again 
 my  life  would  not  change
[57:26] that's  how  you  know  you  found  the  right 
 purpose 
 oh 
 that  was  a  good  sentence
[57:33] all  right  so  before  i  leave  i'm  gonna  do 
 some  plugs  for  my  own  extra  stuff  that  i
[57:38] offer 
 so  if  you've  watched  this  far 
 i'm  grateful
[57:43] i  really  hope  that  you've  been  taking 
 the  actionable  steps  so  far 
 if  you've  watched  this  far  i  think  you
[57:48] would  have  if  there's  anyone  who  has 
 watched  this  far  and  you  have  not  taken 
 the  actionable  steps
[57:54] i  would  recommend  doing  them  if  you 
 watch  this  far  then  this  is  definitely  a 
 topic  that  you're  interested  in  you  want
[57:59] to  improve  your  life  maybe  you've  just 
 not  been 
 so  successful  with  it  so  far
[58:06] this  video  i've  made  is  kind  of  like  a 
 blanket  statement  to  help  young  men 
 everywhere  but  obviously  we're  not
[58:12] really  diving  deep  into  your  exact 
 situation  there's  certain
[58:17] environmental  factors  and  thought 
 processes  that  you  are  having  that  i 
 can't  identify  without  being  able  to
[58:22] speak  to  you  directly  so  far  i'm  seeing 
 quite  a  lot  of  trends  the  same  pattern
[58:27] of  behavior  i've  been  offering  my 
 personal  development  coaching  and  one  of 
 the  things  i've  noticed  to  be  a  huge
[58:33] positive  impact  on  the  guys  that  i've 
 been  helping  is  a  morning  workout  it 
 seems  to  be  the  case  that  when  we  as  men
[58:40] wake  up  early  and  go  and  exercise  we 
 conquer  our  minds  we  conquer  our  bodies 
 even  if  we  don't  want  to  go  even  if  it's
[58:46] raining  outside  it's  still  dark  outside 
 in  the  morning  when  we  accomplish  this
[58:51] it  seems  to  be  the  case  that  the  rest  of 
 the  day  goes  by  so  well
[58:57] it  also  seems  to  be  the  case 
 unfortunately  that  the  opposite  of  that 
 is  true  that  when  we  start  our  mornings
[59:02] off  wrong  when  we  wake  up  late  so  far 
 all  three  clients  i've  had  have  stated
[59:07] this  the  day  that  they  woke  up  a little 
 bit  late  they'll  miss  that  morning 
 workout  the  rest  of  the  day  was  a 
 write-off  the  rest  of  the  day  wasn't  as
[59:14] effective  as  they  wanted  to  be  and  they 
 were  left  feeling  negative  i'm  seeing 
 very  similar  patterns  of  behavior  that  i
[59:20] think  you  may  be  feeling 
 this 
 great  performance  for  one  two  three  days
[59:27] in  a  row  max  the  fourth  day  or  close 
 enough  is  the  day  that  it  just  comes 
 crashing  down  they  do  the  exact  opposite
[59:33] of  what  they've  been  working  for 
 the  nofap  streak  breaks  the  binge  eating
[59:39] disorder  comes  out 
 hours  spent  on  instagram  video  games  the 
 help  that  i've  been  giving  to  the  guys
[59:45] that  i've  been  coaching  seems  to  be 
 very  great  all  of  them  have  said  that
[59:50] it's  helped  a  lot  having  me  as  their 
 coach  going  on  to  one-to-one  video  calls 
 with  me  if  you  want  me  to  be  your
[59:56] personal  development  coach  going  on  to 
 one-to-one  video  calls  then  the  fiver 
 link  is  also  below  it's  very  interesting
[60:01] what  i've  noticed  with  my  clients  they 
 are  all  probably  like  you  young  men  in 
 their  twenties
[60:07] trying  to  get  their  together 
 they  seem  to  be  going  through  the  same 
 struggles  and  the  same
[60:12] accomplishments  and  that  morning  workout 
 seems  to  be  the  key  to  setting  them  up
[60:17] for  a  great  day  physically  and  mentally
[60:22] that  gave  me  the  inspiration  to  make  an 
 email  newsletter  something  i  didn't  ever 
 think  i  would  be  doing  but  i  made  an
[60:27] email  newsletter  just  called  rise  and 
 shine  powerful  morning  motivation  i
[60:33] don't  know  exactly  what  it's  going  to  be 
 if  you  do  want  an  email  from  me  in  the 
 morning  it  won't  be  like  every  morning
[60:38] it  might  be  like  a  couple  in  the  week 
 where  i'll  be  just  saying  something 
 that's  on  my  mind  when  i  go  to  the  gym
[60:45] something  that  will  make  you  feel 
 masculine  and  like  you're  ready  to 
 accomplish  the  day  then  the  email
[60:50] newsletter  link  will  be  below  boys
[60:55] the  grind  is  worth  it 
 if  the  only  time  you  feel
[61:01] satisfied 
 is  when  you're  over  indulging  on  instant 
 gratification  like  netflix  video  games
[61:07] junk  food  porn 
 and  as  soon  as  you  stop  doing  those 
 things  you  just  feel
[61:13] not  good  to  be  you 
 i  completely  understand  that
[61:19] it's  through  these  previous  chapters 
 that  i've  just  mentioned  through  these 
 actionable  steps  this  behavior  this
[61:24] mindset  that  i've  been  trying  to  drill 
 into  you  in  this  video 
 that  this  all  changes
[61:30] that  even  without  instant  gratification 
 with  nothing  else  around  me  i  am  happy
[61:36] and  i  am  not  special  i  am  not  inherently 
 better  or  harder  working  than  anyone
[61:41] else  if  anything  i  am  lazy  i  am  such  a 
 lazy  guy  i  almost  failed  in  school  and
[61:47] in  uni  i  pretty  much  did  fail  in 
 university  but  that's  a  completely 
 separate  thing  i  am  not  any  more  harder
[61:53] working  than  you  and  so  i  hope  to  set  a 
 good  example  for  you  guys  to  show  you 
 that  this
[61:58] doesn't  require  you  to  be  special 
 the  biggest  thing  that  you  could 
 probably  learn  from  all  of  this  video
[62:04] and  everything  i  teach  is  just 
 consistency 
 it's  just  finding  the  right  type  of
[62:10] behavior  so  going  to  the  gym  practicing 
 mindfulness  and  gratitude  and  just 
 trying  to  do  it  as  often  as  you  can
[62:17] not  as  intense  as  you  can  as  often  as 
 you  can 
 aim  for  every  day  aim  for  every  single
[62:23] day  and  you  will  still  miss 
 two  three  four  days  a  week
[62:28] but  it's  those  three  days  that  you  did 
 do  it  that  will  turn  into  four  and  then 
 that  will  turn  into  five  and  maybe  five
[62:34] years  later 
 i'm  six  years  into  weightlifting  and 
 only  recently  have  i  been  training  six
[62:39] days  a  week  without  missing  a  single 
 extra  day  don't  expect  these  results  to 
 come  quick  and  don't  expect  your
[62:44] behavior  to  be  perfect  just  try  to  be  as 
 consistent  as  you  can  with  everything 
 that  i've  taught  here
[62:50] try  to  make  it  a  daily  thing  and  you'll 
 be  you'll  be  finding  that  you  miss  half 
 of  the  days  but  that's  okay  because
[62:56] you're  a  beginner  the  beginner  is  not 
 supposed  to  have  great  performance 
 the  whole  point  is  consistency  one  of
[63:02] the  biggest  things  that  people  don't 
 mention  is  that  the  overlying  theme  of 
 consistency  is  don't  quit
[63:09] that's  the  one  thing  that  those 
 motivational  youtube  videos  and  you  know 
 those  i'm  a  hard  guy  and  oh  you  gotta
[63:15] want  it  as  much  as  you  want  to  breathe 
 type  of  videos  that's  the  one  thing  that 
 they  get  right
[63:20] do  not  quit  and  you  will  hit  that  goal 
 do  not  quit  and  you  will  become 
 successful  do  not  quit  and  you  will
[63:26] build  that  10  out  of  10  physique 
 probably  the  most  important  thing  that
[63:31] i've  learned  in  the  last  six  years  of  my 
 self-improvement 
 do  not  quit
[63:37] trust  the  process 
 the  j-curve  of  results  where  the  results 
 just  pop  up
[63:42] the  j-curve  will  approach  you  sooner 
 than  you  think 
 and  as  soon  as  you  start  seeing  the
[63:47] results  the  motivation  just  flies  in 
 but  you  just  cannot  quit  and  so
[63:54] how  you  don't  quit  is  by  actually  making 
 all  of  this  enjoyable  it's  by  having  a 
 massive  interest  in  all  of  this  stuff
[64:00] that's  why  i  kept  on  saying  get  addicted
