[00:00] he  wakes  up  late  and  does  it  all  wrong 
 guess  what  the  first  thing  Jeffrey  does 
 after  he  wakes  up  he  grabs  his  phone  and
[00:06] proceeds  to  scroll  on  Instagram  Tick 
 Tock  and  Snapchat  and  Reddit  and  Twitter 
 and  what  the  [ __ ]  else  does  Jeffrey  use
[00:12] bro  he  spends  over  an  hour  in  bed  just 
 sweaty  wasting  his  time  and  you  know
[00:17] what's  even  worse  than  that  what  do  you 
 think  Jeffrey  does  when  he  stumbles  upon 
 a  fitness  model  on  Instagram  he  breaks
[00:23] his  nofap  streak  Day  Zero  again  Jeffrey 
 no  Jeffrey  no  ah  it's  too  late  Jeffrey's
[00:29] already  fixated  on  the  mindset  that 
 since  he's  reset  his  nofap  streak  and 
 it's  Day  Zero  anyway  you  may  as  well
[00:34] bust  another  two  times  before  he  gets 
 out  of  bed  he  brushes  his  teeth  for  like 
 30  seconds  instead  of  two  minutes
[00:40] Jeffrey  your  breath  stinks  bro  how  about 
 some  meditation  no  it's  too  late  he's
[00:46] already  hopped  on  his  computer  chair 
 ready  to  play  video  games  he  repeats 
 this  morning  routine  day  in  day  out  what
[00:52] kind  of  Life  do  you  think  that  would 
 lead  you  to  Adonis 
 Adonis  is  the  CEO  of  morning  routines
[00:59] just  like  my  friend  Bill  he  rises  with 
 the  sun  and  Sprints  out  of  his  cave  the 
 people  are  watching  what  is  he  gonna  do
[01:05] time  for  some  exercise  how  do  you  think 
 Adonis  has  built  this  physique  he 
 exercises  first  thing  in  the  morning
[01:10] which  makes  him  feel  so  healthy  a  nice 
 nutritious  meal  in  the  morning  sunlight 
 fuels  his  muscles  it's  time  for  the  most
[01:17] important  part  of  the  day  Adonis 
 journals  he  meditates  he  contemplates  he 
 spends  time  making  the  most  important
[01:23] decisions  you  can't  help  but  look  up  to 
 someone  who  has  a  morning  routine  just 
 like  this  I  wake  up  between  5  30  and  6
[01:30] a.m  using  an  app  called  sleep  cycle  as 
 my  alarm  I'll  never  go  back  to  using  the 
 normal  alarm  that's  on  phones  you're  the
[01:35] one  that  you  said  okay  wake  me  up  at  6am 
 and  then  you're  dreaming  and  you 
 literally  hear  that  like  cancerous
[01:40] trauma  bro  I've  got  Trauma  from  I  need 
 therapy  after  hearing  that  in  my  dreams
[01:45] the  Sleep  Cycle  app  is  completely  free 
 it  wakes  you  up  in  like  a  half  an  hour 
 block  and  it  wakes  you  up  specifically
[01:50] when  you've  been  like  tossing  and 
 turning  a  little  bit  which  actually 
 means  that  you're  almost  awake  anyway 
 it's  so  much  better  to  use  that  the
[01:56] first  thing  that  I  do  as  soon  as  I  wake 
 up  is  take  off  the  tape  that  I  have  on 
 my  lips  let  me  show  you  this  is  micro 
 pore  tape  and  I  put  it  on  my  lips  every
[02:03] single  night  for  like  literally  years 
 when  I  go  to  sleep  I've  made  a  video 
 just  recently  titled  how  to  mute
[02:08] properly  so  you've  probably  heard  of 
 mewing  it  gives  you  like  a  better 
 jawline  makes  you  more  attractive  a  way 
 to  supercharge  your  mewing  progress  is
[02:13] to  tape  your  mouth  shut  it's  completely 
 safe  and  you  can  just  go  watch  my  video 
 like  the  full  explanation  but  it's
[02:18] completely  safe  it  keeps  your  mouth  shut 
 which  forces  you  to  breathe  through  your 
 nose  so  I  wake  up  after  keeping  this 
 tape  on  overnight  and  I've  just  been
[02:24] nasal  breathing  through  the  night  which 
 is  so  healthy  for  you  I  take  off  the 
 tape  and  I  have  my  supplements  I  take 
 vitamin  D  every  single  morning  and  I
[02:30] also  take  a  first  man  male  Advantage 
 supplements  I  make  my  bed  drink  some 
 water  go  to  the  toilet  after  I'm  done
[02:36] having  my  morning  after  I'm  done  having 
 my  morning  poop  I  step  on  the  scale 
 check  my  weight  I  check  my  weight  every
[02:42] single  morning  I  don't  recommend  this  if 
 you're  somewhat  of  like  an  emotional 
 person  I'm  very  emotionally  detached
[02:47] away  from  like  the  data  that  the  scale 
 shows  and  this  way  I  have  like 
 consistent  data  to  input  into  like  the
[02:52] MyFitnessPal  app  to  see  my  weight  Trend 
 I  also  take  a  shirtless  progress  picture 
 sure  every  single  morning  after  checking
[02:58] my  weight  and  upload  that  to  my  My 
 Fitness  Pal  look  my  name  on  MyFitnessPal 
 is  Hamza  97  armored  you  can  see  like
[03:04] I've  been  logging  every  single  day  for  a 
 while  next  I  brush  my  teeth  and  very 
 very  importantly  very  importantly  I
[03:10] brush  my  tongue  do  you  know  the  amount 
 of  people  who  don't  actually  brush  their 
 tongue  okay  let  me  tell  you  something  if 
 you  don't  know  this  already  bad  breath
[03:16] actually  comes  from  the  back  of  your 
 tongue  not  your  teeth  the  most  important 
 thing  if  you  want  to  have  nice  smelling
[03:21] breath  if  you  don't  want  to  like  Revolt 
 people  and  girls  from  like  bad  breath 
 maybe  you've  never  done  this  so  it's 
 like  sounds  weird  brushing  your  tongue
[03:26] is  like  as  important  as  brushing  your 
 actual  teeth  is  and  you  need  to  go  far 
 enough  that  you  literally  gag  and  I  know
[03:31] it  sounds  silly  and  sexual  uh  because 
 you're  [ __ ]  Jeffrey  you're  so 
 immature  but  literally  like  with  my 
 normal  toothbrush  and  toothpaste  brush
[03:36] the  back  of  your  tongue  and  your  breath 
 will  smell  so  much  better  next  I  hop  in 
 a  cold  shower  and  I  don't  really  do  this 
 for  the  meme  of  like  you  know  CEO
[03:42] morning  like  you  know  morning  routine  I 
 do  it  just  because  it  literally  just 
 feels  nice  I  think  most  people  have  cold 
 showers  wrong  they  have  them  in  like
[03:48] quite  a  discipline  kind  of  like  oh  you 
 know  here  I  am  I'm  about  to  step  into 
 the  cold  shower  guys  you  know  they  do  it
[03:53] in  quite  a  dramatic  way  and  I  see  them 
 on  like  the  YouTube  morning  routine 
 videos  I  don't  think  that's  good  for  you 
 I  think  if  you  have  to  like  hype
[03:58] yourself  up  you  know  it's  a  discipline 
 thing  to  like  get  in  the  cold  shower  I 
 think  you're  already  like  sapping  some 
 of  like  your  mental  sort  of  willpower
[04:04] and  discipline  in  the  morning  I  don't 
 think  that's  a  good  thing  the  way  that  I 
 do  it  is  that  I  turn  on  the  hot  water 
 get  in  there  you  know  clean  myself  use
[04:09] some  shampoo  some  body  wash  and  stuff 
 and  I  slowly  just  start  turning  on  the 
 cold  shower  to  the  point  that  it's
[04:14] actually  very  refreshing  and  it's  not 
 like  a  painful  thing  that  I'm  doing  for 
 like  oh  David  Goggins  [ __ ]  next  and
[04:20] very  importantly  I  learned  this  from 
 Andrew  huberman  I  go  outside  into  my 
 back  garden  and  I  literally  just  kind  of 
 stand  around  my  backyard  and  I  walk
[04:26] around  specifically  just  looking  at  like 
 the  sky  and  into  the  not  really  into  the 
 Sun  but  like  you  know  getting  sunlight
[04:32] into  my  eyes 
 Andrew  huberman  is  like  a  very  famous 
 scientist  he  has  a  big  Channel  on
[04:37] YouTube  almost  a  million  subscribers  and 
 he  said  this  is  one  of  the  best  things 
 that  you  can  do  to  improve  your  sleep  is 
 to  wake  up  and  get  sunlight  almost
[04:42] immediately  whilst  I'm  outside  getting 
 sunlight  into  my  eyes  I  open  up  notion 
 which  is  kind  of  like  a  documents  like
[04:48] you  know  a  place  like  write  notes  and  in 
 there  I  have  a  gratitude  Journal  so  I 
 just  write  things  that  I'm  grateful  for 
 on  my  phone  I  have  an  actual  paper
[04:54] gratitude  Journal  which  I  use  as  well 
 but  in  the  morning  morning  was  some 
 stood  outside  I  just  write  it  like  five 
 ten  things  that  I'm  grateful  for  let  me
[05:00] read  you  one  of  them  let's  see  what  I 
 was  grateful  for  this  morning  I've  done 
 a  nice  thing  with  gratitude  journaling 
 I've  just  set  myself  the  goal  to  journal
[05:06] 1  000  things  that  I'm  grateful  for  till 
 the  rest  of  the  year  I  wrote  103  so  far
[05:11] this  morning  I  wrote  down  the  95th  thing 
 I'm  grateful  for  my  back  Garden  a 
 beautiful  peaceful  place  I  love  spending
[05:17] time  in  96.  I'm  grateful  for  hugging  on 
 me  like  which  means  mom  in  like  Urdu  I'm 
 grateful  for  hugging  my  mom  and  kissing
[05:23] her  on  the  forehead  like  a  man  of 
 character  who  loves  his  family  I'm 
 grateful  for  the  little  chat  we  just  had 
 this  morning  about  my  friend  wishing  her
[05:29] a  happy  birthday  so  it  was  my  mom's 
 birthday  two  days  ago  and  I  told  her 
 about  that  I  posted  like  a  Instagram 
 reel  of  like  a  few  clips  of  me  and  her
[05:35] and  everything  and  she  doesn't  like 
 really  use  Instagram  she  didn't  see  it 
 but  I  told  her  about  it  told  her  that  it
[05:40] got  like  11  000  likes  and  she  like  got 
 proper  Impressions  she  was  like  oh  like 
 I'm  famous  too  now  probably  cute  I'm
[05:45] grateful  for  nature  the  plants  are  my 
 back  Garden  the  beautiful  color  of  the 
 trees  in  the  UK  gratitude  journaling  and
[05:51] expressing  gratitude  it's  literally  the 
 most  beautiful  thing  you  can  do  in  my 
 opinion  this  is  probably  the  best  part
[05:56] of  my  morning  routine  I  finished 
 gratitude  journaling  and  getting 
 sunlight  into  my  eyes  for  a  few  minutes 
 I  come  back  upstairs  meditate  from
[06:02] anywhere  from  5  to  20  minutes  depending 
 on  like  what  my  day  is  like  but  I  always 
 try  and  commit  myself  to  at  least  five
[06:08] minutes  that's  my  rule  okay  five  minutes 
 of  meditation  every  single  morning  for 
 the  rest  of  your  life  and  the  last  and 
 final  thing  that  I  do  just  before  I
[06:14] begin  working  for  the  day  is  visualizing 
 my  goals  so  I  open  up  my  goals  it's  all 
 on  notion  and  I  just  kind  of  read  my
[06:20] goals  and  I  visualize  myself  just 
 achieving  them  here's  my  goals  for  this 
 year  I'm  gonna  hit  1.5  million
[06:25] subscribers  on  the  main  Channel  I  also 
 want  to  get  30  million  views  over 
 December  on  the  main  Channel  and  I  want
[06:31] to  bulk  up  to  200  pounds  body  weight  by 
 the  end  of  the  year  and  then  I  also  have 
 goals  for  like  the  next  three  years  as 
 well  and  those  are  like  some  big  ones  as
[06:37] well  I  finished  visualizing  I've  had  a 
 fantastic  morning  and  now  I'm  ready  for
