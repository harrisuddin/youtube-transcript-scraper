[00:00] jeffrey  is  a  black  pillar  there's 
 nothing  you  can  do  to  improve  your  looks 
 it's  all  over  you're  coping  it's  over
[00:05] for  you  curry  cells  you  should  just  kill 
 yourself  that's  how  black  pillars 
 actually  talk  they  tell  young  men  who
[00:10] are  feeling  insecure  to  kill  themselves 
 if  they  don't  have  a  certain  height  or 
 characteristics  of  their  face  black 
 pillars  like  jeffrey  hate  to  see  you  on
[00:16] self-improvement  they  don't  want  to  be 
 proved  wrong  jeffrey  will  try  to  pull 
 you  back  down  into  the  bucket  of  the
[00:21] crabs  he  doesn't  want  you  to  invalidate 
 his  excuses  for  a  long  time  i  thought  i 
 was  ugly  and  i  genuinely  thought  there
[00:26] was  nothing  i  could  do  about  it  i 
 thought  i  was  ugly  simply  because  i  was 
 brown  skinned  and  i  had  this  belief  that
[00:31] brown  people  were  just  unattractive 
 especially  to  the  white  women  that  i 
 wanted  it  was  only  until  i  adopted  a
[00:36] positive  thinking  mindset  when  i  started 
 going  to  the  gym  and  i  realized  that 
 progress  was  possible  i  started  to
[00:41] convince  myself  that  i  could  also 
 progress  my  face  i  did  research  and  i 
 found  a  bunch  of  things  and  i  found  that 
 there's  only  around  five  things  that
[00:47] truly  can  change  how  attractive  your 
 face  is  and  it's  worth  implementing  all 
 of  these  here  is  a  picture  of  what  i
[00:52] used  to  look  like  when  i  was  18  and  here 
 is  the  pictures  that  i  take  now  adonis 
 adonis  has  a  warrior  skull  what  a  fine
[00:58] specimen  indeed  she  looks  phenomenal 
 with  a  jawline  as  sharp  as  the  spear  of
[01:03] zeus  and  the  hunter  eyes  that  would  make 
 black  pillars  proud  there's  only  six 
 things  that  matter  in  terms  of  your
[01:08] facial  attractiveness  low  body  fat 
 tongue  posture  head  posture  neck  size
[01:13] face  exercises  and  beard  and  we're  going 
 to  discuss  exactly  how  to  improve  these
[01:19] what  about  navel  canvas  tint  and  and 
 hunter  oh  shut  up  bro  black  pillars  man 
 we're  not  going  to  discuss  things  that
[01:24] you  can't  change  because  at  least  to  me 
 that's  a  complete  waste  of  time  there's 
 of  course  a  hundred  different  tiny  bits
[01:29] of  your  face  that  make  up  the 
 attractiveness  but  thinking  about 
 something  that  you  can't  change  is  for
[01:34] losers  so  let's  go  through  an  order  of 
 importance  firstly  low  body  fat  this  is 
 obvious  and  common  sense  but  some  guys
[01:40] still  have  too  high  of  a  body  fat 
 percentage  the  ideal  body  fat  that  you 
 should  set  the  goal  off  is  around  10  to
[01:45] 12  percent  this  is  when  your  abs  are 
 completely  visible  you  may  even  have 
 some  veins  around  your  abs  in  your
[01:50] v-line  and  you'll  have  a  sharp  jawline 
 with  no  baggy  skin  underneath  one  huge 
 point  that  no  one  mentions  in  terms  of
[01:55] low  body  fat  is  that  to  look  even  better 
 at  a  low  body  fat  percentage  you  want  to 
 weigh  more  you  simply  want  your  body
[02:01] weight  to  be  as  high  as  possible  whilst 
 also  remaining  lean  and  the  way  to  do 
 that  is  to  bulk  up  first  and  then  cut  to
[02:08] get  leaner  this  is  what  i  looked  like  at 
 120  pounds  and  i  was  fairly  lean  but  you 
 can  see  that  my  face  didn't  exactly  look
[02:13] chiseled  whereas  when  i  put  on  a  fair 
 amount  of  muscle  two  to  three  years 
 later  this  is  what  i  look  like  at  150
[02:18] pounds  you  can  see  a  big  difference  in 
 my  jawline  the  more  that  you  weigh 
 whilst  being  lean  the  better  that  you'll
[02:24] look  focus  on  increasing  your  body 
 weight  and  then  cutting  tongue  posture 
 is  very  very  important  and  something  to
[02:30] be  mindful  of  24  7.  here  is  what  people 
 look  like  when  they  are  mouth  breathers
[02:35] and  here's  what  people  look  like  when 
 they  breathe  from  their  nose  i  was  a 
 mouth  breather  for  most  of  my  adult  life 
 my  nose  would  always  be  stuffy  and  i
[02:41] realized  how  to  fix  this  you  simply  need 
 to  breathe  from  your  nose  more  and 
 you're  probably  thinking  wait  it  comes
[02:46] off  you  you  literally  just  said  your 
 nose  is  stuffy  like  i  can't  breathe  from 
 my  nose  so  how  do  i  breathe  however  much 
 you  can  breathe  from  your  nose  it's
[02:52] generally  how  much  you  need  to  so  let's 
 say  if  your  nose  is  literally  85  blocked 
 and  you  can  just  about  barely  breathe
[02:58] it's  almost  like  a  meditation  practice 
 to  breathe  as  much  as  you  can  without 
 doing  that 
 most  people  do  which  is  to  like  fall
[03:05] don't  do  that  stupid  [ __ ]  just 
 calmly  breathe  silently  through  your 
 nose  and  that's  how  much  air  you  should
[03:10] be  taken  in  the  reason  why  your  nose  is 
 generally  blocked  even  though  you'll 
 believe  that  you've  got  allergies  or  any
[03:15] [ __ ]  you've  been  convinced  by 
 doctors  generally  the  reason  why  so  many 
 people's  noses  blocks  is  because  they
[03:20] simply  don't  breathe  from  their  nose 
 because  they  breathe  from  their  mouths 
 the  more  that  you  breathe  from  your  nose 
 the  more  it'll  open  up  but  you  need  to
[03:25] go  through  the  trials  and  tribulations 
 of  breathing  through  your  nose  when  you 
 can  hardly  do  so  and  it's  completely
[03:30] safe  and  it's  even  healthier  to  do  this 
 simply  breathe  through  your  nose  in  a 
 very  silent  calm  way  and  do  a  full
[03:36] exhale  breathing  from  your  nose  will 
 allow  you  to  assume  the  correct  tongue 
 posture  which  is  when  your  mouth  is
[03:41] closed  your  tongue  presses  up  against 
 the  top  of  your  mouth  and  you  want  to 
 really  focus  on  getting  most  of  your
[03:47] tongue  against  the  top  of  your  mouth  not 
 just  the  tip  but  most  of  it  it  takes 
 some  practice  i  don't  care  what  anyone
[03:52] says  this  literally  changes  the  shape  of 
 your  skull  once  again  these  are  pictures 
 of  me  when  i  ended  puberty  at  around  age
[03:58] 18  and  two  years  later  i  still  remember 
 this  blue  picture  in  the  gym  when  you 
 can  literally  see  that  my  face  started
[04:03] to  grow  outwards  in  more  of  like  a 
 warrior  skull  shape  head  posture  is  very 
 very  important  and  is  so  overlooked  in
[04:09] terms  of  facial  attractiveness  everyone 
 especially  you  has  some  terrible  head 
 posture  because  of  all  the  technology
[04:14] everyone's  got  like  their  neck  up 
 because  we're  always  doing  this  you  know 
 to  see  our  foot  sometimes  i'm  in  the  gym
[04:19] and  i  literally  see  someone  using  their 
 phone  like  this 
 freak  bro  and  you  just  see  everyone  like 
 this  the  simple  way  to  improve  your  head
[04:25] posture  which  improves  your 
 attractiveness  is  simply  just  give 
 yourself  a  double  chin  as  a  stretch  hold 
 it  for  two  seconds  the  more  you  do  this
[04:31] the  more  your  neck  will  start  going  back 
 and  you'll  assume  that  good  confidence 
 strong  posture  with  your  shoulders  back
[04:36] and  neck  is  back  that  jordan  peterson 
 promotes  the  size  of  your  neck  actually 
 makes  a  big  difference  in  your  face  okay
[04:41] we  wanted  to  talk  about  face  while 
 you're  talking  about  neck  your  neck  is 
 always  visible  and  in  terms  of  muscle
[04:46] and  size  and  testosterone  and 
 masculinity  oftentimes  people 
 subconsciously  will  see  your  neck  size
[04:52] as  the  size  of  the  man  that  you  are  when 
 you  see  someone  with  a  thick  neck  even 
 if  the  rest  of  their  body  is  cropped  out
[04:57] you  automatically  have  some  kind  of 
 respect  for  this  guy  and  you  wouldn't 
 want  to  mess  with  them  but  when  you  see 
 a  guy  with  a  skinny  neck  and  his  body's
[05:03] cropped  out  you  think  yeah  i  could  you 
 know  this  is  a  skinny  guy  there's  no 
 problem  we  could  show  you  the  rest  of 
 his  body  he  could  be  massive  but  you
[05:08] wouldn't  have  thought  that  if  you  only 
 saw  his  neck  it's  very  important  to 
 train  your  neck  with  the  rest  of  your
[05:13] body  in  the  gym  as  we've  been  doing  and 
 the  simplest  way  to  increase  your  neck 
 size  is  simply  to  do  neck  curls  where 
 you  just  place  a  small  weight  on  your
[05:19] forehead  and  just  curl  your  neck  like 
 this  when  you're  laying  off  a  bench  the 
 fifth  thing  you  can  do  to  improve  your 
 facial  attractiveness  is  the  face
[05:25] exercises  and  these  are  generally  kind 
 of  weird  i'll  be  completely  honest  i 
 don't  really  do  these  that  much  but
[05:30] there  is  one  thing  that  i  do  heavily 
 recommend  which  is  to  chew  harder  foods 
 the  shape  of  our  skull  and  jaws  are
[05:35] getting  smaller  because  we're  chewing 
 very  soft  processed  foods  any  food 
 that's  rough  and  hard  like  nuts  is  very
[05:41] helpful  for  training  the  muscles  around 
 the  jawline  and  you  can  also  do  a  bunch 
 of  different  facial  exercises  which  look
[05:47] kind  of  weird  my  friend  chris  at  first 
 man  made  a  full  video  on  the  facial 
 exercises  which  i'll  link  below  and
[05:52] finally  the  last  thing  that  you  can  do 
 is  grow  and  also  shape  your  beard  to 
 improve  your  facial  attractiveness  if
[05:58] you  can't  grow  a  beard  just  yet  and  you 
 feel  like  you  should  have  the  genetics 
 to  do  so  so  everyone  in  your  family  can
[06:03] grow  a  beard  even  your  mother  then  it's 
 just  because  you  haven't  actualized  your 
 masculinity  yet  this  is  like
[06:08] neuroscience  and  everyone  disagrees  with 
 me  but  i'm  100  sure  of  this  if  you  are 
 genetically  capable  of  getting  a  beard
[06:13] you  will  get  it  when  you  become  more 
 masculine  when  you  become  more  of  a  man 
 and  you  take  responsibility  take  more
[06:18] responsibility  look  after  more  people 
 become  a  leader  and  you'll  see  that  your 
 braid  will  grow  faster  than  ever  if
[06:23] you've  already  got  a  beard  it's  very 
 important  that  you  shape  it  in  a  certain 
 way  which  is  to  have  the  mustache  and 
 the  chin  longer  than  the  cheek  and  the
[06:29] sidelines  a  very  important  part  of 
 making  your  beard  look  good  is  shaping 
 the  underside  of  it  you  want  to  trim  up
[06:34] the  beard  to  your  jawline  around  the 
 cheek  here  and  have  the  beard  come  down 
 about  an  inch  near  the  chin  like  this  do
[06:40] the  hard  work  especially  when  you  know 
 if  you  like  it
