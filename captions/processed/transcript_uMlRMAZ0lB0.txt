[00:00] it's  back  in  Spring  2022  I'm  22  years 
 old  I'm  in  my  apartment  and  I'm  locked
[00:06] away  in  my  bedroom 
 I'm  on  my  computer  watching  something 
 that  I  should  not  be  watching
[00:12] I  feel  dirty  disgusting  I  feel  like  a 
 degenerate
[00:17] I'm  watching 
 self-improvement  videos
[00:22] but  worse  than  that  I'm  procrastinating 
 from  something  important  that  I  should 
 be  doing  right  now
[00:27] but  I'm  wasting  time  watching  video 
 after  video  after  video  I'm  watching 
 videos  on  how  to  quit  procrastinating
[00:32] and  I'm  literally  procrastinating  whilst 
 watching  them  I've  procrastinated  for  so 
 long  that  the  time  goes  11AM  12  o'clock
[00:40] 1pm 
 it's  literally  time  for  the  next  meal  of 
 the  day  so  I  go  to  the  kitchen  I'm
[00:47] eating  something  gotta  get  my  protein  in 
 and  go  back  to  procrastinating  instead 
 of  doing  the  important  task  that  I'm
[00:53] supposed  to  be  doing 
 eventually  it  gets  so  late  that  I'm 
 actually  starting  to  feel  aggressive  and
[00:59] anxious  so  I  get  up  from  my  computer  I 
 go  into  the  other  room  with  my
[01:04] girlfriend's  sleeping 
 and  I  grab
[01:10] my  shirts  my  pants  and  my  shoes
[01:15] 15  minutes  later  I'm  red-faced  I'm 
 sweating  and  I'm  panting
[01:21] I'm  doing  squats  in  the  gym 
 so  I'm  thinking  to  myself  why  did  I 
 procrastinate  this  all  day  I  should  have
[01:28] hit  this  workout  at  like  9am  but  here  I 
 am  hours  and  hours  later
[01:33] and  so  I'm  gonna  make  this  the  best 
 workout  possible  squats  leg  press 
 Sprints  pushing  super  super  hard
[01:43] in  the  end  it  ends  up  being  a  mediocre 
 workout  at  best
[01:48] but  that's  when  I  realized  that  I've 
 never  regretted  being  disciplined  that 
 it's  always  paid  off  to  do  the  hard  work
[01:55] especially  when  I  didn't  feel  like  it  my 
 name  is  Hamza  and  I've  made  this  full 
 guide  on  discipline  that's  taken  me  a
[02:01] lot  of  time  and  I  want  to  take  you  from 
 being  more  of  like  a  normal  average
[02:06] person  who  isn't  very  disciplined  who 
 misses  a  lot  of  workouts  who  doesn't  do 
 their  studying  or  their  work  on  time  and
[02:13] sometimes  you  do  get  bursts  of 
 motivation  to  go  to  the  gym  or  to  do 
 work  but  it's  so  infrequent  that  it
[02:20] starts  to  sacrifice  your  life  and  your 
 goals  and  so  I  want  to  make  that  way 
 more  consistent  for  you  I've  spent  the
[02:25] last  one  and  a  half  weeks  putting 
 together  this  full  guide  it's  taken  me 
 over  40  hours  I've  read  an  entire  book
[02:31] I've  read  discipline  is  Destiny  by  Ryan 
 holiday  which  is  a  really  good  book  and 
 I've  put  it  all  together  in  one  guide  so
[02:37] this  is  the  one  full  guide  that  you  need 
 to  be  more  disciplined  you  can  put  your
[02:42] trust  in  this  one  guide  if  you  follow 
 one  rule  you  watch  it  in  order  I've
[02:48] wrapped  my  brain  to  think  like  what  are 
 the  specific  steps  in  order  that  you 
 would  need  to  know  so  it's  very
[02:53] important  that  you  don't  click  around 
 and  jump  around  I'm  not  saying  that  you 
 need  to  watch  this  entire  video  to  bump 
 up  the  YouTube  algorithm  or  anything
[02:59] it's  just  if  you're  going  to  spend  10 
 minutes  today  20  minutes  tomorrow 
 watching  this  video  just  simply  watch  it
[03:04] in  order  and  I  promise  you  that  by  the 
 end  of  this  video  If  you  put  in  the  work
[03:09] and  you  followed  the  actionable  steps 
 that  I've  laid  out  for  you  you  will 
 become  a  disciplined  young  man  here  is
[03:15] your  first  actionable  step  of  this  guide 
 if  you  just  close  your  eyes  and 
 visualize  how  you  will  like  one  year  ago
[03:23] you'll  realize  that  maybe  you're  a  bit 
 more  disciplined  and  consistent  than  you 
 realize  because  if  you  picture  younger
[03:28] you  who  was  far  more  awkward  and  he  was 
 you  know  he  liked  working  out  less
[03:34] struggled  with  work  and  with  studying  a 
 lot  more  than  you  do  now
[03:39] and  you  can  just  see  him  just  awkward  as 
 [ __ ]  like  you  know  fixing  his  shirt  or 
 something  for  no  reason  in  a  social
[03:45] setting 
 you  can  open  your  eyes  you've  made  more 
 progress  than  you've  realized  naturally
[03:50] when  you  get  onto  self-improvement  and 
 the  fact  that  you  found  this  video 
 chances  are  you're  already  on  a
[03:55] fantastic  trajectory  to  improve  your 
 life  which  is  awesome  now  what  we  just 
 need  to  do  is  give  you  a  real  protocol  a
[04:01] step-by-step  guide  to  take  that  to  the 
 next  level  Step  Zero  understanding
[04:06] discipline  before  we  begin  in  making  you 
 more  disciplined  we  have  to  actually 
 understand  it  and  I  guarantee  you  don't
[04:11] even  know  what  discipline  actually  is 
 because  a  lot  of  people  think  discipline 
 is  going  to  the  gym  a  lot  of  people
[04:17] think  discipline  is  doing  hard  work 
 it's  not  discipline  is  not  doing 
 something  that's  hard  it's  doing
[04:23] something  that  you  specifically  didn't 
 feel  like  doing  so  we  need  to  explain
[04:28] three  concepts  which  you're  going  to 
 find  really  interesting  because  there's 
 motivation  there's  discipline  and
[04:34] there's  willpower  you  need  to  know  the 
 difference  between  these  three  and  most 
 people  don't  even  know  this  motivation
[04:40] is  desire  it  is  craving  it  is  when  you 
 want  to  do  something  discipline  is
[04:46] persisting  it's  doing  something  that  you 
 aren't  motivated  for  it's  doing  the  hard
[04:52] work  especially  when  you  didn't  feel 
 like  it  and  willpower  is  resisting  it's
[04:58] not  doing  something  even  when  you  feel 
 like  it  so  I'm  motivated  for  the  gym
[05:03] means  I  want  to  go  to  the  gym  I  use 
 discipline  to  go  to  the  gym  means  I 
 didn't  feel  like  going  to  the  gym  but  I
[05:09] went  anyway  and  I  used  my  willpower  not 
 to  eat  the  junk  food  meant  that  I  was
[05:14] motivated  to  eat  the  junk  food  I  wanted 
 to  but  I  specifically  didn't  even  though 
 I  felt  like  it  because  motivation  is
[05:20] fickle  it  can  come  and  go  but  discipline 
 is  here  to  stay  because  it's  a  character 
 trait  that  we  can  build  inside  of  us  in
[05:26] fact  I  think  discipline  is  so  important 
 that  I  end  every  single  one  of  my  videos 
 with  a  catchphrase  do  the  hard  work
[05:32] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 that  phrase  do  the  hard  work  especially 
 when  you  don't  feel  like  it  perfectly
[05:39] encapsulates  discipline  it's  only 
 discipline  if  you  didn't  feel  like  it 
 and  this  is  why  as  a  man  it's  so  easy  to
[05:45] win 
 99  of  men  are  just  chasing  instant
[05:50] gratification  because  they're  so  easy  to 
 fall  down  they  want  the  fast  results  in 
 their  business  so  they're  not  willing  to
[05:55] wait  or  to  sacrifice  or  to  settle  for 
 something  for  the  long  term  they  want  to 
 watch  porn  right  now  because  they  feel  a
[06:02] sense  of  loneliness  or  you  know  a  sense 
 of  being  deprived  of  intimacy  which  they 
 won't  go  and  solve  long  term  through
[06:09] improving  themselves  and  learning  how  to 
 navigate  a  relationship  with  a  woman  so 
 they'll  just  go  and  get  that  online 
 right  now  they  want  a  sense  of  status
[06:15] and  Brotherhood  but  they'll  get  that  in 
 video  games  right  now  because  it's 
 instant  so  99  of  men  are  doing  that  if
[06:21] you  can  become  the  one  percent  of  man 
 and  this  isn't  even  me  saying  that  you 
 need  to  become  so  like  you  know  amazing
[06:26] or  anything  literally  just  do  the 
 fundamentals  of  like  not  doing  the 
 ultimate  degenerate  habits  and  you're
[06:31] already  in  the  top  few  percentile  of  men 
 and  getting  into  the  top  one  percent  of 
 men  will  not  come  from  any  kind  of
[06:37] monumental  act  if  you're  starting  to 
 feel  proper  motivated  right  now  and 
 you've  started  to  visualize  with  this
[06:42] proper  hard  grunting  workout  and  you're 
 gonna  you  know  like  make  this  fancy 
 business  it's  not  it's  not  about  the
[06:47] beating  your  competition  isn't  about 
 some  big  act  that  you've  done  it's  just
[06:52] about  showing  up  every  day  and  literally 
 just  setting  the  intention  to  try  and  do 
 it  a  little  bit  better  it's  the  guy  who
[06:58] like  stayed  on  the  basketball  court  for 
 an  extra  five  minutes  when  everyone  else 
 went  home  he's  the  one  who  becomes  like
[07:03] the  world  champion  afterwards  there's 
 two  books  which  are  very  similar  which  I 
 recommend  you  to  read  There  is  The
[07:08] Compound  Effect  and  the  slight  Edge 
 these  two  books  are  really  good  they 
 talk  about  using  discipline  to  change
[07:14] something  quite  small  and  insignificant 
 you  know  like  a  small  decision  like  a 
 one  percent  better  decision  which  then
[07:20] makes  a  huge  difference  over  a  few  years 
 I  bet  you'll  agree  with  this  it's  also
[07:25] harder  to  be  lazy  than  it  is  disciplined 
 yes  it's  harder  to  be  lazy  than  it  is  to
[07:30] be  disciplined  to  be  disciplined  means 
 that  we  have  to  go  hit  a  workout  today 
 it  means  that  we  have  to  we  can't  watch
[07:35] porn  today  oh  wow  you  know  it's  kind  of 
 difficult  fair  enough  but  to  be  lazy  to
[07:40] be  undisciplined  is  harder  because  that 
 means  that  then  you  have  to  deal  with 
 the
[07:46] you  have  to  deal  with  the  demons  in  your 
 mind  every  single  day  knowing  that 
 you're  not  living  to  your  potential
[07:51] dealing  with  the  negative  thoughts  going 
 to  sleep  and  you're  overthinking  you 
 randomly  get  a  memory  of  some  weird
[07:56] awkward  thing  that  you  did  six  years  ago 
 you  feel  like  crap  everyone  treats  you
[08:01] with  disrespect  because  you  don't 
 deserve  the  respect  genuinely  imagine 
 the  kind  of  lives  that  the  other  people
[08:06] live  where  they  don't  even  consider 
 something  like  improving  their 
 discipline  and  so  they  just  go  to  one
[08:11] easy  source  of  dopamine  to  the  next  to 
 the  next  to  the  next  they're  sacrificing 
 their  future  selves  happiness  for
[08:17] today's  pleasure  and  then  they're 
 wandering  three  months  six  months  12 
 months  down  the  line  why  they're  fat  and
[08:22] depressed  it's  because  they  did  it  it's 
 because  we  did  this  at  some  point
[08:27] I'm  glad  that  we're  on  this  pathway 
 where  we've  stopped  sacrificing 
 ourselves  and  instead  we're  making  life
[08:33] better  for  our  future  self-discipline  is 
 a  treat  for  your  future  self  discipline
[08:38] is  the  ultimate  Act  of  self-love  because 
 you're  saying  you  know  what  hair  is  like 
 some  modern  technology  porn  video  games
[08:44] it's  been  made  by  a  company  who  don't 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  me
[08:49] if  I  killed  myself  today  this  porn 
 company  wouldn't  give  a  [ __ ]  they'd  only
[08:54] care  because  you  know  one  uses  when 
 inactive
[08:59] they've  ruined  my  life  they  gave  me 
 depression  I've  got  [ __ ]  Ed  so  my 
 dick  doesn't  even  get  hard
[09:05] how  is  this  nice  for  me 
 but  if  I  quit  watching  porn  today
[09:12] My  Future  Self  is  going  to  be  recovering 
 slowly  and  slowly  and  slowly
[09:17] three  days  in  and  he  feels  you  know  he's 
 gotten  a  bit  more  lust  a  bit  more  male
[09:23] aggression  inside  of  him  testosterone 
 levels  are  rising 
 two  months  without  porn  and  you  start  to
[09:28] feel  very  healthy  towards  women  and  you 
 can  actually  speak  to  them 
 A  Year  Without  pawn  and  you  stop  getting
[09:34] those  flashes  of  like  dirty  thoughts  of 
 of  dirty  like  images  and  videos  that  you
[09:39] remember 
 the  ultimate  Act  of  self-love  is
[09:45] discipline  in  the  long  run  it's  much 
 more  painful  to  be  undisciplined  and
[09:50] there's  a  quote  that  I  like  nobody  who 
 has  given  themselves  over  to  excess  is 
 having  a  good  time
[09:56] here  is  an  actionable  step  I  want  you  to 
 do  and  it's  kind  of  mean  I  want  you  to 
 go  onto  YouTube  right  now  maybe  open  up
[10:02] a  new  tab  and  I  want  you  to  search  for 
 this  name 
 Nick  okado  n-i-k-o-c-a-d-o
[10:11] nekokado  go  find  his  YouTube  channel 
 he  is  a  morbidly  obese  man  who  made  a
[10:17] YouTube  channel  of  him  eating  a  lot  of 
 food  and  it  gets  a  lot  of  views
[10:22] and  he's  become  like  obese  obese 
 this  man  deserves  to  die  early
[10:29] now  I  know  that  a  lot  of  people  watching 
 this  will  just  we  get  panicked  and  think 
 wait  wait  he  said  something  that's
[10:34] really  bad  after  we've  been  told  never 
 to  speak  like  that  this  is  this  isn't  my 
 opinion  this  isn't  like  my  viewpoint  I
[10:40] don't  want  him  to  die  but  he  deserves  to 
 he  deserves  to  feel  this  obliterating
[10:46] pain  in  his  heart  until  he  ceases  to 
 exist  this  chokeness  in  his  throat  he
[10:51] deserves  to  feel  it 
 I  know  this  sounds  horrible  but  there's 
 something  that  you  must  understand  right
[10:56] here  right  now  if  you  want  to  live  a 
 good  life  you  deserve  the  consequences
[11:01] of  your  actions 
 this  is  worth  for  you  to  really  meditate 
 on  to  write  down  right  now  to  stick  it
[11:07] up  on  your  wall  to  write  it  and  set  it 
 as  your  phone  wallpaper  I  deserve  the
[11:12] consequences  of  my  actions  so  why  don't 
 you  just  make  it  so  that  you  deserve 
 what  you  want  some  people  deserve  to  be
[11:19] obese  sick  and  close  to  death 
 whilst  others  deserve  to  have  a  six-pack
[11:25] to  have  high  testosterone  to  have  a 
 wonderful  relationship  others  deserve  to
[11:30] make  a  lot  of  money  others  deserve 
 deserve  to  be  depressed  and  suicidal
[11:35] because  it  all  comes  down  to  the  acts 
 that  we're  willing  to  partake  in  and  so
[11:41] if  you're  willing  to  for  example  like 
 this  young  man  is 
 eat  and  eat  and  eat  and  eat  you  deserve
[11:47] the  consequences  of  that 
 now  of  course  some  shallow  breather
[11:53] might  be  watching  this  and  think  oh  but 
 so  do  you  deserve  to  be  hit  by  a  buzzer 
 barring  extreme  circumstance  let's  use
[11:59] our  brains  here  extreme  circumstances 
 extreme  accidents  are  different  if 
 you're  literally  you've  done  everything
[12:04] right  you're  just  walking  on  the  pathway 
 and  a  car  you  know  there's  a  freak 
 accident  and  like  a  brick  gets  thrown  up
[12:09] into  the  air  or  a  car  swerves  into  you 
 even  though  you  were  on  the  pathway 
 that's  a  bit  different  likewise  if
[12:15] you're  just  like  you  know  just  minding 
 your  own  business  in  a  shop  and  someone 
 just  hits  you  out  of  nowhere  that's  the 
 difference  but  if  you're  overeating  your
[12:22] calories  every  single  day  you  deserve  to 
 be  fat  and  if  you  deserve  to  be  fat  then 
 you  deserve  to  be  sick  and  if  you 
 deserve  to  be  sick  then  you  deserve  to
[12:28] have  a  higher  risk  of  mortality  this  is 
 the  consequences  of  a  lack  of  discipline 
 and  so  I  think  for  you  it  is  very
[12:35] worthwhile  for  you  to  just  take  a  few 
 seconds  right  now  and  think  about  what 
 you  want  to  deserve  not  what  you  want
[12:42] remember  nobody  gives  a  [ __ ]  what  you 
 want  but  what  you  want  to  deserve  I  want
[12:47] to  deserve  a  six-pack  how  could  I 
 deserve  a  six-pack  of  three  nabs  three
[12:52] or  five  times  a  week  and  I'll  go  on  a 
 calorie  deficit  and  I'll  do  cardio 
 I  want  to  deserve  a  good  healthy
[12:59] relationship  with  a  beautiful  woman  how 
 would  I  deserve  that  first  of  all  I'll
[13:04] deal  with  some  kind  of  problems  that 
 I've  got  internally  I'll  learn  how  to 
 actually  speak  to  people  and  effectively
[13:09] communicate  I'll  learn  how  to  actually 
 be  a  first  of  all  good  partner  I'll 
 learn  what  that  kind  of  woman  this  high
[13:14] quality  woman  would  be  attracted  in  in  a 
 guy  I'll  develop  those  things  myself  and
[13:19] then  I'll  also  try  and  put  my  best  front 
 when  it  comes  to  dating  I'll  stop 
 watching  degenerate  red  pill  content  and
[13:24] I'll  start  embracing  more  faith  and 
 spirituality 
 and  then  when  I  do  meet  the  woman  I'll
[13:29] treat  her  right  very  very  kindly  very 
 lovingly  and  I'll  make  it  so  that  she  is
[13:34] super  happy  with  me
[13:39] doesn't  sound  so  cool  now  does  it  almost 
 sounds  like  a  bit  stupid  and  autistic 
 but  this  is  what  you  want  out  of  life
[13:44] this  is  how  you  get  it  just  make  it  so 
 that  you  deserve  that  thing 
 take  a  second  right  now  is  an  actionable
[13:49] step  to  just  think  of  what  you  want  to 
 deserve  in  life
[13:55] and  your  brain  will  already  start  to 
 work  on  okay  well  here's  how  we  do  it 
 what  I  will  say  is  that  the  greatest
[14:01] reward  of  being  disciplined  is  not  the 
 physique  or  the  money  or  the  girl  in
[14:06] your  arms 
 but  it  is  the  man  that  you  become  I  feel 
 good  being  me  and  I  know  that  there's
[14:13] quite  a  lot  of  guys  watching  this  who  it 
 won't  really  click  in  their  mind  so  I 
 just  want  to  kind  of  explain  this  just
[14:18] watching  this  like  imagine  genuinely 
 waking  up  every  day  and  being  happy  that
[14:25] you  are  you 
 because  for  a  long  time  in  my  life  I 
 couldn't  have  said  this  I  wanted  to  be
[14:30] that  other  guy  I  wanted  to  be  that  guy 
 with  the  real  world  results  I  wanted  to 
 be  the  guy  with  the  six-pack  I  wanted  to
[14:35] be  the  guy  who  you  know  had  the  likes  on 
 Instagram 
 I  would  not  change  myself  for  anyone
[14:41] it's  like  your  own  internal  perception 
 you  start  to  like  yourself  you  start  to 
 respect  yourself  my  brain  is  producing
[14:47] more  and  more  positive  thoughts  about 
 myself  than  ever  think  about  that  my  own 
 mind  is  actually  starting  automatically
[14:54] to  like  say  nice  things  about  me  through 
 the  day  you  know  when  your  brain  wonders 
 when  you're  trying  to  read  and  it  thinks
[14:59] about  something  else  or  it  thinks  about 
 memories  and  stuff  my  brain  mostly  now 
 is  going  to  positive  stuff  certainly  in
[15:06] a  student  light  so  you  know  it's  not 
 like  I'm  just  egotistical  thinking  that 
 I'm  amazing  but  it's  more  that  I've  got
[15:11] like  a  sense  of  bliss  thinking  like  yeah 
 well  done  yeah  awesome  progress  I've 
 been  working  super  hard  I'm  not  thinking
[15:16] yeah  better  than  everyone  else  and  you 
 know  like  oh  I'm  so  amazing  I  don't  need 
 to  learn  anymore  it's  the  exact  opposite 
 I  really  do  think  okay  I  want  to  learn
[15:22] more  what  can  I  learn  how  can  I  improve 
 so  I've  still  got  a  student  mindset  but 
 it's  just  very  positive  and  pleasant  I
[15:27] think  that's  the  best  reward  of 
 discipline  so  far  step  one  ego  before  we
[15:32] can  really  begin  to  get  super 
 disciplined  we  need  to  destroy  your  Rico 
 because  there's  a  reason  why  you're  not
[15:38] going  to  make  any  progress  watching  this 
 there's  a  reason  why  you're  gonna  stay 
 in  the  same  position  I  hope  you  don't 
 but  there  is  gonna  be  a  huge  reason  and
[15:45] it's  purely  ego  it's  ego  because  you 
 think  you're  too  good  for  what  it  will 
 take  to  improve  your  discipline  I
[15:51] guarantee  you  do  you're  thinking  right 
 now  I  don't  know  like  you  know  it's  been 
 made  apparent  in  your  mind  right  now  I
[15:56] guarantee  when  I  tell  you  the  real  way 
 to  increase  your  discipline  you're  gonna 
 think  it's  beneath  you  and  when  you
[16:01] think  that  you  won't  make  any  progress 
 you  need  to  have  an  absolute  like  you 
 remember  the  the  gaming  term  like  Noob
[16:07] you  need  to  have  like  a  noobs  mindset  to 
 discipline  because  most  guys  don't  do
[16:12] this  the  real  way  to  be  disciplined  is 
 not  like  David  Goggins  it's  not  doing 
 this  big  ridiculous  run  you  know  he's
[16:18] he's  decades  into  this  so  that's 
 different  but  it's  not  like  doing  this 
 big  ridiculous  run  or  this  eight  hour 
 workout  you  know  the  super  long  workout
[16:24] with  loads  of  sets  it's  not  like  doing 
 all  these  weird  things  it's  none  of  that 
 the  real  way  to  be  disciplined  is
[16:31] finding  the  easiest  good  habits  that  you 
 consistently  aren't  doing  and  start
[16:37] doing  that  it's  so  uncool  it's  so  boring 
 but  discipline  is  not  that  massive
[16:42] workout 
 it's  cleaning  up  the  mess  on  the  floor 
 it's  like  the  clothes  no  the  one  piece
[16:48] of  clothing  that  you've  had  on  the  floor 
 for  like  the  last  [ __ ]  48  hours  it's 
 picking  that  up  and  putting  it  somewhere
[16:53] discipline  is  taking  those  water  bottles 
 done  like  not  even  drinking  the  plastic 
 water  balls  anyway  but  let's  say  you
[16:58] know  you've  got  water  bottles  in  your 
 room  this  thing's  out  of  place  here 
 discipline  is  literally  just  fixing  that
[17:04] stuff  up  you  know  that  there's  that 
 cringe  piece  of advice  like  oh  make  your 
 bed  you  know  disciplines  making  your  bed
[17:09] and  the  first  route  to  success  or  to 
 changing  the  world  is  to  make  your  bed 
 you  know  why  every  single  military  in
[17:16] every  single  Country  Places  an  emphasis 
 on  things  like  making  your  bed  why
[17:21] really  just  ask  yourself  this  question 
 why 
 because  that's  the  real  discipline  the
[17:27] real  discipline  is  not  charging  into  war 
 and  being  super  heroic  it's  making  your
[17:32] bed  when  you  didn't  want  to  it's  these 
 thousand  acts  of  many  discipline  that 
 other  people  will  ignore  saying  that  oh
[17:38] yeah  it  doesn't  matter  it's  not  that  it 
 doesn't  matter  it's  that  your  ego  is 
 bigger  than  this  task  at  hand  your  ego
[17:44] is  stopping  you  to  improve  if  you  think 
 that  something  doesn't  matter  if  you 
 think  the  Art's  not  going  to  make  a
[17:49] difference  so  I'll  just  cut  the  corner 
 there  that's  because  of  ego  not  that 
 it's  the  objective  truth  of  the  world
[17:54] that  whether  or  not  making  your  bed 
 makes  you  more  disciplined  that  is  your 
 big  fat  ego  that's  stopping  you  from 
 making  progress  you  need  to  start
[18:00] challenging  your  own  brain  you  know 
 people  talk  about  critical  thinking  they 
 talk  about  not  just  taking  like  one
[18:05] piece  of  advice  at  once 
 your  own  brain  convinced  you  to  watch
[18:10] porn  over  a  thousand  times  in  your  life 
 so  your  own  brain  probably  shouldn't  be
[18:15] automatically  trusted  right  think  about 
 this  when  was  the  last  time  your  own 
 mind  convinced  you  to  watch  porn
[18:22] you  know  with  100  objective  Universal 
 fact  that  porn  is  a  bad  thing  your  own
[18:28] brain  convince  you  to  do  it  you're  not 
 as  smart  as  you  think  you  are  right  so 
 when  your  brain  is  telling  you  oh  yeah
[18:33] this  video  is  kind  of  stupid  he's 
 telling  me  to  make  my  bed  he's  telling 
 me  to  pick  up  like  another  clothes  from 
 the  floor  that's  not  going  to  do
[18:38] anything  you  know  I'll  go  watch  another 
 David  Goggins  or  Andrew  Tate 
 motivational  workout
[18:44] maybe  don't  listen  to  your  brain  and 
 maybe  start  with  the  thing  that  will 
 actually  work  look  in  your  rubbish  bin
[18:50] probably  full  right  now  empty  water 
 bottles  around  [ __ ]  all  over  the  floor
[18:55] bed  sheets  not  made  this  is  the  daily 
 Act  of  discipline  so  this  is  exactly 
 what  you  do  to  destroy  your  Rigo  and  to
[19:01] begin  leveling  up  your  discipline  pick 
 one  or  two  of  these  things  that  you  have 
 proven  to  yourself  that  you  usually
[19:07] don't  do  this  is  the  important  part  the 
 small  task  that  I'm  telling  you  to  do 
 consistently  has  to  be  one  that  you  have
[19:14] proven  to  yourself  you  usually  don't  do 
 because  you  don't  like  to  do  it  so 
 discipline  is  not  oh  yeah  I'm  gonna  wake
[19:19] up  and  do  50  push-ups  because  you're 
 gonna  be  motivated  for  that  so  it's  not 
 discipline  discipline  is  looking  around 
 your  room  right  now  and  thinking  to
[19:25] yourself  you  know  what  I've  always  got 
 clothes  on  the  floor  so  clearly  I'm  not 
 disciplined  enough  to  clean  that  up 
 that's  going  to  be  my  new  discipline
[19:31] like  activity  specifically  when  you 
 start  to  do  that  activity  you  need  to 
 know  that  every  single  time  you  do  it
[19:37] you're  not  gonna  want  to  do  it  it's 
 gonna  feel  annoying  there's  gonna  be 
 some  kind  of  like  BS  COPE  in  your  mind
[19:42] whether  it  says  oh  well  you  know  I'll  do 
 it  later  or  I  don't  need  to  do  this 
 anyway  you  know  discipline's  stupid 
 anyway  or  this  is  even  discipline
[19:48] there's  going  to  be  some  kind  of  cope 
 right  because  that's  the  whole  point 
 you're  not  motivated  to  do  it 
 so  you  need  to  almost  be  vigilant  for
[19:54] your  brain  to  start  coping  and  to  start 
 creating  these  excuses  it's  these  small
[19:59] insignificant  things  that  are  the 
 training  ground  for  your  discipline  you 
 know  in  a  video  game  you  start  off  with
[20:04] like  the  small  monsters  a  lot  of  us  in 
 real  life  we  start  off  and  it's  like  we
[20:09] want  to  kill  the  dragon  right  now  but  we 
 can't  because  to  get  up  to  the  dragon  in
[20:14] a  video  game  what  do  you  have  to  do  you 
 have  to  kill  like  10  000  cows  right  you 
 have  to  go  kill  the  cows  then  you  level
[20:19] up  to  little  goblins  then  you  level  up 
 to  the  zombies  then  the  security  guards 
 then  you  level  up  to  like  the  little 
 demon  then  the  big  demon  then  you  level
[20:25] up  to  like  the  hellhound  you  have  to 
 start  off  by  killing  the  level  two  cows 
 this  right  here  when  you  look  around  you
[20:30] this  is  like  the  training  ground  like 
 the  place  that  we  get  XP  in  the  skill  of
[20:35] discipline  you  can  never  think  that 
 you're  above  these  things  you  can  never 
 think  that  you  can  never  think  that
[20:40] you'll  reserve  your  discipline  for  the 
 big  dragon  when  you're  like  level  seven 
 right  now  and  you  need  to  still  keep
[20:45] working  on  these  small  things  it's  very 
 important  that  you  destroy  your  ego  and 
 you  really  start  to  say  to  yourself  you
[20:51] know  what  I'm  actually  not  that  great 
 I'm  not  that  advanced  right  now  I'm  not
[20:56] past  the  point  where  something  like 
 cleaning  up  my  room  wouldn't  help  me  I'm 
 not  past  the  point  with  something  like
[21:02] doing  a  tiny  bit  of  exercise  wouldn't 
 help  me  because  a  lot  of  people  in  this 
 stage  they  get  stuck  because  of  ego  here
[21:09] is  your  actionable  step  for  this  part  of 
 the  guide  pick  one  daily  habit  that  you
[21:14] can  do  one  task  that  you  usually  don't 
 do  that  would  require  discipline  so  it 
 might  be  for  example  wiping  your
[21:20] computer  desk  every  day  and  every  day 
 probably  wouldn't  need  that  right  after 
 you  like  wipe  it  down  today  you  probably
[21:25] wouldn't  really  need  it  tomorrow  but 
 just  do  it  anyway  just  to  get  into  the 
 habit  of  it  or  it  could  be  for  example 
 making  your  bed  every  day  that's  a  nice
[21:30] one  make  your  bed  kind  of  nicely  or  it 
 could  be  for  example  making  sure  that 
 you  don't  have  rubbish  in  your  room  you
[21:35] know  taking  down  the  rubbish  bin  every 
 single  day  it's  very  important  that  you 
 just  start  with  something  small  start
[21:40] with  just  one  habit  and  then  you  can 
 make  it  into  like  a  habit  tracker  like 
 I've  just  got  here  like  you  know  just
[21:45] write  the  days  of  the  month  and  then 
 just  have  that  as  the  habit  and  then  you 
 just  take  it  off  when  you're  done  step 
 two  leveling  up  now  we  want  to  level
[21:51] this  up  so  that  you  actually  start  to 
 accomplish  bigger  goals  because  you  know 
 just  cleaning  up  that  your  room  is  kind
[21:57] of  nice  but  we  really  want  to  like  build 
 something  right  so  let's  talk  about  some 
 big  goals  and  how  you'd  actually  level
[22:02] up  your  discipline  for  example  let's  say 
 building  an  aesthetic  body  like  a  10  out 
 of  10  physique  from  the  gym
[22:08] the  way  to  use  discipline  for  this  is  to 
 figure  out  the  exact 
 constraints  the  micro  task  the  current
[22:16] area  of  weakness  a  specific  task  that 
 you're  lacking  in  so  for  example  with
[22:21] building  a  nice  Physique  in  the  gym  a 
 lot  of  guys  think  it's  like  it's  working 
 out  and  dieting  and  then  they're  trying
[22:26] to  like  discipline  themselves  in  those 
 two  areas  working  out  and  dieting 
 working  out  and  dieting  sure  when  you
[22:31] first  begin  discipline  is  like  going  to 
 the  gym  because  you  might  not  want  to  go 
 to  the  gym  but  after  a  while  you  start
[22:37] liking  the  gym  you  start  being  motivated 
 for  it  so  it's  like  you're  not  using 
 discipline  to  go  to  the  gym  anymore  this
[22:43] is  like  a  very  interesting  point  a  lot 
 of  guys  who  go  to  the  gym  think  that 
 they're  disciplined  but  they're  not
[22:49] because  they're  motivated  for  it  you 
 take  that  same  guy  and  put  them  in  front 
 of  a  computer  and  tell  them  to  do  90
[22:54] minutes  of  deep  work  and  he  can't  so 
 it's  not  about  that  you  know  you're 
 discipline  if  you  go  to  the  gym  if
[22:59] you're  motivated  for  the  gym  then  it's 
 not  disciplined  it's  not  even  like  it's 
 it's  still  difficult  but  it  doesn't
[23:04] require  discipline  because  you  felt  like 
 going  so  let's  say  right  now  you've  been 
 going  to  the  gym  consistently  you've
[23:10] been  making  some  progress  right  you're 
 probably  kind  of  motivated  for  it  right 
 now  which  means  that  your  discipline  is
[23:16] kind  of  saved  for  something  else  most 
 guys  will  just  stop  here  and  wonder  why 
 they're  making  less  gains  as  time  goes
[23:22] on  you  know  you  make  like  the  noob  gains 
 and  then  you  just  kind  of  plateau  after 
 that  most  guys  wonder  why  it's  because 
 you're  not  utilizing  discipline  in  the
[23:28] next  level  The  Next  Step  so  you're 
 consistently  going  to  hit  the  workout 
 but  there's  somewhere  in  the  realm  of
[23:35] Fitness  that  currently  requires  your 
 discipline  which  you're  not  very 
 conscious  of  and  it's  a  very  specific
[23:40] task  that  task  could  be  as  something  as 
 specific  as  making  sure  your  kitchen 
 scale  has  always  got  chargeable
[23:46] batteries  inside  of  it  you  know 
 batteries  that  are  charged  so  it  turns 
 on  because  sometimes  you  might  find  that 
 when  the  battery  dies  you  don't  end  up
[23:52] tracking  your  stuff  for  like  weeks  at  a 
 time  or  it  could  be  for  example  making 
 sure  that  you  fill  up  your  water  bottles
[23:58] at  night  time  and  keep  them  next  to  your 
 bed  so  that  the  exact  moment  that  you 
 wake  up  you  can  start  to  drink  a  lot  of
[24:04] water  and  hydrate  before  your  workout  in 
 the  day  it's  like  these  new  specific 
 habits  require  your  discipline  right  now
[24:10] compared  to  the  big  thing  that  you  used 
 to  like  go  into  the  gym  so  do  you  see 
 this  is  the  way  to  level  up  at  first  we
[24:16] use  discipline  for  some  of  the  core 
 activities  like  you  know  just  eating 
 protein  or  going  to  the  gym  but  soon
[24:21] those  activities  kind  of  feel  like  a 
 little  bit  automated  like  they  become 
 habits  and  they  don't  really  require
[24:26] much  discipline  anymore  most  people  will 
 just  stop  here  what  you  need  to  do  is
[24:31] figure  out  okay  what's  the  next  thing 
 that  I  could  discipline  myself  on  that 
 will  still  get  me  some  results  and  this
[24:36] is  how  like  the  the  concept  of  you  know 
 this  this  less  to  gain  the  more  progress
[24:41] you've  made  at  first  to  make  progress 
 you  just  go  to  the  gym  but  then  after 
 that  you've  got  to  start  tracking  your
[24:46] Macos  after  that  you've  got  to  start 
 tracking  your  micros  after  that  you 
 gotta  like  perfect  your  sleep  you  know
[24:51] there's  less  and  less  and  less  things 
 for  you  to  improve  on  which  is  the 
 nature  of  becoming  an  expert  or  a  master
[24:56] in  your  craft  for  example  another  micro 
 task  could  be  going  straight  to  the  yoga
[25:02] mats  after  you  finish  your  workout 
 grabbing  one  of  the  mats  setting  it  down 
 and  just  stretching  for  like  two  minutes 
 over  the  grand  scheme  of  things  that
[25:08] would  help  you  in  your  goal  of  building 
 this  10  out  of  10  physique  because 
 you'll  be  way  more  like  flexible  and
[25:13] you'll  be  able  to  get  a  better  range  of 
 motion  in  the  lifts  right  so  it's  like 
 that's  a  very  specific  micro  task  that
[25:19] that  is  the  thing  that  would  need 
 discipline  the  exact  moment  when  you 
 finish  a  workout  but  you  stay  even
[25:24] though  you  don't  want  to  even  though  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  you  stay  to  stretch 
 for  a  couple  of  minutes  that's  where  you
[25:29] need  discipline  right  now  it's  these 
 small  micro  tasks  these  little  pockets 
 of  potential  that  you're  leaving  on  the
[25:34] table  because  you're  only  focusing  on 
 the  basics  these  things  seem 
 insignificant  right  now  don't  they  but
[25:40] it  is  these  micro  tasks  that  will  make 
 the  difference  between  you  being  a 
 winner  or  a  loser  five  years  from  now
[25:47] use  your  discipline  for  a  new  micro 
 tasket  for  every  goal  that  you  have  and 
 in  some  time  that  micro  task  will  become
[25:53] a  habit  too  so  for  example  right  now  it 
 would  require  discipline  for  you  to 
 stretch  after  you  work  out  so  like  when
[26:00] you  finish  a  workout  you  don't  feel 
 motivated  it's  a  stretch  you  know  you're 
 making  all  these  excuses  but  then  you 
 say  to  yourself  no  no  I  know  that
[26:06] discipline  means  that  I'm  gonna  have  all 
 these  excuses  I'm  just  gonna  like  turn 
 my  brain  off  and  just  go  and  stretch  for
[26:11] a  few  minutes  after  maybe  a  couple  of 
 weeks  this  will  become  a  habit  and  you 
 might  even  start  to  enjoy  it  so  you
[26:16] might  finish  the  workout  and  just  be 
 used  to  going  to  stretch  at  that  point 
 you're  no  longer  using  discipline  so
[26:22] it's  time  to  find  the  next  micro  task 
 after  that  to  continuously  keep  making 
 progress  in  this  goal  here  is  your
[26:28] actionable  step  for  this  part  of  the 
 guide  figure  out  a  specific  micro  task 
 that  needs  discipline  that  would  get  you
[26:34] some  kind  of  progress  and  a  goal  of 
 yours  and  add  it  up  to  your  habit 
 tracker  and  if  I  was  you  get  the  Habit
[26:40] tracker  and  stick  it  up  on  the  wall  this 
 isn't  just  for  the  video  by  the  way  this 
 has  literally  been  on  my  wall  for  like
[26:45] for  um for  about  a  week  now  and  I  up  if 
 you  know  me  for  a  while  for  my  videos  I 
 always  try  to  show  you  quickly  I  always
[26:52] have  stuff  over  my  wall 
 so  obviously  I've  got  like  the  YouTube 
 Plex  there  but  a  lot  of  the  papers  you
[26:57] can  see  like  those  ones  they've  got  like 
 habit  trackers  they've  got  goals  and 
 everything  like  that  I  really  think
[27:02] that's  an  extra  step  that  you  can  take 
 just  have  a  habit  tracker  if  you  make 
 one  right  now  stick  it  up  add  in  the
[27:09] daily  little  discipline  that  we  had  from 
 the  last  time  you  know  maybe  clean  up 
 your  room  and  then  also  add  some  goal
[27:14] specific  ones  so  let's  say  you've  got 
 three  goals  for  Fitness  the  specific 
 task  could  be  okay  stretch  for  one
[27:19] minute  at  the  end  of  the  workout  for 
 your  work  it  could  be  to  read  three
[27:25] pages  of  a  book  every  single  day  or  it 
 could  be  for  example  to  meditate  or 
 something  and  then  let's  say  for
[27:30] relationships  it  could  be  to  just  hug 
 your  mum  first  thing  in  the  morning  as 
 soon  as  you  see  her  easy  things  right
[27:37] they're  not  actually  that  difficult 
 they're  easy  things  but  there  might  be 
 things  that  you  don't  consistently  do
[27:43] right  now  because  you  don't  really  feel 
 like  it  so  please  remember  this  the  next 
 time  you're  about  to  do  one  of  these
[27:48] tasks  you  will  genuinely  not  want  to  you 
 will  probably  not  be  motivated  your
[27:53] brain  will  probably  start  coping  and 
 saying  I  don't  have  time  I'll  do  this 
 it's  a  bit  awkward  you  know  it'll  start 
 to  cope  just  remind  yourself  that  is  the
[28:00] sign  that  you  are  using  discipline  it's 
 specifically  when  your  brain  is  trying
[28:05] to  convince  you  against  it  which  is 
 awesome  because  now  you're  training  like 
 against  that  weak  part  of  your  mind  that
[28:10] wants  you  to  be  complex  in  a  mediocre 
 and  week  we're  destroying  it  with  our 
 own  intentional  effort  the  next  time
[28:16] that  you  finish  up  a  workout  walk 
 blindly  like  it's  automatically  to  the
[28:21] yoga  mats  get  one  and  literally  just 
 like  do  a  cope  stretch  is  what  I  call  it 
 like  literally  just  like  you  know  just
[28:26] grab  your  knee  or  do  a  little  stretch 
 for  like  30  seconds  because  I  do  is 
 you're  not  trying  to  be  like  some 
 professional  flexible  person  right  now
[28:31] you're  starting  with  this  almost  like  a 
 child  would  and  the  idea  is  if  you  did 
 this  you  know  three  times  a  week  five
[28:37] times  a  week  seven  times  a  week  right 
 now  for  the  next  year  Five  Years  bro  in 
 five  years  time  you're  gonna  be  like  the
[28:42] most  flexible  person  you'll  be  able  to 
 do  or  like  the  weird  [ __ ]  you  know  and 
 like  that  would  genuinely  help  you  you
[28:48] would  genuinely  unlock  your  body  and  be 
 able  to  like  just  work  and  move  so  much
[28:53] better  and  the  same  with  for  example  30 
 seconds  of  meditation  today  you  don't 
 feel  like  it's  kind  of  boring  and  you 
 know  it  drags  on  a  little  bit  but  you
[28:59] start  with  30  seconds  or  a  minute  today 
 and  you  keep  doing  it  even  though  you 
 don't  feel  like  doing  it  for  an  entire
[29:05] year  and  by  the  end  of  the  year  you're 
 probably  used  to  doing  10  minutes  every 
 single  day  which  is  perfect  10  years
[29:11] from  now  you're  meditate  in  20  minutes  a 
 day  30  40  a  one  hour  every  single  day 
 which  is  insane  when  you  compare  that  to
[29:17] like  normal  people  this  is  how  you  get 
 ahead  in  life  it  is  always  these  small
[29:22] micro  Pockets  this  is  how  you  end  up 
 having  like  a  relationship  with  your 
 parents  so  much  better  than  everyone
[29:27] else  are  rich  you  know  everyone's  so 
 individual  and  So  like 
 um  so  against  family  like  almost  no
[29:33] one's  family  orientated  these  days  when 
 you're  the  guy  who  simply  all  you  do  is
[29:38] discipline  yourself  to  just  hug  your 
 parents  every  single  time  you  see  like 
 every  morning  when  you  see  your  parents
[29:43] if  you  live  with  them  I  I  always  hug  my 
 mother  like  it's  not  hard  to  do  it's 
 just  that  often  you  don't  really  feel
[29:49] like  it  you  know  your  brain  tries  to 
 convince  you  that  it's  awkward  or 
 something  it's  a  10  out  of  10  habit  for
[29:54] me  now  it  doesn't  require  discipline  I 
 just  do  it  kind  of  blindly  and  I  saw 
 like  literally  just  saw  the  smile
[30:00] because  it's  morning  time  right  now  I 
 just  saw  the  smile  on  my  mom's  faces 
 always  every  time  I  hug  her  in  the 
 morning  I'm  just  used  to  it  if  you've
[30:06] already  got  some  kind  of  value  from  this 
 video  and  you  think  that  it's  really 
 helping  you  please  just  do  me  a  little 
 favor  do  the  YouTube  algorithm  stuff  I
[30:13] hate  saying  this  but  it  really  does  work 
 so  like  you  know  the  like  in  the 
 comments  and  spam  the  comments  and  share 
 the  link  to  some  friends  if  you  know
[30:19] that  there's  some  people  who  would 
 benefit  from  more  discipline  in  their 
 lives  maybe  you  know  some  guys  who  are 
 on  self-improvements  or  some  guys  who
[30:24] should  be  on  self-improvements  if  you 
 send  this  link  to  a  couple  of  people 
 that  would  be  huge  for  me  and  my  goal
[30:30] with  these  guides  that  I'm  spending  a 
 lot  of  time  on  is  that  even  years  from 
 now  you  keep  mentioning  it  to  people
[30:36] that  would  be  like  the  greatest  gift  you 
 could  ever  give  me  so  you  just  casually 
 just  say  it  to  someone  like  oh  yeah  you
[30:41] should  watch  hamza's  full  discipline 
 guide  that  would  genuinely  bring  like 
 the  biggest  smile  on  my  face  because  if
[30:46] you're  spreading  Word  of  Mouth  to  the 
 people  that  means  that  I've  really 
 produced  something  which  has  contributed
[30:51] to  humanity  which  is  Awesome  chapter 
 three  discipline  in  work  and  studies
[30:57] back  in  June  2023  I'm  about  to  send  my 
 dad  a  message  he's  driving  right  now  but
[31:02] he's  got  someone  in  the  back  seat 
 someone  who  he  doesn't  want  the
[31:09] he's  got  a  woman  in  the  back  seats  and 
 he  has  to  be  polite  to  her
[31:17] he's  a  taxi  driver 
 he  has  to  be  polite  because  that's  his 
 passenger
[31:22] I'm  sending  him  a  message  telling  him  of 
 the  recent  success  that  I've  had  in 
 business  I'm  sending  him  a  screenshot  of
[31:28] the  like  carton  notifications  that  I've 
 been  getting  and  how  much  money  I've 
 been  making
[31:35] a  hundred  thousand  pounds 
 per  month
[31:40] I  tell  him  that  I'm  on  track  for  my  goal 
 of  3  million  this  year
[31:45] and  that  he  doesn't  need  to  drive  the 
 taxi  anymore
[31:52] I'm  getting  flushes  of  the  last  few 
 years  that  I've  dedicated  my  life  to 
 this  goal  of  this  business  this  online
[31:58] income  and  this  was  a  big  moment  for  me 
 and  I'm  thinking  how  awesome  it's  going 
 to  be  he's  going  to  come  home  and
[32:03] together  we'll  take  off  like  the  taxi 
 stickers  that  are  on  the  car  and  I  can 
 record  it  and  I'll  get  a  lot  of  views
[32:10] but  unfortunately  that's  not  what 
 happens 
 because  my  father  doesn't  come  home  as
[32:16] expected 
 he  does  come  home
[32:22] but  as  I  see  the  car  pull  up  into  the 
 driveway
[32:28] the  taxi  stickers  are  already  gone 
 I  was  waiting  there  ready  to  record  the
[32:34] moment  that  we're  going  to  be  taking 
 them  off 
 and  I  asked  him  what  you  already  took 
 them  off
[32:40] it  turns  out  that  the  moment  that  I  sent 
 my  dad  the  text  message  or  the  moment 
 that  he  saw  it
[32:45] he  didn't  even  wait  to  come  home  to  get 
 rid  of  all  of  like  the  signs  that  made 
 it  clear  that  he  was  a  taxi  driver  he
[32:51] pulled  up  at  the  side  of  the  road  and 
 did  it  there 
 and  it  hits  me  that  for  the  last  20
[32:57] years  my  parents  have  dedicated  their 
 lives  to  raising  me  and  my  siblings  and
[33:02] my  dad  has  worked  these  low  status  jobs 
 my  dad  has  sacrificed  status  as  a  man's
[33:07] status 
 to  just  provide  for  the  family
[33:12] and  he 
 was  pained  by  that
[33:17] he  was  agitated  by  it  but  he  just  did  it 
 just  for  the  sake  of  family  my  dad  had  a
[33:23] much  better  job  in  Pakistan  he  had  more 
 of  a  leadership  position  more  of  a 
 manager  inside  of  a  um  like  a  big  paper
[33:31] mill  engineering  position  and  here  in 
 the  UK  he's  he  told  me  from  his  words
[33:36] he's  worked  more  as  a  laborer 
 now  20  years  later  I'm  26  years  old
[33:44] and  I've  finally  been  able  to  pay  it 
 back  there  are  many  people  out  there 
 your  age  who  are  making  an  unbelievable
[33:51] amount  of  money 
 and  one  of  the  first  things  that  the 
 smartest  people  in  this  group  do
[33:57] they  retire  their  family 
 they  pay  their  parents  back  for  the  the
[34:02] effort  and  sacrifice  that  they've  made 
 and  it's  such  a  beautiful  experience
[34:07] it's 
 to  be  a  son  who  retires  his  father  is  a 
 beautiful  experience  I  think  it's  like
[34:12] every  son's  Duty 
 and  it's  gonna  require  discipline
[34:19] because  when  you  look  into  any  of  these 
 genuinely  successful  young  people  the 
 young  people  who  are  literal
[34:25] millionaires  there  is  absolutely  one 
 trait  that  they  have  in  common  they  did 
 hard  work  even  when  they  did  not  feel
[34:32] like  it  but  on  the  other  hand  the  young 
 men  who  lack  discipline  they're  hit  with
[34:37] three  major  pain  points  one 
 they  live  a  life  where  they're  not
[34:43] living  up  to  their  potential 
 they're  always  unfulfilled  two  they're
[34:48] experiencing  the  realities  of  being  a 
 poor  performer  which  means  shitty  jobs 
 not  much  money  in  their  business  poor
[34:56] grades 
 and  maybe  worst  of  all  three  the  people 
 in  their  lives  are  let  down  or  maybe  the
[35:02] people  in  their  lives  are  experiencing 
 extra  stress  to  counteract  their
[35:07] laziness  and  lack  of  discipline 
 you  see  there's  only  really  two  paths  in 
 front  of  you  it's  the  path  of  discipline
[35:14] or  it's  the  path  of  destruction 
 the  cost  of  discipline
[35:20] okay  you've  got  to  wake  up  a  little  bit 
 earlier  you  make  some  coffee  and  you  get 
 to  work  even  though  it  feels  kind  of
[35:25] hard  the  cost  of  lacking  discipline  is 
 your  soul  it's  the  pain  that  when  you 
 fall  in  love  with  a  woman  you're  not
[35:31] successful  enough  to  be  able  to  just 
 retire  her  immediately 
 that  seems  like  a  distant  dream  for  a
[35:38] lot  of  guys  but  it  is  a  reality  for  some 
 imagine  that  moment  when  your  woman
[35:43] still  needs  to  go  to  work  in  a  job  that 
 she  doesn't  want  to  go  to  you  know  if
[35:48] you  meet  a  woman  who  loves  her  work 
 that's  different  let's  say  she's  working 
 some  shitty  job  and  it's  actually 
 starting  to  drain  on  her  let's  say  she
[35:54] gets  pregnant  and  even  six  months  or 
 however  long  three  months  into  the 
 pregnancy  she  still  has  to  go  to  work
[35:59] she  still  has  to  commute 
 now  I  can  be  sat  here  like  you  know 
 being  like  nice  as  everyone  else's  to
[36:04] you  but  I'm  gonna  hit  you  with  some  cold 
 hard  [ __ ]  truths
[36:10] you're  discreasing  your  manhood  if  you 
 can't  provide  for  others 
 if  you  have  a  woman  who  hates  her  job
[36:17] but  still  has  to  go  because  you  weren't 
 disciplined  enough  for  long  enough  in
[36:22] your  life 
 you  should  feel  like  a  [ __ ]  [ __ ] 
 you  should  lock  yourself  in  the  mirror
[36:27] and  actually  think 
 [ __ ]  me  I  wasted  years  of  my  life  doing
[36:32] what  porn  video  games  drinking  drugs 
 right  if  it  was  different  if  it  was  like
[36:37] you  know  you  were  really  working  hard 
 but  you  didn't  end  up  achieving  success 
 that's  the  difference  but  look  into  the
[36:43] [ __ ]  mirror  and  just  be  honest  with 
 yourself  did  you  actually  like  work  to 
 the  level  that  you  should  have  did  you
[36:49] did  you  discipline  yourself  to  the  level 
 that  you  should  have  or  did  you  just 
 keep  coping  and  saying  that  one  hour  of
[36:55] video  games  was  fine  and  now  your  girl 
 has  to  go  work  an  overnight  shift  or  you 
 know  like  she  has  to  work  overtime  on
[37:01] Saturdays  now  your  father's  like  60 
 years  old  and  he's  still  like  stretching 
 along  to  work  and  no  one  will  say  this
[37:06] to  you  by  the  way  no  one  will  actually 
 come  to  you  and  say  like  I  wish  you 
 retired  me  your  father's  probably  not
[37:11] going  to  say  that  to  you  but  they're 
 thinking  that  I  can't  believe  I  raised 
 such  a  weak  son  who  didn't  even
[37:17] understand  the  concept  of  masculinity 
 that  you  provide  your  father  provided
[37:22] for  you  and  here  you  are 
 extra  one  hour  on  video  games  every  day
[37:27] eating  carbs  that  [ __ ]  up  your  brain  and 
 now  you  can't  even  work  well
[37:34] I  don't  mean  to  be  insulting  or 
 aggressive  towards  you  but  I  wish  that 
 someone  spoke  to  me  like  this  because
[37:39] everyone  spoke  to  me  like  a  [ __ ]  when  I 
 was  growing  up  it  was  so  weird  it's  like
[37:44] trust  me  when  I  say  people  are  thinking 
 these  thoughts  but  I'm  growing  up 
 playing  video  games  watching  porn
[37:49] [ __ ]  around  wasting  time  and  only  my 
 father  would  just  kind  of  tell  me  you 
 know  these  are  bad  habits  and  stuff  but
[37:54] he  wouldn't  ever  explain  I  wish  he  sat 
 down  like  maybe  I  would  have  thought  of 
 him  worse  but  I  wish  he  sat  me  down  he
[38:00] said  like  you  shouldn't  be  playing  video 
 games  because  in  10  years  I  wish  that
[38:05] you  would  retire  me  I  wish  that  I'd  stop 
 working  these  shitty  jobs  that  I  hate 
 and  I  hate  my  life  and  I  have  to  drink
[38:11] alcohol  to  be  able  to  sleep  I  wish  in  10 
 years  from  now  you'd  be  able  to  retire 
 me  and  I  don't  believe  you'll  be  able  to
[38:16] do  that  because  you  keep  spending  two 
 three  four  five  hours  a  day  on  video 
 games  I'm  disappointed  in  you  I  wish
[38:22] someone  told  me  that  when  I  was  younger 
 these  days  like  everyone  just  speaks  in 
 such  a  polite  like  nice  way  you  need
[38:28] someone  to  hit  you  with  some  truth  that 
 I  don't  say  this  to  be  an  [ __ ]  I 
 don't  say  this  to  hurt  your  feelings  if 
 I  wanted  to  hurt  your  feelings  I
[38:33] wouldn't  be  making  like  a  guide  like 
 this  where  I've  genuinely  put  my  [ __ ] 
 heart  and  soul  into  this  for  the  last
[38:38] like  two  weeks  and  like  numbed  my  brains 
 of  thinking  how  I  can  help  you  be  more
[38:43] disciplined 
 but  sometimes  especially  for  young  men 
 men  who  are  masculine  you  need  a  bit  of
[38:49] criticism  from  someone  else  you  need 
 another  guy  to  look  at  you  and  just  say 
 like  bro  you're  not  living  to  your 
 potential  so  what  the  [ __ ]  is  the  point
[38:55] in  your  life  now  you  can  start  getting 
 depressed  and  think  that  this  is  gonna 
 trigger  you  and  make  you  worse  or  you
[39:00] can  think  you  know  what  it  is  shameful 
 it  is  absolutely  shameful  for  me  to  be
[39:05] like  a  leech  on  my  family  when  I'm  a 
 young  man  I'm  18  years  old  I'm  20  years 
 old  I  can  work  harder  I  can  figure  it
[39:12] out  and  I  don't  have  to  retire  them 
 right  now  because  that  would  be 
 unreasonable  but  I  could  surely  retire
[39:17] my  parents  after  10  years  from  now  if  I 
 said  that  as  the  plan  right  that's  not 
 so  like  super  unrealistic  I'll  give  you
[39:23] a  like  a  random  tip  when  we  talk  about 
 retiring  parents  people  don't  really 
 explain  it  there's  two  ways  that  you
[39:29] retire  your  parents  one  is  that  you  make 
 like  an  absolute  boatload  of  money  and 
 you  just  essentially  transfer  them  the
[39:35] money  like  a  huge  amount  like  let's  say 
 one  million  dollars  and  they  get  to  live 
 off  that  forever  that  they  don't  have  to 
 think  about  anything  else  that's  very
[39:41] unrealistic  because  that  means  that 
 you've  probably  got  10  million  or  50 
 million  in  the  bank  account  you  can  give 
 them  that  much  so  not  many  guys  will  do
[39:47] that  but  the  other  one  is  that  you're 
 making  a  really  good  amount  of  money 
 every  month  like  for  example  your 
 business  is  making  8  000  or  10  000  a
[39:53] month  which  is  really  high  but  it's 
 possible  and  then  from  that  you  give 
 them  more  than  what  they  need  to  be  able
[39:59] to  pay  off  all  the  bills  so  for  example 
 you  give  your  parents  like  four  thousand 
 dollars  a  month  which  means  that
[40:04] suddenly  they  don't  even  need  to  work 
 anymore  let's  say  it's  like  your  mother 
 right  now  like  how  much  does  she  make 
 two  thousand  dollars  a  month  probably
[40:10] less  for  most  of  the  people  watching 
 this  right  now  probably  way  less  right 
 so  if  you  were  making  five  thousand
[40:15] dollars  a  month  in  your  business  and  you 
 were  able  to  give  your  mother  1.5  K  or 
 2K  suddenly  all  of  her  time  is  freed  she
[40:21] doesn't  need  to  work  the  shitty  job  that 
 she  hates  and  it's  like  this  is  a  very 
 strong  point  for  people  because  this  is
[40:27] when  the  leashes  the  chains  of  Finance 
 get  broken  off  and  they  can  discover  who
[40:32] they  really  are  and  what  they  really 
 want  to  do  with  their  lives  and  it  turns 
 out  you  know  people  still  want  to  work
[40:37] and  be  productive  and  do  something  your 
 mother's  been  working  this  [ __ ]  job  that 
 she  hates  now  it  turns  out  that  she
[40:42] actually  wants  to go  and  volunteer  at 
 this  charity  because  like  one  of  the 
 like  some  friends  or  something  is  there 
 or  there's  like  a  cafe  that  she  really
[40:48] likes  and  she'd  love  to  work  there 
 part-time  so  she's  thrilled  bringing  in 
 a  bit  of  income  but  she  like  really 
 enjoys  it  a  lot  more  it's  not  as
[40:54] stressful  it's  closer  to  home  she 
 doesn't  have  to  commute  and  you've  just 
 gave  her  the  genuine  Gift  of  Life
[41:02] for  two  thousand  dollars  a  month
[41:07] not  bad 
 you  should  not  be  hearing  this
[41:12] and  start  a 
 self-destruct  because  there  are  quite  a 
 lot  of  sensitive  young  people  who  are
[41:18] hearing  this  and  that  they're  just  gonna 
 start  getting  really  really  stressed  out 
 and  stuff  that's  not  going  to  help  you 
 don't  just  start  getting  emotional  at
[41:25] this  start  getting  logical  towards  this 
 start  thinking  to  yourself  you  know  what
[41:30] emotions  aren't  going  to  help  me 
 it's  Logic  power  strength  will
[41:35] discipline  well  what's  going  to  help  you 
 is  the  fact  that  barely  one  percent  of 
 young  men
[41:41] are  interested  in  things  like  this  like 
 if  you  really  just  imagine  yourself 
 right  now  if  you  view  yourself  in  third 
 person  you're  sat  here  watching  a  guide
[41:48] on  discipline  now  if  you  imagine  the 
 people  you  grew  up with  what  are  they 
 doing  right  now  one  of  them  is  genuinely
[41:53] edging  his  dick  right  now  you  know  it 
 the  other  one  is  literally  like  he's 
 still  lying  in  bed  right  now  the  other
[41:58] one  is  watching  some  [ __ ]  TV  or 
 something  the  other  one  is  just  well 
 playing  on  his  little  Xbox  with  his
[42:03] little  stubby  fingers  or  something  he's 
 got  like  a  little  like  oily  fingers  from 
 like  a  little  disgusting  junk  food  he's
[42:08] been  eating  whilst  playing  the  game 
 the  other  one  is  working  some  like  [ __ ] 
 job  that  he  hates  but  he's  spending  all
[42:13] the  money  on  like  some  some  car  that 
 gives  him  a  level  of  validation  so  maybe 
 he  can  get  some  stinky  call  from  when  he
[42:19] goes  to  the  club 
 that's  your  competition  you're  telling 
 me  you  can't  beat  those  guys  your
[42:24] competition  is  literally  guys  who  don't 
 even  exercise  your  competition  is  guys 
 who  genuinely  have  never  even  heard  of
[42:29] the  concept  of  like  meditating 
 that's  your  competition  bro  it's  not
[42:35] that  hard  to  beat  99  of  guys  all  you've 
 got  to  do  is  about  10  push-ups  and  30
[42:40] seconds  of  meditation  today  that's  it 
 then  to  beat  the  one  percent  is
[42:45] ruthlessly  hard  because  guys  in  the  one 
 percent  are  actually  doing  bits  they've 
 already  watched  this  guy  they're  already 
 meditating  for  the  last  year  they've  all
[42:51] got  six  packs  they  all  understand  all 
 these  like  Concepts  and  frames  and 
 mindsets  now  it  gets  hard  but  to  be  99
[42:56] of  guys  bro  and  you  know  to  get  to  like 
 the  equivalent  of  that  might  be  one  or 
 two  or  five  k  in  business  it's  like  just
[43:02] just  do  some  stuff  consistently  for  like 
 two  months  and  ask  for  advice  and  just
[43:08] maybe  get  someone  who's  more  experienced 
 than  you  to  help  you  and  to  give  you 
 some  kind  of  Direction  and  just  do  it 
 for  about  an  hour  a  day  for  like  two
[43:14] months  three  months  when  you  go  down 
 this  path  of  discipline  what  you'll 
 realize  is  you'll  start  to  get  this
[43:19] weird  peaceful  Blissful  experience  which 
 kind  of  like  it  reminds  you  it  it  shows
[43:25] you  you  know  the  concept  of  your 
 potential  you  always  heard  this  in 
 school  and  Instagram  little  quotes  uh
[43:31] live  to  your  potential  do  you  know  your 
 potential  your  potential  eventually  goal 
 potential  when  you  start  to  dedicate
[43:36] yourself  to  discipline  and  really  don't 
 [ __ ]  yourself  you  really  become
[43:41] disciplined  in  the  areas  that  you  didn't 
 want  to  like  you  kind  of  want  to  but  you 
 know  you  don't  feel  like  it  you're  not 
 motivated  and  stuff  you  really  start  to
[43:47] do  hardship  I  didn't  want  to  sit  down 
 for  this  [ __ ]  video  right  now  I 
 didn't  want  to  I've  already  done  three
[43:52] hours  of  deep  work  today  my  brain  was 
 kind  of  hurting  and  for  like  a  like  a 
 break  like  a  vacation  I  closed  my  eyes
[43:58] and  did  some  deep  breaths  and  now  I'm 
 here  now  I'm  recording  for  like  a  solid 
 probably  two  hours  whilst  I'm  here
[44:05] and  it  feels  phenomenal  because  as  I'm 
 doing  this  there's  no  thoughts  in  my
[44:10] mind  I've  challenged  myself  today  so  I 
 get  a  free  flow  State  this  is  the 
 happiest  like  a  human  can  be  is  when
[44:16] you're  experiencing  flow  and  there's  no 
 thoughts  in  my  mind  I  don't  need  to  fake 
 it  you  know  I'm  not  like  like  some
[44:21] people  will  pretend  that  they're  happy 
 with  their  work  and  they'll  show  you 
 like  a  fake  smile  I  don't  need  to  show 
 you  like  a  massive  big  smile  I  am
[44:27] totally  and  utterly  like  content  and 
 almost  slightly  like  enlightened  in  this 
 exact  second  right  now  because  of
[44:32] discipline  because  I've  put  the  hard 
 work  in  to  be  here  today  so  I'm  in  like 
 a  flow  as  I  deserve  the  moment  that  I'm
[44:39] done  recording  this  I'm  gonna  feel 
 phenomenal  I've  accomplished  more  in 
 this  morning  than  I  used  to  genuinely
[44:46] over  an  entire  month 
 it's  10  A.M
[44:51] I  woke  up  at  five 
 it's  awesome  living  like  this  now  I  want
[44:58] to  talk  about  some  specific  strategies 
 that  you  can  use  to  use  discipline  in 
 your  work  and  your  studies  step  3.1  wake
[45:05] up  early  now  either  choose  to  wake  up 
 early  or  to  stay  up  late  but  I  think
[45:10] that  you  should  have  either  one  of  these 
 extreme  like  this  pocket  of  window  very
[45:15] early  in  the  day  or  very  late  at  night 
 where  no  one  can  contact  you  and  that's 
 when  you  can  work  on  something  which  is
[45:21] really  really  important  this  is  building 
 up  to  the  most  important  productivity 
 tactic  that  I  could  be  telling  you  about
[45:26] you  must  have  a  few  hours  of  the  day 
 where  no  one  will  contact  you  when  no
[45:31] one's  awake  but  it's  just  kind  of  you 
 with  some  silent  enthusiasm  working  on 
 something  that's  super  hard  and  like  you
[45:37] know  the  hardest  task  possible  and  it 
 like  100  trust  me  that  I  highly  doubt
[45:42] that  you  could  do  this  in  the  middle  of 
 the  day  and  you  need  to  wake  up  early  4 
 AM  5  AM  6  a.m  or  you  stay  up  late
[45:47] midnight  1am  something  like  that  you  can 
 choose  which  one  it  is  some  people  are
[45:52] way  more  night  owls  and  they  do  a  really 
 good  work  there  somebody  people  are  way 
 better  in  like  the  morning  time  I'm  way
[45:58] better  in  the  morning  what  I  will  say  is 
 I  do  genuinely  think  the  morning  is 
 better  for  pretty  much  everyone  because
[46:03] when  you  stay  up  late  you  do 
 automatically  experience  problems 
 there's  more  people  who  are  still  awake
[46:08] at  11  o'clock  even  midnight  you  can't 
 drink  coffee  or  caffeine  or  anything  if
[46:13] you  see  any  bright  lights  or  you  know 
 any  lights  from  your  computer  past  about 
 10  pm  it  really  does  start  to  [ __ ]  up
[46:19] your  mental  health  like  Andrew  huberman 
 talks  about  this  a  lot  that  if  you  look 
 into  the  computer  or  phone  past  10  pm  or
[46:25] 11  pm  it  starts  to  produce  like 
 depressive  symptoms  inside  of  you 
 because  it's  totally  unnatural  to  see
[46:30] light  at  that  time  when  you  wake  up 
 early  at  five  and  you  see  light  it's 
 absolutely  fine  it's  actually  kind  of
[46:35] healthy  so  I  heavily  prefer  morning  time 
 but  if  for  example  I  was  someone  who 
 genuinely  could  not  wake  up  early  but  I
[46:42] feel  fantastic  at  11  or  midnight  or  1am 
 I  would  still  do  that  I  would  be  pushing
[46:47] that  and  literally  like  be  up  at  a  time 
 where  everyone  else  is  asleep  where  you
[46:52] don't  reply  to  any  messages  so  that  you 
 can  do  the  hardest  task  possible  I  do  my 
 absolute  best  work  as  early  as  possible
[46:59] in  the  day  so  right  now  I  wake  up  at 
 five  and  my  deep  work  task  is  between 
 five  and  eight  am  so  in  cases  you  want
[47:05] to  copy  me  you  want  to  take  any  of  my 
 ideas  here's  my  current  exact  routine  at
[47:10] 8pm  I  shut  everything  down 
 non-negotiable  I  don't  care  if  I'm  on  a 
 call  if  I'm  doing  anything  at  8pm
[47:15] everything  is  shut  down  that's  when  I'll 
 go  and  do  my  nighttime  routine  and  you 
 know  brush  my  teeth  I'll  Frost  my  teeth
[47:20] and  stuff  set  up  my  room  and  everything 
 set  up  tomorrow  for  um  for  work  and 
 everything  then  I'll  get  into  bed
[47:25] and  I  just  read  like  sideways  lying  down 
 the  whole  room  is  dark  but  I  have  a
[47:30] Kindle  which  is  on  the  lowest  brightness 
 and  when  you  read  like  literally  to  the 
 point  that  your  eyes  closed  you  have
[47:35] perfect  sleep 
 I  usually  fall  asleep  for  about  8  30  p.m 
 maybe  sometimes  about  9pm  and  I  wake  up
[47:42] usually  5  a.m  like  on  the  dot  just  by 
 myself  wake  up  first  10  minutes  15
[47:47] minutes  I'm  just  quickly  just  going  to 
 the  toilet  drinking  some  water  go 
 downstairs  and  I'll  look  at  bright  light 
 like  I'll  look  at  the  the  sunlight  right
[47:53] now  this  sun  which  is  out  at  like  5  a.m 
 so  I'm  getting  that  into  my  eyes  Andrew 
 huberman  says  it's  good  then  at  about  5
[47:59] 50  and  I  come  up  and  I  literally  just  do 
 deep  work  till  8  A.M  so  I'm  working  on
[48:04] the  full  guides  for  the  script  and 
 everything  it's  like  a  very  mentally 
 demanding  super  hard  task  no  one  can
[48:09] disturb  me  no  one's  awake  I'm  not 
 checking  messages  no  one's  awake  in  my 
 house  so  I'm  just  working  on  that  this
[48:15] is  how  you  move  the  needle  so  there's  a 
 phrase  that  I  want  to  tell  you  which 
 means  a  lot  to  me  it's  called  Eat  the
[48:22] Frog  the  idea  is  I  think  some 
 philosopher  or  something  made  this  but 
 the  idea  is  that  if  you  eat  the  Frog
[48:27] first  the  hardest  thing  if  you  do  the 
 most  gross  thing  the  hardest  thing  first 
 then  the  rest  of  the  day  is  going  to  be
[48:33] easier  and  better  most  people  do  the 
 opposite  thing  they've  got  something 
 hard  that  they  really  don't  have
[48:38] motivation  for  and  they'll  keep  pushing 
 it  on  pushing  it  later  later  until
[48:43] eventually  it's  like  their  entire  day 
 has  just  been  kind  of  like  stressed  out 
 by  that  thing  that  they're  pushing  later
[48:48] and  sometimes  they  don't  even  get  it 
 done  so  you  wake  up  and  you  do  the 
 hardest  thing  straight  away  whilst  your
[48:54] brain's  really  fresh  and  then  you've  got 
 like  an  easier  day  after  that 
 so  when  I  wake  up  I  focus  entirely  on
[49:00] these  full  guides  because  that's  like  my 
 main  thing  that's  like  the  hardest  thing 
 I  could  possibly  be  doing  and  I'll  just
[49:05] be  scripting  the  video  I'll  be 
 researching  it  I'll  be  editing  my  script 
 and  everything  and  then  I  record  the
[49:10] full  guide  as  well  this  is  the  real  me 
 time  this  is  when  I  wake  up  no  one  can
[49:15] bother  me  and  I  can  focus  on  dedicating 
 myself  to  my  craft  and  I  really  think
[49:20] that  I'm  moving  things  along  and  so  you 
 can  copy  this  so  the  first  thing  you've 
 got  to  do  is  figure  out  are  you  going  to 
 be  a  morning  person  or  a  nighttime
[49:26] person  I  really  think  you  need  to  be  one 
 and  I  think  the  more  extreme  that  you 
 can  push  the  time  the  better  if  you  can
[49:33] wake  up  at  like  4am  or  5am  and  then 
 start  to  adjust  you  know  the  rest  of 
 your  life  to  it  the  sleep  schedule  and
[49:39] everything  to  it  fantastic  if  you  can 
 stay  up  1am  or  2  2  A.M  and  you  can
[49:44] really  really  get  good  work  done  and 
 you're  not  coping  and  you  don't  get 
 distracted  and  no  one's  messaging  you
[49:49] and  you  can  like  you  know  stay  awake  at 
 that  time  then  do  that  you  should  have 
 one  of  these  Pockets  the  next  thing  is
[49:54] and  this  is  the  actionable  step  figure 
 out  what  you  you'll  eat  the  Frog  task  is
[50:00] what  is  the  single  greatest  hardest 
 highest  leverage  task  for  your  work  or
[50:05] your  studies 
 for  a  YouTuber  for  example  it's  not  you 
 know  changing  the  channel  Banner  it's
[50:11] not  like  commenting  on  videos  it's 
 simply  just  like  recording  the  video  and 
 maybe  scripting  the  video  that's  like
[50:16] the  hardest  highest  leverage  thing  out 
 there  for  a  YouTuber  so  this  is  what  I 
 do  in  that  first  pocket  of  the  day  if
[50:22] you're  a  nighttime  person  then  you  do 
 this  right  at  the  end  or  for  example 
 let's  say  you  are  an  author  you  could  be
[50:28] messaging  people  you  could  be  writing 
 emails  you  could  you  know  be  sending 
 shout  outs  to  people  or  something  but
[50:33] the  hardest  task  that  eat  the  Frog  of  an 
 author  what  do  you  think  it  is  literally 
 just  writing  words  down  on  a  page  that's
[50:40] the  hardest  task  so  if  you're  an  author 
 you'd  wake  up  and  you  do  that  as  fast  as 
 possible  or  you'd  stay  up  late  and  you
[50:46] do  that  you  get  the  drift  the  point  is 
 that  there's  a  certain  task  for  your 
 work  and  for  your  studies  that  is  super
[50:52] high  leverage  but  it's  really  hard  and 
 that's  the  thing  that  you  should  be 
 doing  in  these  like  pockets  of  time  if
[50:58] you're  a  student  for  example  you  might 
 think  that  oh  yeah  mine  is  studying  for
[51:03] example  needs  to  be  way  more  specific  it 
 can't  just  be  studying  because  then  it's 
 like  you  know  you  can  you'll  just  cope
[51:08] right  because  you  won't  have  a  plan  it 
 needs  to be  a  specific  task  as  specific 
 as  for  example  practicing  the  exam
[51:15] questions  so  you've  got  an  upcoming  exam 
 you've  got  like  a  list  of  all  the 
 questions  that  they've  had  over  the  last
[51:21] five  years  at  Five  AM  you  wake  up  and 
 you  practice  the  exam  questions  for  90 
 minutes  that's  that  is  a  good  deep  work
[51:28] task  right  there  Alex  hamosi  is  a 
 entrepreneur  like  a  YouTuber  who's  got  a 
 bunch  of  subscribers  and  he  spoke  about
[51:35] how  he  ended  up  getting  really  really 
 good  grades  in  college  he  literally  just 
 practiced  the  exam  questions  over  and
[51:40] over  and  over  again  so  that  when  it  came 
 to  the  exam  he  had  already  practiced  the 
 questions  that  come  up  anyway  so  we  just
[51:45] breathe  through  them  that's  a  very  high 
 leverage  task  a  lot  of  students  cope  and 
 they  say  like  you  know  their  task  is
[51:50] just  going  to  be  studying  they  end  up 
 sitting  there  they're  distracted  they 
 don't  know  what  they're  doing  they'll
[51:55] read  a  bit  of  the  book  but  it's  boring 
 it's  not  even  high  leverage  it's  very 
 important  you  have  a  specific  task  that
[52:00] you'll  focus  on  I  will  tell  you  that 
 I've  been  on  self-improvement  full  time 
 for  the  past  three  years  I  haven't  had  a
[52:06] job  other  than  YouTube  and  so  I've 
 literally  had  the  beautiful  opportunity 
 to  like  be  full-time  on  my
[52:12] self-improvements 
 and  I  will  tell  you 
 that  this  is
[52:18] a  10  out  of  10  productivity  tactic  wake 
 up  early  stay  up  late  whichever  one  and
[52:24] work  on  that  Harvest  task  eat  the  Frog 
 that's  what  I  have  in  this  habit  tracker 
 behind  me  I  have  5  am
[52:31] sunlight 
 eat  the  Frog  that's  the  three  things  I 
 do  first  and  then  I've  got  like  my  the
[52:36] rest  of  my  morning  routine  as  well  this 
 will  be  hard  when  you  sit  down  to  try 
 and  do  one  of  these  tasks  it's  always
[52:41] like  quite  brutally  hard  it's  like 
 you're  trudging  through  deep  snow  it's
[52:46] hard  there's  always  a  bit  of  a  struggle 
 you  don't  really  want  to  do  it  but  as 
 you  get  about  20  minutes  or  30  minutes
[52:51] into  one  of  these  hard  like  frog  tasks 
 that's  when  you  start  to  feel  a  lot 
 better  like  I  am  right  now  when  I  was
[52:58] having  a  shower  before  this  I  was 
 literally  thinking  like  you  know  Kobe  do 
 I  want  to  record  this  I  can't  be 
 bothered  what  if  I  do  after  the  gym  what
[53:03] if  I  do  you  know  this  all  these  thoughts 
 the  first  like  10  minutes  or  so  of 
 recording  this  video  I  was  feeling  a
[53:08] little  bit  like  I  don't  know  groggy  not 
 really  feeling  it  now  it's  fine  you've 
 just  got  to  fight  the  struggle  that  will
[53:13] inevitably  arise  with  a  task  like  this 
 hard  and  this  is  really  I'm  gonna  be
[53:18] honest  this  is  where  the  success  is 
 built  because  you  see  how  hard  you  can 
 imagine  how  hard  this  is  I'm  telling  you
[53:24] to  either  wake  up  early  or  to  stay  up 
 late  which  means  that  you've  got  to  kind 
 of  dedicate  your  life  around  this  and
[53:29] then  I'm  telling  you  to  work  on  the 
 super  hardest  task  possible  the  highest 
 level  average  task  everyone  else  is
[53:35] doing  the  exact  opposite  everyone  else 
 is  spending  their  time  doing  like  the 
 pointless  tasks  which  aren't  so
[53:40] important  and  the  hard  really  important 
 task  they're  pushing  that  off  to  like 
 you  know  until  the  later  of  the  day  till
[53:46] they're  tired  and  it's  less  of  a 
 priority  and  they're  doing  other  things 
 first  they're  going  to  the  gym  first
[53:52] this  is  how  you  get  ahead  of  everyone 
 else  you  prioritize  that  big  task  and
[53:57] you  try  and  do  it  first  thing  in  the  day 
 when  no  one  can  message  you  and  do  all 
 this  with  the  vibe  of  enthusiasm  and
[54:02] enjoyment  because  you're  building  your 
 dream  life  and  you're  not  just  building 
 your  dream  life
[54:07] this  is  the  dream  life  when  you  imagined 
 your  dream  life  and  you  thought  of  you
[54:12] know  the  life  that  you  wanted  to  live 
 oftentimes  we've  been  influencing 
 brainwashed  by  media  by  school  by  you
[54:17] know  like  people  that  we  know  and 
 influencers  and  even  like  the  red  pill 
 like  like  based  guys  have  influenced  us
[54:23] to  think  that  we  need  this  Bugatti  or 
 this  this  apartment  or  you  know  like  be 
 a  high  value  man  and  stuff  when  you  take
[54:28] all  that  [ __ ]  aside  when  you  really 
 think  about  your  dream  life  in  some  way 
 you  probably  did  think  about  the  fact
[54:34] that  you'd  be  working  hard  on  some  kind 
 of  project  that  meant  a  lot  to  you 
 because  if  you  think  that  you  know  the
[54:40] dream  life  is  you  just  kind  of  retiring 
 and  having  enough  money  I  have  to  say 
 you're  quite  immature  and  foolish  not
[54:45] not  in  a  insulting  way  it's  just  because 
 you  haven't  experienced  life  anyone 
 who's  experienced  life  especially  as  a
[54:50] man  knows  if  once  you  make  a  [ __ ]  ton  of 
 money  and  you  can  pretty  much  retire  you 
 don't  because  it's  boring  as  [ __ ]  you
[54:56] need  some  kind  of  purpose  fulfillments 
 right  so  it's  like  this  already  was 
 going  to  be  the  the  dream  life  for  us
[55:03] and  we  can  have  it  today  we  can  have 
 something  that  we  can  work  hard  on  that 
 contribute  to  humanity  that  also  gets  us
[55:08] to  the  point  that  we  can  start  to 
 provide  for  our  families  a  year  or  so 
 ago  I  remember  being  on  Instagram  and
[55:14] there  was  an  Instagram  reel  of  like  a 
 basketball  player  who  was  like  um  you 
 know  saying  this  like  motivational
[55:19] quotes  and  he  said  those  days  where  you 
 wake  up  early  and  you  work  hard  those 
 days  when  you  stay  up  late  and  you  work
[55:25] hard  those  are  actually  the  dream 
 which  is  super  like  I  remember  watching
[55:30] that  I  think  that's  actually  so  true  my 
 Instagram's  I  don't  know  if  my 
 Instagram's  Linked  In  the  description 
 you  can  follow  me  if  you  want  I  don't
[55:35] even  post  on  it  but 
 um  and  it's  very  true  the  dream  is  not 
 the  subscribers  it's  not  the  car  it's
[55:40] not  the  number  in  your  bank  account  it's 
 just  working  on  something  that  actually
[55:45] means  a  lot  to  you  if  you  disagree  right 
 now  you  might  be  working  on  the  wrong
[55:50] thing  you  might  be  for  example  either 
 being  forced  or  you're  maybe  forcing 
 yourself  to  work  on  something  that  you
[55:56] don't  actually  care  about  you're  only 
 doing  it  for  the  external  validation  the 
 results  this  is  why  it's  very  important
[56:03] to  slow  down  for  a  second  and  you  know 
 your  response  to  everything  I've  been 
 saying  here  if  it  seems  kind  of
[56:08] depressive  of  like  oh  man  I've  got  to 
 work  hard  on  this  task  you  know  it's 
 going  to  be  [ __ ]  and  stuff  but  you  know
[56:13] maybe  I'll  eventually  make  money  it's 
 probably  the  wrong  thing  for  you  because 
 the  right  task  is  gonna  be  the  kind  of
[56:19] one  where  it's  still  super  difficult  but 
 you're  actually  thinking  man  a  life  of 
 me  waking  up  early  and  working  on  that
[56:25] that  would  actually  be  a  pretty  good 
 life  it  would  be  hard  and  of  course  I 
 want  other  parts  of  my  life  too  but  I
[56:31] would  actually  like  enjoy  that  like  that 
 would  be  good  for  me  that  would  be  good 
 for  the  world  oftentimes  many  young  men
[56:37] they  choose  the  work  they  choose  the 
 studies  which  they  don't  actually  feel 
 intrinsically  motivated  or  or  internally
[56:45] pull  towards  rather  than  you  just  choose 
 whatever  like  your  latest  red  pill
[56:50] influencer  has  been  telling  you  what  I 
 highly  suggest  if  you're  relating  to 
 this  right  now
[56:55] close  off  everything  for  a  little  while 
 and  just  kind  of  you  know  don't  use  your 
 phone  just  for  a  few  minutes
[57:00] and  just  kind  of  sit  silently  and  just 
 ask  yourself  what  do  you  really  want  and 
 question  that  and  maybe  Journal  it  and
[57:06] think  to  yourself  okay  where  have  these 
 desires  formed  into  my  mind  why  do  I 
 want  to  be  rich  and  just  it  sounds  like
[57:11] a  stupid  question  but  ask  it  and  you 
 won't  want  to  write  it  down  I  guarantee 
 you'll  be  too  much  of  a  [ __ ]  to  admit
[57:16] this  but  you'll  say  that  you  want  to  be 
 rich  just  because  Andrew  Tate  talked 
 about  being  rich  that's  it  that  was  the 
 only  reason  why  if  he  didn't  and  if
[57:22] other  people  didn't  you  the  concept  of 
 being  rich  might  have  never  formed  in 
 your  mind  because  that  wasn't  what  your
[57:27] purpose  was  supposed  to  be  as  a  man  you 
 hear  so  much  about  purpose  none  of  these 
 guys  online  know  about  purpose  purpose
[57:32] isn't  about  becoming  the  successful 
 high-level  man  who  wears  a  [ __ ]  shirt 
 pretends  he's  Andrew  Tate  does  the
[57:37] [ __ ]  [ __ ]  sign  and  then  smokes  a 
 cigar  that's  not  purpose  purpose  is 
 detaching  away  from  everything  being  in
[57:43] solitude  or  with  some  good  man  which  you 
 probably  have  not  even  met  just  yet 
 being  in  a  complete  Solitude  and  really
[57:48] investigating  the  reason  for  why  you 
 [ __ ]  exist  and  it  will  probably  not 
 be  related  to  anything  that  you  see
[57:53] these  guys  showing  you  these  male  role 
 models  showing  you  this  life  of 
 hedonistic  this  materialistic  degenerate
[57:59] showing  you  that  oh  here  I  I'm  in  Dubai 
 and  you  know  I'm  sleeping  with  lots  of 
 girls  but  you  know  if  a  woman  sleeps
[58:05] around  then  she's  a  hoe  but  I  can  sleep 
 around  you  know  she's  damaged  if  she 
 sleeps  around  but  I  can  damage  her  by  my
[58:10] course  the  Hustler's  University  you  know 
 people  are  [ __ ]  doing  this  [ __ ] 
 online  the  more  you  watch  that  kind  of
[58:15] content  or  content  in  general  the  more 
 that  your  brain  and  your  heart  will  be 
 polluted  with  weird  new  desires  that
[58:21] weren't  ever  your  own  you  must  spend 
 some  time  away  from  everything 
 and  detach  and  slow  down
[58:29] and  slowly  you'll  start  to  figure  out 
 what  you  really  want 
 but  you're  a  [ __ ]
[58:35] so  what  you  really  want  isn't  as  cool  as 
 what  Andrew  Tate  wants  and  you'll
[58:40] prioritize  his  desire  into  your  own 
 heart  and  mind  instead  of  your  own
[58:45] when  you  hear  about  this  concept  of 
 purpose  it's  all  about  finding  out  what 
 is  internally  right  for  you  and  so  many
[58:52] young  men  have  given  up  their  purpose  to 
 just  go  follow  the  desire  of  the  latest 
 celebrity
[58:58] it's  a  very  shameful  way  to  live
[59:04] perhaps  I  should  have  said  this  before 
 you  even  wake  up  early  before  you  know
[59:09] we  try  and  figure  out  this  frog  task  for 
 you  to  eat  the  Frog 
 we  have  to  make  sure  that  you're  on  the
[59:15] right  track  to  begin  with 
 this  will  come  from  making  sure  that
[59:20] there's  no  desires  that  are  external 
 there's  no  influence  by  these  other
[59:25] people  these  creators  this  validation 
 seeking  that  you  get  from  Instagram 
 it's  awesome  for  example  to  go  build
[59:31] your  your  body  it's  awesome  to  go  to  the 
 gym  and  train  hard  but  if  you're 
 training  hard  to  get  the  Instagram  Likes
[59:37] it's  probably  not  a  good  thing  if  you're 
 training  hard  to  get  more  likes  on 
 Tinder  like  I  was  for  a  very  long  time
[59:42] it's  probably  not  a  good  thing  if  you 
 detach  away  from  all  of  that  and  you 
 pretend  like  none  of  that  exists  and  you
[59:47] are  just  here  empty  in  this  room  for  a 
 few  minutes 
 you'll  start  a  really  like  question
[59:54] things  and  you'll  be  so  scared  of  doing 
 that  because  you  were  on  the  path  to 
 gain  validation  from  other  people  as  you
[60:00] you  know  you  started  to  fulfill  someone 
 else's  desires  the  truth  is  their 
 validation  is  [ __ ]  useless
[60:06] so  it's  valuable  for  you 
 as  an  extra  actionable  step  for  this 
 video  that's  unplanned
[60:12] spend  maybe  10  minutes  maybe  five 
 minutes  maybe  preferably  a  couple  of 
 days  zero  technology  zero  words  spoken
[60:20] from  your  mouth  to  anyone  else 
 pen  piece  of  paper 
 sit  there  look  at  your  wall  talk  out
[60:25] loud  and  ask  yourself  questions  of  like 
 why  do  I  desire  where  did  this  come  from
[60:30] no  no  I  know  that  Andrew  Tate  made  a 
 good  good  reason  but  like  where  did  it 
 come  from  it  came  from  a  tape  podcast  oh
[60:35] it  came  from  a  red  pill  podcast  yep  I 
 was  watching  another  one  of  those 
 useless  podcasts  with  the  angry  men  come
[60:40] on  and  they  Shout  at  the  the  women  for 
 being  hoes  and  then  the  same  men  talk  to
[60:45] those  women  afterwards  and  try  and  sleep 
 with  them 
 that's  where  my  desire  came  from  and
[60:50] that's  where  I'm  dedicating  my  life  to 
 when  you  say  it  out  loud  like  that  you 
 feel  like  a  [ __ ]  idiot  don't  you
[60:57] instead  your  desires  should  form  from 
 the  inside  and  they  should  be  related  to
[61:02] like  your  Soul's  purpose  here  on  Earth 
 this  is  how  you  get  into  spirituality 
 I'm  very  new  to  this  myself  but  I  think
[61:08] that  this  is  the  better  way  this  is  the 
 only  way  to  live  otherwise  you're  just 
 wasting  your  life
[61:14] because  we  know  that  achieving  these 
 external  things  we  know  that  that 
 doesn't  lead  to  happiness  or  fulfillment
[61:19] we  know  this  right  you  don't  even  need 
 me  to  like  question  this  we  know  for  a 
 fact 
 that  when  you  get  the  house  or  the  car
[61:25] that  every  rich  guy  says  this  when  you 
 buy  the  house  of  the  car  it's  like 
 nothing  going  what  look  at  the  video 
 Iman  moved  into  his  place  in  Dubai  look
[61:31] at  his  face  when  he  explains  yeah  like 
 he's  bored  the  take  buys  the  new  car  and
[61:36] he's  super  happy  driving  it  and  then 
 watch  how  he  talks  about  it  the  next 
 time  it's  like  it's  boring  when  you  get
[61:41] these  like  little  materialistic  toys 
 it's  boring  it  doesn't  add  anything  to 
 your  life  and  imagine  sacrificing  a  year
[61:47] of  your  life  for  that  little  [ __ ] 
 like  Smile  as  you  drive  in  this  car  that 
 you've  you've  wasted  like  a  year  of  your
[61:53] life  you  haven't  hugged  one  of  your  like 
 family  members  for  a  while  like 
 instead  very  important  detach  figure  out
[62:00] your  real  purpose  figure  out  your  real 
 desires  I  know  that  this  is  going  off 
 topic  here  I  probably  should  have
[62:05] mentioned  I  should  mention  this  almost 
 every  video  because  there's  no  point  in 
 living  if  you're  on  someone  else's 
 trajectory  there's  a  few  quotes  that  I
[62:11] really  like  days  are  made  of  mornings 
 and  lives  are  made  of  days
[62:17] in  the  morning  win  at  life 
 I  really  think  that's  the  case  if  you
[62:22] start  your  day  with  an  awesome  morning 
 morning  routine  hard  work  the  specific
[62:27] task  that  means  a  lot  to  you  which  is 
 super  hard  to  do  and  you  just  do  it  to 
 the  best  that  you  can  not  expecting  it
[62:32] to  be  perfect  struggling  with  it  losing 
 your  attention  but  just  you  know 
 sticking  to  it  doing  it  anyway  doing  it
[62:37] anyway  waking  up  early  every  single  day 
 doing  that 
 you're  starting  each  day  perfect  that
[62:43] usually  translates  into  a  way  better  day 
 than  you  know  where  you  can  up  late  or 
 anything  and  your  whole  life  is  just
[62:49] made  up  of  these  days 
 so  it  sounds  weird  but  like  the  way  to 
 live  a  good  life  is  just  to  have  like  a
[62:56] good  morning  routine 
 there's  a  lot  of  power  in  that  so  an 
 actionable  step  for  you  right  now  is  to
[63:03] add  on  to  your  habit  tracker  something 
 like  either  wake  up  early  or  eat  the 
 Frog  I've  just  wrote  eat  the  Frog  oh
[63:08] I've  got  both  I've  got  5am  and  I've  got 
 eat  the  Frog 
 and  this  way  you're  gonna  hold  yourself 
 accountable  and  if  you  stuck  this  up  on
[63:15] your  wall  it's  very  obvious  you  can't 
 escape  it  so  that's  why  I  love  sticking 
 up  these  papers  like  this  on  my  wall
[63:20] this  is  the  route  to  self-mastery  it's 
 allocating  time  to  the  hardest  task  you
[63:27] could  possibly  be  doing  and  usually  that 
 means  waking  up  early  which  is  such  a 
 blissful  experience  and  I'm  actually
[63:32] excited  for  you  if  you  haven't  already 
 to  get  into  this  step  3.2  excellence  in
[63:38] all  areas  if  you're  okay  with  dust 
 piling  up  on  your  desk  then  you'll  be 
 okay  with  tasks  piling  up  in  your  to-do
[63:45] list  if  you're  okay  with  leaving  things 
 out  of  place  then  you'll  probably  be 
 okay  with  setting  an  email  with  a
[63:51] spelling  mistake  if  you're  okay  with 
 leaving  the  gym  before  you've  actually 
 finished  your  workout  you'll  be  okay
[63:57] with  cutting  Corners  in  your  studies  or 
 your  work  and  the  results  that  you  get
[64:02] in  life  will  show  but  more  than  that  you 
 will  know  you  will  know  that  you  are  a
[64:07] messy  room  kind  of  entrepreneur  I 
 learned  of  this  concept  of  excellence  in
[64:12] all  areas  from  an  entrepreneur  called 
 some  ovens  he  has  a  YouTube  channel  you
[64:17] can  just  go  search  for  some  ovens  and 
 he's  recently  made  this  platform  like 
 this  online  Community  website  called
[64:22] school.com  that's  where  I  host  to  my 
 business  as  well  and  he  ended  up  just 
 like  in  one  random  video  of  his  he
[64:29] showed  that  he  had  principles  for  his 
 like  previous  business  like  the  kind  of 
 guidelines  and  rules  and  mindset  that
[64:36] everyone  in  his  business  was  following 
 and  one  of  them  was  excellent  excellence 
 in  all  areas  they  won't  cut  corners  and
[64:42] I've  been  inspired  by  that  since  and 
 that's  something  that  I  want  to  get  into 
 myself  Excellence  not  in  just  the  work
[64:49] that  you  produce  or  the  videos  that  you 
 make  here  but  excellence  in  for  example 
 the  form  that  you  have  in  your  workouts
[64:55] in  the  gym  excellence  in  your  diets 
 excellence  in  the  the  way  you  hold  eye
[65:00] contact  when  you're  speaking  to  your 
 loved  ones  it's  without  a  doubt  that  the 
 students  who  are  well  hydrated  they've
[65:06] got  good  diets  they  go  to  sleep  on  time 
 will  get  better  grades  than  the  students 
 who  stay  up  late  on  Tick  Tock  who  refuse
[65:13] to  drink  water  because  they  don't  like 
 the  taste  of  it  that's  obvious  it's 
 common  sense  and  yet  people  miss  this
[65:19] out  this  is  undeniable  we  know  this 
 because  these  are  the  people  who  have 
 got  their  life  in  order  trying  to  get
[65:25] better  grades  when  you're  dehydrated  or 
 trying  to  make  more  money  from  your 
 business  when  you  don't  even  make  your 
 bed  every  morning  or  trying  to  make
[65:31] gains  in  the  gym  when  you  refuse  to 
 improve  your  diet  and  you  keep  eating
[65:36] sugar  that's  obvious  it's  common  sense 
 it's  basic  but  a  lot  of  people  miss  the 
 basics  and  you  might  be  one  of  them  if
[65:41] for  example  you're  a  guy  who's  always 
 well  hydrated  there's  probably  another 
 area  of  life  that  you're  not  even
[65:46] hitting  the  basics  on  just  yet  maybe 
 your  form  in  the  gym  if  you're  just 
 being  honest  maybe  your  form  in  the  gym
[65:51] is  [ __ ]  it  could  be  have  you  ever  had  a 
 personal  training  session  to  have 
 someone  else  like  a  professional
[65:56] evaluate  your  form  have  you  ever  trained 
 with  someone  who's  got  10  years  of 
 experience  have  you  ever  even  like  sat
[66:01] down  and  watched  50  different  videos  on 
 how  to  like  bench  press  correctly  how  to 
 increase  your  squat  form  and  everything
[66:07] all  of  this  this  pursuit  of  becoming 
 excellent  comes  down  to  just  your
[66:12] mindset  of  setting  higher  standards  than 
 you  have  done  previously  so  again  this 
 is  something  that  you  can  do  you  can
[66:17] look  around  your  room  and  just  think 
 okay  what  could  I  slightly  increase  the 
 standards  of  a  lot  of  it  for  a  lot  of
[66:22] people  is  cleanliness  and  you  can 
 increase  the  standards  there  maybe  you 
 can  increase  the  standards  slightly  of
[66:27] the  clothes  you  wear  or  the  hair  that 
 you  keep  the  way  that  you  groom  yourself 
 a  lot  of  young  guys  including  myself
[66:32] kind  of  let  ourselves  go  with  a  little 
 bit  of  laziness  so  booking  in  a  haircut
[66:37] once  a  week  or  two  weeks  and  with  this 
 new  mindset  okay  I'm  gonna  have  higher 
 standards  for  my  appearance
[66:44] that  will  translate  to  higher  standards 
 in  your  work  step  3.3  perfectionism  is
[66:51] simply  a  lack  of  discipline  I  spoke  to  a 
 lot  of  people  who  suffer  with 
 perfectionism  they  want  it  to  be  just
[66:56] rights  they  want  to  wait  months  or  Years 
 to  you  know  do  something  that  should 
 take
[67:01] maybe  a  couple  of  days 
 and  I  speak  to  a  lot  of  guys  who  want  to
[67:06] become  YouTubers  maybe  they've  been 
 inspired  by  seeing  like  my  YouTube 
 channel  growth  and  they  always  ask  me
[67:12] these  [ __ ]  questions 
 you  know  should  it  be  like  this  video  or
[67:17] this  one  sure  how  about  this  this  idea 
 or  this  one  this  one  or  this  one  this 
 like  you  know  they're  just  like 
 literally  just  jumping  around  from  idea
[67:23] to  idea  and  I  always  just  ask  how  many 
 videos  have  you  posted 
 and  the  most  common  answer  that  I  get  is
[67:30] zero 
 here  we  have  a  young  man  who's 
 overthinking  to  such  a  crazy  level
[67:35] thinking  wait  should  his  videos  be  like 
 this  or  like  this  like  this  and  he's
[67:40] made  zero  videos  so  he  doesn't  even 
 understand  this  is  like  a  fat  guy  sat
[67:45] here  saying  no  no  I  won't  go  to  the  gym 
 until  I've  got  The  Perfect  Workout 
 routine
[67:50] how  do  you  think  you'll  find  The  Perfect 
 Workout  routine  you  go  so  I  always 
 always  every  time  I  meet  a  perfectionist
[67:56] I  always  relate  them  to  a  fat  man  you're 
 the  exact  same  it's  just  a  lack  of 
 discipline  the  fat  guy  who  doesn't  go  to
[68:02] the  gym  because  he  doesn't  know  exactly 
 what  The  Perfect  Workout  routine  is 
 going  to  be  is  the  exact  same  as  the
[68:07] little  skinny  fat  nerd  with  the  skinny 
 neck  who's  saying  that  he  won't  make  his 
 YouTube  video  right  now  who's  saying
[68:12] that  he  won't  produce  this  work  right 
 now  or  he  won't  release  it  just  yet 
 because  it's  not  good  enough  it's  not 
 perfect  this  just  comes  down  to  a  lack
[68:18] of  discipline  it  comes  down  to  arrogance 
 and  narcissism  there's  a  weird 
 Counterpoint  here  where  we  want  you  to
[68:24] have  high  standards  but  we  don't  want  it 
 to  be  stupid  for  example  your  first 
 video  that  you  post  onto  YouTube  is
[68:29] probably  gonna  be  trash  now  if  you're 
 some  professional  guy  you're  30  years 
 old  and  you  can  invest  in  a  really  high
[68:35] quality  team  and  you're  already  a  great 
 speaker  then  it's  going  to  be  different 
 but  if  for  example  you're  a  young  guy 
 and  you  don't  have  much  experience
[68:41] you're  not  really  that  great  at  speaking 
 or  anything  you  don't  have  like  a 
 fantastic  team  or  even  a  camera  you're
[68:47] just  using  your  phone  your  first  video 
 is  gonna  be  kind  kind  of  trash  and 
 that's  okay  but  then  having  high
[68:53] standards  would  mean  okay  well  the  next 
 video  I  make  I'm  gonna  try  and  do  one 
 thing  that's  slightly  better
[68:59] having  high  standards  could  mean  okay 
 I'm  going  to  make  sure  that  in  my  videos 
 I  don't  waste  that  much  time  because  you
[69:06] know  a  lot  of  new  YouTubers  they'll 
 press  record  and  they'll  waste  20 
 seconds  30  seconds  just  getting  to  it
[69:11] this  is  the  way  to  increase  standards 
 but  whilst  destroying  perfectionism  just
[69:16] know  that  they'll  always  be  more  things 
 that  you  can  add  into  something  always 
 there  will  always  be  more  that  you  can
[69:22] add  in  that  isn't  the  skill  this  is 
 where  perfectionists  get  stuck  they're 
 always  just  trying  to  add  more  into
[69:28] something  think  that  they  can  make  it 
 better  how  exactly  do  you  use  discipline 
 to  overcome  perfectionism
[69:33] you  find  a  perfectionist  body  kind  of 
 like  an  accountability  partner  but
[69:38] another  guy  who  also  has  these  feelings 
 of  perfectionism  and  you  join  together
[69:43] because  generally  we  have  perfectionism 
 in  ourselves  but  we  can  kind  of 
 rationally  see  for  someone  else  because
[69:49] you  know  perfectionists  can't  see  it  in 
 themselves  they  think  that  it's  still 
 not  good  enough  they  think  that  it's  not
[69:54] ready  to  be  released  but  if  a 
 perfectionist  meets  another 
 perfectionist  they  can  kind  of  help  each 
 other  in  a  weird  way  where  they  both
[70:00] relate  to  the  feeling  that  they  have  and 
 they're  able  to  convince  each  other  well 
 and  so  your  actionable  step  is  to  go
[70:05] down  to  the  comments  right  now  and  go 
 search  for  your  own  perfectionist  slash 
 procrastination  buddy  and  if  you  really
[70:11] want  to  take  action  then  write  your  own 
 comments  and  then  people  can  reply  to 
 you  maybe  you  can  put  your  Discord
[70:16] username  so  people  can  add  you  you  can 
 say  like  I'm  looking  for  a  perfectionist 
 body  this  is  the  thing  that  I  think  I've 
 got  perfectionist  on  oh  you  know  I
[70:22] procrastinate  on  this  task  because  I 
 keep  expecting  it  to  be  perfect  if 
 anyone's  similar  has  my  Discord  has  my
[70:27] email  address  or  something  everyone 
 spamming  in  the  comments  will  also  help 
 the  algorithm  pick  up  this  video  so
[70:32] that's  a  win-win  if  you  are  interested 
 in  all  of  the  entrepreneur  stuff  I've 
 just  spoke  about  like  finding  your  dream 
 business  and  you  want  my  advice  with
[70:38] that  and  you  want  to  join  like  this 
 online  community  Adonis  school  is  the 
 place  to  be  and  that's  the  top  Link  in
[70:43] the  description  step  four  discipline  in 
 health  and  fitness  this  is  the  most 
 common  place  where  young  men  can  use
[70:49] discipline  to  improve  their  lives  go  to 
 the  gym  and  eat  right  eat  clean  even
[70:55] when  you  don't  feel  like  it  it  is  really 
 going  to  the  gym  and  hitting  workouts 
 that  is  usually  most  young  men's  like
[71:01] first  taste  of  discipline  it's  first 
 taste  of  feeling  like  quite  masculine 
 and  you  know  doing  something  even  though
[71:06] you  don't  feel  like  it  doing  it  even 
 though  it's  hard  doing  it  especially 
 because  it  is  hard  and  there's  four
[71:11] major  benefits  to  being  disciplined  when 
 it  comes  to  Fitness  number  one  it's  the 
 concept  of  Hard  Times  create  strong  men
[71:17] you've  probably  heard  of  the  cycle 
 before  Hard  Times  create  strong  men 
 strong  men  create  good  times  good  times
[71:23] create  weak  men  weaker  men  create  Hard 
 Times  wherever  we  are  in  the  cycle  right 
 now
[71:28] I  mean  I  think  we  know  where  we  are  the 
 hard  times  are  pretty  much  here  for  a
[71:33] lot  of  countries  and  it  will  get  worse 
 and  worse  like  we're  talking  potentially
[71:38] Decades  of  like  the  Dark  Ages  on  the 
 other  hand  there  might  actually  be  the 
 biggest  sort  of  resurrection  of  good
[71:44] times  as  fast  as  possible  that  we've 
 ever  seen  in  history  because  of 
 Technology  because  of  AI  like  who  knows
[71:49] where  it's  going  to  go  right  now  it  does 
 seem  to  be  the  case  that  we  are  like 
 entering  the  hard  times  which  means  that 
 if  you  are  a  strong  man  you  will  be  able
[71:56] to  ride  this  wave  that  we're  going 
 through  but  weak  men  won't  weak  men  are 
 coming  every  single  day  to  more  of  these
[72:02] addictions  whereas  some  men  are  getting 
 stronger  even  though  the  times  are 
 getting  harder  it's  hard  right  now  like
[72:08] for  example  I  live  in  the  UK  it's  hard 
 for  an  average  man 
 to  be  able  to  feed  his  family  because  of
[72:14] the  cost  of  living  crisis  that  you  know 
 he's  not  making  much  money  the  weak  men 
 will  just  kind  of  struggle  with  that  and
[72:20] just  keep  struggling  and  complaining  and 
 ask  for  handouts  the  strong  man  will 
 figure  out  extra  ways  that  he  can  make
[72:25] money  and  become  more  capable 
 it's  how  you  use  the  situation  around
[72:30] you 
 and  going  to  the  gym  interestingly  will 
 help  you  with  this  it  will  develop  you
[72:36] into  a  strong  man  because  you're  pulling 
 yourself  through  hard  times  now  I've  got 
 to  make  a  disclaimer  a  lot  of  guys  will
[72:43] not  get  this  benefit  because  for  a  lot 
 of  people  including  like  Fitness 
 influences  and  everything  the  two
[72:50] they're  too  relaxed  they're  too  easy 
 like  you  know  that  their  workout  routine
[72:55] their  their  diet  when  you  I  see  like 
 every  now  and  then  I'll  see  a  video  from 
 a  fitness  influencer  and  he's  having
[73:01] like  200  grams  of  sugar  a  day  he's 
 eating  like  protein  pancakes  and  he's 
 put  little  like  [ __ ]
[73:06] um  chocolate  spread  over  it  or  something 
 like  is  this  the  level  of  discipline 
 we've  got  to  this  is  this  is  the
[73:11] Pinnacle  of  health  is  these  Fitness 
 YouTubers  who  are  literally  showing  you 
 like  oh  look  at  me  I'm  having  a  snack
[73:16] I'm  having  loads  of  sugar  and  stuff  like 
 bro  like  I  said  before  100  if  you  want
[73:21] to  go  out  for  like  a  nice  tree  every  now 
 and  then  100  I  love  to  do  that  as  well 
 so  you  know  I'm  not  I  don't  have  like  a
[73:27] 100  perfect  diet  this  is  the  Pinnacle  of 
 Health  these  days  this  is  like  Fitness 
 influences  20  years  ago  it  was  you  know
[73:32] okay  way  out  the  whites  rice  the 
 broccoli  the  chicken  maybe  a  little  bit
[73:37] too  extreme  and  now  it's  these  guys  who 
 are  like  doing  10  000  calorie  challenges
[73:42] because  all  the  the  disgusting  people 
 just  watch  that  content  it  should  still 
 feel  hard  today  if  you  really  want  to
[73:49] level  up  if  you  really  want  to  get 
 stronger  it  should  be  relatively  hard 
 like  like  I'm  speaking  directly  to  the
[73:55] guys  who've  been  training  for  years  now 
 remember  when  you  first  started  in  the 
 gym  and  how  [ __ ]  hard  it  was  remember
[74:00] how  sore  your  muscles  got  in  that  first 
 ever  like  arm  workout  that  you  did  you 
 know  the  first  time  that  you  did  a  bunch
[74:05] of  bicep  curls  and  the  next  day  you 
 couldn't  even  straighten  your  arm  and 
 you  felt  the  same  way  about  your
[74:10] hamstrings  and  everything  right 
 that  was  a  hard  workout  that  built  you 
 strong  these  days  we  do  a  full  workout
[74:15] and  afterwards  we  could  work  out  again 
 because  even  though  our  workout  is  like
[74:20] you  know  harder  than  it  was  before  our 
 capabilities  have  risen  so  we're  no
[74:25] longer  even  in  that  level  where  we're 
 challenging  ourselves  and  becoming 
 stronger  the  same  with  dieting  remember
[74:31] the  first  time  that  you  started  to 
 dieting  you  the  first  time  you  really 
 made  some  progress  in  dieting  how  like
[74:36] hard  it  kind  of  felt  remember  how  much 
 you  used  to  think  about  this  concept  of 
 eating  less  calories  and  eating  cleaner
[74:41] and  it  would  like  literally  almost  feel 
 like  a  full-time  job  and  these  days  I 
 might  feel  like  way  easier  you're  just
[74:46] not  used  to  it  that  means  that  sure 
 you're  rinsing  out  the  current  benefits 
 but  you're  not  growing  anymore  you're
[74:51] not  getting  any  stronger  right  now  maybe 
 you  don't  need  to  maybe  you're  already  a 
 super  strong  man  chances  are  you're
[74:56] probably  not  because  I'm  not  I've  still 
 got  a  lot  like  a  long  way  to  go  and  if 
 you're  sat  here  like  learning  from  me
[75:02] and  I'm  telling  you  as  your  teacher  that 
 I've  got  a  long  way  to  go  I  think  you 
 should  slap  your  ego  and  think  you  know
[75:07] what  I  probably  do  as  well 
 so  your  diet  and  your  training  should 
 feel  hard  today  I  know  that  I'm  doing
[75:13] this  right  when  I'm  in  the  gym  and  I 
 really  want  to  go  home  but  I  have  to 
 like  really  like  fight  to  stay  there
[75:19] whereas  I've  had  a  lot  of  workouts  over 
 the  last  few  years  where  I've  just  kind 
 of  you  know  I've  just  done  it  yeah  it's
[75:25] hard  you  know  when  you're  pressing  the 
 weight  and  you're  close  to  failure  it 
 feels  hard  but  all  in  all  it  doesn't 
 like  it's  not
[75:31] 10  out  of  10  difficult  it's  kind  of  like 
 fun  going  to  the  gym  but  these  days 
 recently  just  very  recently  only  for  a
[75:36] few  days  I've  literally  been  in  the  gym 
 and  been  like  exhausted  and  tired  and  it
[75:41] really  reminds  me  of  when  I  first  used 
 to  go  to  the  gym  and  like  you  couldn't 
 wait  to  almost  like  leave  like  it  was 
 fun  but  it  was  super  tiring  and  the  same
[75:47] with  my  diet  I  had  to  restrict  it  to  the 
 next  level  now  that  now  it  feels  like
[75:52] like  kind  of  like  how  it  was  when  I  was 
 a  beginner  and  I  can  see  the  progress 
 that  I'm  making  it's  like  I  keep  feeling
[75:58] this  weird  Blissful  feeling  which  is 
 like  I  can  genuinely 
 understand  the  concept  of  potential  of
[76:06] self-mastery 
 because  most  people's  fitness  journey 
 and  you  know  the  journey  to  be
[76:11] disciplined  looks  like  this 
 like  that  like  a  start  and  they  get  you 
 know  loads  of  progress  they're  being
[76:16] really  disciplined  but  then  out  of 
 nowhere  it  just  starts  to  level  off  and 
 they  just  kind  of  stay  comfortable  here
[76:21] even  the  guys  who  consistently  go  to  the 
 gym  if  you've  been  going  to  the  gym  for 
 a  few  years  I  guarantee  you've  been
[76:26] pushing  out  guarantee  that  even  though 
 the  gym  like  you've  been  going 
 consistently  and  the  gym  feels  kind  of
[76:31] hard  guarantee  that  you're  not  like 
 progressively  overloading  not  just  set 
 by  set  but  just  kind  of  workouts  in
[76:37] month  by  month  of  like  you  know 
 restricting  your  diet  more  getting  bit  a 
 little  bit  more  extreme  in  your  training
[76:42] and  people  can  say  oh  well  you  know  this 
 is  you  know  restrictive  diets  don't  work 
 and  stuff  yeah  for  [ __ ]  of  course
[76:47] they  don't  for  shallow  breathers  of 
 course  they  don't  but  for  Superior  men 
 men  who  want  to  become  strong  this  is
[76:53] the  trajectory  it's  like  every  single 
 month  you  slightly  increase  the  level  of
[76:58] discipline  that  you  need  for  your 
 activities  most  guys  stopped  one  year 
 into  going  to  the  gym  and  they  just  kind
[77:04] of  like  maintain  that  level  you  know  if 
 you've  been  finding  that  you're  not 
 making  as  much  gains  recently  and  we  all
[77:09] blame  it  on  like  yeah  you  know  it's  Noob 
 games  you  make  a  lot  of  muscle  when  you 
 first  stop  and  you  don't  make  much  after
[77:14] that  maybe  but  maybe  you've  just  been 
 posting  out  maybe  you're  not  putting  in 
 the  same  level  of  discipline  relative  to
[77:20] when  you  first  started  because  I 
 remember  when  I  first  started  and  I 
 found  it  incredibly  difficult  to  diet
[77:26] and  to  train  and  then  for  years  it  was 
 way  easier  because  my  skill  level  had
[77:32] went  up  but  I  wasn't  challenging  myself 
 anymore 
 so  if  you  want  like  a  little  idea
[77:39] for  example  start  adding  in  some  cardio 
 maybe  you  already  do  some  go  and  track 
 your  cardio  and  do  a  hundred  calories
[77:46] every  single  day  for  the  rest  of  your 
 life  and  every  time  you  get  onto  your 
 favorite  cardio  machine  to  hit  100
[77:51] calories  try  and  beat  your  score  from 
 last  time  like  your  your  time  for
[77:56] example  so  you  really  like  the  treadmill 
 for  example  and  it  takes  you  10  minutes
[78:01] to  hit  100  calories  today  tomorrow 
 you're  going  to  the  gym  and  you  try  and 
 get  it  in  9  minutes  and  30  seconds  then
[78:08] the  next  day  you  try  and  get  it  in  nine 
 minutes  then  randomly  then  you  know  one 
 day  later  you  end  up  getting  it  in  like 
 seven  minutes  and  it's  like  whoa  that's
[78:14] really  good  then  the  next  day  it's  like 
 eight  minutes  and  you're  really  trying 
 to  beat  the  seven  minute  again  but  you 
 know  that  was  quite  lucky  so  you  simply
[78:19] yourself  okay  I'm  gonna  be  you  know 
 progressively  overloading  I'm  going  to 
 be  smart  let's  try  and  get  it  on  average 
 like  eight  minutes  okay  eight  minutes
[78:25] then  750  and  you  you  start  playing  this 
 game 
 and  now  this  is  like  an  actual  level  of
[78:31] challenge 
 you're  there  sometimes  in  the  gym 
 feeling  like  oh  I  don't  want  to  do  the 
 100  calorie  thing  it's  stupid  Hamza  was
[78:36] just  you  know  saying  it  lightly  I  don't 
 want  to  do  it  that's  exactly  how  we  felt 
 when  we  started  going  to  the  gym  you
[78:42] wake  up  the  next  day  and  your  legs  are 
 sore  and  you've  got  that  like  pain  heavy 
 feeling  in  your  Chili's  tendons  and  your
[78:48] carbs  that's  exactly  how  it  felt  when  we 
 first  started  training
[78:53] now  you're  like  being  as  disciplined  as 
 you  was  back  then  relatively  and  you're 
 becoming  stronger  the  second  benefit  of
[78:59] being  disciplined  in  Fitness  is  the 
 physical  and  mental  health  that's  going 
 to  translate  over  to  better  work
[79:04] relationships  happiness  and  love  and  the 
 third  benefit  of  being  disciplined  in 
 Fitness  of  course  is  getting  into  shape
[79:10] Tristan  Tate  was  on  a  podcast  that  I 
 watched  a  little  while  ago  and  he  was
[79:16] asked  what's  like  the  number  one  tip  to 
 look  better  in  a  suit  and  he  ended  up
[79:21] saying  it  was  just  get  into  shape  it 
 wasn't  actually  about  the  suit  or  the 
 tailor  or  the  style  if  you're  in  shape
[79:27] you'd  look  good  in  clothes  or  without 
 clothes  finally  the  fourth  benefit  to 
 being  disciplined  in  Fitness  eventually
[79:33] it  becomes  fun  if  you  keep  going  and  you 
 have  this  playful  mindset  almost  like 
 you're  playing  a  game  you're  trying  to
[79:39] beat  your  high  score  and  you're  trying 
 to  you  know  get  the  high  score  for  the 
 bench  press  you're  trying  to  get  the 
 high  score  for  how  fast  you  can  burn  100
[79:44] calories  that  will  soon  turn  into  you 
 genuinely  just  enjoying  each  and  every
[79:50] gym  session  and  it  becomes  such  a 
 beautiful  enjoyable  and  and  important
[79:55] part  of  your  life  a  lot  of  the  guys 
 who've  been  going  to  the  gym  for  a  while 
 will  know  this  it  really  integrates  into
[80:00] your  personality  and  you  start  to  love 
 being  an  athlete  like  it  adds  to 
 yourself  image  that  you  are  this  healthy
[80:06] person  who's  able  to  delay  gratification 
 who's  able  to  you  know  think  for  the 
 future  who's  able  to  enjoy  the  hard  work
[80:12] the  exercise  the  sweat  the  discomfort 
 the  pain  the  sacrifice  right  now
[80:18] and  I  think  that's  beautiful  I  think  it 
 adds  a lot  of  flavor  to  your  life  step 
 4.1  destroying  depression  with
[80:24] discipline  there's  a  lot  of  people  these 
 days  who  feel  quite  depressed  and
[80:30] whether  there  is  such  a  concept  of 
 clinical  depression  or  not  I  actually 
 don't  know  which  I  know  sounds  stupid
[80:36] but  I  think  that  the  majority  of  people 
 who  have  depression  I  don't  think  it's
[80:41] this  like  weird  mystical  chemical 
 imbalance  that  they  might  need 
 medication  for  it's  in  my  belief  that  we
[80:47] feel  depression  when  we  don't  act  like 
 how  humans  are  supposed  to  act  now  you
[80:52] remember  being  a  child  and  how  playful 
 and  innocent  and  beautiful  the  world
[80:57] used  to  be  and  I'm  not  talking  about 
 being  a  teenager  but  I'm  talking  about 
 actually  being  like  a  pure  child 
 remember  when  you  used  to  climb  trees
[81:02] and  you  used  to  jump  over  puddles  like 
 remember  when  you  used  to  literally  just 
 lie  down  in  the  grass  and  you  just  kind
[81:08] of  like  look  at  the  individual  Blades  of 
 grass  and  you'd  see  tiny  insects  in  your 
 play  with  them  maybe  you'd  kill  them
[81:13] right  we  don't  do  that  as  adults  anymore 
 we're  so  focused  on  our  phones  on  our 
 computers  on  like  just  you  know  these
[81:20] desires  that  have  been  put  into  us  by 
 influencers  and  by  media  we're 
 constantly  thinking  about  sex  but  not  in
[81:25] like  a  loving  way  more  in  like  a 
 validation  like  you  know  obsessed  with 
 ejaculation
[81:30] so  we  left  this  like  shallow  life  this 
 dirty  shameful  life  as  adults  and  we
[81:37] wonder  why  we  don't  feel  like  happy 
 playful  children  anymore 
 so  a  lot  of  people  believe  that
[81:43] depression  is  something  that  they  can't 
 change  I'm  depressed  I  need  medication  I
[81:48] think  the  issue  from  my  understanding 
 with  medication  is  that  it's  not  going 
 to  cure  the  problem  there's  a  reason  why
[81:54] you're  depressed  the  medication  just 
 kind  of  masks  the  symptoms  and  kind  of 
 like  makes  you  feel  a  little  bit  better
[81:59] like  a  bit  more  mellow  today  you  know 
 anti-depressants  kind  of  take  off  the
[82:04] sort  of  extreme  High  and  the  extreme  low 
 and  so  you're  in  this  weird  gray 
 androgynous  Zone  and  I'm  not  sure  if
[82:09] that's  the  best  way  to  go  ahead  like  go 
 about  this  I  think  perhaps  a  better  way
[82:14] which  is  going  to  require  me  to  sound 
 like  a  [ __ ]  [ __ ]
[82:19] is  to  ask  you 
 why  you  deserve  to  be  depressed
[82:24] if  you  really  want  this  full  guide  to 
 help  you  and  if  you  really  want  to  make 
 some  progress  here  it  might  be  worth  for
[82:31] you  to  like 
 not  think  of  me  as  a  bad  person  when  I 
 say  that  and  for  you  to  ask  the  question
[82:36] to  yourself  maybe  write  this  down  and 
 you  know  write  this  as  a  note  or 
 something  and  to  answer  this  what  am  I
[82:42] doing  to  deserve  to  feel  depressed  it 
 sounds  like  a  horrible  question  I  can
[82:47] imagine  so  many  people  might  like  think 
 that  I'm  weird  or  I'm  a  bad  person  for 
 asking  you  this  I  personally  believe
[82:52] like  you  know  you've  tried  you've 
 listened  to  the  entire  world  just  listen 
 to  me  for  like  two  minutes  and  let  me 
 just  explain  my  mindset  you  can  just  try
[82:58] what  I'm  saying  right 
 I  personally  believe  that  we  deserve 
 most  of  what  happens  to  pretty  much
[83:04] everything  apart  from  like  extreme  freak 
 accidents  and  everything  like  that  right 
 and  I  believe  especially  when  it  comes
[83:10] to  things  of  how  we  feel  we  are  in  total 
 control  of  that  whether  or  not  we 
 realize  it  or  and  whether  or  not  we
[83:16] accept  it  and  so  I  believe  it's  more  of 
 an  empowering  thought  to  have  that  our
[83:21] emotions  are  simply  just  caused  by  our 
 actions  and  honestly  when  I've  started
[83:26] to  think  like  this  like  I've  started  to 
 think  okay  I  control  how  I  feel  in  life 
 I've  had  more  control  over  it  so  this  is
[83:32] what  I  want  to  give  you  this  gift 
 because  it's  one  of  the  best  things 
 that's  ever  happened  to  me
[83:37] this  is  gonna  maybe  sound  like  boasting 
 but  it's  not  even  in  the  kind  of  post 
 that  most  people  would  do  you  know  most 
 people  will  talk  about  their  money  in
[83:43] their  Fast  Cars  one  of  the  things  I 
 really  like  am  proud  of  and  I  could 
 boast  about  I'm  genuinely  like  quite  a
[83:50] happy  content  person  if  there's  10 
 people  sat  waiting  for  the  train  nine  of
[83:55] them  are  on  a  phone  and  I'm  the  10th  guy 
 who's  literally  happier  than  all  of  them 
 put  together  with  a  smile  on  my  face
[84:01] just  kind  of  like  looking  at  the  world 
 that's  the  kind  of  man  that  I've  become 
 now  and  I  promise  that  I  was  not  always
[84:07] like  this  this  is  because  I've 
 conditioned  my  own  mind  to  like  fight 
 for  my  happiness  my  joy  my  my  survival
[84:13] my  my  gratitude  and  presence  and  so  I 
 want  to  give  you  this  gift  this  this
[84:18] mindset  that  I've  had  if  you  ask 
 yourself  right  now  and  just  be  totally 
 honest  and  really  write  this  down  as  an
[84:23] actionable  step 
 write  some  notes  on  this 
 what  am  I  doing  to  deserve  to  feel
[84:28] depressed 
 just  write  bullet  point  some  some ideas 
 and  your  lizard  brain  might  pipe  up  and
[84:34] say  oh  you  know  nothing  it's  you  know 
 it's  just  what  my  doctor  told  me  it's 
 just  you  know  it's  it's  genetic  and 
 stuff  but  just  ask  yourself  you  don't
[84:40] even  need  to  you  don't  need  more  in 
 education  or  anything  just  ask  yourself 
 what  are  some  of  the  actions  I'm  doing
[84:45] that  probably  leads  to  this  and  you  Pro 
 you  could  probably  write  a  hundred  let's 
 just  be  honest 
 I  wake  up  late  I'm  sleep  deprived  I
[84:52] don't  drink  enough  water  I  wake  up  and 
 the  first  thing  I  do  is  grab  my  phone 
 even  though  I  shouldn't  I  watch  an 
 Andrew  huberman  podcast  where  he  said
[84:58] that  you  should  get  sunlight  in  the 
 morning  and  I  don't  do  it  I  wear  the 
 same  clothes  and  they're  dirty  and  they
[85:03] stink  but  I  just  throw  them  on  the  floor 
 then  I  put  them  back  up  and  I  put  them 
 on  I  have  no  respect  for  myself  I 
 haven't  groomed  in  a  while  I  missed
[85:09] quite  a  few  days  of  brushing  my  teeth  I 
 haven't  played  anything  other  than 
 stimulation  and  porn  and  destructive
[85:15] habits  I've  been  addicted  to  these 
 habits  for  a  very  long  time  and  I've 
 been  unable  to  quit  I  eat  a  very  poor
[85:20] diet  that  my  parents  probably 
 conditioned  me  to  eat  you  could  write  a 
 massive  list  of  reasons  what  of  actions
[85:25] that  you're  doing  which  are  contributing 
 to  you  not  feeling  good 
 now  please  try  this
[85:31] on  the  other  side  of  the  page  or  maybe 
 just  below  it  on  a  PC 
 right  what  activities  and  tasks
[85:39] was  I  doing  as  a  child  when  I  felt 
 really  happy
[85:44] and  if  you've  got  some  memories  you  can 
 just  replay  them 
 I  was  spending  time  with  my  brother
[85:50] we  would  listen  to  peaceful  music  and  we 
 would  play  Yu-Gi-Oh  like  a  card  game
[85:55] we'd  play  crickets  in  the  back  garden 
 and  would  make  up  games  where  one  of  us
[86:00] had  to  be  blindfolded  but  still  hit  the 
 ball 
 when  it  was  raining  outside  that's  when
[86:05] we'd  go  outside  to  play  cricket  so  that 
 it  was  just  kind  of  in  a  weird  way  more
[86:10] uncomfortable  but  also  like  kind  of  more 
 hardcore 
 would  practice  things  just  for  the  sake
[86:16] of  practicing  like  we  used  to  like 
 parkour  we  weren't  even  good  at  it  so 
 we're  literally  just  trying  to  like  jump
[86:21] over  fences  like  we  would  literally 
 spend  an  hour  trying  to  jump  over  a 
 fence  for  the  sake  of  just  trying  to
[86:27] jump  over  it  just  for  fun 
 I'll  spend  more  time  with  my  mother  and
[86:32] I'd  laugh  and  she'd  tell  me  stories  my 
 dad  would  teach  me  maths
[86:37] I  would  spend  way  more  time  playing 
 outside  with  my  friends  the  things  that 
 we  would  do  before  mobile  phones  was
[86:43] very  enjoyable  we  just  goes  like  parks 
 and  literally  would  just  jump  over  stuff 
 that's  why  childhood  was  just  about
[86:48] jumping  over  stuff  we  would  climb  trees 
 and  I'd  be  in  ore  as  my  dad  could  climb
[86:53] like  the  biggest  tree  ever  and  I  could 
 only  get  to  like  the  second  branch
[86:58] I'd  purposely  jump  into  a  muddy  puddle 
 and  get  it  all  over  my  shoes  and  you 
 know  my  mom  would  be  angry  at  me  but  it
[87:03] was  really  fun 
 would  go  on  adventures  which  was 
 literally  just  like  a  mile  away  from  our
[87:08] house  and  we'd  end  up  going  it's  like  a 
 random  field  and  like  make  up  stories 
 like  oh  yeah  this  is  where  the  homeless 
 man  lives  who  kills  kids
[87:15] innocence 
 like  pure  childish  joy  and  play
[87:23] what  makes  you 
 happy  what  makes  you  not  feel  depressed
[87:28] I'm  not  sure  if  it  changes  that  much  I 
 think  that  you  know  the  things  that  we 
 did  as  children  that  really  brought  us
[87:33] into  a  flow  state  that  made  us  super 
 happy  I  think  that  it's  specifically
[87:38] exactly  the  same  activities  right  now 
 but  it's  that  it  feels  kind  of  weird
[87:44] because  as  a  grown  adult  in  some  ways 
 like  it  shouldn't  but  in  some  ways  it 
 can  feel  a  little  bit  weird  or  awkward
[87:50] to  considered  the  idea  of  going  to  go 
 climb  a  tree  right  or  to  do  like  some  of 
 these  things  or  like  inviting  your
[87:55] friends  like  going  on  to  your  friend's 
 door  knocking  on  the  door  saying  hi  do 
 you  want  to  play  out  don't  bring  your 
 phone  let's  just  go  like  ride  our  bikes
[88:01] for  no  reason  no  hey  hey  bro  can  I  go 
 jump  over  stuff 
 right  there's  a  level  of  like  oh  no
[88:06] that's  not  what  that's  not  what  adults 
 do  you  know  this  age  like  yeah  we  can  go 
 to  the  gym  and  that's  kind  of  nice  but 
 that's  about  it  right  and  any  other  kind
[88:12] of  playing  is  just  online  these  days 
 it's  video  games  and  everything  right 
 but  I  have  an  actionable  step  just 
 something  peaceful  for  you  to  try
[88:19] take  one  activity  that  you  can  remember 
 that  you  used  to  do  as  a  child  that  used
[88:24] to  be  kind  of  fun  and  maybe  exhilarating 
 and  start  doing  it  today
[88:29] climbing  trees 
 like  when  was  the  last  time  you  climbed 
 a  tree  you  can't  feel  depressed  when
[88:35] you're  a  Pioneer  you  literally  just 
 can't  you  can't  feel  depressed  when 
 you're  on  a  tree 
 when  you  go  go  for  a  runoff  for  a  walk
[88:41] right  and  it's  been  raining  and  there's 
 a  puddle  on  the  floor  you  can't  feel 
 depressed  as  you  try  and  jump  over  the
[88:46] puddle  and  you  you  know  you  could  kind 
 of  laugh  at  yourself  because  you  didn't 
 make  it  and  you  got  it  all  over  your 
 shoes  you  can't  feel  depressed  when  that
[88:52] when  you're  doing  that  now  that's  only  a 
 few  seconds  and  then  strip  after  that 
 the  demons  will  come  back  okay  sure  but
[88:59] if  your  day  in  your  life  and  your  month 
 started  to  be  filled  up  with  these 
 little  micro  childish  habits
[89:04] as  they  used  to  be  as  a  kid  we  used  to 
 see  everything  like  a  game  used  to  see
[89:09] everything  like  a  challenge 
 that's  what  we  need  to  be  like  even  as
[89:15] adults 
 it's  only  I  wouldn't  say  Western  but 
 it's  only  in  these  like  like  these
[89:21] somewhat  modern  countries  where  people 
 think  that  to  be  an  adult  means  to  be
[89:26] like  this  stuck-up  person  who  maybe 
 doesn't  smile  so  much  unless  it's 
 socially  appropriate  who  acts  like
[89:31] everyone  else  who  doesn't  act  like  a 
 child  and  so  we  wonder  why  we  feel  so 
 bad  if  you  go  to  some  other  countries
[89:37] not  so  much  countries  but  if  you  go  to 
 especially  tribes  which  have  been  like 
 quite  Untouched  by  modern  civilization
[89:44] you'll  see  the  adults  will  literally 
 dance  for  like  an  hour  or  two  every 
 single  day  they'll  do  things  which  are
[89:51] fun  for  the  sake  of  doing  things  just 
 for  fun  you  can  almost  picture  right  now
[89:56] if  like  a  YouTuber  already  let's  say  if 
 I  did  like  a  vlog  with  some  like 
 African  tribe  you  can  imagine  the  kind
[90:02] of  ones  I'm  talking  about  where  they've 
 all  got  like  a  feathered  headdresses 
 they  make  them  they  spend  an  hour
[90:08] picking  like  feathers  from  chickens  and 
 whatever  dyeing  them  just  because
[90:13] they're  like  oh  yeah  you  know  there's 
 the  yellow  feather  and  the  that's  fun 
 for  them  then  they're  there  like  you're
[90:18] doing  that  they're  dancing  everything 
 and  they're  having  a  good  time  and  here 
 we  are  thinking  that  all  right  shouldn't
[90:24] dance  yeah  that's  awkward  I  feel 
 embarrassed  by  that  back  to  work  or  back 
 to  my  video  games
[90:32] so  I  invite  you  now  as  an  actionable 
 step  to  use  discipline  because  it  will 
 require  discipline  you  will  have  a  lot
[90:37] of  limiting  beliefs  about  this  to  think 
 nope  this  isn't  going  to  work  nope  this 
 is  going  to be  cringe  someone  might  see
[90:42] me  going  to  be  cringe  gonna  be  awkward 
 going  to  be  uncomfortable  I'll  go  back 
 to  my  video  games  Hamza  doesn't  know 
 what  he's  talking  about  depression  can't
[90:47] be  cured  maybe  you  could  be  thinking 
 that 
 but  remember  that  I'm  on  your  side  here
[90:52] and  if  your  brain  is  is  literally 
 arguing  against  he  like  us  and  it's
[90:57] saying  oh  no  no  we  can't  get  any  better 
 is  that  really  your  own  brain  or  is  that
[91:03] like  [ __ ]  evil  demonic  conditioning 
 that's  inside  of  you
[91:09] because  your  own  brain  should  argue  and 
 fight  for  you  shouldn't  it
[91:14] so  what  if  you're  you  can  just  manually 
 input  the  thought  into  your  brain  right 
 now
[91:19] it's  worth  a  try  I  I  remember  being  a 
 kid  and  climbing  and  doing  silly  stuff 
 and  it  was  always  fun
[91:25] yeah  I  could  go  try  it  and  maybe  you're 
 literally  starting  to  think  logistically
[91:31] of  where  you  could  go  around  your  area 
 okay  where  is  there  where  could  I  find  a 
 puddle  or  a  tree  to  climb  up
[91:38] the  easiest  way  to  start  in  a  way  that 
 doesn't  feel  awkward  like  at  all  which
[91:43] is  how  I  started  my  mental  health 
 Journey  was  long  distance  running  by
[91:48] long  distance  I  don't  even  mean  like 
 long  distance  for  me  long  distance  was 
 like  two  kilometers  or  something  but  it
[91:54] was  specifically  running  Outdoors  not  in 
 on  a  treadmill  but  Outdoors  specifically
[91:59] with  a  prioritization  of  Adventure 
 rather  than  just  running  and  calories
[92:06] and  heart  rate  so  what  I  mean  by  this 
 this  is  this  really  transformed  my 
 mental  health  and  I  thought  I  really
[92:11] hope  that  you  could  take  this 
 I  started  running  but  instead  of  me  just 
 trying  to  follow  you  on  the  route  and
[92:16] running  on  the  road  and  everything  like 
 normal  people  would  do  I  ran  with  cardio
[92:21] being  like  the  second  thing  I  was 
 running  for  the  first  thing  I  was 
 running  for  was  adventure  and
[92:27] exploration  so  I  would  specifically  and 
 purposefully  run  into  places  that  I  just
[92:32] wanted  to  see  so  you  know  I'd  like 
 imagine  okay  here's  the  here's  kind  of 
 like  the  road  that  everyone  would  be 
 running  around  like  you  know  this  big
[92:38] estate  where  I  live  okay  here's  the  road 
 everyone  just  runs  there  instead  of  just 
 following  the  same  road  as  everyone  else
[92:43] I  know  is  that  there's  almost  like  an 
 Alleyway  like  not  like  a  dirty  one  but 
 you  know  just  like  a  a  small  Road  or
[92:48] something  to  the  left  which  is  very 
 close  to  my  house  and  it  just  occurred 
 to  me  like  I've  never  been  in  that
[92:54] street  before  so  I've  run  down  there 
 it's  a  cul-de-sac  which  means  you  you 
 literally  just  have  to  run  back  out
[92:59] right  but  it's  kind  of  like  I  just  tuck 
 it  in  for  a  second  and  I  couldn't  help 
 but  to  imagine  you  know  the  game  Grand
[93:05] Theft  Auto  when  you  look  at  the  map  and 
 the  map  is  all  like  kind  of  blacked  and 
 dark  out  up  until  you  kind  of  Discover
[93:10] it  then  the  maps  got  light  and  I  could 
 don't  imagine  like  my  own  City  being
[93:16] like  that  like  this  dark  map  with  a  few 
 areas  really  brightly  lit  and  there's  a 
 few  dark  spots  like  quite  a  lot
[93:22] literally  so  close  to  my  house  where 
 I've  lived  for  so  long  which  I've  never 
 even  seen  because  we've  always  just
[93:28] thought  oh  yeah  well  you  know  it's 
 probably  the  same  but  our  eyes  have 
 never  even  witnessed  something  literally
[93:34] like 
 two  minutes  walk  away  we've  never  seen  a 
 specific  house  before  we've  never  seen  a
[93:39] specific  like  you  know  car  and  the  front 
 garden  before 
 there's  some  places  you've  not  seen
[93:44] which  are  literally  just  minutes  away 
 from  yours  and  if  you  allowed  this  like 
 fantasization  to  build  up  this  this
[93:49] feeling  of  wanting  to  explore  an 
 adventure  and  just  go  out  today  maybe  on
[93:54] a  run  for  the  purpose  of  literally  just 
 like  exploring  your  your  local  area 
 going  somewhere  new  and  almost  looking
[94:01] at  it  like  in  awe  not  focusing  100  on 
 the  run  but  you  know  getting  somewhere 
 and  like  looking  around  smiling  and
[94:07] seeing  okay  I've  never  seen  that  person 
 before  never  seen  that  house  before  oh 
 wow  I  didn't  realize  that  they  had  a  a
[94:12] big  oak  tree  here 
 this  is  what  we  used  to  do  as  children
[94:17] so  I  want  to  ask  you 
 when  was  the  last  time  your  shoes  got
[94:22] muddy 
 on  purpose 
 when  was  the  last  time  you  genuinely  on
[94:28] purpose 
 jumped  into  a  puddle  just  to  like  get 
 wet  and  dirty
[94:33] when  was  the  last  time  you  genuinely 
 went  out  and  had  a  snowball  fight
[94:39] or  that  you  climbed  a  tree
[94:44] and  you  know  if  you  think  that  this  is 
 lame  the  thing  is 
 big  Macho  successful  you  know  these
[94:51] these  masculine  men  that  you  see  online 
 they're  doing  it
[94:56] Andrew  Tate's  playing  with  his  daughter 
 and  he's  probably  like  goofing  around 
 with  her
[95:01] chuckle  willing  Bear  Grylls 
 David  Goggins  these  are  all  guys  who've
[95:07] got  long-term  Partners  who  are  playing 
 with  their  kids  every  day  and  probably 
 fooling  around  with  them  and  laughing
[95:12] and  playing  hide  and  seek  with  them  guys 
 who  have  got  [ __ ]  triple  hour  levels 
 of  testosterone  guys  were  literally  been
[95:17] like  military  and  successful  business 
 and  kickboxer  and 
 and  how  they  are  actually  playing  more
[95:22] than  we  are  because  we're  sat  here 
 trying  to  be  too  like  masculine  for  our 
 own  good  thinking  yeah  you  know  like  oh
[95:28] yeah  no  no  business  you're 
 when  the  best  businessmen  are  literally 
 playing  step  4.2  starting  the  gym  so  you
[95:37] can  skip  this  section  if  you've  already 
 consistently  in  the  gym  but  this  is 
 specifically  for  the  people  who  haven't 
 really  signed  up  for  the  gym  yet  or
[95:43] maybe  who  have  got  a  gym  membership  but 
 aren't  going  consistently  and  you're 
 trying  to  figure  out  okay  how  do  I
[95:48] actually  start  I  know  it  seems  like  a 
 like  a  simple  topic  of  literally  just 
 joining  the  gym  but  I  kind  of  needed  a
[95:53] guide  like  this  when  I  first  started 
 very  quickly  the  way  to  join  a  gym  is 
 that  you'll  go  onto  Google  Maps  or  onto
[95:58] like  just  Google  and  you'll  search  your 
 area  to  your  city  and  just  write  gym  and
[96:03] you'll  start  to  see  the  map  of  where  all 
 these  gyms  are  and  you  just  want  to  pick 
 the  one  that's  closest  to  you  see  it's
[96:08] opening  times  and  you  can  usually  just 
 literally  just  turn  up  and  you  can  buy 
 it  there  or  you  buy  it  on  the  website
[96:13] and  they'll  say  you  know  the  monthly 
 membership  the  yearly  membership  just  do 
 that  and  to  actually  get  started  in  the
[96:19] gym  a  lot  of  people  do  have  that  kind  of 
 perfectionist  mindset  of  like  you  know  I 
 don't  know  what  workout  to  do  yeah  maybe
[96:25] I'll  start  in  two  weeks  and  you  know 
 this  there's  a  lot  of  things  that  just 
 are  stopping  you  from  starting  right
[96:31] away  the  mindset  I  want  to  give  to 
 anyone  who's  in  this  position  is  you'll 
 never  be  100  ready  to  start  the  gym
[96:39] there's  always  going  to  be  another 
 thought  of  like  wait  I  need  to  wait  for 
 the  workout  clothes  wait  I  need  to  wait
[96:44] for  this  other  thing  I've  got  oh  no  I'm 
 not  feeling  it  no  this  thing  okay  I'll 
 start  after  that  trip  and  then  I'll  do
[96:49] this  I  don't  know  the  workout  routine  I 
 don't  know  if  it's  going  to  be  safe  I 
 don't  know  there's  going  to  be  always 
 these  thoughts  whether  you  start  today
[96:55] or  10  years  from  now  you're  not  going  to 
 feel  100  clear  with  going  to  the  gym
[97:01] you'll  only  feel  that  after  you've 
 already  been  to  10  or  20  workouts  so
[97:08] what  I  mean  by  this  is  you  specifically 
 need  to  start  going  to  the  gym  even 
 though  your  brain  isn't  100  convinced
[97:14] that  right  now  is  the  time 
 which  is  powerful  because  now  no  matter
[97:20] what  [ __ ]  your  little  lizard  brain 
 which  is  probably  more  of  an  enemy  than 
 a  friend  let's  just  be  honest
[97:25] it's  telling  you  you  can  just  go  anyway 
 literally  just  tell  yourself  like  well 
 I'll  never  be  100  certain  so  whatever
[97:30] bullshit's  telling  me  it's  like  just 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  I'm  gonna  sign  up  right 
 now  and  I'm  gonna  go  for  my  first
[97:35] workout  and  you  might  think  oh  well  you 
 know  what's  the  workout  you  don't  even 
 need  to  know  because  I  want  you  to  think
[97:40] about  the  concept  of  exposure  and  you 
 know  what  we've  just  talked  about with 
 um  destroying  depression  with  discipline
[97:46] and  that  concept  I  spoke  to  about  like 
 the  the  Grand  Theft  Auto  map  being  kind 
 of  blacked  out  up  until  you  experience
[97:52] something 
 the  exact  same  thing  is  true  with 
 exposure  to  like  how  the  gym  works
[97:58] because  right  now  it's  like  the  gym  in 
 your  mind  is  this  kind  of  like  black 
 kind  of  dark  Beast  that  you  can't  see
[98:03] you  can't  understand  it  but  the  first 
 time  you've  literally  signed  up  to  the 
 gym  you've  went  there  you've  walked
[98:09] around  the  gym  area  and  you've  like  you 
 know  you  just  coped  and  you  did  some 
 stupid  exercise  and  went  home  think 
 about  how  much  extra  light  you've  just
[98:15] added  to  the  whole  concept  of  going  to 
 the  gym  right  now  the  whole  concept  is 
 just  dark  and  that  this  is  why  you're
[98:21] making  no  progress  because  you're 
 thinking  how  do  I  make  it  perfect  for 
 but  you  don't  know  because  it's  all  dark
[98:26] you  need  to  get  a  little  bit  of  exposure 
 first  so  even  if  your  first  day  in  the 
 gym  is  literally  just  you  walking  around
[98:31] looking  at  all  the  different  machines 
 and  then  going  home  or  you're  not 
 literally  just  sitting  on  one  of  the 
 machines  and  just  coping  and  doing  like
[98:37] a  few  Reps  for  no  reason  that  literally 
 will  add  so  much  more  exposure  to  the 
 concept  of  the  gym  that  you'll  be  able
[98:43] to  go  again  more  often  so  I  highly 
 recommend  that  you  get  into  this  concept
[98:48] of  I'm  not  going  to  be  100  certain  so 
 whatever  [ __ ]  extra  excuses  My  Mind 
 Is  Telling  Me  especially  the  one  that  I
[98:54] think  like  right  in  here  right  now  you 
 understand  what  I'm  saying  but  another 
 one  has  popped  in  and  you're  like  okay
[98:59] sure  I'm  gonna  listen  to  times  it  but 
 after  this  one  because  this  is  a  really 
 important  one  no  no  it's  that  one  that
[99:05] will  keep  you  skinny  fat  or  fat  for  the 
 rest  of  your  life 
 okay  so  don't  listen  to  your  [ __ ]
[99:11] brain  because  how  many  times  have  I  told 
 you  this  is  the  exact  same  part  of  your 
 mind  that  convince  you  for  10  000  hours
[99:16] of  video  games  and  a  thousand  episodes 
 of  [ __ ]  fake  taxi  or  something  so 
 your  brain  can't  be  trusted  so  when  your
[99:22] brain's  popping  up  with  seemingly 
 logical  reasons  why  you  shouldn't  join 
 the  gym  or  go  for  the  first  workout
[99:27] right  now  it's  not  logical  it's  just 
 that  your  brain  is  has  been  conditioned 
 to  be  like  a  little  [ __ ]  so  ignore
[99:34] everything  that  your  brain  says  let's 
 sign  up  for  the  closest  gym  nearby  just 
 navigate  through  the  website  absolutely
[99:39] fine  and  literally  just  walk  into  the 
 gym  and  you  might  wonder  okay  what 
 exactly  should  I  do 
 for  your  first  like  real  workout  I  will
[99:46] literally  make  you  the  workout  routine 
 and  I'll  link  it  below  so  you  can  just 
 click  on  the  link  don't  overthink  it  and
[99:51] you're  gonna  say  Oh  either  just  click  on 
 the  link  there'll  be  like  a  strong  app 
 link  you'll  download  the  app  it's  all
[99:56] free  I  don't  make  money  from  this  or 
 anything  but  I'll  do  that  and  then  um 
 it'll  open  up  on  your  phone  once  you've
[100:01] downloaded  the  app  it's  a  very  very 
 simple  workout  then  what  what  you  need 
 to  do  is  just  know  that  you're  using  the
[100:08] right  form  what  this  means  what  form 
 means  it's  kind  of  like  your  Technique 
 so  it's  to  make  sure  that  you're
[100:13] training  in  a  safe  way  so  I'll  link 
 below  the  exact  form  videos  that  I've
[100:18] used  which  are  years  and  years  old  so 
 that  you  can  learn  how  to  do  exercises 
 safely  so  the  next  time  you  go  into  the
[100:24] gym  the  only  thing  that  you'll  need  is 
 your  phone  and  hopefully  some  internet 
 connection  like  your  internet  data  or
[100:29] maybe  the  gym  has  some  internet  go  into 
 the  gym  get  close  to  the  thing  that's  in
[100:34] the  workout  so  for  example  it's  bench 
 press  then  you  see  okay  the  bench  is 
 over  there  you  stand  over  to  it  go  at
[100:40] your  phone  click  on  the  video  that  I've 
 linked  below  and  you'll  learn  how  to 
 actually  do  that  exercise  safely  and 
 someone  will  literally  Show  You  On  video
[100:45] okay  this  is  how  you  rack  the  thing  grab 
 it  like  this  do  this  with  your  shoulders 
 and  then  you  go  and  perform  the  exercise
[100:51] at  a  very  like  low  weight  maybe  like  the 
 empty  bar  is  more  than  enough  for  most
[100:56] beginners  this  is  how  you  start  the  gym 
 you  go  back  to  the  gym  watching  the  same 
 videos  thinking  about  the  same  cues  that
[101:02] they've  said  trying  to  make  sure  it 
 feels  okay  and  hitting  it  again  and 
 again  and  again  eventually  you  probably 
 don't  even  need  like  the  form  videos  for
[101:08] those  specific  exercises  and  you  can 
 start  to  build  on  from  there 
 go  to  the  description  right  now  I've
[101:14] linked  that  stuff  you  can  go  get  it  for 
 free  I've  just  added  it  all  just  to  try 
 and  help  you  here  so  that  it  feels  like
[101:19] less  mentally  demanding  to  start  in  the 
 gym  because  I'm  very  grateful  that  my 
 brother  did  this  for  me  because  if  my
[101:25] brother  didn't  force  me  to  go  to  the  gym 
 and  if  he  didn't  force  me  to  like  follow 
 this  specific  routine  I  wouldn't  have  I
[101:31] just  would  have  been  you  know 
 information  overload  so  I  want  to  be 
 like  the  big  brother  for  you  and  just  be
[101:36] like  bro  just  shut  up  just  here's  the 
 routine  just  please  just  follow  it  and 
 then  you  know  a  month  from  now  two 
 months  from  now  you  can  change  it
[101:41] however  you  like  at  least  this  will  just 
 get  you  into  the  gym  and  once  you've 
 been  in  the  gym  and  you've  seen  it  20
[101:46] times  50  times  you  know  where  everything 
 is  and  you  know  that  area  of  your  of 
 your  mind  is  so  bright  that  now  it
[101:52] doesn't  feel  as  scary  anymore  what  I 
 will  say  is  if  you  can  afford  it  or  even 
 if  it's  slightly  too  expensive  but  you
[101:57] just  want  to  really  do  this  getting  some 
 personal  training  sessions  right  at  the 
 beginning  is  absolutely  one  of  the  best
[102:04] investments  you  can  make  10  out  of  10. 
 if  you've  got  someone  who  you  train  with 
 who  can  teach  you  fine  if  you've  got
[102:09] like  a  big  brother  who  knows  the  form 
 and  the  technique  fine  but  if  you  don't 
 have  anyone  and  you  can  afford  personal
[102:16] training  sessions  like  a  like  a  package 
 of  five  or  a  package  of  ten  or  something 
 it'll  be  like  a  hundred  dollars  two
[102:21] hundred  dollars  something  like  that  100 
 even  if  you're  feeling  kind  of  broke 
 right  now  100  just  like  save  up  for  it
[102:28] and  get  it  because  you  will  genuinely 
 make  so  much  faster  progress  if  you've
[102:33] had  five  hours  or  ten  hours  of  like  a 
 professional  who's  qualified  who's  got 
 years  of  experience  giving  you  direct
[102:40] instant  feedback  who's  already  made  the 
 plan  for  you  which  you  can  follow  even 
 after  your  time  with  them  and  he's  just
[102:46] giving  you  like  like  all  this  micro  bits 
 of  feedback  which  you  might  not  get  for 
 the  next  like  five  years  if  you  train  by
[102:52] yourself  so  it's  super  worth  it  at  the 
 start  to  just  invest  into  this  few 
 hundred  dollars  because  they'll  change
[102:57] like  the  trajectory  of  your  fitness 
 journey  forever  if  you  can't  afford  some 
 PT  sessions  like  I  couldn't  when  I  first
[103:03] started  just  keep  going  on  to  YouTube 
 and  searching  for  technique  videos  so 
 whatever  exercise  you  want  to  get  into
[103:08] you  can  just  educate  yourself  on  YouTube 
 for  free  step  four  point  three
[103:13] keep  skipping  workouts  if  you  find 
 yourself  constantly  skipping  your
[103:18] workouts  and  you  cope  and  you  make  a  lot 
 of  excuses  I'll  do  it  at  7  pm  then  7pm
[103:23] comes  around  and  you  don't  go  anymore 
 I'll  do  it  tomorrow  and  you  know  you  you 
 set  the  plan  to  go  maybe  three  days  a
[103:29] week  or  four  or  five  days  a  week  and 
 you're  not  just  messing  it  all  up  and 
 you  go  on  different  days  you  know  you're 
 very  inconsistent
[103:35] you  just  miss  days  entirely  it's  too 
 sore  you  know  all  these  reasons  to  not
[103:40] be  as  consistent  as  you're  supposed  to 
 be  in  the  gym  I  know  exactly  what  to  do 
 because  I've  done  this  by  the  way  I've
[103:45] been  going  to  the  gym  like  consistently 
 for  I  think  about  eight  or  nine  or  ten
[103:50] years  something  like  that  and  here  is  my 
 bicep  to  show  I  am  incredible  to  talk
[103:55] about  this  yes 
 so 
 this  is  exactly  what  worked  for  me  when
[104:01] I  was  a  lot  younger  and  way  way  less 
 disciplined  and  you  know  more  of  like  a
[104:06] Jeffrey  more  of  like  a  beginner  a 
 shallow  breather  where  I  was  um 
 missing  so  many  workouts  coping  eating
[104:13] [ __ ]  food  and  just  calling  it  a  cheap 
 day  you  know  I  was  all  over  the  place 
 but  I  was  able  to  get  discipline  in  the 
 gym  following  two  things  one  I  made  it
[104:20] easier  to  be  disciplined  to  consistently 
 go  to  the  gym  so  instead  of  just  relying 
 on  discipline  it's  awesome  if  we  can  use
[104:27] some  of  those  productivity  tactics  like 
 routines  and  schedules  so  that's  it's 
 just  kind  of  easier  and  more  motivating
[104:33] to  go  to  the  gym  so  what  this  means  is 
 set  a  schedule  to  go  to  the  gym  at  the
[104:39] exact  same  times  so  that  it's  in  a 
 routine  if  you're  trying  to  go  to  the 
 gym  somewhat  randomly  thinking  okay  when
[104:46] will  I  have  time  oh  man  I  forgot  to  go 
 to  the  gym  for  the  last  three  three  days 
 or  something  that's  going  to  be  super
[104:51] hard  to  get  consistent  but  if  you 
 already  just  spend  literally  just  two 
 minutes  right  now  you  can  pause  the
[104:56] video  just  spend  two  minutes  thinking 
 okay  what  would  be  a  great  time  for  me 
 to  go  to  the  gym  in  general  for  a  lot  of
[105:02] people  it  will  be  in  the  morning  maybe 
 before  work  maybe  before  school  or 
 something  or  maybe  like  a  little  bit
[105:07] afterwards  you  need  to  find  out  a  time 
 that  you  could  imagine  will  work  not 
 only  right  now  but  might  work  for  the
[105:14] rest  of  your  life  like  for  example  for 
 me  I  can  go  to  the  gym  for  the  rest  of 
 my  life  from  around  nine  to  about  12.
[105:20] that's  the  time  that  I  usually  go  to  the 
 gym  now  sure  there's  some  days  where  I 
 can't  right  now  it's  10  a.m  and  I'm
[105:25] still  recording  so  you  know  prioritizing 
 something  else  but  in  general  my 
 exercise  block  is  around  like  9  to  12
[105:31] ish  somewhere  around  that  and  that  works 
 for  me  I'm  energized  at  that  time  I
[105:36] enjoy  training  at  that  time  the  gyms  are 
 super  quiet  at  that  time  because 
 everyone's  in  work  so  that  works  for  me
[105:41] it'd  be  worth  it  for  you  right  now  to 
 figure  out  exactly  the  time  that  you 
 would  go  and  also  to  use  what's  called
[105:47] habit  stacking  this  is  something  from 
 James  clear's  book  Atomic  habits  which
[105:52] the  idea  is  to  put  the  gym  on  top  of  a 
 habit  which  has  already  been  formed  so
[105:57] for  example  every  day  you  wake  up  you  do 
 your  morning  routine  and  you  do 
 something  like  studying  or  something  and 
 you  go  to  the  gym  after  that  every
[106:03] single  day  so  it's  super  super 
 consistent  and  you  know  you  adjust  your 
 workout  routine  to  like  make  it  I
[106:08] personally  think  working  out  every 
 single  day  is  way  better  I  think  that 
 taking  days  off  starts  getting  too
[106:13] complicated  for  your  routine  and  it's 
 better  to  for  example  go  to  the  gym 
 every  day  for  45  minutes  than  it  is  to
[106:19] go  to  the  gym  three  days  a  week  for  one 
 and  a  half  hours  I  think  it's  so  much 
 better  to  go  every  single  day  because  it
[106:24] just  fits  with  your  routine  you  get  so 
 used  to  it  your  bag's  always  ready  you 
 know  you're  going  to  the  gym  at  the  same
[106:29] time  so  it's  always  there  super 
 consistent  so  I  would  say  if  you  can  try 
 and  stack  it  with  another  habit  you'll
[106:35] get  way  more  consistent  the  most 
 consistent  I've  ever  been  in  the  gym 
 it's  all  in  just  working  out  in  general
[106:40] is  when  I've  just  done  it  first  thing  in 
 the  morning  and  it  was  stacked  on  pretty 
 much  waking  up  brushing  my  teeth  having
[106:45] a  poop  and  then  just  literally  just 
 getting  my  my  earpods  in  and  stuff  and 
 then  just  go  into  exercise  straight  away
[106:51] once  you've  utilized  a  few  of  those 
 principles  to  try  and  build  like  a 
 routine  not  just  like  the  gym  routine 
 you  know  push-pull  legs  but  specific
[106:57] like  calendar  routine  going  every  single 
 day  at  9am  once  you've  utilized  some  of
[107:02] those  there's  one  discipline  mindset 
 that  I  want  to  teach  you  I  had  known 
 this  for  a  while  but  eventually  I  had  a
[107:08] conversation  with  a  Marine  like  a  royal 
 Marine  Commando  like  a  hardcore  guy  I
[107:14] hiked  up  a  mountain  everyone  else  has 
 hiked  up  this  mountain 
 I  saw  this  guy  climbing  up  like  scaling
[107:21] up  from  the  peak  side 
 so  whilst  everyone  else  you  know  one 
 step  okay  here  this  guy  was  like  hand
[107:28] like  climbing  like  this  like  from  a 
 steep  side  like  that  that's  when  I  saw 
 him  I  was like  whoa  it's  crazy  that's
[107:34] why  I  asked  him  you  know  what  he  does  we 
 ended  up  speaking  and  I  ended  up 
 speaking  to  him  on  a  podcast  which  is 
 very  old  we  can  have  a  look  if  you  just
[107:40] search  like  Hamza  Marine  Commando  he'll 
 probably  come  up  very  very  old  like  two 
 three  four  years  old  and  um he  ended  up
[107:47] telling  me  the  exact  same  thing  that  I 
 had  been  sort  of  following  in  my  mind 
 which  was  a  really  interesting  where  he
[107:52] said  it's  all  about  taking  it  one  step 
 at  a  time 
 instead  of  looking  at  the  entire  battle
[107:59] what  I  mean  by  this  is  when  we  don't 
 feel  like  going  to  the  gym  it's  often
[108:04] because  we're  thinking  about  how  big  and 
 scary  and  painful  and  uncomfortable  the
[108:09] entire  situation  is  let's  say  right  here 
 right  now  I'm  sat  here  in  my  shirts  you
[108:14] know  my  shorts  and  stuff  I'm  kind  of 
 cozy 
 if  I  think  about  the  hour  of  cardio  that
[108:19] I'm  gonna  go  and  do 
 I  might  start  to  like  not  want  to  go  to 
 the  gym  because  it  can  start  to  feel
[108:24] kind  of  like  like  hard  and  you  know  like 
 kind  of  exhausting  and  and  I'm  comfy 
 here  and  I  might  end  up  coping  I  might
[108:30] not  say  to  myself  yep  I'm  a  [ __ ]  I'm 
 not  gonna  go  today  not  many  people  are 
 that  humble  I  might  say  yeah  I'm  gonna
[108:35] go  today  but  yeah  I'll  go  I'll  go  after 
 you  know  I'll  get  it  I'll  have  a  coffee 
 first  I'll  do  that  call  I'll  do  this
[108:40] other  thing  and  I'll  go  after  I'll  go  at 
 2PM  instead  of  my  usual  time  I'll  go  you 
 know  we  start  pushing  it  off  because
[108:45] it's  this  big  scary  thing  when  actually 
 we  don't  need  to  go  and  do  the  500
[108:51] calories  of  cardio  that's  not  what  the 
 task  is  the  task  is  to  just  get  changed
[108:56] into  the  gym  clothes  the  next  task  is  to 
 like  get  our  water  bottle  and  our
[109:01] earphones  you  can  do  that  right  you  no 
 matter  how  tired  you  are  you  could  go 
 and  literally  just  grab  your  airpods  and
[109:06] put  them  in  right 
 the  next  task  is  to  put  on  your  music 
 you  can  do  that  no  matter  how  tired  you
[109:11] are  you  could  put  on  the  music  right  the 
 next  task  is  to  like  go  downstairs  and 
 put  your  shoes  on  again  no  matter  how
[109:16] tired  you  are  you  could  do  that  then 
 it's  to  leave  your  door  then  it's  to 
 walk  to  the  gym  then  it's  so  I  can  also
[109:21] do  the  warm-up  so  what  the  issue  is  is 
 that  we  are  seeing  the  gym  for  this  big
[109:26] beast  this  workout  which  is  you  know 
 huge  it's  long  it's  uncomfortable 
 especially  when  we're  in  a  state  of
[109:31] comfort  instead  of  seeing  the  specific 
 next  task  that  needs  to  be  conquered
[109:37] because  when  we  are  here  in  our  nice  you 
 know  quiet  cozy  environments  and  we 
 think  about  the  last  set  of  squats  it's
[109:44] like  our  brain  says  no  no  I  couldn't  do 
 this  couldn't  do  that  transformation 
 but  it  doesn't  need  to  because  we  just
[109:50] need  to  do  the  next  step 
 it's  one  step  at  a  time  how  do  you  hike 
 up  a  mountain
[109:56] one  step  at  a  time 
 so  that  idea  is 
 the  next  time  that  you're  supposed  to  go
[110:02] to  the  gym  but  you  start  coping  just 
 remind  yourself  of  this  like  one  step  at 
 a  time  mindset  remind  yourself  that
[110:08] right  now  your  brain  is  convincing  you 
 that  you  couldn't  do  this  massive  leap 
 to  the  gym  but  it's  not  about  the
[110:14] massive  leap  it's  just  the  individual 
 step  and  just  ask  yourself  it  sounds 
 kind  of  foolish  but  ask  yourself  could  I
[110:19] put  my  earphones  on  right  now  you'll  be 
 like  well  yeah  of  course  okay  I'll  stick 
 them  on  could  I  put  my  music  on  right
[110:25] now  yeah  of  course  I'll  put  it  on  one 
 step  at  a  time  and  before  you  know  it 
 you're  outside  of  the  gym  before  you 
 know  it  you're  inside  the  gym  before  you
[110:30] know  it  you're  warming  up  and  by  the 
 time  you've  warmed  up  and  you've  done 
 one  set  of  squats  it's  like  okay  well 
 you've  come  on  let's  [ __ ]  get  it
[110:35] you're  warm  you're  sweaty  you're  you're 
 actually  inviting  the  next  set  of  squats 
 now  you're  awesome  right  step  4.4  a
[110:42] disciplined  diets  I've  mentioned  in  this 
 video  that  you  see  a  lot  of  these  weak 
 modern  Fitness  influences  and  it's  it's
[110:48] a  shame  that  these  are  like  the  scene  as 
 the  Pinnacle  of  health  and  fitness  it's 
 these  guys  who  are  reading  sugar  200
[110:55] grams  of  sugar  a  day  it's  these  guys  who 
 are  making  anabolic  cookbooks  with 
 pancakes  and  you  know  it's like  it's
[111:01] just  childish  to  eat  that  day  to  day  and 
 it's  certainly  not  your  best  it's 
 certainly  not  like  the  best  of  your
[111:07] character  to  indulge  in  sweet  treats  and 
 cope  and  say  that  it's  part  of  your  diet 
 now  you  can  absolutely  make  Muscle
[111:14] whilst  eating  [ __ ]  food  of  course  you 
 can  but  there's  more  to  life  than  just 
 making  muscle  how  about  your  health  how
[111:20] about  your  physical  and  mental  health 
 how  about  your  guts  Health  overloading 
 on  sugar  and  weird  chemicals  which  are
[111:26] in  like  gummy  bears  or  whatever  the  [ __ ] 
 these  influencers  and  these  um  Dunkin 
 Donuts  you  know  Krispy  Kreme  Donuts  that
[111:32] they're  eating  all  the  time 
 there's  a  better  way  to  do  this  for  me
[111:37] the  moment  that  I  was  able  to  improve  my 
 diet  came  when  I  started  to  educate 
 myself  on  it  I  realized  at  age  22  I  had
[111:45] been  through  the  entire  education  system 
 and  I  had  never  had  a  real  lesson  on 
 diet  or  nutrition  before  and  that  I
[111:51] actually  knew  nothing  about  what  these 
 things  were  actually  doing  to  my  body
[111:56] that's  when  I  discovered  this  lecture 
 that's  on  YouTube  that  you  can  watch  for 
 free  it's  from  like  this  it's  just  it's
[112:01] very  good  and  I  highly  recommend  that 
 you  just  watch  every  second  of  it  it's 
 called  Fat  Chance  2.0  and  if  you  just  go
[112:09] on  the  description  of  this  video  I'll 
 link  it  for  you  whenever  you  got  the 
 time  it's  like  an  hour  long  I  highly
[112:14] recommend  you  watch  it  there  might  be 
 some  bits  that  you  get  a  little  bit 
 bored  just  trust  me  when  I  say  if  you
[112:19] watch  every  second  of  it  to  the  end 
 you're  going  to  be  very  grateful  that 
 you  did  because  it's  going  to  give  you
[112:24] the  kind  of  education  you  should  have 
 gotten  when  you  were  in  school  but  then 
 they  don't  teach  this  stuff  for  some
[112:29] reason  so  that  works  really  well  for  me 
 because  online  I  think  there's  only  a 
 voice  right  now  on  this  you  know  Fitness
[112:35] influencer  [ __ ]  of  people  just  being 
 kind  of  like  mediocre  every  day  it's
[112:40] people  who  are  disciplining  themselves 
 or  living  to  like  50  to  60  of  their
[112:45] intensity  they're  eating  some  clean 
 calories  but  then  every  single  day 
 they're  having  a  little  bit  of  chocolate 
 they're  having  this  from  my  experience
[112:52] you  might  be  different  but  I'm  just 
 going  to  tell  you  that  what  I  believe  is 
 the  truth  from  myself  and  also  for  every
[112:58] successful  guy  that  I  know 
 it  doesn't  seem  like  successful  people
[113:03] have  daily  balance  it  doesn't  seem  like 
 the  guys  who  have  the  best  like  the  real 
 best  physiques  or  helpful  business  it
[113:09] doesn't  seem  like  they're  doing  50  of 
 their  intensity  every  day  it  seems  like 
 those  guys  resemble  the  phrase  like  work
[113:16] hard  play  hard  they  go  into  periods  of 
 intense  work  mode  where  they  do  nothing
[113:21] but  work  and  nothing  but  like  you  know 
 strict  calories  and  everything  like  that 
 and  then  they  go  into  periods  of  intense
[113:27] play  time  where  they  literally  just  for 
 a  lot  of  these  people  they're  just 
 totally  generates  they'll  start  drinking 
 and  sleeping  with  loads  of  women  and
[113:32] taking  drugs  and  stuff  I'm  not  doing 
 that  stuff  but  for  me  my  degenerate  time 
 is  like  going  to  a  family  Cafe  and
[113:38] having  some  cake  and  like  talking  to  the 
 family  there  and  everything  so  that's
[113:43] just  what  I've  seen  online  is 
 you're  recommended  to  have  this  kind  of 
 almost  you  know  perfect  sustainable  diet
[113:49] every  day  eighty  percent  of  your 
 calories  from  healthy  stuff  and  20  from 
 like  the  process  you  know  like  nice
[113:54] Foods  I  don't  recommend  that  because 
 that  means  that  you're  not  living  to 
 your  potential  whilst  you're  in  work
[113:59] mode  because  if  you're  eating  20  of  like 
 you  know  junk  calories  per  day  I  promise
[114:05] you  you  will  get  [ __ ]  by  someone  who's 
 competing  with  you  if  there's  someone 
 else  who  wants  to  take  what  you've  got
[114:11] if  there's  someone  else  who's  got  the 
 same  business  as  you  and  he's  on 
 Carnivore  diet  he's  gonna  [ __ ]  you  up  so
[114:17] because  if  you're  in  work  mode  I  think 
 you  should  have  everything  optimized  for 
 work  mode  for  a  lot  of  us  young  guys  we
[114:24] probably  should  be  in  work  mode  because 
 this  is  an  awesome  time  for  us  to 
 develop  I  think  the  better  way  is  we  go
[114:29] into  these  periods  of  work  mode  we  try 
 and  be  as  disciplined  as  possible  with 
 our  diets  and  then  when  we  get  to  you
[114:35] know  this 
 two  weeks  in  three  weeks  in  that's  when 
 we  have  a  few  days  off  and  we  go  on  a
[114:40] little  trip  somewhere  because  this  gives 
 you  the  heightened  experience  so  if  you
[114:45] want  to  copy  this  what  I'd  suggest  is 
 get  onto  like  a  quite  strict  diet  and  I 
 don't  mean  stretched  by  like  you  know
[114:50] super  low  calories  because  that's 
 unhealthy  what  I  mean  strict  is  like  for 
 example
[114:55] no  sugar  no  carbs  preferably  which  means 
 that  you're  literally  just  eating  eggs
[115:02] steak  you  know  Meats 
 butter
[115:08] nuts  that's  about  it  that's  pretty  much 
 like  most  of  what  I  eat  I  have  halloumi 
 as  well  halloumi  is  a  kind  of  like  a
[115:14] Greek  um  goat  cheese  which  is  quite  nice 
 as  well  that's  it  it's  quite  boring  it
[115:19] still  tastes  kind  of  nice  because  if  you 
 can  cook  you  know  eggs  nicely  it  still 
 tastes  nice  if  you  can  cook  steak  well
[115:24] it  still  tastes  nice  but  it  does  feel 
 like  something's  missing  because  we've 
 had  carbs  with  every  meal  for  like  20
[115:30] years  but  your  brain  will  never  be  a 
 shop  here's  an  actionable  step  for  you 
 for  this  part  of  the  guide  write  down  a
[115:37] plan  for  your  workout  and  for  your  diet 
 have  it  super  clear  what  are  you  gonna 
 eat  every  day  what  time  are  you  gonna
[115:42] train  how  often  will  you  train  my  advice 
 is  train  every  single  day  at  the  same
[115:47] time  but  do  like  slightly  less  volume 
 than  you  would  if  you  were  doing  three 
 or  five  days  or  so  whatever  days  a  week
[115:52] this  way  that  it's  so  much  more 
 consistent  my  favorite  way  of  doing  this 
 is  just  the  Habit  trackers  as  I've  shown
[115:58] you  here  step  five  discipline  and 
 self-improvement  habits  so  it's  summer
[116:03] of  2022  and  I'm  in  Thailand  in  a  big 
 Villa  that  I've  rented  out  on  airbn  be
[116:08] I'm  sat  outside  next  to  the  pool  some  my 
 video  editor  sat  next  to  the  pool  he's
[116:13] reading  and  I'm  sat  there  recording  a 
 video  for  Youtube  and  the  videos  on
[116:18] mental  health  so  I  mean  I'm  talking 
 about  all  these  great  habits  that  you 
 can  get  into 
 eventually  I  end  up  finishing  the  video
[116:24] it's  pretty  good  I'm  proud  of  myself  you 
 know  here  we  are  in  a  different  country 
 being  digital  Nomads  and  I've  just  done
[116:29] this  deep  work  task  that's  probably  paid 
 for  the  next  few  days  of  our  stay  which 
 is  awesome  and  as  I  press  the  sort  of
[116:35] stop  button  on  my  camera 
 Sam  looks  over  to  me  and  he  he's  almost 
 like  smirking  a  little  bit  and  he  says
[116:41] Hamza  do  you  still  meditate  because  you 
 mention  it  in  all  of  your  mental  health 
 videos  but  I've  never  seen  you  meditate
[116:47] before 
 straight  away  out  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah 
 yeah  I  meditate  in  my  in  my  bedroom
[116:53] every  day 
 I'm  lying  I  used  to  meditate  every
[116:59] single  day  for  an  hour  I  was  known  as 
 The  Meditation  guy 
 but  at  this  point  I  hadn't  meditated  for
[117:05] the  last  year 
 and  yeah  I  was  still  known  as  The
[117:10] Meditation  guy  because  I  would  speak 
 about  it  so  often  and  I  hadn't  even  told 
 anyone  on  YouTube  or  anyone  who  knew  me
[117:16] that  I  pretty  much  like  quit  or  not  that 
 I  quit  but  that  I  just  kept  on  slacking
[117:21] on  that  I  wasn't  consistent  at  all  I'm 
 teaching  all  of  these  young  guys  around 
 the  world  of  all  these  Habits  Like
[117:26] meditation  and  I  don't  even  do  them 
 myself 
 and  so  I'm  feeling  like  a  fraud  Sam's
[117:31] words  plagued  my  mind  for  over  six 
 months  whilst  I  was  trying  to  get 
 consistent  in  meditation  again  and  I
[117:37] kept  on  failing 
 and  eventually  I  realized  why  so  only
[117:43] just  a  few  months  ago  I  realized  why  I 
 kept  on  struggling  to  get  consistent  in 
 meditation  again  even  though  when  I
[117:49] first  started  I  got  super  consistent  I 
 was  doing  it  for  an  hour  a  day  but  then 
 I  missed  it  for  over  a  year  and  a  half
[117:55] and  I  realized  for  me  it's  because  it 
 wasn't  in  my  morning  routine  anymore  you
[118:01] see  for  the  last  year  or  so  I've  seen  a 
 rise  of  a  bunch  of  YouTubers  and 
 influencers  who  almost  mock  the
[118:07] self-improvement  habits  who  mock  the 
 idea  of  like  a  morning  routine  and  you 
 know  they  think  it's  kind  of  cringe  or
[118:12] weird  and  you  know  there's  been  a 
 cultural  online  of  people  kind  of  saying 
 that  this  stuff  is  like  it  doesn't  work
[118:17] or  whatever  but  then  of  course  there's 
 been  a  culture  online  of  of  like  more
[118:22] qualified  people  like  Andrew  huberman 
 saying  that  this  stuff  of  course  it 
 works  cold  showers  of  course  it 
 increases  your  dopamine  meditation  of
[118:28] course  increases  your  focus 
 but  I  got  influenced  by  the  people  who 
 were  kind  of  disrespecting  the
[118:34] self-improvement  habits  and  you  know 
 saying  that  you  know  morning  routines  a 
 cringe  CEO  morning  routine  and  stuff
[118:40] and  when  I  don't  do  a  morning  routine  I 
 found  that  I  simply  just  don't  do  the
[118:46] self-improvement  habits  because  when  I 
 start  work  for  the  day  it's  like  I'm  in 
 work  mode  so  it's  like  it's  very  hard
[118:52] for  me  to  kind  of  like  get  out  of  that  I 
 found  that  I  have  like  a  pocket  of  time 
 like  a  window  of  between  like  8  A.M  to
[118:58] 9am  which  is  perfect  for  me  to  do  the 
 self-improvement  habits  so  I  wake  up 
 before  that  so  I  can  still  do  like  you
[119:04] know  the  deepest  work  and  wake  up  super 
 early  and  work  super  hard  on  like  the 
 four  guides  but  as  part  of  my  morning
[119:09] routine  I'll  go  outside  I'll  get 
 sunlight  into  my  eyes  whilst  I'm  reading 
 on  my  Kindle  so  it's  like  a  two  in  one  I
[119:15] bring  my  Kindle  up  here  like  up  into  the 
 sky  like  this  so  This  Way  like  the  sun's 
 rays  are  going  into  my  eyes  and  I'm  also
[119:20] like  reading  at  the  same  time  then  I'll 
 come  in  I'll  go  for  a  cold  shower  then
[119:25] I'll  straight  after  the  cold  shower  for 
 two  minutes  I'll  meditate  for  20  minutes 
 then  I'll  do  gratitude  journaling  then
[119:31] I'll  do 
 um  death  meditation  I'll  do  double  deep 
 breaths  I'll  do  like  I've  got  a  bunch  of 
 things  in  my  morning  routine  it  takes  me
[119:37] just  under  an  hour  and  people  find  it 
 like  sad  for  some  reason  which  I  don't 
 get  why  because  it's  like  it's  very
[119:42] wholesome  activities  that  genuinely  have 
 changed  my  life  forever  I  stopped 
 meditating  for  a  long  time  and  my
[119:48] anxiety  like  level  of  intrusive  thoughts 
 really  shot  up  like  I  really  started  to
[119:53] feel  how  I  used  to  feel  for  most  of  my 
 life  which  was  new  for  me  because  for  a
[119:58] solid  year  I  almost  forgot  what  it  was 
 like  to  to  feel  anxious  and  slowly  those
[120:04] anxious  thoughts  started  to  come  back 
 and  I  you  know  I  was  wasn't  so  conscious 
 as  to  why  and  it  was  because  I  just
[120:10] stopped  meditating  this  is  all  about  the 
 concept  of  progressing  one  percent  every 
 single  day  you  know  you've  heard  it
[120:15] before  be  one  percent  better  that 
 actually  comes  from  this  Japanese 
 philosophy  which  is  called  Kaizen  Kaizen
[120:21] is  is  this  kind  of  student  mindset  which 
 means  that  we  prioritize
[120:27] wanting  to  be  slightly  better  like  to 
 learn  something  and  to  be  slightly 
 better  today  every  single  day  for  the
[120:33] rest  of  our  lives  that's  where  like  the 
 concept  of  self-improvement  comes  from 
 it's  like  this  random  Japanese 
 philosophy  that  ended  up  you  know  like
[120:38] we  started  masking  over  it  with  just 
 these  sort  of  habits  and  everything  what 
 you'll  find  is  that  progress  creates
[120:44] happiness  when  you  are  consistently 
 progressing  in  your  developments  as  a
[120:50] man  you  will  consistently  feel  the 
 emotions  and  and  mood  of  happiness  every
[120:55] single  day  when  you  stop  progressing 
 that's  when  your  life  starts  to  turn
[121:00] quite  gray  and  dark  and  let's  say  for 
 example  you  stop  progressing  with  these 
 self-improvement  habits  but  you're  still
[121:06] getting  more  results  like  you're  making 
 more  and  more  money  it  does  nothing 
 telling  like  telling  you  from  my  own
[121:13] personal  experience  I  was  happier  when  I 
 was  totally  broke  but  I  was  meditating 
 an  hour  a  day  than  I  was  when  I  was
[121:20] living  in  Dubai  and  I  was  making  like 
 40K  a  month  because  when  you're  when  you 
 live  like  that  like  this  is  a  separate
[121:26] point  I  guess  but  when  you  know  that 
 you've  seen  this  this  lifestyle  that's 
 been  promoted  to  you  by  the  media  the
[121:31] influences  and  everything  right  when  you 
 live  that  kind  of  Lifestyle  people  only 
 show  you  the  Glamorous  part  of  it  but
[121:37] almost  like  what  I  found  is  when  you 
 sacrifice  these  wholesome  habits  like
[121:42] reading  like  meditating  like  journaling 
 and  you  start  to  make  a  lot  more  money
[121:48] you  still  don't  feel  happy  you  don't  get 
 as  much  power  as  you  think  you  do  by  the
[121:53] pursuit  of  wealth  instead  the  power 
 comes  from  the  exact  opposite  which  is
[121:58] needing  less  the  power  and  happiness  and 
 joy  and  fulfillment  and  success  doesn't
[122:03] come  from  achieving  your  desires  it 
 comes  from  destroying  the  desire  in  the
[122:09] first  place  soon  I'll  have  a  full  guide 
 on  Willpower  and  willpower  is  is  you 
 know  that  habit  that  we  said  is
[122:14] resisting  the  bad  desires  that  will  be 
 super  important  and  it'll  get  very  deep
[122:19] because  it's  not  just  about  you  know  not 
 watching  a  porn  it's  like  literally  not 
 losing  your  [ __ ]  soul  to
[122:25] these  influences  that  you  see  we've 
 probably  seen  this  concept  of  old  guys 
 who  have  worked  for  their  entire  lives
[122:32] and  then  at  some  point  when  they're  60 
 years  old  they  retire  and  their  life
[122:37] actually  gets  worse  afterwards  because 
 we  need  to  keep  working  on  something 
 this  the  studies  and  you  know  things
[122:43] that  I've  I've  read  and  looked  on  online 
 which  I'll  summarize  for  you  which  is 
 that  no  matter  what  our  age  is  we  still
[122:49] have  the  ability  to  to  use  what's  called 
 neuroplasty  which  means  kind  of  that  we 
 can  update  our  brain  with  new  beliefs
[122:56] and  learn  and  learning  and  wisdom 
 everyone  kind  of  understands  this  now 
 but  you  know  only  a  few  years  ago  people
[123:01] genuinely  thought  that  your  brain  stops 
 developing  past  like  the  age  of  25  which 
 is  completely  like  just  idiotic  your
[123:07] brain  develops  and  in  fact  your  brain 
 needs  to  develop  every  single  year  for 
 your  life  otherwise  you  start  having  a
[123:13] [ __ ]  existence  those  those  old  people 
 that  you  know  probably  your  parents  our 
 parents  our  great  grandparents
[123:20] destroying  their  lives  why  because  they 
 don't  [ __ ]  read  because  they  don't 
 learn  because  they're  just  setting  their
[123:26] own  ways  now  they're  dying 
 now  that  it's  Siri  and  now  the  health  is
[123:31] getting  worse  now  their  brain  is  getting 
 destroyed 
 soon  enough  they're  gonna  get
[123:36] Alzheimer's  and  they  won't  even  remember 
 your  name
[123:41] that's  what  happens  when  you  don't  keep 
 learning  and  progressing  when  you  don't
[123:46] use  your  brain  it  just  starts  to 
 deteriorate  so  we  need  to  already  have 
 this  mindset  we  don't  want  to  turn  out
[123:51] like  these  old  people  that  we  see  who 
 you  know  like  for  example  it's  kind  of 
 cute  but  also  not  that  you  know  like
[123:57] they  literally  don't  know  how  to  use 
 phones  and  stuff  we  might  say  that 
 that's  wholesome  it's  not  as  wholesome
[124:02] as  you  think  when  you  can  see  genuinely 
 that  they're  experiencing  like  minor 
 forms  of  brain  damage  because  they're
[124:07] not  learning  we  should  be  old  and  we 
 should  know  how  to  use  the  newest
[124:12] Technologies  because  we're  learning  how 
 to  use  it  now  we  shouldn't  be  addicted 
 to  them  of  course  we  you  know  we  want  to
[124:17] be  wise  enough  not  to  be  addicted  to 
 like  VR  porn  or  whatever  the  [ __ ]  like 
 um AI  sex  spots  or  something  when  they
[124:22] come  out  but  we  should  know  how  to 
 navigate  AI  although  whatever  technology 
 there  is  a  hundred  years  from  now  we
[124:28] should  know  how  to  use  these  things  we 
 should  continuously  keep  learning  and  so 
 if  you  can  start  to  visualize  that  and
[124:33] almost  write  it  down 
 to  form  a  new  identity  for  yourself  that 
 you  are  a  lifelong  student  that  you'll
[124:41] always  keep  learning  because  really  ask 
 yourself  people  don't  do  this  brother 
 make  a  decision  right  now  is  that  the 
 life  you  want  to  live  do  you  plan  to
[124:47] stop  learning  and  do  like  want  your 
 brain  to  just  stop  developing  at  a
[124:52] certain  age  or  do  you  want  to  set  the 
 intention  that  you've  probably  like  to 
 keep  learning  and  developing  and
[124:58] enjoying  and  gaining  wisdom  every  single 
 day  for  the  rest  of  your  life  and  it'll 
 probably  make  your  life  better  and
[125:03] you'll  probably  live  longer  set  that 
 intention  clear  right  now  I  am  a
[125:08] lifelong  students  I'm  Gonna  Keep 
 learning  for  as  long  as  I  live  I'm  gonna 
 be  the  80  year  old  who's  still  reading
[125:13] books  every  single  day  I'm  going  to  be 
 the  90  year  old  who's  still  exercising
[125:18] of  course  I  am 
 people  don't  really  set  this  intention 
 and  then  they  surprise  when  life  just 
 hits  them  and  they're  fat  and  disgusting
[125:25] and  stupid  when  they're  50  years  old 
 never  mind  70.  and  guess  what  the  worst
[125:30] part  of  all  this  is 
 guys 
 our  age  who  are  doing  the  same  things
[125:37] there's  guys  our  age  whose  brains  and 
 bodies  have  already  started  to
[125:42] deteriorate  not  even  70  years  old  not  50 
 years  old  at  20  years  old  25  years  old
[125:47] they're  literally  poisoning  themselves 
 with  alcohol  every  week  they  take  drugs 
 they're  sleep  deprived  they're  [ __ ]
[125:53] up  their  brain  and  their  dopamine 
 receptors  they're  taking  medications 
 which  they  don't  even  know  the  side
[125:58] effects  of 
 content  consumption  and  porn  and  video 
 games  [ __ ]  disgusting  food  destroying
[126:04] their  guts  wondering  why  they  feel  like 
 [ __ ]  all  the  time  and  why  they  have  to 
 cover  it  up  with  more  and  more
[126:09] substances 
 there's  people  our  age  who  are  already 
 like  acting  as  if  they're  80  years  old
[126:16] like  they've  got  like  you  know  no  time 
 left  now  you  may  as  well  just  like 
 slowly  start  killing  yourself  with 
 substances
[126:22] they're  destroying  their  brains  ability 
 to  think  and  to  learn  and  these  same
[126:27] people  will  complain  when  you  make  more 
 money  than  them  and  they'll  say  oh  we 
 should  tax  you  we  should  steal  money
[126:33] from  you  we  should  eat  the  rich  that's 
 what  they'll  say  but  they  literally  wear 
 necklaces  and
[126:40] they  literally  wear  these  types  of 
 people  I  know  them  okay  they  literally 
 wear  necklaces  which  has  like  a  little
[126:46] small  metal  spoon  which  is  what  they  use 
 the  [ __ ]  key  cat  like  a  key  cat  is  a
[126:51] phrase  where  like  this  ketamine  like  a 
 [ __ ]  party  drug  in  the  UK  and  these 
 little  degenerates  will  put  it  into  the
[126:56] bag  of  cats  like  this  drug  and  so  they 
 can  sniff  it  they'll  have  a  piece  of 
 [ __ ]  jewelry  that  they  wear  for  easy
[127:02] access  to  be  able  to  scoop  drugs  into 
 their  nose  already  destroying  their
[127:07] brains  and  their  their  body's  health  and 
 they'll  look  to  you  when  you  make  money 
 and  say  that  oh  yeah  you  should  be  taxed
[127:14] more  because  it's  unfair  that  you  make 
 more  money 
 there's  people  who  live  like  that  right 
 now
[127:20] that's  an  extreme  example  obviously  of 
 like  the  total  degenerates  of  the  world 
 the  thing  is  that  the  50  year  old  who
[127:25] doesn't  read  a  book  is  not  far  from  that 
 the  50  year  old  who's  been  drinking 
 alcohol  for  the  last  30  35  years  he's
[127:31] not  far  from  that  the  first  step  to 
 living  a  great  life  is  to  just  set  the
[127:36] intention  and  to  be  honest  with  yourself 
 and  say  you  know  what  this  is  the  life  I 
 want  to  live  I  want  to  be  old  and  I  want
[127:42] to  be  healthy  and  I  want  to  still  be 
 able  to  go  to  the  gym  when  I'm  90  years 
 old  because  bro  this  there's  literally
[127:48] like  a  92  year  old  or  something  like 
 maybe  82  year  old  African
[127:53] um 
 I  think  he's  from  Kenya  he  comes  to  my 
 gym  I  haven't  seen  him  in  a  little  while
[127:58] actually  so  maybe  that's  concerning  but 
 like  he  comes  to  my  gym  and  he  does  like 
 an  hour  of  cardio  every  day
[128:04] and  here  we  are  people  our  age 
 literally  do  less  than  an  hour  of  cardio
[128:09] a  month  let  me  tell  you  the  story  of  two 
 men  these  two  men  are  very  similar  they
[128:14] both  work  at  the  same  job  and  after  they 
 finish  their  shift  they  drive  home
[128:19] one  of  the  men  listens  to  the  news  and 
 then  sometimes  he  also  changes  that  to
[128:24] his  Spotify  playlist  and  the  other  man 
 listens  to  podcasts  the  first  guy  is
[128:29] driving  home  but  before  he  gets  home  he 
 makes  a  stop  to  McDonald's  and  he  just
[128:34] picks  up  a  small  thing  there  like  a 
 McFlurry  and  he  goes  home  and  he  just 
 has  that 
 the  second  guy  drives  home  without  that
[128:40] stop  without  the  McFlurry  the  rest  of 
 the  day  is  exactly  the  same  imagine  that
[128:45] 100  the  same  it's  only  the  difference  is 
 what  they're  listening  to  in  the  car  and 
 whether  or  not  they  picked  up  like  a
[128:51] little  200  calorie  ice  cream  on  the  way 
 home 
 in  20  years
[128:56] the  guy  on  the  left  is  morbidly  obese
[129:01] just  an  extra  100  200  calories  a  day 
 over  like  10  years  is  like  50  pounds  of
[129:07] fat  and  that's  if  it  literally  stays 
 with  just  like  you  know  it's  like  it's
[129:12] in  a  vacuum  you  only  gain  the  200. 
 naturally  you  can  imagine  the  fat  ass 
 who  stops  for  ice  cream  every  day  is
[129:18] going  to  be  more  likely  to  also  get 
 other  things  as  well  you  know  it's  going 
 to  compound  not  just  like  linearly  but 
 also  like  he's  going  to  be  way  more
[129:24] likely  to  cheat  on  his  diet  even  more 
 not  only  that 
 he's  actually  working  in  the  exact  same
[129:29] job  20  years  later  because  he's  not 
 learning  the  other  guy  listens  to  a 
 podcast  for  30  minutes  on  his  way  back
[129:36] home  he's  listening  to  Chris  Williamson 
 podcast  Deep  dive  with  Ali  abdall  he's 
 listening  to  something  intelligence  and
[129:42] with  that  he  got  one  promotion  after 
 let's  say  four  years  then  one  more  then 
 one  more
[129:47] and  he  makes  at  least 
 triple  what  this  guy  does  he  still  makes
[129:52] like  45k  a  year  decades  later  this  guy 
 makes  like  120k  this  guy's  actually
[129:58] relatively  in  shape  this  guy's  morbidly 
 obese  and  we  only  change  two  variables
[130:03] literally  just  what  you  listen  to  in  the 
 car  for  30  minutes  a  day  and  whether  or 
 not you  stop  to  pick  up  ice  cream  and
[130:08] we're  saying  that  this  is  all  like  in  a 
 vacuum  because  again  the  person 
 listening  to  the  music  is  probably  going
[130:14] to  be  much  more  likely  to  be  a 
 degenerate  and  sex  obsessed  you  know 
 that's  the  state  of  Music  These  Days 
 he's  also  going  to  be  listening  to  the
[130:20] news  which  means  that  his  cortisol  is 
 higher  which  means  it  sleeps  worse  his 
 performance  and  work  is  worse  his 
 relationship  so  worse  so  it's  a  lot  more
[130:26] of  an  effect  than  we  think  but  even  if 
 we're  just  being  nice  to  this  guy 
 literally  just  the  objective  facts  is
[130:31] that  he  makes  three  times  less  and  he's 
 three  times  as  fat  as  this  one  with 
 those  two  small  changes  That's  The
[130:36] Compound  Effect  in  action  You  Don't  See 
 Much  day  to  day  you  can  have  the  ice 
 cream  and  it  doesn't  actually  do  much  to
[130:42] your  physique  right  now  but  if  you  do 
 that  two  three  four  times  a  week  if  you 
 go  to  McDonald's  like  you  know  once  a
[130:47] week  compared  to  the  guy  who  doesn't  go 
 at  all  if  you  have  that  that  extra 
 little  bit  of  sugar  every  single  day  you
[130:52] know  20  of  your  calories  on  junk  food 
 and  eighty  percent  on  unhealthy  food 
 that's  when  over  years  it  makes  a  much
[131:00] bigger  difference  so  it's  your  gift  to 
 your  future  self  to  be  thinking  about 
 The  Compound  Effect  and  thinking  that
[131:06] small  choices  will  really  change  your 
 future  self's  life  a  lot  here's  an 
 actionable  step  for  you  decide  one  good
[131:14] small  thing  that  you  could  do  very  small 
 I'm  talking  the  equivalent  of  like  50 
 calories  for  example  you  could  go  for  a
[131:20] walk  every  single  day  for  just  10 
 minutes  that's  it  what  a  good  habit 
 that's  small  that  you  could  start  to  do
[131:26] every  single  day  for  the  rest  of  your 
 life  maybe  it's  three  minutes  of 
 meditation  maybe  it's  five  minutes  of
[131:33] prayer  maybe  it's  five  minutes  of  deep 
 breathing  or  it's  five  minutes  of 
 reading  maybe  it's  five  minutes  of
[131:38] walking  outside  maybe  it's  five  minutes 
 of  just  playing  with  your  dog  with  no 
 distractions  at  all  what's  a  very  small 
 thing  for  less  than  five  minutes  and
[131:44] then  also  what's  a  bad  habit  that  you'll 
 stop  doing  a  very  small  bad  habit  maybe
[131:50] it's  putting  sugar  in  your  coffee  or 
 your  tea  maybe  it's  using  like  one  of 
 those  [ __ ]  artificial  sweeteners
[131:55] which  are  as  bad  as  sugar  or  even  worse 
 because  it's  just  got  weird  chemicals 
 and  maybe  you  just  stop  doing  that  maybe
[132:00] you  stop  putting  in  whole  milk  which  is 
 full  of  estrogenic  materials  you  know
[132:05] they've  put  stuff  the  cow  full  of 
 disgusting  stuff  and  it's  been  bottled 
 in  plastic  and  everything  maybe  you  just 
 stop  putting  milk  in  your  coffee
[132:11] these  two  changes  if  you  can  make  it 
 easy  enough  to  literally  follow  them
[132:16] every  single  day  for  the  rest  of  your 
 life  and  of  course  knowing  you're 
 probably  still  going  to  miss  like  a 
 thousand  days  you'll  be
[132:23] significantly  very  significantly 
 different  20  years  from  now  more  than
[132:28] you'd  realize  you  know  why  just  if  we  do 
 the  math  that  literally  just  you  know 
 the  splash  of  milk  that  you  put  into
[132:34] your  coffee  is  like  30  calories  50 
 calories  right  if  we  just  do  the  math
[132:39] that  if  you  had  that  every  single  day 
 for  10  years  for  50  like  20  years  30 
 years  there's  the  difference  of  like
[132:44] literally  50  pounds  of  pure  fat  but  and 
 never  mind  the  estrogenic  testosterone
[132:49] killing  effects  of  milk  and  everything 
 but  also  we  know  that  one  decision  often 
 leads  to  the  next  and  so  if  you  stop  for
[132:54] example  putting  in  artificial  sweeteners 
 you  know  like  two  grams  of  sugar  in  your 
 coffee  every  single  day  because  of  the
[133:00] impact  of  that  you'd  be  more  likely  to 
 create  another  really  good  change  and 
 another  one  and  another  one  and  you
[133:06] become  so  different  I  want  to  give  you 
 some  hope  now  I'm  a  little  bit  older 
 than  a  lot  of  the  guys  who  watch  me  on
[133:11] average  hour  audience  is  quite  young 
 it's  like  16  17  18  19  20  years  old  I'm 
 26.  I'm  telling  you  right  now  by  the
[133:17] time  you  get  to  about  25  26  years  old 
 that's  when  you  really  start  to  first
[133:23] see  the  difference  between  you  and  the 
 men  your  age  you  know  when  you're  18 
 years  old  you  don't  see  much  a  lot  of
[133:29] it's  actually  quite  based  on  like 
 genetics  and  early  positive  feedback 
 loops  there's  like  there's  an  absolute 
 imbecile  who's  more  popular  than  you  and
[133:35] might  even  make  more  money  than  you  when 
 you're  18  or  20  or  21  years  old  because 
 they  got  the  positive  feedback  loop  you
[133:40] know  there's  there's  a  guy  who's  kind  of 
 attractive  but  he's  kind  of  like  brain 
 dead  and  he  doesn't  even  work  hard  and
[133:45] he's  getting  more  girls  than  you  when 
 you're  16  years  old  or  even  when  you're 
 21  years  old  because  he's  got  nicer  hair
[133:50] he's  got  a  jawline  he's  you  know  he's 
 like  more  attractive 
 give  it  another  like  five  years  when  The
[133:55] Compound  Effect  takes  off  once  you  get 
 to  around  like  you're  closer  to  your 
 late  20s  it  starts  to  become  apparent
[134:01] when  you  see  that  like  everyone  you  went 
 to  high  school  with  or  let's  say  90  of 
 people  that  you  go  to  high  school  with
[134:06] have  gained  like  20  pounds  30  pounds  of 
 pure  fat  because  they've  been  drinking
[134:11] every  single  weekend  for  the  last 
 [ __ ]  eight  years  even  more  because  in 
 these  degenerate  cultures  in  the  UK  for
[134:18] example  people  drink  when  they're  like 
 15  14  years  old  so  people  my  age  I've 
 been  drinking  most  weeks  for  about  12
[134:25] years  now  I'm  still  guilty  of  this 
 because  I  drank  heavily  for  a  few  years 
 when  I  went  to  University  and  I  was  a
[134:31] like  a  degenerate  and  everything 
 but  for  the  past  few  years  it's  been 
 very  minimal  for  the  last  like  what
[134:37] seven  eight  months  it's  been  absolutely 
 zero 
 The  Compound  Effect  is  showing  in  my
[134:44] life  and  the  people  that  I  come  across 
 and  I  think  this  is  just  the  start  I 
 wonder  what  it's  going  to  be  like  five
[134:49] or  ten  twenty  years  from  now  I'm  a 
 patient  guy  20  years  from  now  What's  it
[134:54] gonna  be  when  I'm  the  guy  who  just  I 
 meditate  20  minutes  every  single  morning 
 I  don't  miss  it  anymore  what's  that  one
[134:59] Change  Gonna  lead  to  20  years  from  now 
 this  is  what  excites  me  of  like  the
[135:05] future  of  being  on  self-improvement  of 
 watching  stuff  like  this  of  implementing 
 these  small  things
[135:10] if  you  are  a  long-term  thinker  which  you 
 probably  are  if  you've  watched  you  know 
 like  two  hours  of  this  video  so  far
[135:17] there's  a  lot  of  power  in  these  small 
 changes  and  I  know  that  you  know  like  we
[135:23] shouldn't  be  in  the  vibe  of  looking  down 
 at  other  people  but  you  can't  help  but
[135:28] in  a  way  feels  sad  but  also  in  a  way 
 just  feels  super  [ __ ]  happy  that 
 you're  part  of  the  enlightened  group  who
[135:34] understands  The  Compound  Effect  of 
 self-improvements  of  Kaizen  of 
 progressive  overload  because  the  people
[135:39] that  you've  went  to  school  with  don't 
 and  if  you're  younger  than  me  right  now 
 like  right  now  it's  gonna  seem  like  this
[135:45] stuff  isn't  doing  much  because  they're 
 better  than  you  in  quite  a  lot  of  ways 
 and  the  difference  will  be  [ __ ]  huge
[135:52] and  that's  the  start 
 then  every  year  after  that  that's  when
[135:57] you  know  like  because  The  Compound 
 Effect  starts  becoming  exponential 
 that's  when  it  starts  the  show  and  it's
[136:02] like  suddenly  they're  35  they've 
 actually  got  like  serious  health 
 problems  they've  had  their  first  like
[136:07] major  health  scare  right  now 
 here  you  are  in  the  best  health  of  your
[136:12] entire  life  because  you've  been 
 improving  your  sleep  for  the  past  10 
 years  15  years  you've  been  exercising
[136:19] consistently  for  15  years  you've  been 
 trying  to  improve  your  diet  you  quit 
 porn  [ __ ]  14  years  ago  compare  that
[136:26] to  the  average  guy  who  10  years  from  now 
 is  literally  gonna  be  addicted  to  like 
 the  the  most
[136:31] the  uh  the  most  unreal  sex  bots 
 available
[136:37] there's  a  good  future  ahead  for  the  guys 
 who  commit  themselves  to 
 self-improvements  step  five  when  you
[136:43] become  successful  so  imagine  that  you've 
 been  grinding  away  for  a  long  time
[136:48] you've  been  developing  yourself  you've 
 been  disciplined  in  yourself  and  you've 
 been  moderating  your  desires
[136:53] eventually  you  build  the  success  that 
 you've  wanted  all  this  time  you  build
[136:58] the  physique  you  get  the  girl  you  make 
 the  money  you  get  the  status  this  is 
 where  Discipline  matters  most
[137:05] and  this  is  also  where  hard-working  guys 
 end  up  messing  up
[137:10] because  when  you  get  those  things  that 
 you  thought  you  wanted  that's  when  you
[137:16] take  your  foot  off  the  pedal 
 that's  when  you  stop  grinding  as  hard 
 that's  when  you  get  distracted  success
[137:22] mark  my  words  when  I  say  this  success 
 leads  to  opportunities  that  will  destroy
[137:29] your  success  let  me  give  you  an  example 
 let's  say  there's  a  young  man  who  wants 
 to  be  an  entrepreneur  and  he  starts
[137:35] working  super  super  hard  he's  literally 
 living  at  home  with  his  parents  and  he's
[137:40] grinding  away  he  wakes  up  he  does  a 
 bunch  of  deep  work  he  just  does  you  know 
 like  a  quick  like  workout  that's  really
[137:45] good  for  his  brain  he's  eating  a  very 
 simple  diet  and  he's  just  grinding  on 
 this  business  that  means  a  lot  to  him
[137:50] and  he  does  that  literally  for  months 
 and  months  and  months  reads  books 
 constantly  learns  you  know  limits  the
[137:56] input  that's  coming  in  from  other  people 
 and  he's  just  working  on  this  one  goal 
 of  making  10K  a  month  20K  a  month  30k  a
[138:02] month  in  his  business  actually 
 eventually  after  a  long  time 
 starts  to  do  really  well
[138:09] what  might  happen  to  this  young  man
[138:14] he's  gonna  upgrade  his  lifestyle 
 he  might  end  up  getting  a  nice 
 girlfriend  and  she  might  not  be  nice
[138:22] suddenly  he's  got  a  watch  that  he  wants 
 to  show  off  on  Instagram  and  he's  got  a 
 car  and  he's  got  this  like  nice  little
[138:27] dinner  and  these  things  seem  nice  and 
 yet 
 he  isn't  waking  up  early  and  working  on
[138:32] his  business  anymore 
 it's completely  distracted  he's  not
[138:37] doing  the  thing  that  caused  him  to  to 
 have  this  momentum 
 and  it's  awesome  you  know  I  mean  the
[138:43] money's  coming  in  you  know  strike 
 notification  to  the  group  chat  to  the 
 like  you  know  the  Instagram  and  the
[138:48] YouTube  thumbnails  everyone's  validating 
 him  and  what  he's  not  realizing  is  right 
 now  he's  riding  on  the  success  of  his
[138:54] younger  self  but  he's  not  adding  to  it 
 he's  not  planting  more  seeds  so  that  his 
 future  self  can  still  have  ripe  fruit  he
[139:00] stopped  planting 
 what  happens
[139:05] one  month  two  months  three  months  from 
 now 
 the  momentum  starts  to  drop
[139:12] he  isn't  doing  what  got  him  here
[139:18] and  worse  than  that 
 he  might  end  up  going  too  far  into  the
[139:23] distractions  he  might  for  example  this 
 happens  to  so  many  guys  and  you  need  to 
 take  this  seriously  he  might  end  up
[139:29] getting  the  wrong  girl  pregnant 
 because  when  he  had  less  success  when  he 
 was  less  disciplined  no  girls  were  into
[139:35] him  and  as  he  started  to  become  more 
 disciplined  which  can  happen  to  you 
 suddenly  more  girls  are  into  him  but  he
[139:41] hasn't  really  like  you  know  really 
 clarified  it  in  his  mind  of  the  risks
[139:48] that  could  come  about  this  now  obviously 
 if  it  ends  up being  like  this  beautiful 
 relationship  and  they  want  to  have 
 children  that's  obviously  different  but
[139:54] let's  say  for  example  this  wasn't  part 
 of  his  plan  he  didn't  expect  to  have 
 children  right  now  but  he  was  just  being 
 a  bit  foolish  careless
[140:02] idiotic 
 so  he  gets  a  woman  pregnant 
 he's  bought  a  car  that's  fifty  thousand
[140:09] dollars  maybe  a  seventy  five  thousand 
 dollars
[140:15] and  now  he  needs  that  money  back 
 you  see  the  same  thing  so  often  with
[140:21] athletes  there's  an  athlete  right  now 
 who's  training  maybe  two  three  times  a 
 day  he's  stretching  he  literally  goes
[140:27] this  sweaty  like  kind  of  almost  run  down 
 gym  and  he  trains  hard  as  hell  there  he 
 comes  back  and  he  does  stretches  at  home
[140:33] he's  eating  the  perfect  diet  he's 
 obsessing  over  he's  reading  the  books 
 listening  to  audio  programs  mentally
[140:38] visualizing  he's  putting  in  the  work  and 
 then  he  actually  gets  the  success 
 because  these  are  the  things  that  cause
[140:43] the  success  so  he  ends  up  playing  really 
 well  in  you  know  the  game  of  basketball 
 or  he  he  joins  the  UFC  or  something  he
[140:48] does  really  well 
 but  then  the  fame  the  women  that  the
[140:53] parties  sex  money  opportunities  all 
 these  things  that  he  thought  he  wanted 
 they  come  into  his  life  and  he  starts  to
[140:59] indulge  and  then  you  see  pictures  of 
 Conor  McGregor  and  he's  there  you  know 
 drinking  and  he's  at  the  party  and 
 everything  everyone  wants  to  take
[141:04] pictures  with  him  and  what  happens 
 because  whilst  he's  there  staying  up 
 late
[141:10] there's  another  athlete  who's  still  in 
 the  sweaty  gym  who's  still  coming  home
[141:16] and  stretching  and  then  going  back  to 
 this  the  sweaty  gym  after  that
[141:21] and  what  happens  when  these  two  men 
 compete  with  each  other 
 the  guy  who's  still  focused  who's  still
[141:28] disciplined  is  gonna  destroy  him 
 and  so  right  now  you  might  get  you  know
[141:33] a  little  bit  depressed  hearing  this 
 because  you  might  be  thinking  and 
 correct  me  if  I'm  wrong  right  you  might 
 be  thinking  but  then  when  do  I  get  to
[141:39] enjoy  the  success  you  know  it  like  I 
 unders  you  can  probably  understand  this
[141:44] concept  of  like  success  can  lead  to  the 
 distractions  but  you  might  be  getting 
 really  upset  thinking  like  but  like 
 that's  the  point  of  it  right  that's  the
[141:50] point  like  you  know  I  want  to  be  able  to 
 experience  the  women  in  the  parties  and 
 and  you  know  the  status  and  the  money
[141:55] and  everything  right 
 again  this  is  when  you  may  realize
[142:02] if  we  have  the  maturity  to  to  you  know 
 be  the  enlightened  ones
[142:07] but  the  reward  for  discipline  was  never 
 the  material  success 
 that's  what  the  average  person's
[142:13] ambition  is  the  Instagram  Likes 
 the  woman  open  up  her  legs  that's  it
[142:20] this  is  like  a  normal  person's  ambition 
 maybe  a  superior  man's  ambition  is
[142:27] personal  fulfillments 
 progression  to  realizing  and  opening  and
[142:35] embodying  your  purpose  as  a  man  you've 
 heard  about  how  important  purposes  Maybe
[142:41] that's  the  reward  of  discipline  it's 
 nowhere  near  as  cool  it's  not  going  to 
 get  you  as  many  likes  on  Instagram
[142:47] but  it  will  mean  that  you  will  die  with 
 a  smile  on  your  face  rather  than  the  man 
 who  looks  back  and  thinks  man  I  I  could
[142:52] have  been  the  champion  and  yet  the 
 cocaine  and  the  pretty  women  with  fig 
 titties  got  me
[142:58] just  like  every  other  stupid  man  who 
 becomes  successful
[143:06] if  my  younger  self  was  watching  this 
 right  now  a  few  years  ago  this  is  the
[143:11] point  where  he'd  lose  interest  because 
 it  just  he  would  not  be  able  to 
 comprehend  what  I'm  saying  here  because 
 his  mind  was  all  about  the  material
[143:17] desires  and  I  really  want  to  help  you 
 with  this  I  will  have  a  full  guide  to 
 willpower  that's  what  we're  going  to
[143:23] talk  about  like  resisting  these  like  bad 
 desires  and  trust  me  when  I  say  when  you
[143:28] see  that  full  guide  come  out  will 
 powerful  guide 
 it's  blowing  my  mind  of  what  I'm 
 learning  in  it  but  let  me  just  give  you
[143:34] like  a  quick  like  a  little  bit  here 
 the  desires  that  form  in  your  mind  will
[143:39] take  you  away  from  the  things  that  are 
 more  important  these  desires  that  you 
 have  you  know  the  idea  is  okay  we're
[143:45] being  disciplined  because  if  we're 
 totally  honest 
 because  we'd  like  to  [ __ ]
[143:50] because  we'd  like  to  be  invited  to  the 
 party  because  we'd  like  the  Instagram 
 likes  or  you  know  the  nice  handshake
[143:55] from  another  guy 
 where's  that  desire  really  coming  from
[144:01] genuinely  where  is  the  desire  really 
 coming  from  for  this  validation  you  know
[144:06] the  girl  and  the  the  cocaine  at  the 
 party  where's  the  desire  coming  from 
 probably  from  somewhere  in  childhood
[144:12] because  like  a  six-year-old  friend  that 
 you  had  didn't  invite  you  to  a  birthday 
 party  and  that's  like  a  wound  that  we've
[144:18] kept  deep  inside  of  us  for  10  15  years 
 later  we're  here  now  dedicating 
 ourselves  12  hours  a  day  of  work  to  try
[144:24] and  get  like  the  same  equivalence  of 
 that  that's  the  wound  that's  directing 
 our  adult  lives
[144:31] if  you  throw  all  away  the  immaturity 
 there  and  you  really  think  to  yourself 
 like  what  is  it  that  I  want  out  of  life
[144:37] it's  probably  not  to  have  stupid 
 unintelligent  people  next  to  you
[144:43] it  probably  is  definitely  to  be 
 financially  well  off  and  I  I  think 
 that's  a  pretty  good  desire  but  it
[144:49] probably  isn't  you  know  if  you  peel  back 
 the  [ __ ]  it  probably  isn't  to  be 
 like  rich
[144:55] 10K  a  month  50k  a  month  you  know  every 
 everyone  in  your  family  is  retired 
 fantastic
[145:00] past  that  point  it's  like  what  is  the 
 gain  of  more  money  at  that  point
[145:06] right  now  if  you  make  more  money  just 
 because  you're  contributing  more  value 
 to  the  the  world  yeah  sure  but  then  at
[145:11] that  point  it's  like  the  focus  changes 
 to  contribution  to  your  craft  to  your
[145:16] fulfillment  and  you  know  to  achieve  flow 
 state  every  day
[145:21] but  a  lot  of  guys  get  distracted  when 
 they  get  here  you  can  choose  to  stick  at
[145:26] the  level  you're  at  right  now  and  to 
 enjoy  that  level  or  you  can  twist  and 
 you  can  actually  reach  for  the  next
[145:32] level  the  next  level  of  discipline  the 
 next  level  of  dedication  and  sacrifice 
 and  this  seems  so  weird  right  so  you
[145:37] could  get  to  a  point  let's  say  you've 
 got  a  six-pack  you're  making  75k  a  year
[145:42] there's  girls  on  Instagram  who  are 
 messaging  you  first  you've  got  a  nice 
 hurt  genuinely  visualize  this  you
[145:47] literally  get  a  notification  on 
 Instagram  where  there's  that  autistic 
 rating  but  there's  a  6.5  girl  who's  in
[145:54] your  city  who's  literally  messages  you 
 flirty  you  could  probably  ban  tonight 
 the  majority  of  guys  will  stay  here  so
[146:01] do  you  know  how  easy  it  is  to  [ __ ] 
 destroy  them 
 most  guys  as  soon  as  they  get  to  the
[146:07] level  where  they  start  getting  some 
 attention  from  women  they'll  stick  there 
 and  then  what  happens
[146:13] the  six  pack  turns  into  a  four  pack 
 the  75k  a  year  in  their  business  starts
[146:19] going  down  because  they  stopped  doing 
 the  thing  waking  up  early  being 
 dedicated  meditating  and  everything  that
[146:24] got  them  there  you  know  one  night  off  of 
 course  is  absolutely  fine  but  when 
 you're  consistently  two  three  nights  a
[146:29] week  you're  waking  up  late  because  you 
 know  that  girl  came  over  again  and  you 
 had  like  some  wine  or  alcohol  or  sugar
[146:35] with  her  and  like  imagine  that  micro 
 habit
[146:40] along  an  entire  year  compared  to  that 
 like  monk  mode  of  like  spiritual  Focus
[146:45] that  you  had 
 that's  sticking  with  where  you're  at  now 
 and  the  thing  is  sticking  with  where  you
[146:51] are  now  is  a  myth  because  if  you  stick 
 with  where  you  are  now  you  naturally 
 will  just  get  worse  you  know  that  like
[146:56] there's  a  phrase  which  has  like 
 maintenance  is  a  myth  like  like  just 
 maintaining  in  life  is  a  myth  because
[147:01] everyone  else  is  still  more  competitive 
 so  if  you  are  number  50  you  can't  just 
 stay  at  number  50  by  like  you  know
[147:06] maintaining  because  there's  other  guys 
 who  are  competitive  in  life  and  so  when 
 someone  else  beats  you  you're  51  then  52
[147:12] right  so  you  can  stick  here  and  enjoy 
 some  of  the  results  of  like  this  point
[147:18] in  life  let's  say  this  point  in  life  is 
 60  of  your  potential  most  guys  don't 
 even  get  here  most  guys  genuinely  get  to
[147:24] like  25  to  35  of  their  potential  and 
 they  stop  there  why
[147:30] because  there's  a  girl  that  they 
 genuinely  consider  a  five  or  a  six  out
[147:35] of  ten  and  they'll  stop  there  again  I'm 
 not  saying  these  like  ratings  to  be  like 
 mean  or  anything  this  is  just  you  know
[147:40] to  explain  things 
 they'll  stop  there 
 some  of  the  more  ambitious  guys  will  go
[147:46] one  level  up  they'll  get  the  six-pack 
 they'll  get  to  12  body  fat  and  then
[147:51] they'll  stop  there  they've  got  a  girl 
 who's  6.5  who  says  seven  now  and  you 
 know  this  is  absolutely  fine  and  then
[147:56] they'll  stop  working  as  hard  then 
 they'll  relax 
 it  takes  a  true  killer  to  get  to  the
[148:02] point  where  like  you  have  a  huge  success 
 and  you're  still  just  [ __ ]
[148:08] disciplining  yourself  not  even  for  the 
 greed  not  even  for  the  money
[148:15] before  the  journey  that  it  takes  you  on 
 for  the  simple  desire  of  actually
[148:21] wanting  to  see  what  your  potential  is 
 and  this  is  where
[148:26] I'm  pretty  proud  of  myself 
 because  when  I  started  this  journey  a
[148:31] good  few  years  ago  you  know  being  on 
 self-improvement  and  being  productive 
 genuinely  I'm  not  lying  when  I  say
[148:37] I  did  it  for  girls 
 I  did  it  because  I  wanted  to  get  laid  I
[148:42] stuck  at  these  like  earlier  levels  and  I 
 was  going  to  be  happy  there
[148:47] but  there  was  this  voice  that  maybe  it's 
 internal  maybe  it  was  something  that  was
[148:52] built  inside  of  me  if  I  was  gonna  say 
 something  I  think  this  voice  came  from  a
[148:57] lot  of  introspectiveness  because  I  do  a 
 lot  of  meditation  and  journaling  and 
 also  from  Wise  mentors  like  I  don't  have
[149:03] any  real  mentors  but  I  just  read  a  lot 
 of  books  reading  not  watching  YouTube  is 
 a  very  different  thing  I  read  a  lot  of
[149:09] books  from  intelligent  people  and  by 
 these  two  things  of  introspectiveness 
 and  wisdom
[149:14] I  couldn't  ever  stay  like  stuck  at  the 
 level  that  I  was  at  with  the  success
[149:19] that  I  do  have 
 I'm  still  waking  up  at  5am  every  day
[149:24] I  still  live  at  home  with  my  parents 
 because  I  did  level  up  my  life  I  did
[149:29] stick  there  I  did  get  the  apartment  in 
 Dubai  genuinely  I  moved  to  Dubai  and 
 everything  I  did  get  the  ten  thousand
[149:34] dollar  a  month  apartment  in  Dubai  I  did 
 post  the  pictures  of  the  Rolex  and  give 
 them  a  nice  shirt  and  everything  I  did
[149:39] that  I  did  make  the  mistake  right  but  I 
 got  myself  out  of  it  after  two  months  of 
 doing  that  and  realizing  like  that's  a
[149:45] stupid  life  and  that  it  was  just  a 
 distraction  from  what  got  me  here 
 it  made  me  realize  and  like  reframe  my
[149:52] mind  which  I  really  want  to  happen  to 
 you  at  this  point  if  you  started  getting 
 like  a  good  level  of  success  you  might 
 be  watching  this  if  you've  not  got  that
[149:58] just  yet  but  there's  going  to  be  a  time 
 if  you  follow  the  principles  from  this 
 full  guide  that  you  do  get  like  a  really
[150:03] good  level  of  success  and  this  concept 
 is  probably  hopefully  going  to  be  in 
 your  mind  thinking  Should  I  stick  or
[150:09] should  I  twist  here  should  I  just  start 
 enjoying  my  life  now  and  I  want  to 
 reframe  your  mind  this  is  not  about
[150:14] abstinence  this  is  not  about  like  hating 
 yourself  and  not  rewarding  yourself  and 
 not  enjoying  yourself  I  think  this  is
[150:21] the  opposite  way  I  think  the  best 
 enjoyment  in  life  comes  from  when  you 
 continuously  keep  disciplining  yourself
[150:27] not  when  you  like  reward  yourself  in 
 what  the  modern  world  considers  the
[150:32] reward  from  what  we  like  you  know  our 
 perception  of  what  the  reward  and  of
[150:37] what  enjoying  success  is  genuinely  our 
 perception  of  it  is  so  incredibly 
 cancerous  we  think  it's  spending  all  the
[150:43] money  we  think  it's  buying  like  the  nice 
 car  and  stuff  and  you  know  it's  like 
 taking  the  holiday  and  everything  and
[150:49] these  things  seem  nice  but  when  you 
 really  think  why  we  have  these  desires 
 it's  literally  just  because  we  like  you
[150:54] know  the  nice  car  if  we're  totally 
 honest  you  know  every  guy  will  cope  and 
 say  no  but  I  really  like  the  exhaust 
 engine  and  wherever  the  truth  is  if
[151:00] we're  really  honest  the  nice  car  the 
 reason  why  we're  spending  100K  through 
 or  however  much  on  a  nice  car  that  you
[151:05] know  the  dream  car  that  we've  got  the 
 reason  why  is  because  we're  hoping  that 
 someone  on  the  street  does  this
[151:11] that  that  Little  Neck  turn  is  why  we'll 
 go  and  sacrifice  our  future  we're  hoping
[151:16] that  a  girl  just  slightly  opens  up  her 
 legs  for  us  and  we're  thinking  yep  see 
 valid  like  I'm  nice  and  validated  see  I
[151:22] am  worthy  of  Love  after  all  because 
 there  was  that  one  day  that  my  mother 
 when  I  was  four  years  old  didn't  respond 
 to  my  tears  and  this  is  why  I  need  this
[151:28] woman  with  her  stinky  hole  today 
 this  is  where  most  men  are  headed 
 towards  and  it's  utterly  important  for
[151:34] you  to  induce  some  stoicism  right  now 
 and  to  really  start  to  clarify  your 
 desires  but  I  think  that  the  best  life
[151:40] we  may  be  able  to  have  is  one  of 
 continuous  discipline  to  ever  strive  for
[151:45] more  not  Material  success  but  more  from 
 ourselves 
 to  realize  the  potential  that  we  could
[151:51] get  to 
 to  realize  that  it  was  never  about  these 
 material  desires  the  money  the  status
[151:57] the  subscribers  it  was  never  about  that 
 it  was  about  having  something
[152:02] challenging 
 that  we  actually  liked 
 that  hopefully  contributed
[152:08] to  the  world  in  some  way 
 when  you  reframe  your  mind  with  the
[152:14] things  you're  disciplining  and  you  start 
 to  see  them  purely  for  this  thing  of 
 like  I  want  to  challenge  myself  I  want
[152:20] to  get  better  I  want  to  contribute  to 
 the  world  in  some  way 
 that's  when  I  think  you  start  to  feel
[152:26] like  you're  getting  rewarded  every 
 single  time  you  work  people  see  you
[152:31] working 
 you're  actually  just  playing  you  see  the 
 guys  who  are  at  the  absolute  top  of  like
[152:37] you  know  every  niche  of  sport  of 
 business  whatever  it's  play  time  for
[152:42] them  they  have  more  fun  than  everyone 
 else  why 
 because  to  them  it  genuinely  is
[152:47] enjoyable  because  they  don't  care  about 
 the  results  when  you  really  look  at  the 
 best  businessmen  out  there  not  to  the
[152:53] ones  who  have  allowed  us  who  get  the 
 most  views  on  Instagram  and  you  know 
 YouTube  these  are  like  literally  Petty 
 influencers  a  lot  of  them  are  lying
[152:59] about  their  success  but  when  you  see 
 like  the  top  tier  like  we're  talking
[153:04] hundreds  of  billions  [ __ ]  Sam  Walton 
 the  guy  who  made  Walmart  and  that  like 
 you  know  Jeff  Bezos  and  stuff  bro  they
[153:10] don't  party  they  wear  the  same  clothes 
 every  day  they  literally  like  to  wake  up 
 and  experience  their  life  their
[153:17] day-to-day  that's  what  their  reward  is 
 imagine  that  the  strength  of  a  man  who
[153:24] what  he  wants  out  of  life  is  his 
 day-to-day  routine  compared  to  the 
 strength  of  the  man  who  wants  the  fancy
[153:30] car  who  needs  the  private  jet  who  wants 
 the  you  know  the  group  of  women  in  his 
 Instagram  picture  because  that  validates
[153:36] him  in  some  way 
 those  things  can  be  nice  you  know  you
[153:41] can  say  oh  I'm  just  coping  I'm  a  broker 
 I  don't  have  those  things  you  can 
 believe  that  if  you  want  but  I  wish  my
[153:46] younger  self  was  able  to  watch  this 
 guide  because  I'd  tell  him  one  thing 
 right  now  when  you  use  discipline
[153:51] consistently 
 you  will  build  the  success 
 and  when  you  build  the  success
[153:58] the  distractions  will  come 
 and  if  you  do  get  distracted  by  them
[154:03] you'll  lose  the  success  you'll  lose  the 
 discipline  and  you'll  just  go  back  down
[154:08] and  what  a  horrible  life  that  is  to  just 
 choose  like  you  know  the  this  little
[154:13] tiny  puny  Mountain  that  is  nowhere  near 
 your  capability  to  climb  up  and  then
[154:18] down  again  and  then  you  know  a  few  years 
 later  when  you  get  pissed  off  and  you 
 realize  oh  man  I've  just  wasted  three 
 years  with  this  degenerate  woman  you
[154:23] know  like  this  [ __ ]  relationship  that 
 I'm  in  and  I  got  kind  of  fat  again  let's 
 climb  up  the  mountain  again  and  then
[154:28] let's  get  to  like  level  six  and  then 
 let's  go  down  again  let's  get  to  level 
 six  again  and  let's  go  down  again  let's 
 get  to  level  six  again  let's  go  down
[154:33] again  this  is  most  people's  experiences 
 in  my  experience  for  a  very  long  time 
 how  about  getting  to  level  seven  how
[154:38] about  getting  to  level  eight  and  nine 
 and  ten  and  into  Infinity
[154:43] da  is  how  you  start  to  find  your  purpose 
 I  believe  this  is  how  you  start  to  find
[154:49] God  I  believe  this  is  how  you  start  to 
 find  like  genuine  fulfillments  in  life
[154:54] so  for  this  actionable  step  let's  do  a 
 visualization  together  whatever  you're 
 working  hard  on  right  now  if  you  imagine
[155:00] yourself  that  you've  finally  got  the 
 real  world  material  success  that  you've
[155:06] thought  that  you've  wanted  all  this  time 
 if  you've  been  working  hard  in  your 
 fitness  journey  maybe  it's  the  physique
[155:11] maybe  it's  the  Instagram  followers  of 
 your  Fitness  page  if  you've  been  working 
 hard  in  business  then  maybe  it's  the
[155:16] money  and  you  know  it's  the  Instagram 
 pictures  of  you  in  the  car  and  the  watch 
 maybe  it's  the  girl  and  after  a  few
[155:23] weeks  of  this  or  months  of  this 
 how's  it  going  to  feel  when  you  finally 
 look  back  to  the  analytics  the  data
[155:30] and  you  realize  that  you've  genuinely 
 significantly
[155:35] backtracked 
 you're  not  waking  up  at  5am  anymore  now
[155:40] are  you  because  you've  already  got  the 
 girl
[155:45] so  what's  gonna  happen  to  all  of  the 
 material  success  then  the  girl  the  money 
 the  car  the  likes
[155:52] when  you  aren't  doing  the  things  to 
 maintain  that 
 foreign
[155:57] step  5.1  slow  down 
 a  friend  of  mine  and  a  very  intelligent
[156:02] man  who's  really  good  at  business  his 
 name's  Andrew  Kirby  and  he  gave  me  some 
 advice  that  I  want  to  give  you  here  I
[156:08] sent  him  a  message  saying  you  know  he 
 knows  quite  a  lot  about  me  my  business 
 and  I  said  to  him  like  you  know  what's 
 some  advice  you'd  have  for  me  at  this
[156:14] stage  and  his  advice  was  slow  down 
 that  the  success  that  I  had  gotten  so
[156:20] far  was  probably  largely  due  to  the  fact 
 that  I  was  quite  fast  I  was  fast  to
[156:25] implement  things  if  I  had  an  idea  like 
 this  new  business  or  this  type  of  video 
 I'd  implement  it  very  quickly  which
[156:31] meant  that  I  was  someone  who  was  taking 
 action  I  was  an  action  taker  at  the 
 start  of  business  at  the  start  of  like
[156:37] your  journey  in  any  Endeavor  for 
 discipline  that  is  amazing
[156:42] later  on  when  you've  already  started  to 
 see  success 
 that  actually  really  really  bad  so  in
[156:49] his  text  message  back  to  me  he  said  in 
 the  early  days  you're  like  a  speedboat
[156:54] it's  very  important  that  you  can  correct 
 course  and  be  able  to  like  realign 
 yourself  and  you  know  move  quickly  but
[156:59] once  you've  built  the  success  it's  more 
 like  a  cruise  ship
[157:04] set  the  direction  and  go  there  you  don't 
 want  to  stop  and  alter  courses  too  often
[157:10] thinking  about  that  analogy  if  you're 
 closer  to  the  start  of  this  journey  in
[157:15] some  area  let's  say  with  Fitness  it's 
 way  better  for  you  to  move  like  a 
 speedboat  be  quick  for  example  you  get
[157:20] the  thought  maybe  I  want  to  start  going 
 to  the  gym  you  sign  up  to  the  gym 
 immediately  and  literally  go  within  24
[157:25] hours  from  now  you  get  the  thought  maybe 
 I  want  to  try  martial  arts  you  sign  up 
 to  the  gym  and  go  literally  within  24
[157:30] hours  from  now  the  same  with  you  know 
 there's  going  to  be  so  many  guys 
 watching  this  who  want  to  be  YouTubers 
 and  they've  been  thinking  about  this  for
[157:35] the  last  like  a  year  the  route  to 
 success  like  in  these  early  levels  is 
 literally  just  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  and  just
[157:42] start  immediately  speedboat  go  fast  make 
 your  first  video  within  24  hours  from 
 now  and  then  you'll  start  to  you  know
[157:48] feel  it  out  you'll  start  to  see  what's 
 happening  but  if  you're  specifically 
 watching  this  because  you're  later  in
[157:53] this  in  this  journey  or  you  know  that 
 you'll  eventually  get  here 
 going  fast  is  actually  going  to  be  a
[157:59] detriment  and  this  is  something  which 
 I'm  struggling  with  because  when  you've 
 been  fast  that's  how  you  get  that 
 earlier  success  but  soon  going  fast  is  a
[158:05] bad  thing  when  I  go  fast  now 
 it's  chaotic
[158:11] when  I  go  fast  I  end  up  literally  like 
 abandoning  a  whole  product  that  I've
[158:16] made  and  I  literally  have  refunded  over 
 a  hundred  people  in  one  day  not  only  did
[158:22] I  like  literally  like  20  or  30  or 
 however  much  thousand  it  was  left  my 
 like  bank  account  in  one  day  but  also  it
[158:29] just  took  like  [ __ ]  six  hours  to  go 
 through  like  every  imagine  like  manually 
 going  through  like  you  know  for  my 
 assistance  and  I  did  it  as  well  because
[158:35] it  was  just  like  a  really  really  hectic 
 day 
 you  don't  want  to  experience  something
[158:40] like  that  and  that's  because  when  you 
 get  these  ideas  and  these  new  fantasies
[158:46] and  and  you  know  like  this  new  project 
 that  you  want  to  build  on  at  this  level
[158:51] it's  actually  important  for  you  to  slow 
 down  and  to  really  question  it  and  to 
 journal  it  and  to  ask  a  bunch  of
[158:57] questions  and  so  the  way  that  I 
 personally  do  this  now  is  with  what  I 
 call  a  decision  making  framework  it's
[159:03] essentially  it's  just  a  list  of 
 questions  that  I  ask  myself  when  I'm 
 making  a  decision  so  that  I  end  up
[159:08] making  decisions  quite  slower  instead  of 
 you  know  just  the  decision  being  just  in 
 my  mind  and  often  those  are  based  on
[159:14] like  emotions  you've  probably  heard  like 
 you  could  literally  have  an  emotion 
 because  you  ate  sugar  yesterday  or  you
[159:19] had  like  too  much  coffee  this  morning 
 and  that  emotion  coupled  with  some  sleep 
 deprivation  coupled  with  a  bit  of
[159:24] influence  from  something  you've  seen 
 online  maybe  one  of  my  videos  you  end  up 
 like  literally  like  deciding  on  a
[159:29] decision  that  changes  your  future 
 without  realizing  it  probably  just 
 happened  because  you  ingested  sugar
[159:35] yesterday  at  this  level  right  now 
 any  of  these  extra  Desires  in  your  mind 
 any  of  these  extra  decisions  could  be
[159:41] extremely  chaotic  and  they  could  be  very 
 stupid  and  so  my  decision  making 
 framework  which  I'll  walk  you  through
[159:46] right  now  is  an  actionable  step  is  one 
 way  where  it  forces  me  to  take  like  a
[159:51] few  minutes  to  be  sat  here  often  I  do  it 
 first  thing  in  the  morning  when  I'm 
 actually  just  here  in  front  of  my
[159:56] computer  with  like  the  the  list  of 
 messages  like  the  list  of  questions  that 
 I  have  to  put  a  decision  through  and
[160:02] I'll  walk  you  through  it  right  now  it 
 has  the  exact  like  step-by-step  protocol 
 but  what  I  do  right  so  for  example  my
[160:07] mind  could  have  just  generated  a  thought 
 like  a  desire  of  should  I  make  this  new 
 product  should  I  change  the  style  of  my
[160:14] videos  these  are  huge  huge  questions  to 
 be  thinking  about  so  this  is  what  I  put
[160:19] them  through  I  get  the  thought  and  I 
 come  in  to  a  notes  page  doesn't  matter
[160:25] which  software  you  use  I  literally  just 
 use  the  normal  iPhone  Notes  you  don't 
 need  anything  fancy  and  I  put  that  as
[160:30] the  title  I  literally  just  write  it  as  a 
 question  should  I  change  the  videos  from 
 what  they  are  now  to  this  new  style  that
[160:37] I'm  thinking  of  in  my  mind  and  this  is  a 
 series  of  questions  that  I  ask  myself
[160:42] first  of  all what's  the  question  or 
 what's  the  decision  to  be  made  just 
 write  it  out  by  the  way  this  is  probably 
 about  50  of  the  battle  if  you  write  the
[160:49] decision  out  on  paper  on  PC  normally 
 like  you've  just  instantly  left  this
[160:55] like  weak  emotional  state  and  you're 
 looking  at  it  logically  so  this  is  the 
 most  important  question  just  write  it
[161:00] out  what's  the  question  what's  the 
 decision  the  second  question  is  where 
 did  this  thought  stem  from  originally
[161:05] was  it  something  someone  said  to  you 
 something  you  saw  from  others  on  social 
 media  try  and  dig  to  find  its  Origins
[161:12] you  know  how  important  this  question  is 
 like  where  did  this  desire  come  from 
 because  sometimes  I've  wrote  down  there
[161:19] was  someone  in  the  gym  who  was  bigger 
 than  me 
 and  then  I'm  realizing  how  stupid  it  is
[161:24] or  I've  rolled  out  I  saw  like  a  [ __ ] 
 Andrew  Tate  shot  and  that's  where  this 
 desire  this  decision  has  come  from  and
[161:30] I'm  like  okay  that's  probably  a  stupid 
 like  place  to  make  a  decision  from  so 
 just  by  writing  okay  I  saw  something  on
[161:35] social  media  you  kind  of  realize  like  oh 
 yeah  this  this  decision  is  probably 
 stupid  as  [ __ ]  because  it's  come  from
[161:40] like  you  know  like  a  low  quality  place 
 the  third  question  is  what  is  the  dream 
 result  so  of  this  area  what  is  already
[161:45] like  your  big  goal  in  it  so  for  example 
 for  me  with  YouTube  it  might  be  like  a 
 specific  goal  if  I  want  to get  to  5
[161:51] million  subscribers  next  year  or  it 
 might  be  for  example  more  of  a  wholesome 
 intention  of  like  you  know  I  want  to 
 contribute  to  the  body  of  knowledge  what
[161:57] is  like  the  end  point  that  you're  first 
 trying  to  get  to  then  an  interesting 
 question  think  about  alternative  options
[162:03] to  achieve  the  same  result  so  I've  got 
 the  dream  result  you  know  the  5  million 
 subscribers  and  the  question  is  you  know
[162:09] should  I  change  my  videos  in  this  style 
 that  I'm  currently  thinking  of  but  this 
 question  think  about  the  alternative 
 option  suddenly  I'm  bullet  pointing  well
[162:16] I  could  probably  just  continue  doing  the 
 same  videos  I  could  change  them 
 completely  to  this  new  idea  I  could
[162:22] maybe  maybe  post  one  video  with  this  new 
 idea  instead  of  changing  it  completely 
 that  sounds  way  more  like  reasonable  I
[162:28] could  you  know  ask  people  on  the 
 community  post  what  they'd  think  about 
 it  and  I'd  probably  get  a  thousand 
 replies  so  that'd  be  pretty  good  data
[162:34] and  suddenly  you  start  to  think  okay 
 probably  this  decision  that's  in  my  mind 
 is  probably  a  little  bit  too  extreme
[162:39] there's  alternative  options  that  I  can 
 consider  instead  of  needing  to  do  this 
 exact  thing  that  my  mind  is  fantasizing
[162:45] on  then  I  have  more  like  an  actionable 
 step  for  myself  which  this  is  exactly 
 what  it  reads  if  this  is  a  big  decision
[162:50] of  high  leverage  go  and  get  a  response 
 from  a  smart  person  first  and  see  what
[162:55] they  say  about  this  decision  and  so  I've 
 got  a  list  of  like  smart  people  that  I 
 know  we've  got  Andrew  we've  got  Victor
[163:00] some  ovens  Chris  Williamson  my  brother 
 the  my  girl  Chachi  BT  literally  Chachi
[163:05] BT  is  like  a  smart  person  that  I  ask 
 these  questions  to  because  sometimes 
 I've  had  these  decisions  and  big  desires 
 and  I've  ended  up  speaking  to  like  one
[163:11] of  these  intelligent  people  and  they'll 
 be  like  comes  a  year  old  for  thinking 
 this  is  like  way  too  dramatic  or
[163:16] something  like  that  you  know  like 
 another  person  who's  not  emotionally 
 invested  into  this  will  look  from  the 
 outside  and  tell  you  no  no  you're
[163:21] thinking  not  right  here  it  might  be 
 better  doing  it  like  this  what's  making 
 you  think  that  ah  then  I  have  a  question
[163:26] what  would  my  85  year  old  self  think 
 about  this  decision  this  is  something  I
[163:31] learned  from  Alex  hamosi  like  one  of  his 
 videos  he  spoke  about  this  we  think  of 
 like  this  Grandpa  frame  when  you're
[163:37] imagining  yourself  either  really  elderly 
 or  maybe  on  your  deathbed  what  would  you 
 think  about  this  decision  is  it  minor
[163:43] would  you  look  back  and  think  like  okay 
 this  was  just  stupid  oftentimes  this 
 kind  of  calibrates  my  life  a  bit
[163:49] differently  because  right  now  I'm  super 
 work  obsessed  like  that's  where  I  am  in 
 life  but  when  I  ask  this  question  what
[163:54] would  my  85  year  old  self  think  of  this 
 decision  for  example  the  decision  is 
 something  that  might  take  me  away  from
[163:59] my  family  or  my  girl  or  friends  or 
 something  I'll  often  ask  myself  what 
 would  my  85  year  old  self  think  and  I'd
[164:05] write  oh  yeah  he'd  probably  think  it  was 
 just  silly  that  like  I  already  had  quite 
 a  lot  of  success  and  money  and 
 subscribers  why  was  I  sacrificing
[164:11] something  that  mattered  more  and  finally 
 the  last  point  of  this  framework  that 
 you  can  copy  to  make  decisions  is
[164:16] literally  just  the  text  which  says 
 decision  made  with  a  colon  an  idea  is 
 that  I  just  write  like  okay  what  I've
[164:21] decided  on  this  here 
 takes  a  few  minutes  but  it  takes  you  out
[164:26] of  this  emotional  state  and  it  makes  you 
 slow  down  and  just  that  could  be
[164:32] honestly  like  this  might  save  you  years 
 of  your  life 
 you  might  end  up  like  you  know  because
[164:38] decisions  are  really  how  we  become 
 successful  decisions  is  you  know  it's 
 discipline  what  are  you  going  to  decide
[164:43] today  is  it  easy  path  or  the  hard  path 
 that  you're  going  to  decide  the 
 long-term  thing  or  the  short  term  think 
 when  you  become  slightly  better  at
[164:49] decisions  just  because  you've  got  a 
 framework  like  this  your  life  might 
 change  forever  so  I'm  actually  very 
 happy  to  share  that  with  you  and  I
[164:54] really  do  hope  it  serves  you  as  well  as 
 it  served  me  step  5.2  be  strict  with
[164:59] yourself  but  tolerance  with  others  by 
 this  point  you've  already  started  to
[165:04] build  a  great  level  of  discipline  and 
 you've  started  to  see  the  success  of 
 that  which  is  wonderful  this  is  where
[165:09] many  young  guys  they've  asked  me  how  do 
 they  get  their  parents  on 
 self-improvement  how  do  they  get  their
[165:15] friends  to  start  working  out  then 
 quitting  these  bad  habits 
 through  my  years  of  doing  this  work  I've
[165:21] always  advised  you  know  let's  help  them 
 let's  do  this  try  and  do  this  try  and  do 
 this  and  I'm  slightly  ashamed  bro  but  I
[165:27] understand  now  that  I  have 
 never  been  able  to  help  someone  in  this
[165:32] situation 
 every  young  man  which  is  over  maybe  100 
 or  200  by  now  that  you  know  I've  spoke
[165:38] to  of  this  specific  problem  comments  and 
 video  calls  and  whatever  right
[165:43] it  has  always  failed  like  our  plan  to
[165:48] help  this  young  man  help  someone  else 
 always  failed
[165:55] why 
 because  you  can  be  strict  with  yourself 
 you  really  want  this  right  you  really
[166:02] want  to  improve  your  life  you  really 
 want  to  get  the  success  and  everything 
 you're  here  watching  a  video  like  this 
 and  so  me  giving  you  this  advice  and
[166:08] being  a  bit  strict  with  you  works  but 
 the  people  in  your  life  your  friends 
 your  family  they  don't  care  as  much  they
[166:15] might  say  that  they  like  they  want  this 
 but  they  really  don't  I  understand  how 
 saddening  and  depressing  it  is  seeing
[166:20] the  people  you  love  waste  away 
 but  you  can't  force  anyone  to  get  onto
[166:26] self-improvement  and  be  disciplined  into 
 delay  gratification  these  things  are 
 hard  enough  when  you  really  want  them
[166:31] and  so  when  there's  someone  who  doesn't 
 even  want  them  as  much 
 there's  not  much  hope  there  but  there  is
[166:36] something  practical  that  we  can  do 
 you  set  a  fantastic  example  you  lead  by
[166:43] example  you  keep  disciplining  yourself 
 you  keep  getting  to  the  next  level  you 
 don't  indulge  in  the  desires  that  arise
[166:49] you  know  the  success  that  leads  to  the 
 distractions  you  keep  disciplining 
 yourself  and  maybe  hopefully  one  day  the
[166:55] people  that  we  love  will  be  inspired  by 
 that  and  that's  when  they'll  come 
 towards  us  that's  when  they'll  really
[167:01] really  want  to  change  and  that's  when  we 
 can  maybe  help  them 
 when  I  moved  back  home  here  to  my
[167:07] parents  house  when  I  was  22  years  old  I 
 was  a  very  different  man  than  what  my
[167:12] family  knew  my  family  knew  me  as  like 
 you  know  the  video  gamer  and  they 
 probably  smelled  like  my  room  smelling
[167:17] of  [ __ ] 
 for  10  years  right 
 and  suddenly  I  came  back  with  this  idea
[167:23] of  being  disciplined  and  you  know  I'm 
 doing  these  crazy  things  that  you  know 
 it  was  locked  down  but  I  would  literally
[167:28] get  a  weighted  backpack  and  just  go  for 
 runs  and  I'd  go  run  specifically  through 
 like  wet  muddy  fields  and  everything
[167:34] just  to  get  uncomfortable  kind  of 
 remember  this  moments  when  I  started 
 waking  up  super  early  and  it  felt
[167:40] amazing  to  do  it  you  know  really 
 disciplined  and  I  felt  really  strong  I'm 
 listening  to  can't  hurt  me  by  David
[167:45] Goggins  and  I  um I  wake  up  it's  you  know 
 the  silent  quiet  enthusiasm  of  the  night
[167:50] time  or  of  the  morning  time  it's  like  5 
 a.m  and  I  go  downstairs  and  I've  got  my
[167:55] earphones  in  listening  to  can't  hurt  me 
 and  I'm  filling  up  the  water  bottle 
 and  my  dad  walks  him  now  my  dad  wakes  up
[168:02] super  early  5  a.m  4  30  whatever  and  he's 
 gonna  go  drive  the  taxi
[168:07] and  he  walks  in  through  the  kitchen  and 
 he's  almost  like  taking  him  back  you 
 know  he's  probably  shocked  because  he's
[168:12] never  seen  me  awake  at  the  same  time 
 that  he's  he  wakes  up  at  4  30  to  work 
 right
[168:17] and  his  youngest  son  the  guy  who's  been 
 a  degenerate  for  as  much  as  he's  known 
 me  who's  been  addicted  to  video  games  is
[168:24] there  in  gym  clothes  with  earphones  on 
 filling  up  my  bottle  and  he  says  like 
 wait  what  oh  like  oh  you're  awake
[168:29] couldn't  you  sleep 
 I  remember  saying  to  him  like  oh  no  I'm 
 going  for  a  run
[168:34] his  his  I  promise  you  the  noise  he  went 
 he  made  was  eh
[168:39] like  an  Asian  parent  eh  yeah
[168:44] he's  asking  me  like  if  I'm  okay  and 
 everything  I  couldn't  I  sleep  I  said  I 
 don't know  like  I  woke  up  on  purpose
[168:49] it's  pitch  black  outside  this  is  not 
 something  that  you  know  me  or  my  family 
 do  like  you  know  there's  hard  discipline
[168:54] stuff  it's  Pitch  Black  it's  probably 
 cold  and  still  I  literally  went  for  a 
 run  at  this  point  fast  forward  a  few
[168:59] years  from  that  moment 
 and  my  dads  went  through  a 
 transformation  of  his  own  he's  reduced
[169:04] how  much  alcohol  he  drinks  he's  improved 
 his  diet  I  see  him  training  he  goes  to 
 the  gym  he  plays  badminton  and  for  most
[169:10] of  all  for  the  like  the  biggest  thing 
 that  he  cares  about  is  cricket 
 and  over  the  last  year  he  kept  on
[169:16] sharing  like  screenshots  to  our  family 
 group  chat  of  like  these  um you  know  the
[169:21] websites  that  post  like  a  cricket  result 
 like  a  match  result  and  his  team  keeps 
 winning  and  he  keeps  getting  like  man  of
[169:27] the  match  and  he's  like  he's  the  bowler 
 and  he  keeps  getting  like  uh  promoted  or 
 whatever  you're  like  recognized
[169:32] is  the  team  captain  now 
 now  of  course  this  is  his  this  is  his 
 effort  of  course  but  I  can  see  like
[169:38] maybe  you  know  I'm  taking  a  bit  of  the 
 credit  who  knows  but  like  I  can  see  a 
 bit  of  a  link  between  like  me  being
[169:43] there  at  5am  and  being  this  excellent 
 example  for  myself  and  for  my  family  and
[169:48] for  the  world  and  my  dad  and  maybe  and 
 hopefully  in  some  ways  getting  inspired 
 by  that  and  thinking  yeah  like  you  know
[169:53] yeah  we  work  hard  yeah  we  kind  of  like 
 exercise  and  everything 
 any  like  w  in  the  chat  is  what  all  these
[170:00] internet  people  say  my  dad  is  the  team 
 captain  of  his  Cricket  Club  now
[170:05] so  yeah  that's  just  my  story  man  if
[170:10] I  think  that's  the  best  way  to  help  the 
 people  that  you  love 
 set  a  fantastic  example  step  six  what  to
[170:16] do  when  you  fall  off  at  any  point  during 
 this  journey  whether  it's  straight  away
[170:21] or  when  you've  built  up  a  good  level  of 
 success  there  must  be  a  bit  when  this 
 climb  starts  to  dip  down  there  must  be
[170:28] you  know  when  you  look  at  the  the  graph 
 of  success  in  any  area  weight  loss
[170:33] business  subscribers  whatever 
 hopefully  you  see  over  time  it  goes  like
[170:39] this  right  sweet 
 when  you  zoom  in  and  you  see  like  you 
 know  really  what  it  looks  like  day  to
[170:45] day  it's  like  this  it  literally  feels 
 random  if  you've  ever  tracked  your  body 
 weight  every  single  day  on  like  a
[170:51] bathroom  scale  you  know  so  you're  seeing 
 how  much  you  weigh  you  know  this  right 
 it's  not  like  it's  just  exactly  like  170
[170:57] pounds  and  it  goes  down  by  0.15  pounds 
 every  single  day  you  know  so  it's 
 completely  like  linear  it's  not  it's  so
[171:03] weird  it's  like  you  could  eat  the  same 
 calories  drink  the  same  amount  of  water 
 and  for  some  reason  your  weight  tomorrow 
 will  be  two  pounds  lower  even  though
[171:09] like  you  ate  like  a  cheat  meal  today  and 
 you  know  it's  like  it's  always  like  this 
 until  you  zoom  out  and  it's  been  a  week
[171:15] it's  been  a  month  now  you  see  like  more 
 of  a  trend  this  is  what  we  need  to  get 
 used  to  there's  gonna  be  many  days  where
[171:21] you  feel  like  you've  fallen  off 
 it's  that  it's  this  like  this  this  day
[171:27] and  so  what  do  you  do  because  for  a  lot 
 of  guys  when  they  experience  this  day 
 that's  when  they'll  change  their  plan
[171:33] that's  when  they'll  be  too  fast  that's 
 when  they'll  start  thinking  oh  you  know 
 I've  got  to  hurt  myself  more  I've  gotta
[171:38] you  know  I'll  double  the  the  cardio  and 
 I'll  eat  even  less  than  a  you  know  I'll 
 do  this  I'll  get  super  super  hard  right
[171:45] that's  the  wrong  mindset  because  the 
 better  thing  to  do  when  you  experience  a 
 day  like  this
[171:50] is  to  try  your  best  to  stick  to  the 
 exact  same  plan  as  before 
 is  to  understand  that  some  of  the  days
[171:55] are  going  to  be  like  this  and  some  of 
 the  days  are  going  to  be  like  that  and 
 they'll  average  out  if  your  plan  was  set
[172:00] in  the  right  direction  many  people  will 
 change  their  plan  on  the  first  bad  day 
 and  then  again  it's  like  that  same
[172:05] concept  of  just  moving  too  fast  making 
 too  many  like  shallow  decisions  and 
 they're  all  over  the  place  and  they're 
 all  like  fickle  with  their  plans  and  the
[172:12] goals  that  being  said  if  you  notice 
 yourself  falling  off  at  least  more  than 
 like  a  few  days  in  a  row  it's  been  weeks
[172:17] it's  been  months  for  example  since  you 
 last  meditated  let's  say  you  got  into 
 meditation  at  some  point  earlier  this
[172:22] year 
 and  then  you  like  you  literally  just 
 haven't  meditated  in  so  long  many  people
[172:27] will  live  with  that  regret  inside  of 
 their  mind  and  not  really  do  much  for  it 
 defining  the  problem  is  three  quarters
[172:34] of  the  answer  just  ants  like  literally 
 just  writing  down  the  problem  so  if
[172:39] you're  here  right  now  and  specifically 
 you  know  you've  got  this  vague  pain  in 
 your  mind  of  like  I've  been  slacking  in
[172:44] meditation  for  the  last  six  months  you 
 just  taking  that  from  your  mind  and 
 writing  it  down  pen  piece  of  paper  or
[172:50] like  I  use  iPhone  Notes  I've  missed  most 
 of  my  meditation  sessions  for  the  last 
 six  months
[172:55] why 
 then  your  brain  will  actually  start  to 
 be  productive  why  have  I  missed  it
[173:02] I  don't  really  want  to  do  him 
 I  don't  find  them  fun  I'm  not  sure  if 
 they're  actually  that  productive
[173:07] then  you  start  asking  more  questions  is 
 this  reasonable  is  it  rational  is  it
[173:12] logical 
 probably  not  because  you  know  I  know  the 
 scientific  research  meditation  has
[173:17] proven  to  be  effective  maybe  I'm  just 
 coping  maybe  I'm  just  procrastinating 
 but  I  just  don't  know  why  I'm  not
[173:23] getting  consistent  in  it  then  you  ask 
 some  more  questions  you  almost  have  like 
 a  step-by-step  you  know  as  we  did  with
[173:29] the  decisions  but  with  like  I've  fallen 
 off  framework 
 what  could  I  do  to  get  back  on  easier
[173:36] well  I  could  start  doing  meditation  in 
 my  morning  routine  again  because  I  was 
 really  consistent  when  I  did  that  I
[173:42] could  reduce  the  time  that  I  meditate 
 for  because  in  my  mind  like  it's  hard  to
[173:47] start  meditating  with  20  minutes  again 
 but  if  I  started  with  like  three  minutes 
 for  the  first  week  I  could  easily  do
[173:52] three  minutes  and  you  know  a  week  from 
 now  I  could  do  five  minutes  and  two 
 weeks  from  then  I  could  do  10  minutes 
 and  you  know  a  month  or  two  months  from
[173:58] now  if  I  just  maintain  10  minutes  a  day 
 that's  already  really  good  but  I  reckon 
 two  months  from  now  I  could  probably  be 
 back  at  20  minutes  a  day  again  maybe  the
[174:05] problem  is  just  that  like  it's  too  hard 
 to  get  back  into  right  now  which  makes 
 sense  and  you  know  your  brain  starts
[174:11] ticking  and  it  starts  saying  like  oh 
 yeah  well  you  know  that  that's  really 
 reasonable  this  is  like  a  really 
 practical  way  to  get  back  to  where  I  can
[174:17] just  progressively  overload  if  I  made  it 
 super  easy  today  and  you  have  like  four 
 new  strategies  to  get  back  to  it  most
[174:22] people  will  literally  like  see 
 themselves  not  being  disciplined  they'll 
 keep  messing  up  on  their  goals  they'll
[174:28] keep  getting  into  a  rut  and  they'll 
 never  really  just  ask  their  brain 
 properly  with  you  know  pen  and  piece  of 
 paper  and  like  note  taking  or  whatever
[174:34] why  is  this  happening  most  people  people 
 just  keep  it  inside  of  their  brain
[174:39] and  your  brain's  thoughts  at  times  like 
 this  is  always  very  jumbled  it's  kind  of
[174:44] like  if  you  imagine  you  know  like  a  pair 
 of  earphones  like  wired  earphones  and 
 you  put  them  in  your  pocket  and  then  you
[174:49] bring  them  out  and  it's  like  all  in  like 
 a  ball  that's  what  your  brain's  thoughts 
 are  like  and  here's  you  like  looking  at
[174:54] the  ball  and  like  you  know  you're 
 getting  stressed  that  it's  a  ball  every 
 day  writing  things  down  is  like  when  you 
 take  those  earphones  and  you  start  to
[175:00] unravel  them 
 and  here  they  are  now  organized  that's
[175:05] 80  of  the  battle 
 so  if  you've  been  getting  this  thought 
 for  the  last  while  of  like  oh  man  you
[175:11] know  I'm  not  consistent  in  this  thing  I 
 keep  slacking  in  my  workouts  you  know  my 
 workout  performance  is  trash  I  keep
[175:16] skipping  my  diet  whatever  it  is  right  I 
 keep  relapsing  just  asking  the  question 
 why  is  this  happening  why  am  I  going
[175:22] through  this  pain  why  am  I  specifically 
 relapsing  why  am  I  grabbing  my  phone
[175:27] halfway  through  the  day  lying  in  bed  and 
 then  ending  up  relapsing  again
[175:32] and  the  answer  might  be  so  like  simple 
 you  might  just  literally  just  say  like 
 oh  it's  because  like  I'm  just  bored
[175:38] because  at  4  pm  I've  got  nothing  good  to 
 do  so  I  just  get  bored  and  I  just  end  up 
 fapping  again
[175:43] how  could  I  solve  that 
 I  could  have  something  to  do  at  4pm
[175:49] like  go  on  a  walk  go  read 
 okay  let's  try  tomorrow  so  this  is
[175:54] exactly  what  you  do  if  you  find  yourself 
 falling  off  you  create  yourself  a  I've
[175:59] messed  up  system  you've  got  like  these 
 few  reminders  that  you  can  have  you  only 
 need  them  on  for  like  a  couple  of  days
[176:05] till  it  becomes  you  know  like  a  bit  more 
 clear  that's  the  new  habit  that  you're 
 gonna  have  and  then  finally  but  very
[176:10] importantly  you  document  this  mess  up 
 this  rut  somewhere  that  you  can  look
[176:15] back  on  again  iPhone  Notes  works  really 
 well  you  make  almost  like  this  Bank  of
[176:21] like  times  that  you've  messed  up  and 
 principles  and  Frameworks  that  you've 
 used  to  come  out  of  this  so  that
[176:27] preferably  you  never  go  through  the  same 
 problem  again  imagine  if  you  literally 
 just  just  literally  a  folder  on  your
[176:32] iPhone  Notes  or  you  know  folder  on 
 notion  or  maybe  a  journal  I  would 
 suggest  doing  it  on  um  technology  which
[176:39] is  rare  for  me  to  say  if  you  watch  a 
 bunch  of  my  videos  you  know  for  a  fact  I 
 don't  often  say  like  I  do  this  on 
 technology  instead  of  paper  the  reason
[176:44] why  I  suggest  doing  it  with  technology 
 like  iPhone  Notes  or  notion  because  then 
 you  can  search  so  if  you  make  like  a  new
[176:50] folder  in  one  of  these  like  note  taking 
 and  having  something  to  do  with  like  I 
 messed  up  in  quotation  marks  I  messed  up
[176:56] you  can  then  start  a  document  with  each 
 time  that  you  feel  like  you've  messed  up 
 what  happened  why  it  happened  the
[177:02] decisions  and  Frameworks  and  mindsets 
 and  then  how  you  were  able  to  resolve  it 
 if  it  was  actually  resolved  and  what  was
[177:07] the  effective  thing  so  that  this  way  six 
 months  down  the  line  if  you  cut  yourself 
 thinking  like  oh  man  I've  not  been
[177:12] meditating  again  wasn't  this  a  problem  I 
 used  to  have  you  go  to  that  folder  you 
 search  for  meditation  since  it's  a
[177:17] computerized  system  there's  a  one  for 
 like  how  I  started  meditating  again  you 
 see  oh  yeah  like  I  did  I  fell  off
[177:22] meditation  and  then  I  got  back  on  it 
 because  I  just  sat  in  an  iPhone  alarm 
 and  I  said  that  I'd  do  three  minutes  a
[177:27] day  ah  recently  I've  been  saying  that 
 article  it's  got  to  be  half  an  hour  a 
 day  I  get  it  so  it's  got  to  be  just  all
[177:33] I've  got  to  do  is  discipline  myself  so 
 just  do  three  minutes  and  maybe  there 
 and  then  in  the  daytime  if  I  want  to  do
[177:38] more  I  can  do  but  if  I  discipline  myself 
 for  three  minutes  like  I  did  last  time 
 that  worked  last  time  I  can  try  it  again
[177:43] soon  you  start  to  have  this  collection 
 of  these  problems  that  you've  went
[177:48] through  and  ways  that  you've  solved  them 
 because  a  lot  of  problems  you  go  through 
 are  just  going  to  be  similar  I  learned 
 this  from  a  billionaire  named  Ray  dalio
[177:55] and  he  calls  this  like  principles  for 
 life  so  here's  your  actionable  step 
 create  your  I  messed  up  system  right  now
[178:03] just  spend  a  few  minutes  really  like 
 because  you  know  yourself  quite  well 
 what  would  work  for  you  when  you  find
[178:08] yourself  quite  aware  and  Vigilant  okay 
 I've  slacked  recently  I've  you  know  I've 
 been  missing  this  thing  I've  not  been
[178:13] doing  this  quite  well  what  would  work 
 for  you  what  questions  should  you  ask 
 should  you  write  this  on  paper  should
[178:18] you  like  you  know  ask  people  about  it 
 should  you  journal  and  write  a  note  and 
 how  could  you  in  the  future
[178:24] when  it's  likely  that  you  might  make  the 
 same  mistake  again 
 end  up  having  some  kind  of  place  you
[178:30] could  look  back  on  to  have  this  a 
 collection  of  knowledge  on  how  to  like 
 recover  from  this  rut  set  up  this  system
[178:36] right  now  you  don't  have  to  completely 
 copy  mine  you  know  yourself  quite  well 
 at  this  point  so  you  know  okay  I've
[178:41] fallen  off  on  these  things  these  are  the 
 things  that  I've  gotten  back  onto  how  do 
 I  consistently  set  this  up  so  my  future
[178:47] self  is  less  likely  to  experience  the 
 same  pains  that  I'm  going  through  today 
 step  seven
[178:52] remember  why  you  started  by  now  I've 
 taught  you  all  that  I  know  about
[178:57] discipline  I've  encapsulated  a  few  years 
 of  my  life  being  like  hyper  focused  on
[179:02] discipline  and  self-improvements  in  this 
 guide  for  you  and  the  one  final  message
[179:07] I  want  to  leave  you  with  is 
 one-off  purpose  and  Direction  and
[179:12] meaning  in  life 
 remember  why  you  started  this  this
[179:17] journey  of  self-improvement  and 
 discipline  who  you're  doing  it  for 
 because  it's  not  just  for  yourself  level
[179:22] one  thinking  is  like  yeah  you  know  it's 
 myself  I  want  to  you  know  build  more 
 muscle  and  I  want  to  make  more  money
[179:27] usually 
 the  internal  desire  that  we  have  is
[179:32] actually  for 
 other  people  and  so  if  you  just  close 
 your  eyes  one  last  time  with  me
[179:37] and  you  do  think  of  like  the  points  that 
 you  do  want  to  get  to
[179:42] and  other  people 
 their  lives  are  benefiting  because  of 
 your  hard  work  and  your  your  dedication
[179:48] and  your  discipline  here
[179:53] being  able  to  help  other  people  and 
 contribute  to  your  community 
 and  you  know  help  and  retire  your  family
[180:02] that's  what  discipline  is  all  about  this 
 is  not  only  for  us  but  it's  for  our
[180:08] future  children  to  not  have  to 
 experience  the  pain  of  poverty
[180:13] it's  for  our  future  wives  who  we  can 
 spoil  even  though  they  don't  you  know
[180:18] they're  not  materialistic  but  it's  like 
 would  be  able  to  like  you  know  buy  them 
 the  nice  thing  that 
 that  they're  surprised  by  we'd  be  able
[180:25] to  retire  our  future  wives  and  our 
 parents  and  our  fathers  who  have  worked 
 so  hard  and  even  our  distant  relatives
[180:32] just  because  of  the  fact  that  they  are 
 blood  related  to  us 
 really
[180:37] that's  what  the  material  success  of  of 
 discipline  is  the  one  major  thing  that  I
[180:42] that  I  want  for  my  own  like  selfish  game 
 and  everything  is  I  really  want  to  have
[180:47] like  positive  word  of  mouth  for  this 
 full  guide  and  for  all  of  them  that  I 
 work  really  hard  on  so  the  greatest  gift
[180:53] that  you  could  give  me  in  return  for 
 this  work  that  I'm  doing  here  is  just 
 when  it  is  relevant  in  your  normal  life
[181:01] mention  this  full  guide  to  someone 
 if  it  becomes  like  something  in  your 
 vocabulary  or  you  know  you  speak  to  a
[181:07] friend  you're  like  oh  you  should  watch 
 hamza's  full  guide  on  discipline  you  end 
 up  commenting  that  somewhere  in  the
[181:12] internet  you  know  oh  watch  Houses  full 
 guide  of  discipline 
 that  would  be
[181:18] my  task  here  like  that  would  mean  that 
 I've  done  an  awesome  job  if  this  video 
 starts  spreading  organically  through
[181:24] word  of  mouth  because  I  make  these  full 
 guides  as  part  of  this  movements  of
[181:29] young  men  who  want  something  better  out 
 of  life  who  want  to  get  onto 
 self-improvement  and  you  know  experience
[181:35] this  good  natural  healthy  life  that  we 
 should  have  in  these  days  again  with  the 
 media  and  the  influences  and  these  evil
[181:41] corporations  of  porn  and  everything 
 not  many  of  us  get  to  experience  the
[181:46] good  life 
 and  I've  realized  that  for  me
[181:51] it  does  seem  like  maybe  my  core  desire 
 you  know  my  core  purpose  or  maybe  you 
 want  to  like  the  the  purpose  layers  is
[181:59] to  teach  and  to  add  to  the  body  of 
 knowledge  like  the  education  of  young 
 men  or  something  I  feel  very  strongly
[182:04] for  so  that's  why  I  do  what  I  do  I  just 
 want  more  guys  out  there  to  learn
[182:09] lessons  like  this  finally  if  you  want  to 
 continue  learning  on  this  topic  it's 
 super  normal  for  a  YouTuber  to  end  their
[182:15] videos  by  trying  to  get  you  to  watch 
 more  of  their  videos  but  I'd  rather 
 direct  you  to  the  resources  that  I've
[182:21] learned  from  so  this  entire  video  has 
 been  inspired  by  the  book  discipline  is
[182:26] Destiny  by  Ryan  holiday  he  has  a  list  of 
 books  which  genuinely  like  have  changed
[182:31] my  life  another  one  is  ego  is  the  Enemy 
 by  Ryan  holiday  and  the  one  I'm
[182:36] currently  reading  is  courage  is  calling
