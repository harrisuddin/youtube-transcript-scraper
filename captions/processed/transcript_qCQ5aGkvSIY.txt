[00:00] for  the  first  time  in  a  month  Jeffrey 
 has  finally  left  his  dark  disgusting 
 damp  room  he's  been  motivated  by
[00:06] watching  Andrew  take  shorts  and  now  he's 
 gonna  finally  go  on  a  run  yay  Jeffrey 
 let's  do  it  he  leaves  this  house  and
[00:12] starts  waddling  away  this  is  the  most 
 exercise  that  young  Jeffrey  has  had  in  a 
 very  long  time  we're  so  proud  of  you
[00:17] Jeff  why  have  you  stopped  did  you  say 
 you  were  gonna  go  on  a  run  what's  he 
 doing  he  looks  like  he's  contemplating
[00:22] like  he's  thinking  don't  turn  around 
 Jeffrey  you're  literally  just  a  minute 
 away  I  guess  a  minute's  still  progress
[00:27] and  you  know  if  you  run  a  minute  back 
 home  then  that's  two  minutes  today  maybe 
 you  can  increase  bro  no  no  Jeffrey  what
[00:33] the  Jeffrey  went  out  for  a  run  he  ran 
 for  less  than  a  minute  we  thought  he  was 
 gonna  run  back  home  so  at  least  it  was
[00:38] gonna  be  something  but  he  just  hopped  on 
 an  electric  scooter  instead  Jeffrey 
 Adonis
[00:44] Adonis  is  climbing  Mount  Everest  and 
 he's  determined  to  reach  the  top  as  the 
 Earth  ends  and  he  struggles  to  catch  his
[00:50] breath  Adonis  pushes  on  his  muscles 
 begin  to  ache  and  his  body  screams  for 
 him  to  quit  but  Adonis  is  mentally  tough
[00:56] and  he  refuses  to  give  up  I  must  reach 
 the  top  Adonis  pushes  himself  harder
[01:01] than  he  has  ever  done  before  and 
 eventually 
 he  reaches  the  summit  he  sits  down  on  a
[01:06] rock  to  rest  and  take  in  his 
 surroundings  and  meditate  even  with  this 
 lack  of  oxygen  it  seems  like  the  whole
[01:12] world  is  laid  before  him  he  is  filled 
 with  gratitude  for  the  beauty  of  Nature
[01:17] and  the  mental  toughness  he  possesses 
 that  allowed  him  to  complete  his  journey 
 you  know  I've  seen  some  comments  of  guys
[01:23] who  don't  really  watch  our  videos  maybe 
 they've  just  clicked  on  a  random  one  and 
 I've  seen  them  genuinely  disbelieve  some
[01:29] of  the  stories  I  told  you  about  my 
 younger  days  where  you  know  like  I  play 
 a  lot  of  video  games  and  I  was  addicted
[01:34] to  porn  and  everything  I  was  addicted  to 
 weed  and  junk  food  and  stuff  and  I 
 always  saw  these  comments  and  they're 
 always  right  something  like  oh  yeah
[01:39] right  I  doubt  his  life  was  that  bad  and 
 everything  and  I  just  thought  bro  like 
 you  must  have  had  a  pretty  good  life 
 because  the  guys  who  can  relate  to  my
[01:44] life  know  that  the  stories  that  I've 
 told  you  they  could  not  be  faked  the 
 amount  of  detail  that  I've  went  in  to
[01:49] tell  you  the  real  experiences  I've  had 
 of  the  days  that  you  know  I'd  wake  up 
 and  jack  off  three  times  to  the  point
[01:54] that  my  PV  wasn't  even  hard  anymore  for 
 the  final  nut  or  the  times  that  I'd  be 
 smoking  weed  as  soon  as  I'd  wake  up
[01:59] through  the  day  at  night  time  and  I  was 
 just  high  all  the  time  and  I  was  eating 
 just  horrible  junk  food  people  who  have
[02:05] been  in  those  situations  I've  heard  so 
 many  times  from  the  guys  who  are 
 actually  a  part  of  our  culture  like  well
[02:10] I've  never  actually  heard  someone  like 
 describe  in  that  much  detail  like  that's 
 exactly  what  I  was  going  through  so  when
[02:15] I  tell  you  what  I  was  like  a  good  few 
 years  ago  you  must  believe  that  I  was  a
[02:20] total  I  was  a  coward  I  was  weak  and  I'm 
 certainly  not  Adonis  right  now  not  even 
 close  but  I  think  I've  made  some  pretty
[02:25] good  progress  I  went  from  being  that 
 stereotypical  skinny  neck  video  gamer
[02:30] who  just  ate  horrible  food  who 
 eventually  through  puberty  developed 
 breasts  like  gynecomastia  like  man  boobs
[02:36] because  my  testosterone  was  so  low  my 
 estrogen  would  have  been  so  high  because 
 I  was  genuinely  like  even  hormonally  to
[02:42] the  greatest  period  of  discipline  that  I 
 had  when  I  was  in  monk  mode  in  2020 
 because  you  know  I  had  been  stacking  up
[02:47] the  dopamine  the  instant  gratification 
 for  years  and  years  and  years  I  was 
 taking  drugs  smoking  weed  partying
[02:53] hooking  up  with  girls  I  know  those  some 
 of  those  things  can  be  a  lot  of  fun  but 
 certainly  when  you  overdo  pleasurable
[02:58] things  to  the  point  that  they  even 
 stopped  becoming  pleasurable  and  they 
 become  more  like  crutches  like  things
[03:03] you  need  and  so  that  have  been  doing 
 once  it  becomes  very  problematic  and  so 
 you  know  stacking  all  these  up  for  years
[03:08] at  a  time  just  more  pleasure  more 
 pleasure  more  pleasure  more  pleasure 
 leads  to  pain  and  then  I  had  the
[03:14] greatest  bouts  of  depression  anxiety 
 feeling  horrible  nihilistic  slightly 
 suicidal  I  was  weak  and  quite  frankly  no
[03:21] one  has  ever  said  this  to  you  before  I 
 was  weak  and  I  deserved  to  feel  trash  I
[03:27] was  weak  and  I  deserved  to  feel 
 depressed  I  was  weak  and  I  deserved  to
[03:32] feel  suicidal  no  one  has  ever  spoke  like 
 this  before  because  it's  so  anti-pc  it's
[03:38] so  offensive  but  I  was  doing  the  actions 
 that  would  lead  to  depression  I  was 
 doing  the  actions  that  would  lead  to
[03:44] feeling  horrible  and  so  I  deserve  the 
 consequences  of  my  actions  you  know  I
[03:49] said  this  once  on  the  community  posts  of 
 this  channel  I  said  if  there's  someone 
 out  there  who  doesn't  contribute  to
[03:54] their  tribe  who  just  wastes  away  and 
 just  indulges  in  stimulation  they 
 deserve  to  feel  depressed  and  the  amount
[03:59] of  guys  who  like  we're  trying  to  be  like 
 cool  and  soft  like  no  one  deserves  to 
 feel  depressed  Hamza  that's  really
[04:04] offensive  of  yeah  yeah  you  do  I  did  100 
 I  did  when  you  do  the  actions  that  would
[04:10] lead  a  person  to  feel  nihilistic  gray 
 dull  anxious  scared  weak  well  then  you
[04:16] deserve  the  consequences  of  your  actions 
 We  Are  Men  we  are  not  boys  we  are  men 
 that  means  that  whatever  we  do  we  take
[04:21] full  responsibility  for  if  you  feel  a 
 certain  way  it's  because  you  deserve  to 
 feel  that  way  because  you  did  the
[04:26] actions  to  feel  that  way  if  you've  got 
 Paul  grades  in  school  okay  you  deserve 
 it  if  you  feel  really  bad  dare  I  even
[04:32] say  if  you  feel  suicidal  you  deserve  it 
 because  you  have  done  the  actions  to  get 
 you  there  now  this  hurts  there's  a  lot
[04:37] of  guys  thinking  that  I'm  absolutely 
 crazy  right  now  but  you  know  what  any 
 guy  who's  actually  not  so  entirely  weak
[04:43] that  he  can  just  listen  to  this  message 
 there's  a  lot  of  guys  watching  this  my 
 boys  who  know  that  this  kind  of  message
[04:48] is  what's  needed  right  now  this  is 
 actually  in  a  weird  way  the  message  that 
 will  save  more  lives  because  telling
[04:54] people  like  oh  it's  okay  you  feel 
 depressed  oh  I'm  so  sorry  there's  the 
 suicide  hotline  number  that  doesn't  work
[05:01] because  if  it  did  and  everyone  speaks 
 like  that  we  wouldn't  keep  seeing  the 
 right  of  more  people's  poor  mental
[05:06] health  would  we  we  need  a  little  bit  of 
 tough  love  we  need  a  little  bit  of 
 accountability  of  ownership  of 
 responsibility  for  young  men  why  does  a
[05:13] young  man  feel  so  bad  these  days  because 
 he  is  weak  and  he  must  become  tougher
[05:18] because  for  a  very  long  time  after  I 
 indulged  in  all  that  pleasure  and  I 
 chose  to  have  depression  and  Suicidal
[05:24] Thoughts  because  it  was  a  choice  if 
 you're  doing  the  actions  that  leads  to 
 that  then  it  is  a  choice  of  choosing  to 
 feel  depressed  you're  choosing  to  feel
[05:29] suicide  I  was  choosing  to  feel  those 
 things  I  didn't  want  to  feel  those 
 things  you  know  they  were  really  scary 
 it's  a  bad  feeling  but  I  was  doing  the
[05:34] actions  that  would  lead  to  that  I  felt 
 depressed  I  hated  my  life  I  hated  being 
 broke  and  I'd  keep  smoking  weed  and  so  I
[05:40] chose  to  be  like  that  I  chose  to  feel 
 mentally  dull  I  chose  to  not  speak  to  my 
 family  for  an  entire  year  so  I  deserve
[05:46] to  feel  like  that  I  deserve  to  being 
 close  to  end  it  all  because  I  did  those
[05:51] actions  this  sounds  absolutely  crazy  to 
 some  people  but  if  you  can  grasp  this 
 knowledge  you  will  literally  be  equipped
[05:56] with  the  mindset  that  will  actually  save 
 you  from  these  dark  things  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  you  want  to  know  how  to
[06:01] become  mentally  tougher  you  want  to  know 
 how  to  stop  being  weak  and  I'm  not 
 talking  about  you  know  physically  oh  I 
 just  want  to  get  bench  pressed  to  100
[06:07] kilograms  that  stuff's  nice  that's 
 really  nice  but  your  mental  strength  is 
 a  hundred  times  more  valuable  than  your
[06:12] physical  strength  you  want  to  know  how 
 to  get  that  you  take  full  accountability 
 it  becomes  common  sense  when  we  talk
[06:17] about  it  like  this  you  know  if  an  action 
 something  you're  about  to  do  is  Gonna 
 Make  You  weaker  you  know  if  this  thing
[06:23] that  you're  about  to  do  is  gonna  make 
 you  feel  bad  24  hours  from  now  you  know 
 this  you're  not  stupid  you  know  if  you
[06:28] eat  that  junk  food  right  now  that's 
 sugar  you're  gonna  feel  pretty  nice  and 
 oh  yeah  yeah  oh  pleasure  oh  there's  a
[06:34] bit  of  a  taste  on  my  lips  yes  you  know 
 that  you're  gonna  feel  like  that  for  20 
 seconds  and  then  you've  ate  all  of  it
[06:39] you've  ate  all  the  sugar  and  you  also 
 knew  that  you  were  going  to  feel  worse 
 for  hours  afterwards  now  this  small  one
[06:45] little  thing  that  you've  had  isn't  that 
 bad  but  in  the  grand  scale  of  things 
 this  is  how  people  get  fat  this  is  how
[06:50] people  get  extremely  overweight  this  is 
 how  you've  become  too  high  body  fat  to 
 even  appreciate  the  beauty  that  should
[06:56] have  been  your  physique  you  understand 
 that  by  wasting  time  today  on  your  phone 
 or  your  computer  it's  gonna  feel  kind  of
[07:01] pleasurable  oh  yeah  let's  just  go  scroll 
 on  tiktok  or  let's  go  some  pointless 
 YouTube  videos  you  knew  that  I  would
[07:07] feel  kind  of  nice  but  you  also  knew  that 
 you  would  feel  worse  tomorrow  when 
 you're  a  little  bit  behind  on  the  work 
 that  you  said  you  were  gonna  do  again
[07:13] you  are  not  stupid  you  are  not  unaware 
 you  are  not  ignorance  men  these  days 
 need  to  be  slapped  in  the  face  and
[07:18] reminded  is  one  very  important  quote  you 
 deserve  the  consequences  of  your  actions
[07:23] if  you  are  committing  to  the  actions 
 that  would  make  you  feel  bad  good  I  want 
 you  to  feel  bad  if  you  are  doing  the
[07:29] actions  that  will  make  you  feel 
 depressed  and  suicidal  good  I  want  you
[07:34] to  feel  depressed  and  suicidal  because 
 that's  what  you  deserve  likewise  if  you 
 are  doing  the  actions  that  will  make  you
[07:40] feel  good  that's  what  you  deserve  if  you 
 are  doing  the  actions  that  will  make  you 
 feel  connected  in  your  tribe  with  the
[07:45] people  around  you  with  your  family  your 
 friends  thank  good  that's  what  you're 
 gonna  get  this  video  is  going  to  trigger
[07:50] a  lot  of  soft  people  and  they  got  to 
 keep  going  through  their  lives  one 
 antidepressant  pill  at  a  time  wondering
[07:56] why  their  PB  doesn't  even  work  anymore 
 why  they  don't  have  that  same  gust  that 
 they  used  to  when  they  were  a  little  boy
[08:01] the  male  feminists  are  going  to  be 
 watching  this  with  skinny  necks  thinking 
 yeah  this  guy  is  misogynist  like  we've
[08:06] not  even  talked  about  women  in  this 
 video  and  they'll  still  be  watching 
 everything  and  yeah  he's  a  misogynist  a 
 lot  of  people  will  be  watching  the  soft 
 people  and  they  won't  understand  this
[08:12] message  but  you  may  there  is  a  key  to 
 becoming  mentally  tougher  and  is  to 
 literally  just  know  that  you  have  to 
 take  full  responsibility  for  the  things
[08:18] that  you  do  in  life  and  whatever 
 decisions  you  make  know  that  you  deserve 
 the  consequences  of  those  actions  this
[08:24] is  why  once  a  guy  actually  has  a  good 
 head  on  his  shoulders  and  he  actually 
 gets  onto  self-improvement  and  he
[08:29] follows  the  words  of  Adonis  that  he 
 looks  around  as  you  may  have  done  and 
 you  see  your  friends  and  they're
[08:34] voluntarily  choosing  to  do  the  actions 
 that  make  them  feel  bad  and  they  just 
 won't  stop  and  they  kind  of  think  that
[08:40] you're  the  crazy  one  if  you  look  around 
 and  see  this  in  the  world  do  you  not 
 think  it's  weird  that  literally  everyone
[08:45] is  doing  a  thing  that  they're  getting  to 
 point  a  and  they're  like  what  huh  but
[08:50] why  am  I  at  Point  a  but  I  want  to  be  at 
 point  B  I  know  ah  yes  I'll  keep  doing
[08:56] the  actions  that  will  keep  getting  me 
 further  and  further  and  further  in  point 
 a  let's  see  if  that  gets  me  to  point  B
[09:01] that's  literally  what  people  are  doing 
 people  are  like  going  on  to  Google  Maps 
 saying  they  want  to  go  to  a  city 
 Manchester  but  then  moving  the  location
[09:08] over  all  the  way  okay  uh  Edinburgh  yeah 
 I  want  to  go  to  Manchester  so  Edinburgh
[09:13] okay  let's  go  they're  driving  for  hours 
 and  hours  wait  I'm  getting  further  away 
 from  Manchester  what's  happening  but 
 it's  okay  driving  and  driving  and
[09:19] driving  wait  why  why  am  I  here  huh  well 
 I  mean  I'm  already  in  Scotland  so  let's
[09:24] just  keep  going  north  does  this  blow 
 anyone  else's  mind  bro  because  for  me 
 personally  when  I  see  young  men  and  even
[09:29] women  of  today  literally  just  quite 
 frankly  like  this  is  stupidity  is  it  not 
 I  see  the  stupidity  in  most  people
[09:35] wondering  why  their  lives  are  so  bad 
 wondering  why  they're  broke  but  they 
 keep  doing  the  actions  that  cause  them
[09:40] to  be  broke  in  the  first  place  and  they 
 won't  change  anything  honey  you've  been 
 trying  to  like  quit  buying  Starbucks 
 coffees  for  months  for  years  and  you're
[09:47] still  broke  it  didn't  change  anything 
 the  guy  who's  been  trying  to  quit  weed 
 for  ages  and  keeps  going  back  because  he 
 keeps  trying  in  the  exact  same  way  all
[09:53] the  men  around  the  world  who  feel  so 
 glum  and  so  negative  and  life  so  hard 
 and  I'm  so  lonely  and  they  keep  doing
[09:59] the  actions  that  have  led  them  here 
 instead  of  drastically  changing  their 
 lives  when  you  look  at  it  this  way  don't
[10:04] you  see  the  foolishness  of  the  world 
 don't  you  see  the  weak  people  because 
 mental  strength  mental  toughness  it's
[10:09] just  about  choosing  to  do  the  thing  that 
 will  actually  get  you  to  where  you 
 really  want  to  go  even  if  that  thing
[10:15] feels  a  little  bit  uncomfortable  and 
 painful  today  you  want  that  body  don't 
 you  you  want  to  look  into  the  mirror  and 
 see  your  physique  and  actually  feel
[10:21] proud  and  confident  for  how  you  look  you 
 want  your  shirts  to  fit  against  your 
 arms  you  want  your  shirt  to  be  a  little
[10:26] bit  loose  against  your  stomach  so  why 
 not  just  go  and  do  the  actions  that  will 
 cause  that  well  the  reason  why  most
[10:31] people  don't  is  because  you  can't  click 
 your  fingers  and  make  it  happen  it's 
 because  you  have  to  experience  some  kind 
 of  pain  and  discomfort  first  and  so  many
[10:37] people  are  so  avoidant  of  pain  and 
 discomfort  without  realizing  the  pain 
 and  discomfort  leads  to  happiness  and  so
[10:42] the  modern  Neanderthal  that  you  see 
 around  you  today  which  is  probably  80  of 
 people  are  like  literally  modernly
[10:48] undefaulted  just  brain  dead  they'll 
 choose  to  sacrifice  their  dreams  they'll 
 choose  to  sacrifice  their  health  their
[10:54] family  their  relationships  their  work 
 their  livelihood  for  a  bit  of  pleasure 
 today  they  want  that  body  but  they  won't
[11:00] go  to  the  gym  today  they'll  just  keep 
 scrolling  on  Tick  Tock  they  want  that 
 money  that  wealth  won't  go  and  do
[11:05] something  that  actually  has  the 
 possibility  to  get  them  that  much  money 
 and  instead  they'll  just  keep  trudging 
 along  in  the  education  system  like  oh
[11:11] yeah  maybe  I'll  make  25k  a  year  it  takes 
 a  mentally  strong  person  to  be  able  to 
 delay  gratification  to  see  what  you  want
[11:18] months  from  now  years  from  now  see  the 
 choices  that  will  get  you  there  and 
 commit  to  those  choices  even  though
[11:23] those  choices  are  harder  and  more 
 uncomfortable  than  something  else  you 
 could  do  today  that's  it  that's
[11:28] literally  as  simple  as  it  gets  you  want 
 to  know  a  bulletproof  way  to  build  the 
 body  of  your  dreams  sacrifice  sacrifice
[11:33] today  for  tomorrow  how  about  for  your 
 parents  who  are  in  debt  you  want  to  know 
 a  bulletproof  way  for  them  to  get  rid  of
[11:39] their  debts  sacrifice  today  for  tomorrow 
 how  about  your  studies  a  bulletproof  way 
 to  improve  your  grades  sacrifice  the  day
[11:45] for  tomorrow  why  are  you  trying  to  cash 
 out  today  why  are  you  trying  to  feel  so 
 much  pleasure  today  oh  but  I  you  know
[11:50] it's  7  PM  one  hour  isn't  that  bad  your 
 competition's  not  doing  that  one  hour 
 Bro  you've  got  a  lot  to  think  about  if
[11:56] this  videos  annoyed  you  the  issue  is 
 with  videos  like  this  the  guys  who  truly 
 need  to  hear  this  message  got  offended
[12:01] and  clicked  off  in  the  first  few  minutes 
 in  a  day  so  chances  are  if  you've 
 watched  all  of  this  as  much  as  this 
 maybe  has  triggered  you  a  little  bit  you
[12:08] probably  deeply  agree  with  the  message 
 because  you  just  know  that  it's  the 
 truth  and  you  know  that  you  slipped  up  a 
 little  bit  there's  areas  in  your  life
[12:13] right  now  that  you  haven't  been 
 sacrificing  for  there's  areas  in  your 
 life  that  you  have  been  weak  instead  of 
 tough  and  being  able  to  admit  that  it's
[12:19] kind  of  like  a  superpower  in  this  modern 
 day  because  so  many  people  don't  have 
 the  strength  the  humility  the 
 accountabilities  you  just  hold  their
[12:24] hands  up  and  say  you  know  what  I've 
 slacked  I  will  tell  you  and  I  won't  just 
 tell  you  I'll  tell  all  100
[12:30] 000  guys  who  are  watching  this  video 
 yeah  bro  last  few  months  I  slacked  on  my 
 physique  I  slacked  on  my  diet  I  slacked
[12:36] on  my  training  I  said  that  work  was  the 
 priority  in  that  you  know  I  was  only 
 going  to  train  once  or  twice  a  week  and 
 then  I  got  kind  of  fat  last  like  one
[12:41] maybe  two  to  three  weeks  I've  really 
 been  bringing  it  back  I'm  getting  back 
 into  it  but  bro  I  really  fell  off  my 
 physique  I  really  fell  off  my  training
[12:47] for  a  good  amount  of  time  a  couple  of 
 months  and  I  felt  horrible  I  slacked  I 
 stopped  putting  the  work  and  I  stopped 
 sacrificing  for  my  physique  and  guess
[12:53] what  I  felt  bad  and  I  deserved  to  feel 
 bad  do  you  understand  me  saying  that  I 
 deserved  to  feel  bad  I  deserved  to  feel
[13:00] bad  because  I  did  the  actions  that  would 
 lead  to  that  so  I  deserved  it  building 
 my  physique  training  in  the  gym  makes  me
[13:06] feel  good  I  stopped  doing  it  I  started 
 to  feel  bad  good  that's  exactly  what  I 
 deserved  if  you  can  talk  to  yourself
[13:11] like  this  bro  you  will  be  miles  above 
 everyone  else  who's  just  holding  like 
 covering  their  eyes  up  a  little  bit  and
[13:16] they  don't  want  to  be  accountable  they 
 just  want  to  stay  in  their  safe  space 
 and  get  the  participation  trophy  it'll
[13:21] be  wise  for  you  to  have  a  little  pep 
 talk  with  yourself  after  this  if  you're 
 a  Jeffrey  you'll  click  onto  the  next 
 video  even  if  it's  one  of  mine  and  you
[13:26] know  that  gets  me  more  YouTube  AdSense 
 and  you've  watched  more  of  my  videos 
 fantastic  but  you  would  be  wise  to  pause 
 this  video  and  to  just  sit  there  and
[13:32] utter  silence  for  the  first  time  in  a 
 while  just  sit  there  and  just  like  stare 
 at your  wall  for  a  bit  don't  look  at
[13:37] your  phone  don't  look  at  your  computer 
 oh  let  me  write  on  my  notion  document  no 
 no  just  sit  there  for  a  few  minutes  and
[13:42] just  stare  at  a  wall  and  have  a  mental 
 pep  talk  with  yourself  pick  out  those 
 times  that  you  slept  and  you  know  where
[13:47] they  are  and  don't  be  easy  on  yourself 
 don't  be  soft  on  yourself  one  of  the 
 greatest  things  that  you  can  do  as  a
[13:53] young  man  is  to  be  hard  on  yourself  I 
 want  you  right  now  to  pause  the  video 
 look  at  your  wall  and  literally  pick
[13:58] apart  those  small  things  that  you  did 
 that  were  not  of  your  total  potential  I 
 will  do  it  live  I  will  do  it  out  loud
[14:05] I  ate  this  dessert  just  over  a  week  ago 
 some  like  baklava  some  like  Turkish 
 thing  and  it  was  full  of  sugar  honestly
[14:11] I  didn't  even  enjoy  it  that  much  I  just 
 kept  on  eating  it  I  knew  it  was  bad  for 
 me  but  I  went  with  this  cup  of  like  oh 
 well  you  know  it's  only  once  in  a  while
[14:17] there's  no  problem  but  I  didn't  even  get 
 that  much  pleasure  from  it  all  I  did  was 
 just  gain  more  fat  and  then  felt  bad 
 after  that  when  I  mentioned  before  a
[14:22] couple  of  weeks  that  still  annoys  me  for 
 a  solid  two  months  I  slacked  on  my 
 training  and  my  fitness  and  my  diets
[14:28] just  a  couple  of  months  ago  bro  I  was 
 ordering  like  junk  food  very  often  a 
 couple  times  a  week  I  was  eating  burgers
[14:33] and  stuff  and  I  know  that  that  can  be 
 okay  as  a  treat  but  when  that  became  a 
 part  of  my  normal  diet  and  I  just  gained
[14:38] so  much  weight  randomly  and  I  felt  bad 
 and  I  looked  at  myself  in  the  mirror 
 shirtless  and  I  literally  felt  bad  I'm
[14:43] realizing  now  that  I  should  have  felt 
 bad  and  I've  slacked  I've  slacked  in  my 
 work  I  say  this  is  the  most  important
[14:48] thing  for  me  and  it  is  and  why  have  I 
 slapped  recording  these  videos  and  my 
 editors  have  had  to  wait  an  extra  day  or
[14:53] two  days  or  sometimes  three  days  or  even 
 longer  because  I've  just  slacked  and 
 it's  like  oh  guys  so  sorry  no  videos
[14:58] today  that  I've  recorded  because  I'm 
 just  a  little  bit  tired  and  you  know  I 
 had  a  big  meal  before  and  I'm  really 
 tired  now  like  that's  embarrassing
[15:03] there's  people  relying  on  me  for  their 
 wages  and  I've  been  slow  with  my  work 
 and  as  much  as  I've  said  so  many  times
[15:08] that  this  is  quite  a  mentally  and 
 physically  demanding  job  I've  shown  that 
 I  can  do  it  I've  shown  that  I  can  record
[15:13] all  seven  videos  even  in  one  sitting  and 
 so  to  have  my  editors  wait  for  multiple
[15:18] days  it's  unacceptable  in  this  modern 
 day  you  are  told  to  not  talk  like  this 
 to  yourself  you  are  told  to  be  so  soft
[15:24] to  yourself  and  look  around  look  at  the 
 consequences  of  that  kind  of  message 
 everyone  these  days  is  so  weak  you  have
[15:29] been  weak  for  far  too  long  if  you 
 literally  just  think  about  your  life 
 like  periods  of  your  life  year  by  year
[15:34] by  year  you  have  been  weak  for  most  of 
 them  because  you've  listened  to  the 
 exact  same  advice  that  everyone  else  has
[15:39] be  nice  to  yourself  go  easy  on  yourself 
 it's  okay  just  compare  yourself  to 
 yesterday  one  percent  better  every  day
[15:44] but  that  guy  who's  competing  with  you 
 and  you  don't  even  realize  he's 
 competing  but  that  guy  who's  gonna  flirt
[15:49] with  your  future  wife  he's  not  going 
 easy  on  himself  I  will  say  this  again 
 bro  I  want  you  to  imagine  in  the  future
[15:54] you  got  a  wife  you  got  kids  and  yeah 
 everything's  so  happy  and  your  wife's 
 you  know  at  work  there  are  gonna  be  some
[15:59] guys  who  hit  on  on  the  and  one  of  those 
 guys  he  didn't  take  days  off  when  you
[16:04] did  one  of  those  guys  who  will  flirt 
 with  your  future  wife  or  your  girlfriend 
 or  the  mother  of  your  children  he's  not
[16:09] being  easy  on  himself  right  now  he's  on 
 the  floor  doing  ab  exercises  doing 
 crunches  whilst  he's  listening  to  this
[16:14] video  are  you  or  are  you  sat  there  with 
 like  fat  rolls  just  like  poor  posture
[16:19] thinking  oh  yeah  well  you  know  I've 
 already  worked  out  today  I  already  went 
 to  the  gym  today  so  I  don't  need  to  do 
 anything  more  I  arrest  this  key  he's  not
[16:25] resting  bro  and  when  he  approaches  your 
 future  wife  and  he's  lean  and  he's  10 
 body  fat  and  his  shirt  just  presses
[16:30] against  his  abs  and  her  eyes  just 
 quickly  look  down  and  a  little  bit  of
[16:35] lust  begins  to  form  in  her  and  she's  not 
 a  bad  person  for  this  how  could  she  not 
 be  turned  on  by  a  guy  who  is  just  so
[16:41] much  better  than  you  and  that's  gonna 
 [ __ ]  hurt  sometimes  I  forget  to  think 
 like  this  because  you  know  it's  toxic
[16:46] and  there  might  be  some  male  feminists 
 reacting  to  this  it's  so  toxic  yeah  it 
 is  it  is  toxic  but  male  life  is  supposed
[16:51] to  be  toxic  male  life  is  supposed  to  be 
 a  competition  it's  supposed  to  be  a  war 
 so  all  these  soft  people  telling  you
[16:56] like  oh  no  dude  just  take  some  time  off 
 dude  it's  all  that  deep  dude  just  play 
 some  video  games  they  weren't  even  in
[17:02] the  competition  of  men  anyway  but  that 
 guy  who  is  truly  your  company  position  I 
 promise  you  right  here  right  now  whilst
[17:07] you're  watching  this  video  I  promise  you 
 he  is  literally  on  the  floor  doing 
 crunches  get  to  work  do  the  hard  work
[17:13] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 mwah
