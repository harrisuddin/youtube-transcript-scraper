[00:00] - [Zak] The challenge with the eCommerce is often the difficulty
in getting up and running. That challenge for us
was definitely alleviated
[00:07] with the use of Shopify. I'm Zak. - [Zara] I'm Zara. - [Zak] And we're the
founders of Delhicious.
[00:13] My favorite part of
Shopify is the mobile app. When we're really busy,
[00:18] we need to update our shipping timelines. We can very quickly do
that on the back end, and in a second, it's
updated on the front end.
[00:24] So it allows us to really
just react to our business and how it's going. - [Zara] Start your online store today.
