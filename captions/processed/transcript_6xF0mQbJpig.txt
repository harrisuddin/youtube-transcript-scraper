[00:00] dopamine  detoxing  changed  my  life 
 forever  but  not  in  the  way  that  you 
 might  think  around  two  years  ago  I  saw
[00:06] the  videos  on  YouTube  popping  off  with 
 all  the  big  YouTubers  making  videos  like 
 a  dopamine  detox  how  to  reset  your  brain
[00:11] in  24  hours 
 and  instantly  I  knew  that  that  wasn't
[00:16] right  I  knew  that  they  were  kind  of 
 lying  I  don't  know  if you  had  the  same 
 feeling  when  you  saw  those  videos  like
[00:21] how  to  reset  your  mind  in  24  hours  I 
 knew  that  it  was  just  click  bait  that 
 these  guys  were  just  titling  this  to  get
[00:26] more  views  and 
 really  you're  not  going  to  reset  your 
 brain  in  24  hours  it's  just  unreasonable
[00:33] but  what  I  knew  for  a  fact  would  work 
 would  be  a  long-term  sustainable
[00:40] reduction  in  bad  dopamines  now  I'm  not  a 
 scientist  and  I'm  sure  there's  someone
[00:45] who  can  critique  this  video  and  make  you 
 know  like  the  phrases  I've  used  on  very 
 scientific  but  the  act  of  dopamine
[00:51] detoxing  is  just  about  stopping  the  bad 
 dopamines  the  bad  habits  that  seem  to
[00:56] give  us  a  bit  of  a  spike  in  enjoyment 
 and  pleasure  today  like  right  now
[01:01] but  make  our  life  worse  in  the  long  run 
 so  this  is  called  like  instant 
 gratification  so  this  comes  from  the  bad
[01:07] things  that  we  do  that  we  know  are 
 pretty  bad  like  for  example  eating  junk 
 food  we  eat  ice  cream  today  we  we  eat
[01:14] ice  cream  and  it  tastes  good  it  makes  us 
 feel  good 
 but  we  kind  of  know  that  later  on  once
[01:21] that  the  pleasure  is  gone  from  our 
 tongue  the  consequences  remain 
 so  ice  cream  feels  good  right  now  but  in
[01:29] the  long  run 
 [ __ ]  up  our  insulin  gives  us  extra  body 
 fat  gives  us  brain  frog  we  know  that
[01:35] it's  not  good  for  us  especially  I  mean 
 unless  if  you're  a  fitness  influencer
[01:40] trying  to  sell  people  programs  and  you 
 tell  them  that  they  can  eat  anything 
 they  want  calories  and  calories  out 
 that's  [ __ ]  as  well  but  that's  a
[01:45] separate  note  I  do  want  to  expand  on 
 that  though  calories  and  calories  out  is 
 absolute  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  and  when  I  got
[01:51] onto  dopamine  detoxing  it  was  the  first 
 time  where  I  actually  took  back  control 
 of  my  diet  that  I  realized  that  the
[01:57] fitness  influencers  kind  of  hijacked  I 
 saw  all  these  like  diseased  sick  like
[02:02] sick  as  in  like  the  illness  sick  Fitness 
 influences  who've  all  got  bingy  in
[02:07] problems  mental  health  problems 
 recommending  Their  audience  to  follow 
 their  diets  whether  you  see  them  eating 
 at  Krispy  Kremes  and  10  000  calorie
[02:13] diets  and  everything  like  you  know  10 
 000 calorie  challenges  where  oh  I  can't 
 wait  to  eat  Krispy  creams  that  they're 
 eating  like  oh  dinner  today  I  just
[02:19] picked  up  like  this  uh  this  Wendy's 
 McNugget  chicken  burger  like  they're 
 just  eating  like  children  bro  and  I  used
[02:24] to  eat  like  that  too 
 that's  a  little  bit  of  a  weird  rant  but
[02:29] it  really  does  fit  in  with  the  topic  of 
 the  the  video  with  dopamine  detoxing 
 because  when  you  eat  the  ice  cream  today
[02:34] or  you  eat  like  a  fitness  influencer  you 
 eat  the  Krispy  Kreme  donuts  and  the  10 
 000  calorie  challenge  like
[02:40] when  you  do  that  stuff  it  feels  good 
 right  now  but  it  makes  your  life  worse 
 in  the  long  run  and  something  that's
[02:45] hard  to  swallow  pill  for  many  young  men 
 this  is  the  case  with  video  games  and
[02:50] anime 
 a  lot  of  the  very  enjoyable  things  that 
 a  lot  of  young  men  are  you  know  very
[02:55] addicted  to  they  feel  awesome  right  now 
 it  feels  nice  it  feels  so  desirable
[03:00] right  now  but  you  have  this  thought  in 
 the  back  of  your  mind  which  kind  of  says 
 like  uh
[03:05] I'm  gonna  miss  my  deadline  because  of 
 this  or  oh  you  know  this  is  two  hours 
 that  I'm  not  gonna  be  studying  for  the
[03:10] exam  that's  coming  up  you  kind  of  know 
 like  we  all  inherently  know  that  video
[03:15] games  anime  and  stuff  is  somewhat  bad 
 for  us  now  we  can  cope  and  say  oh  no  no
[03:20] it's  actually  good  for  us  because  you 
 know  it's  a  story  that  you're  following 
 along  to  or  your  handbag  coordination
[03:26] gets  better  your  memory  skills  get 
 better  and  those  things  are  true 
 but  we're  not  we're  not  playing  video
[03:31] games  so  that  we  can  improve  our  memory 
 we're  playing  it  to  indulge  we're  not 
 watching  anime  for  the  sake  of  like  you
[03:38] know  this  philosophical  mindset  change 
 we're  watching  it  just  because  it  feels 
 good  right  now
[03:44] the  issue  is  that  when  you  do  too  many 
 of  these  habits  that  feel  good  right  now 
 but  make  your  life  worse  in  the  long  run
[03:50] eventually  your  Baseline  happiness  just 
 goes  down  and  down  and  down  and  this  is
[03:55] why  dopamine  detoxing  got  so  popular 
 because  so  many  people's  happiness 
 Baseline  is  just  totally  tanked  and  so
[04:02] when  this  is  you  for  example  if  you  want 
 to  know  some  of  these  symptoms  so  you 
 know  you're  one  of  these  people  with
[04:07] like  a  lowered  happiness  Baseline 
 things  that  used  to  give  you  pleasure
[04:12] and  enjoyment  don't  anymore 
 so  if  you  found  yourself  still  you  know 
 playing  video  games  still  doing  whatever
[04:17] habit  maybe  maybe  watching  porn  and 
 stuff  maybe  in  junk  food  maybe  taking 
 drugs  but  they  don't  give  you  like  the
[04:22] same  high  as  they  used  to 
 video  games  aren't  as  fun  anymore  you 
 need  to  smoke  a  lot  more  weed  to
[04:28] actually  get  like  high  and  when  you  do 
 get  high  it's  not  even  that  nice  anymore 
 the  same  with  really  any  drug  the  first
[04:34] time  you  used  to  start  drinking  alcohol 
 it  was  so  lit  it  was  so  exciting  now 
 it's  like  you  drink  just  to  get  like  to
[04:39] the  old  Baseline  and  you  drink  it's  like 
 it's  not  even  as  fun  it  makes  you  like 
 just  weird  and  groggy  and  angry  and  you
[04:44] get  way  more  of  the  negatives 
 the  Baseline  just  seems  to  decrease  and
[04:51] you're  just  not  as  happy  as  you  used  to 
 be 
 it's  a  very  very  sad  place  to  be  in  and
[04:58] I  fear  that  a  large  part  of  the 
 population  especially  the  young  people 
 are  struggling  with  this  without  really
[05:04] identifying  the  issue  which  is  just 
 instant  gratification  overload  dopamine
[05:09] overload  and  again  this  probably  isn't 
 like  real  scientific  right  maybe  there's 
 someone  who  can  correct  me  with  the 
 science  here
[05:16] the  act  of  dopamine  detoxing  the  way 
 that  I  did  it  I  am  sure  and  I  promise
[05:22] you  it's  better  than  any  other  person 
 who's  ever  spoke  about  the  term  dopamine 
 detoxing  before  because  every  other
[05:27] video  that  I  saw  quite  frankly  I'm  just 
 gonna  be  honest  every  YouTuber  that  I 
 saw  who  made  a  video  on  dopamine
[05:32] detoxing  was  making  one  to  get  views  I 
 could  see  right  through  them  and  maybe 
 you  could  too  but  I  could  see  right
[05:37] through  all  of  the  guys  you've  seen 
 their  YouTube  channels  I  won't  really 
 name  them  [ __ ]  it  you  know  I  will  Andrew
[05:42] Kirby  Nicholas 
 um there  was  a  somewhat  recent  one  where 
 he  got  like  10  million  views  you
[05:47] probably  saw  that  it's  really  nice  like 
 a  camera  photography  and  everything 
 Nicholas 
 um  project  Master  like  there's  another
[05:54] one  there's  another  self-improvement 
 YouTuber  who's  got  400k  nice  videos 
 beautifully  made  videos  amazing
[05:59] storytelling  amazing  editing  quite  a  lot 
 of  dopamine  in  the  the  you  know  like 
 dopamine  in  the  editing  the  fast-paced
[06:06] action  music  and  stuff  yeah  it's  a  it's 
 a  weird  kind  of  way  to  edit  your  video 
 when  you're  talking  about  dopamine 
 detoxing  isn't  it  but  at  least  for  me  I
[06:13] watch  those  videos  and  I  didn't  see  any 
 of  any  authenticity  in  the  creators  of 
 those  videos  and  it  was  clear  to  me  that
[06:18] they  were  making  videos  for  views  and 
 not  actually  to  educate  their  followings 
 and  to  like  actually  help  people  out
[06:24] there  when  I  first  started  making  my 
 videos  or  in  fact  when  I  first  started
[06:29] going  onto  my  own  door  because  I  I  went 
 on  a  dopamine  detox  weeks  before  I 
 actually  ever  spoke  about  it  so  I  didn't
[06:34] like  you  know  see  the  trend  make  a  video 
 and  say  like  oh  I  tried  opening  detoxing 
 for  Thursday  night  I  didn't  do  that  what
[06:39] I  did  was  I  saw  those  videos  I  saw  the 
 trend  I  went  on  a  dopamine  detox  the 
 best  way  possible  I  did  it  myself  I  went
[06:45] on  to  it  in  the  silence  didn't  tell 
 anyone  I  didn't  have  any  subscribers  at 
 the  time  I  had  like  maybe  40  subscribers
[06:51] and  they  were  all  my  family  in  Pakistan 
 and  you  know  my  family  here  in  the  UK 
 I  went  on  dopamine  detox  for  two  weeks
[06:57] two  weeks  and  then  I  made  a  video  about 
 it
[07:03] I  made  a  video  because  it  changed  my 
 life  in  just  two  weeks  literally  in  two 
 weeks  bro  I  went  from  being  just  a
[07:09] normal  guy  who  used  to  watch  porn  and 
 masturbate  I  went  from  being  a  normal 
 guy  who  used  to  smoke  weed  very  often
[07:15] and  you  know  eat  junk  food  and  just 
 waste  time  on  Instagram  and  everything  I 
 decided  I  was  gonna  go  on  a  dopamine
[07:20] detox  with  certain  rules  that  I've  not 
 seen  anyone  else  speak  about  and 
 literally  almost  instantly  it
[07:26] transformed  my  life  and  since  that 
 moment 
 I've  been  more  productive  than  I've  ever
[07:31] been  in  my  entire  life  I've  become  wild 
 like  wildly  successful  I  have  a  company 
 I  have  employees
[07:38] I  can't  believe  how  successful  I've 
 become  and  it  is  largely  due  to  the  fact
[07:43] that  I  went  on  this  dopamine  detox  but 
 that  I  didn't  Follow  The  Click  bait 
 advice  the  thing  is  this  video  is  not
[07:48] going  to get  anywhere  near  the  amount  of 
 views  as  the  other  guys  who've  got 
 fast-mix  edited  and  you  know  like  it's  a 
 video  on  Doppler  come  on  like  I  had  the
[07:54] respect  to  not  put  any  editing  in  this 
 or  in  this  video  because  if  you  want  to 
 go  on  a  dopamine  detox  I'm  not  going  to
[07:59] fry  your  brain  but  like  when  you  see  a 
 video  about  dopamine  detoxing  and  it's 
 these  guys  with  Fast  Cuts  and  everything
[08:04] it's  like  they  clearly  don't  give  a  [ __ ] 
 about  you  do  that  but  I  digress
[08:11] the  way  that  I  did  my  dopamine  detox  was 
 very  different  because  I  did  not  believe
[08:16] the  lies  that  were  being  told  by 
 everyone  else  that  you  could  reset  your 
 brain  in  24  hours  and  all  you  had  to  do
[08:21] was  this  clickbait  challenge  of  like  24 
 hours  of  just  sitting  in  a  room  he  he 
 like  you  know  it  sounds  awesome  it
[08:26] sounds  like  so  exciting  I  knew  that 
 wasn't  going  to  change  anything 
 when  I  went  on  my  dopamine  detox  I  kind
[08:32] of  changed  it  from  dopamine  detox  so 
 almost  like  dopamine  like  reduction
[08:37] what  I  thought  to  myself  okay  I'm  not 
 just  going  to  do  one  day  to  reset  my 
 mind  and  then  just  go  back  to  my  normal
[08:42] [ __ ]  life  because  that  would  be 
 horrible  I  just  suddenly  realized  that 
 doing  those  instant  gratification
[08:47] activities  porn  video  games  junk  food 
 scrolling  on  Instagram  and  everything
[08:53] I  realized  that  I  had  to  just 
 drastically  reduce  them  if  not  cut  them 
 out  completely  for  the  rest  of  my  life
[09:00] I  didn't  see  this  as  a  24  hour  challenge 
 or  a  one  week  little  Adventure 
 I  saw  this  as  literally  the  next  chapter
[09:06] of  my  life  where  I'm  no  longer  the  kind 
 of  person  who  is  still  in  chains  by  the
[09:11] modern  overstimulation  that  we  see  today 
 by  the  short  form  content  on  tick  tock
[09:17] this  is  when  I  discovered  another  term 
 very  similar  to  instant  gratification 
 but  it  was  called  delayed  gratification
[09:24] delayed  gratification 
 comes  from  the  things  that  we  do  that
[09:29] feel  kind  of  hard  and  uncomfortable 
 right  now  but  eventually  they  go  on  to
[09:34] make  our  lives  better  in  the  future 
 and  this  is  the  key  to  self-improvement
[09:39] this  is  the  key  to  happiness  that's  a 
 success  money  whatever  you  want  bro 
 chances  are  whatever  you  want  in  life  I
[09:45] promise  you  it  comes  from  delayed 
 gratification 
 whatever  you  want  to  avoid  in  life  like
[09:50] being  broke  being  like  an  [ __ ]  to 
 your  family  or  to  to  your  partner
[09:56] being  fat  being  unhealthy 
 all  those  things  you  want  to  avoid  bro 
 they're  happening  because  of  instant
[10:02] classification  and  all  of  the  things 
 that  you  want  would  happen  if  you 
 dedicate  yourself  to  delayed
[10:07] gratification  delayed  gratification  is 
 activities  like  for  example  exercising 
 for  a  lot  of  people  you  know  once  you
[10:13] get  to  a  certain  point  fair  enough  but 
 like  for  a  lot  of  people  exercising 
 isn't  actually  fun 
 you  know  like  I'm  90  years  into  the
[10:19] Journey  of  exercising  consistently  of 
 like  going  to  the  gym  and  building  a 
 body  so  it's  fun  for  me  now  but  for  a
[10:24] long  time  it  wasn't  for  a  lot  of  people 
 exercising  actually  not  fun  it's 
 actually  something  that  requires 
 discipline
[10:30] how  interesting  is  that 
 it  doesn't  feel  good  right  now  it  feels 
 bad  right  now
[10:35] and  yet  we  do  it  because  we  know  that  it 
 makes  our  life  better  in  the  long  term
[10:41] we  sacrifice  the  short  term  for  the  long 
 term  and  if  there  is  one  phrase  that
[10:47] defines  successful  people  rich  people 
 athletes 
 it  is  that  they  sacrifice  the  short  term
[10:52] for  the  long  term 
 if  there's  one  phrase  that  defines
[10:58] overweight  people  broke  people  angry 
 emotional  people  [ __ ]
[11:03] it's  that  they  sacrifice  the  long  term 
 for  the  short  term
[11:08] now  you  understand  this  and  you  you 
 probably  agree  with  the  concept  here  but 
 there  will  be  something  in  the  instant
[11:14] gratification  activity  like  bucket  that 
 you  don't  want  to  give  up  that  you  will
[11:19] fight  tooth  and  nail  for  that  you  will 
 save  with  Souls 
 certainty  is  not  instant  gratification
[11:25] you  will  say  perhaps  this  video  games 
 maybe  it's  anime  it's  one  of  those 
 usually  for  young  men  nope  no  no no
[11:30] video  games  is  absolutely  fine  one  hour 
 at  the  end  of  the  day  is  still  fine  you 
 it's  absolutely  fine  the  thing  is  a  lot
[11:37] of  guys  say  that 
 I  at  least  for  me  I  personally  wasn't 
 able  to  live  like  that
[11:42] if  you  enjoy  video  games  as  much  as  I 
 did  I  don't  believe  that  you  could  ever 
 play  it  when  I  was  a  lot  of  people  have
[11:48] told  me  they  only  play  one  hour  a  day  at 
 the  end  of  the  hard  day  and  it's  not 
 like  that  bad  because  they've  done  all 
 their  work  and  stuff  and  I  just  think
[11:53] either  maybe  they're  mistaken  maybe  it's 
 not  one  hour  maybe  it's  more  like  two  to 
 three  and  if  it  is  genuinely  one  hour
[11:59] they're  probably  not  enjoying  it  that 
 much  because  I  really  enjoyed  video 
 games  a  lot  I  have  over  10  000  hours  on
[12:05] RuneScape  3  000  hours  on  like  other 
 games 
 there's  no  way  I  was  playing  one  hour  a
[12:10] day  bro  it's  just  not  gonna  happen  for 
 me  video  games  it  was  a  very  like  zero 
 or  a  hundred  and  there's  a  lot  of  other
[12:16] guys  who  feel  the  exact  same  way  so  we 
 had  to  cut  it  out  completely  maybe 
 you're  someone  who  can  manage  it
[12:21] absolutely  perfectly  fine 
 maybe  still  even  then  just  consider 
 cutting  it  out  just  because  it  is
[12:28] inherently  something  that's  bad  for  you 
 that's  addictive  that's  time  consuming 
 and  you  might  say  well  you  know  oh  well
[12:34] you  know  like  but  what  if  I  just  want  to 
 have  balance  in  my  life 
 and  you  could  but  then  this  isn't  really
[12:40] the  video  for  that  this  dopamine 
 detoxing  is  a  very  extreme  thing  to  do 
 it's  like  you  want  to  change  you  want  to
[12:45] have  a  new  chapter  of  your  life  you're 
 tired  of  being  just  like  a  normal  person 
 and  you  want  to  become  the  one  percent
[12:50] you  want  to  get  to  the  point  of  your 
 success  and  your  wealth  and  your 
 richness  that  you're  making  so  much
[12:55] money  that  you  can  help  your  family 
 through  these  hard  financial  times 
 because  that's  not  coming  when  you're 
 playing  one  hour  of  video  games  a  day
[13:00] that's  probably  not  gonna  happen
[13:06] if  you  have  that  level  of 
 need
[13:11] of  burning  desire  to  like  really  be 
 productive 
 you  need  to  be  extreme
[13:18] dopamine  detoxing  is  Extreme  and  it 
 seems  to 
 offend  and  insult  the  people  who  prefer
[13:25] to  have  a  balanced  lifestyle 
 and  I  don't  say  this  to  be  insulting  but 
 I  don't  I  know  a  couple  of  quite  a  fair
[13:32] amount  of  like  successful  people  now  you 
 see  how  many  subscribers  I've  got  like 
 and  obviously  I've  done  networking  with 
 other  people  and  everything  I  don't  know
[13:39] really 
 that  many  successful  people 
 who  aren't  extreme
[13:45] the  people  who  want  to  live  a  balanced 
 lifestyle  often  have  like  balanced 
 results  as  well  and  they  they  make
[13:50] enough  to  like  live  but  to  still 
 struggle  in  these  times
[13:56] they've  got  like 
 and  okay  physique  they're  not  muscular 
 they're  not  really  in  in  great  shape
[14:01] they're  just  kind  of  in  shape  they're 
 not  they're  not  out  of  shape  so  yeah 
 they  could  be  nice  to  live  a  Monday  in
[14:06] life 
 you  can  see  I'm  not  a  fan  of  that  maybe 
 someone  else's  and  maybe  they'll  be  like 
 yeah  you  know  like  balance  is  amazing
[14:11] I'd  rather  be  balanced  than  just  have 
 like  you  know  17  body  fat  and  and  not
[14:17] that  much  muscle  because  that  sounds 
 amazing  but 
 I  don't  know  maybe  I'm  just  being 
 offensive  but
[14:23] so  the  way  that  I  did  my  dopamine  detox 
 them  was  that  I
[14:28] thought  to  myself  I'm  not  going  to  cut 
 out  all  of  the  instant  gratification 
 because  if  I  do  eventually  I'll  go  back
[14:33] to  it  so  what  I  said  to  myself  was  that 
 I  would  do  a  drastic  reduction  in  the 
 instant  gratification  activities
[14:40] junk  food  you  know  porn  and  everything 
 and  I  would  you  know  somewhat  try  to  cut 
 it  out  completely  but  I  wouldn't  force
[14:46] that  I  wouldn't  see  myself  as  a  failure 
 if  I  couldn't  cut  it  out  completely  I 
 would  just  drastically  try  to  reduce  it
[14:52] and  likewise  very  very  importantly  which 
 a  lot  of  these  other  guys  that  when  I 
 was  watching  all  these  videos  it  just
[14:57] like  you  can  see  I'm  still  kind  of 
 pissed  off  about  the  the  dopamine  detox 
 videos  because  I  don't  think  they  really
[15:02] helped  me  or  anyone  else  maybe  I'm  I'm 
 wrong  here  but  they  they  were  literally
[15:07] just  entertaining  videos  to  watch  which 
 kind  of  defeats  the  points  of  dopamine 
 detoxing  I  didn't  find  any  good
[15:12] education  from  them  what  I  realized  was 
 that  dopamine  detoxing  is  not  just  about 
 you  know  reducing  or  eliminating  the  bad
[15:19] dopamines  or  the  instant  gratification 
 activities  put  on  video  games  and 
 everything  it's  also  likewise  equally  as
[15:25] important  if  not  more  important  of 
 drastically  increasing  the  delayed 
 gratification  activities
[15:31] because  the  reason  like  we  don't  we're 
 not  just  cutting  out  pleasure  for  the 
 sake  of  it  that  might  be  a  good  practice
[15:36] to  do  for  you  know  a  sense  of  stoicism 
 but  we're  cutting  our  pleasure  for 
 purpose
[15:41] there  needs  to  be  a  purpose  for  this 
 dopamine  detox  so  what  is  the  purpose 
 for  me 
 it  was  to  level  up  in  this  in  this
[15:46] business  at  first  when  I  first  started 
 this  channel  two  years  ago  it  was  solely 
 just  a  business  it's  become  a  global
[15:51] movement  of  young  men  who  have  taken 
 back  control  of  their  lives  now  but  at 
 the  time  in  May  2020  when  I  really
[15:56] started  uploading  to  this  channel  I 
 literally  just  did  it  just  because  I 
 just  wanted  some  money  because  I  was 
 broke  and  I  just  moved  back  home  to  my
[16:01] parents  house  and  I  just  wanted  to  make 
 like  1  000  pounds  a  month  online  and  um 
 that  was  what  I  began  to  spend  my  time
[16:08] with  what  I  did  which  I'm  still 
 impressed  by  having  been  like  literally 
 just  a  procrastinator  for  all  of  my  life
[16:14] you  know  not  a  productive  person  when  I 
 got  onto  this  dopamine  detox  what  I  did 
 which  absolutely  blew  my  mind  was  I
[16:20] wrote  down  a  timetable  like  a  schedule 
 for  when  I  would  do  things  and  I  still
[16:26] have  a  variation  of  that  on  my  phone 
 which  I'll  just  briefly  show  you  you 
 don't  need  to  like  see  it  exactly  and 
 you  know  like  pause  the  video  to  just
[16:32] because  I'll  explain  it  to  you  so  it's 
 not  like  um  that  important  of  what  I've 
 wrote  down  it's  just  the  concept  of  it
[16:37] let  me  just  find  it  for  you  here 
 so  this  is  this  is  what  it  looks  like
[16:42] I'll  I'll  read  it  out  to  you  what  I  have 
 on  there  doesn't  matter  do  you  literally 
 just  need  to  see  a  glimpse  of  how  the
[16:48] structure  is  right  so  what  what's  on 
 there  doesn't  matter  all  the  structure 
 that  matters  like  all  you  need  to  pay 
 attention  to  is  on  the  left  hand  side
[16:53] there's  the  time  and  on  the  uh  the  right 
 hand  side  there's  like  the  tasks  that 
 I'll  do
[16:58] that's  it  you  don't  need  to  see  what 
 I've  put  there  because  it's  very 
 individual  for  each  each  person  but  what
[17:03] it  was  that  every  single  day 
 I  just  follow  as  best  as  I  could  this 
 timetable  5  a.m  wake  up  5  30  morning
[17:10] routine  6  a.m  gym  9  A.M  post  workout 
 meal  9  30  record  like  every  single  day
[17:15] following  the  exact  same  thing  and  of 
 course  you  know  your  day  changes  and  you 
 know  life  gets  in  the  way  that's  fine 
 but  my  idea  was  that  if  I  write  down  my
[17:21] absolute  ideal  10  out  of  10  productive 
 crazy  productive  day
[17:26] and  I  try  and  follow  it  as  best  as  I  can 
 and  I  end  up  following  it 
 for  50  of  the  day
[17:32] that's  still  incredibly  better  than  my 
 usual  days  when  I  would  just  wake  up  and
[17:37] smoke  weed  isn't  it 
 if  this  was  my  perfect  day  and  I  only 
 followed  it  for  30  of  the  day  you  know
[17:43] it's  hard  to  quantify  but  let's  just 
 take  it  30  of  the  day  that  would  still 
 be  better  than  the  normal  days  I  was
[17:48] having  before  my  dopamine  detox  but  now 
 I've  kind  of  made  the  rule  that  you  know 
 I'm  gonna  try  my  best  to  stay  away  from
[17:53] the  instant  gratification  activities 
 that  were  taking  so  much  of  my  time 
 I  suddenly  had  nothing  else  to  do  than
[17:59] to  just  follow  this  timetable  now  again 
 of  course  there  was  times  when  like  I 
 just  did  the  bad  things  you  know  I  spent
[18:04] an  extra  like  hour  by  accident  just 
 watching  stupid  YouTube  videos  or  you 
 know  some  back  then  two  years  ago  like  I
[18:10] was  I  was  on  tindered  like  trying  to  get 
 laid  and  stuff  so  I'd  be  on  Tinder  just 
 spending  time  on  Tinder  messaging  a 
 bunch  of  girls  and  going  on  to  like
[18:16] um  text  messages  and  everything 
 but  largely  like  I  followed  it  as  best
[18:21] as  I  could  and  I  started  to  see  insane 
 progress  not  even  in  the  business  and
[18:26] you  know  the  work  I  was  doing  here  and 
 the  money  that  I  was  making  but  also  in 
 my  physique  but  best  of  all  in  my  mental
[18:32] health 
 I  didn't  realize  just  how  much  the 
 instant  gratification  activities  like
[18:37] video  games  this  is  why  I'm  so  heavily 
 against  video  games  even  though  I  know 
 how  fun  they  can  be  I  didn't  realize  how
[18:43] much  it  was  negatively  affecting  my 
 mental  health  up  until  I  fully  stopped 
 it  was  like  once  I  fully  stopped  and  I
[18:48] stopped  coping  and  saying  oh  you  know 
 what  if  I  just  like  play  a  little  bit 
 what  if  I  just  make  a  new  account  on 
 RuneScape  and  I  start  like  killing  other
[18:53] people  you  know  like  I  go  do  PVP  and 
 what  if  I  try  this  and  this  and  this 
 once  I  fully  stopped  coping
[18:59] I  had  such  a  boost  to  my  mental  health 
 because  something's  just  clicked  you
[19:04] might  not  be  able  to  relate  to  this  if 
 you  still  play  video  games  but  a  lot  of 
 the  guys  who  have  quit  will  relate 
 something  clicked  I  was  like  oh
[19:11] real  life  is  really  like  a  video  game 
 why  have  I  been  leveling  up  for
[19:16] thousands  of  hours  in  the  virtual  world 
 when  I  can  go  level  up  in  real  life
[19:21] suddenly  I  became  so  much  happier  just 
 from  this  realization  of  just  saving
[19:26] time  and  actually  wanting  to  improve  in 
 real  life  instead  of  just  putting  all  my 
 focus  into  improving  in  a  video  game
[19:31] what  I  realized  was  that  even  playing 
 one  hour  a  day  wasn't  okay  playing  one
[19:36] hour  a  day  wasn't  fine  because  with  just 
 one  hour  a  day  it's  like  I  would 
 displace  some  of  my  masculine  urge  to
[19:42] improve  and  level  up  into  the  game 
 instead  I  didn't  want  that  to  sap  my 
 urge  to  level  up  so  when  I  completely
[19:48] stopped  playing  video  games  it's  like  I 
 still  had  this  urge  on  this  mask  if 
 you're  a  man  you  have  this  there's
[19:53] masculine  desire  to  like  progress  to 
 make  to  level  up  when  that's  not  being 
 stolen  from  you  from  video  games  it's
[19:58] like  suddenly  just  automatically  you 
 start  making  progress  in  real  life  it's 
 just  how  it  works  being  a  man  if  you
[20:03] have  no  distractions  as  a  man  you 
 literally  will  just  stop  making  progress 
 but  when  you  have  distractions  when  you
[20:09] have  video  games  when  you  have  anime 
 when  you  have  porn  your  focus  is  just 
 diverse  everywhere  and  suddenly  your
[20:14] real  life  just  goes  to  shambles
[20:20] another  thing  which  was  a  huge  one  which 
 is  relevant  right  now  was  my  diet  for  a
[20:25] long  time  I  was  a  binge  eater  for 
 literally  most  of  my  life  Benji  incomes 
 from  like  poor  mental  health  I  had  a
[20:32] very  like  traumatic  abusive  childhood 
 and  even  more  sort  of  like  traumatic 
 experiences  as  an  adult  which  um
[20:38] you  know  kind  of  like  [ __ ]  up  my 
 mental  space  and  I  had  like  extreme 
 anxiety  and  this  isn't  one  of  those
[20:44] cases  of  you  know  like  someone  telling 
 you  they've  got  mental  health  issues 
 yeah  like  I  wasn't  taking  medications 
 for  it  but  like  I  did  because  I  didn't
[20:49] even  know  like  I  wasn't  like  identifying 
 as  someone  with  mental  health  issues  at 
 the  time  it  was  only  afterwards  when  I
[20:55] realized  what  it  was  but  yeah  like  I  had 
 extreme  anxiety  I  had  like  you  know  um
[21:00] like  intrusive  violent  thoughts  so 
 imagine  I'd  be  going  about  my  day  and 
 just  suddenly  get  a  violent  thought 
 about  hurting  someone  and  I'd  visually
[21:06] see  myself  like  hurting  like  someone 
 who's  being  racist  to  me 
 that  was  what  happened  to  me  like  the
[21:12] traumatic  incident  when  I  was  um  19 
 years  old  I  had  like  two  racist  guys 
 like  fully  like  followed  me  onto  like  a
[21:19] train  and  try  and  hurt  me  and  um maybe 
 you  can  relate  us  not  that  story  exactly
[21:24] but  like  maybe  you  can  relate  to  this 
 feeling  of  just  getting  random  thoughts 
 which  are  very  negative  very  violent
[21:30] very  aggressive  very  self 
 uh  deprecating
[21:35] that  was  happening  to  me  so  often  for 
 most  of  my  life 
 and  it  was  just  you  know  I  was  just
[21:40] living  like  it  I  didn't  realize  that  you 
 know  that  was  it  was  never  a  I  was  never 
 aware  that  I  was  like  a  real  mental
[21:46] health  problem  because  I  was  just  always 
 lived  like  that  and  it  was  only  when  I 
 went  on  this  dopamine  detox  and  I  had  so
[21:51] much  free  time  and  energy  in  my  mind 
 wasn't  going  on  so  you  know  these 
 platforms  and  video  games  and  and  um
[21:56] Instagram  and  everything  suddenly  I  then 
 had  the  awareness  to  just  ask  myself 
 again  like  yeah  like  why  is  that
[22:02] happening 
 and  so  I  started  researching  it 
 I  started  learning  online  about  mental
[22:08] health  and  suddenly  like  I  actually 
 gained  like  a  very  good  understanding  of 
 depression  and  anxiety  and  you  know 
 these  Concepts  which  I  talk  about  today
[22:13] like  dopamine  detox  and 
 instagramification  delayed  gratification 
 I  got  like  a  pretty  good  understanding
[22:18] of  it  and  suddenly  I  just  realized  like 
 oh  mental  health  is  a  skill  that  I  can 
 level  up  and  now  that  I  have  time  and
[22:24] energy  and  you  know  my  dopamine  levels 
 are  like  getting  back  to  normal  I 
 actually  had  the  desire  to  literally
[22:30] spend  time  meditating  and  journaling  and 
 just  learning  about  mental  health  I 
 remember  this  like  I  literally  just  went
[22:36] on  Google  and  started  searching  for  like 
 mental  health  lectures  and  everything 
 and  I  learned  quite  a  lot  like  that  and
[22:41] to  think  that  20  I'm  25  but  like  23  year 
 old  me  was  spending  time  watching  Mental
[22:47] Health  University  lectures 
 just  blows  my  mind  because  for  most  of 
 my  life  like  I  wasn't  into  education  I
[22:53] always  thought  that  that  was  a  gay  I 
 always  thought  I  was  like  weird 
 I  didn't  even  plan  to  show  you  this  but
[22:58] bro  right  next  to  me  I  have  I  have  a 
 book  How  to  Win  Friends  and  Influence 
 People  like  I  literally  didn't  I  didn't 
 think  I'd  show  you  and  I  just  had  it
[23:03] next  to  me  like  I  love  learning  now 
 one  of  the  best  parts  of  being  on  the
[23:08] dopamine  detox  is  that  you  you  just  like 
 to  do  the  good  habits  because  you  aren't
[23:14] doing  the  bad  ones 
 the  reason  why  I  enjoy  learning  so  much 
 and  reading  books  so  much  is  because
[23:19] it's  one  of  the  most  fun  things  that  I 
 do  if  suddenly  I  played  one  hour  of 
 video  games  a  day  if  suddenly  I  went  on
[23:25] Tick  Tock  or  Instagram  or  watch  porn 
 those  things  would  be  so  so  fun  and
[23:30] enjoyable  even  though  you  know  we  say 
 those  things  about  the  thing  is  like 
 they  are  [ __ ]  enjoyable  they  are 
 extremely  addictive  aren't  they  they're
[23:35] so  pleasurable  to  like  our  sort  of 
 animal  brain  that  then  you  can't  even
[23:40] enjoy  the  the  smaller  things  in  life 
 like  just  reading  a  book 
 that's  exactly  what  happened  with  my
[23:46] diet  I  fried  like  my  if  that's  the 
 scientific  term  of  like  my  dopamine 
 receptors  in  terms  of  my  diet
[23:52] for  a  long  time  I  was  just  eating  like  a 
 child  like  junk  food  snacks  sweet
[23:57] Pizza  you  know  just  quick  stuff  that  you 
 you  could  just  like  throw  in  quickly 
 because  you  were  like  being  lazy  that's
[24:02] all  I  really  ate  for  most  of  my  life 
 and  suddenly  you  know  I  wasn't
[24:07] technically  allowed  to  eat  that  anymore 
 because  I  was  on  this  dopamine  detox  I 
 can't  really  eat  like  you  know  junk  food
[24:12] so  I've  got  to  start  eating  clean 
 again  I  had  the  desire  to  learn  and  so
[24:17] for  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  started 
 to  research  nutrition 
 so  I  started  to  what's  like  nutritional
[24:22] lectures  and  I  realized  what  food 
 actually  does  to  you  and  this  literally 
 blew  my  mind  because  I  had  been  into
[24:28] fitness  you  know  weightlifting  building 
 muscle  for  years  and  I'd  always  followed 
 the  fitness  influencers  like  the
[24:33] YouTubers  I  saw  and  it  always  listened 
 to  them  and  they  told  me  yeah  you  know 
 calories  in  calories  out  just  eat 
 whatever  you  want  better  protein  carbs
[24:38] and  fats  and  stuff  so  I've  did  that  you 
 know  If  It  Fits  your  Macros  I  did  that 
 way  you  like  you  just  track  the  macros
[24:43] on  this  app  called  MyFitnessPal  I  always 
 did  that  and  thought  yeah  well  that's 
 what  everyone's  saying
[24:48] then  when  I  started  to  actually  research 
 nutrition  and  I'm  not  gonna  lie  I  only 
 need  to  research  there  for  a  couple  of 
 hours
[24:53] I  realize  that  none  of  these  Fitness 
 influencers  actually  knew  anything  what 
 they  were  talking  about  because  this
[24:58] idea  that  like  oh  calories  in  calories 
 are  all  calories  are  the  same  like
[25:03] once  you  do  20  minutes  of  research  onto 
 nutrition 
 and  you  hear  the  same  phrase  like  oh
[25:09] calories  in  calories  out  you'll  just 
 think  yeah  they're  actually  stupid  I 
 don't  say  that  to  be  horribly  offensive
[25:14] like  they're  actually  like  you  know  I'm 
 gonna  be  a  little  bit  insulting  they're 
 actually  brain  dead  some  of  these
[25:19] Fitness  influences  they've  got  to  be 
 stupid  to  believe  calories  in  calories 
 out
[25:24] they  are  but  it's  physics  the  the  laws 
 the  human  body  does  not  work  with 
 physics
[25:29] it's  biology  it's  biochemistry 
 what  actually  matters  is  what  this
[25:34] nutrition  is  doing  to  our  hormones  none 
 of  the  fitness  influencers  know  anything 
 more  than  just  our  calories  and  like  736
[25:41] grams  of  protein 
 so  I  started  researching  this  and  I 
 realized  that  all  my  life  I  was  eating 
 the  stuff  that  like  these  guys  promoted
[25:47] to  me  you  know  Krispy  Kreme  donuts  and 
 everything  and  I  realized  that  oh  that
[25:52] stuff's  not  actually  healthy  for  you 
 just  because  these  Fitness  influences 
 with  muscle  who  are  lean  are  showing  it
[25:57] doesn't  mean  that  it's  healthy  I 
 realized 
 whatever  you  eat  just  has  an  effect  on
[26:02] your  hormones  and  when  you  eat  shitty 
 junk  food 
 your  hormones  get  [ __ ]
[26:08] and  your  intelligence  literally  drops 
 you  you  literally  like  become  less  smart
[26:13] the  worst  junk  food  that  you  eat 
 I  was  watching  all  this  nutritional  like
[26:19] data  and  you  know  this  research  and 
 lectures  and  stuff  just  thinking  like  I 
 wish  someone  told  me  this  message  after
[26:25] I've  just  I've  suffered  from  years  of 
 binge  eating  when  I  turned  into  like  a 
 weight  lifter  going  to  the  gym  trying  to
[26:30] get  protein  and  just  like  eating  carbs 
 and  cereal  because  that's  what  all  these 
 Fitness  YouTubers  were  telling  me  to  do 
 eat  cereal  before  my  workout  and  stuff
[26:36] then  I've  learned  that  oh  yeah  sugar 
 skyrockets  your  insulin
[26:41] insulin  is  a  hormone  that  we  don't  want 
 that  high  and  when  your  insulin  goes  up 
 your  leptin  hormone  goes  down  and  when
[26:47] your  left  and  hormone  goes  down 
 you  don't  feel  as  full  like  leptiness 
 like  the  hormone  that
[26:53] that  is  created  in  your  body  to  signal 
 that  you're  done  eating  and  you're  full 
 when  you  eat  sugar  your  insulin  goes  up
[27:00] your  leptin  goes  down  when  you  eat  sugar 
 that  literally  means  that  you  literally 
 feel  less  full  and  that  causes  you  to 
 overeat
[27:06] there's  no  Fitness  YouTuber  out  there 
 who  knew  this  show  like  they're  just 
 eating  [ __ ]  cereal  and  stuff  and
[27:11] wondering  why  they  keep  binge  eating 
 after  all  of  their  like  Fitness 
 competitions  and  stuff
[27:16] the  the  one  like  you  know  they  get  a  lot 
 of  views  so  you  know  you  can  say  it's  a 
 business  Advantage  but  you  see  these
[27:21] Fitness  YouTubers  do  a  10  000  calorie 
 challenge  every  month  they're  not  doing 
 it  because  of  like  oh  it's  a  good  thing
[27:26] to  do  they're  not  doing  it  because  of 
 like  science  or  some  [ __ ]  they're  doing 
 it  because  they  can't  control  themselves 
 and  so  they  cope  and  they're  like  oh
[27:31] well  yeah  I  really  want  to  binge  eat 
 because  I've  got  bad  mental  health  and 
 they're  eating  [ __ ]  food  oh  well  I  may
[27:36] as  well  do  a  10  000  calorie  challenge 
 so  along  the  same  time 
 not  only  did  I  drastically  improve  my  my
[27:43] diets  my  physique  just  transformed  in 
 front  of  my  eyes  I  had  like  somewhat  of
[27:48] a  like  a  fairly  okay  physique  for 
 someone  who  had  been  training  for  a 
 while 
 but  it  was  around  this  time  in  my
[27:54] dopamine  detox  days  where  I  fully  just 
 got  shredded  for  the  first  time  ever  and
[27:59] it  was  hard  for  me  to  gain  extra  fat 
 with  the  diet  that  I  went  on  bro  the 
 diet  that  I  went  on  and  the  workout
[28:05] routine  that  I  went  on  it  became  so  hard 
 for  me  like  it  literally  was  hard  for  me
[28:10] to  gain  weight  I  shredded  all  the  fat 
 that  I  had  packed  on  lean  muscle  mass 
 which  all  these  Fitness  YouTubers  said
[28:16] it  was  impossible  to  gain  leading  muscle 
 mouth  that's  exactly  what  happened 
 why 
 because  I  started  eating  clean
[28:24] shouldn't  blow  your  mind  but  literally 
 for  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  started 
 eating  clean  I  literally  just  ate  meat
[28:30] and  vegetables  and  like  the  most  like 
 unhealthy  thing  that  I  ate  was  like  oats
[28:35] oh  it's  not  even  like  you  know  they're 
 quite  heavily  processed  because  they're 
 like  obviously  not  natural  ingredients 
 but  they're  not  really  that  unhealthy
[28:41] that  was  it 
 just  meat  and  vegetables  that's  pretty 
 much  all  I  was  just  eating
[28:47] no  longer  eating  cereal  no  longer 
 ordering  fast  food  like  all  these 
 YouTubers  who  say  oh  you  know  I  just
[28:52] ordered  from  like  KFC  or  some  [ __ ]  not 
 no  longer  doing  that  lean  meat 
 vegetables  got  shredded  got  strong
[29:00] my  athleticism  kicked  up  into  overdrive 
 for  the  first  time  my  life  actually  was 
 able  to  like  run  control  my  breathing
[29:06] whilst  running 
 do  like  a  whole  new  style  of  exercise 
 called  the  gymnastic  rings  and  I  did
[29:11] those  workouts  disciplined  skyrocketed 
 alongside  that  but  switching  over  to
[29:16] this  diet  had  such  a  huge  impact  onto  my 
 brain 
 I  have  a  slight  fear  that  I'll  get
[29:22] canceled  I  probably  won't  because  we're 
 29  minutes  into  this  video  probably 
 won't 
 maybe  it's  a  bit  of  a  conspiracy  theory
[29:28] but  like 
 the  modern  diets  is  extremely  extremely
[29:34] silly  the  modern  diet  that  we  have  the 
 average  person  eats
[29:40] what  they  think  isn't  that  bad 
 you  don't  and  you  know  the  thing  is  most
[29:45] people  with  diets  they  only  think  about 
 what  it  does  to  their  body  don't  they  of 
 how  they  look  how  much  fat  they've
[29:51] gained  that's  it  that's  most  people 
 thinking 
 you  realize  that  what  you  eat  has  a  huge
[29:56] impact  on  your  brain  and  perhaps  the 
 single  greatest  reason  why  you  feel 
 tired  while  you  feel  like  you  don't  have
[30:02] energy  while  you  feel  like  a  struggle 
 with  you  know  learning  something  in  your 
 studies  or  doing  some  work  and  you  while
[30:08] you  procrastinate  you've  always  been 
 thinking  it's  about  like  productivity 
 tips  that  you  need  to  try  and  do  the 
 Pomodoro  Technique  that  it's  about  like
[30:14] you  need  to  incentivize  yourself  to  like 
 um  sit  down  and  do  25  minutes  of  work
[30:19] it's  not  that  bro 
 the  reason  why  most  people  can't  do  any 
 good  work  the  reason  why  most  people's
[30:24] brains  are  just  not  that  good  is  because 
 of  their  diets  because  they're  just 
 eating  shitty  Western  food  like
[30:29] processed  junk  food  high  sugar 
 refined  food  trans  fats  fast  food
[30:34] McDonald's  and  [ __ ] 
 I  switched  over  to  just  a  clean  diet  of
[30:40] literally  just  meat  and  vegetables  and 
 for  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  stopped 
 procrastinating  I  built  a  successful
[30:46] business  I  went  from  being  on  benefits 
 of  government  welfare  you  don't  realize 
 how  low  down  like  how  much  of  a  rut  I
[30:51] was  in  when  I  first  discovered  the 
 dopamine  detox  Pro  I  was  on  government 
 welfare
[30:57] I  switched  over  to  the  dopamine  detox 
 Lifestyle  the  diet  the  hard  work  one 
 year  later  I  started  making  10  000
[31:03] pounds  per  month 
 a  year  after  that  now  we're  on  about
[31:08] 50  and  it's  drastically  going  to 
 increase  and  I  will  say  that  again 
 that's  per  month
[31:24] My  Hope  with  this  video  is  that  it 
 spreads  out 
 and  as  someone  who  needs  to  hear  it
[31:29] watches  it  the  entire  way  through 
 because  dopamine  detoxing  changed  my
[31:34] life  forever  and  I  didn't  realize  it  was 
 as  simple  as  just  stopping  the  bad
[31:39] habits  the  instant  gratification  and 
 just  doing  the  good  habits  you  know  you 
 always  have  that  desire  through  your
[31:44] life  to  like  yeah  you  know  stop  eating 
 as  much  junk  food  maybe  yeah  go  and 
 exercise  maybe  read  some  books  you've 
 always  kind  of  got  it  but  you  never
[31:50] really  take  it  like  that  seriously  you 
 always  kind  of  skip  it  and  I  mean  you're 
 always  just  like  it's  just  someone  in
[31:55] everyone's  mind  to  you  know  maybe  I'll 
 go  to  the  gym  once  a  week  or  so  you  know 
 everyone  kind  of  knows  what  they  should
[32:00] do  what  they  shouldn't  do  but  you  never 
 really  take  it  that  seriously  most 
 people  say  like  they're  gonna  go  on  a
[32:05] diet  and  then  they  don't  stick  to  it  and 
 then  they  just  go  back  to  eating 
 whatever  most  people  do  the  exact  same
[32:10] with  like  just  content  consumption  just 
 watching  over  stimulating  content  shorts
[32:15] tick  tocks  and  everything
[32:20] but  the  point  that  it  got  me  to 
 from  just  a  simple  Act  of  stopping  the
[32:27] bad  habits  and  starting  the  good 
 I  can't  believe  that  I've  got  to  this
[32:32] position  in  life  and  I'm  certainly  not 
 the  end  I'm  not  as  like  successful  as  I 
 want  to  be  this  people  who  are  so  much 
 more  successful  and  Wealthy  than  I  am
[32:37] and  I've  become  like  friends  with  some 
 guys  who  are  very  very  wealthy  and  so
[32:42] that  you  know  they're  impressing  me  and 
 I  want  to  get  to  their  level 
 but  the  fact  I  think  that  like  I've  only 
 been  like  this  for  two  years  I've  only
[32:48] been  productive  like  I  wasn't  productive 
 for  all  of  my  life  out  like  even  I  went 
 to  University  but  I  never  studied  I  was
[32:53] like  I  always  just  like  wouldn't  mind 
 one  day  you  know  the  teacher  the 
 professor  is  saying  something  I'm  not 
 even  focusing  imagine  being  in  class  the
[32:59] teachers  you  know  telling  you  to  do  [ __ ] 
 or  the  teachers  like  teaching  you  about 
 something  and  your  brain's  just  like
[33:04] talking  over  them  in  your  mind  you  can't 
 even  listen  to  them  properly  like  I 
 wanted  to  listen  join  me  through  all  my
[33:09] time  I  wanted  to  like  through  my 
 childhood  my  teenage  years  my  early 
 adult  years  like  I  wanted  to  be 
 productive  I  wanted  to  be  successful  I
[33:14] wanted  to  be  able  to  get  good  grades  in 
 schools  I  just  was  never  able  to  because 
 my  brain  was  always  fried  and  yeah  the
[33:20] other  scientific  term  doesn't  make  sense 
 but  bro  I  started  playing  video  games 
 when  I  was  like  five  years  old  I  was
[33:26] playing  video  games  in  primary  school  I 
 was  in  primary  school  when  I  was  six 
 seven  years  nine  years  old
[33:32] unable  to  listen  to  the  primary  school 
 teacher  because  I  was  playing  video 
 games  in  high  school  I  was  unable  to
[33:38] listen  to  the  teacher  because  I  was 
 playing  video  games  and  my  mind  was 
 obsessed  with  it  I  would  be  in  class
[33:43] thinking  about  video  games 
 the  rest  of  the  kids  around  me 
 especially  the  girls  that  had  hit  in
[33:48] puberty  they're  all  growing  up  a  little 
 bit  I'm  just  like  still  this  little  boy 
 who's  still  stuck  in  the  virtual  world
[33:53] unable  to  even  focus  on  his  studies  and 
 like  yeah  you  know  pursuing  like  the 
 your  studies  in  terms  of  the  education
[33:59] system  I  don't  think  it's  a  really  good 
 idea  I  think  University  is  like  a  scam 
 and  everything  but  even  then  I  wanted  to
[34:04] still  get  good  grades  because  I  knew 
 that  that  was  like  a  good  thing  to  do 
 and  I  wouldn't  study  I  wouldn't  do  my
[34:09] homework  I  wasn't  able  to  concentrate  in 
 school 
 because  in  my  mind  I  was  just  elsewhere 
 I  was  thinking  about  what  I'd  do  next  in
[34:14] Runescape 
 a  dopamine  receptors  were  fried  I  was 
 eating  [ __ ]  food
[34:20] I  wish  I  could  go  back  pass  a  message 
 like  this  to  younger  Hamza  and  just  tell
[34:25] them  to  con  just  potentially  to  consider 
 something  like  this  consider  a  new
[34:30] chapter  of  your  life  a  new  identity 
 where  you  drastically  reduce  how  much  of
[34:35] the  instant  gratification  that  you  do  do 
 drastically  reduce  all  of  the  bad  habits 
 and  suddenly  just  start  doing  all  of  the
[34:41] good  habits  no  matter  how  it  makes  you 
 feel  you  discipline  yourself  to  just 
 literally  do  all  the  good  habits  and
[34:46] just  drastically  try  your  absolute  best 
 to  drastically  reduce  all  of  the  bad 
 habits  it  must  be  all  of  them  and
[34:52] there's  going  to  be  a  certain  one  that 
 you  really  don't  want  to  give  up  and 
 that's  the  exact  one  that  if  you  gave  up
[34:57] your  new  your  new  life  would  just  be 
 Unleashed 
 the  reason  why  I'm  saying  this  so  much
[35:03] in  this  video  you  know  that  that  one 
 there's  something  that  you  don't  want  to 
 give  up  just  right  now 
 because  whatever  it  is  whatever  is  in
[35:09] your  mind  of  the  instant  gratification 
 activities  whether  it's  video  games  or 
 something 
 it's  that  one  that's  going  to  unleash
[35:15] this  new  chapter  of  your  life  you  don't 
 realize  how  much  you're  missing  out  on 
 up  until  you  go  two  three  weeks  without
[35:20] like  your  main  crutch  because  when  you 
 do  that  and  you  also  have  the  you  know 
 the  the  sort  of  focus  to  go  and  do  some
[35:26] of  the  good  habits  you  realize  just  how 
 good  life  can  be
[35:33] 12  p.m  right  now 
 12  P.M 
 I've  been  awake  since  five  so  it's  been
[35:39] seven  hours  I've  not  ate  anything 
 I've  just  been  drinking  water  I've  just
[35:44] been  recording  videos  I've  recorded 
 seven  videos  this  morning  seven  videos 
 that's  a  week's  worth  of  content  in  one
[35:49] morning  in  one  morning  it's  not  even 
 like  it's  just  about  lunch  time  by 
 lunchtime  I've  done  a  week's  worth  of
[35:55] work 
 this  is  the  dopamine  detox  lifestyle
[36:00] I  will  say  that  again  and  this  I'm  not 
 even  saying  it  to  you  anymore 
 this  is  a  message  to  my  younger  self
[36:05] that  by  lunchtime  I  have  done  a  week's 
 worth  of  work
[36:10] whereas  for  most  of  my  life  I  didn't 
 even  do  like  a  day's  worth  of  work
[36:16] for  a  in  a  week's  time
[36:22] I  can't  explain  like  how  much  this 
 transformation  means  to  me  like  I  was 
 literally  just  like  you  know  just  a
[36:28] normal  guy  just  struggling  with  life  and 
 everything  and  now  I've  I've  become 
 successful
[36:35] I've  become  like  the  man  of  my  house 
 I've  retired  my  father  I've  been  I've 
 gotten  my  family's  respect
[36:45] foreign
[37:03] do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 mwah
