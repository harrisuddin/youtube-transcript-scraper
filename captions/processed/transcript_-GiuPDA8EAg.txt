[00:00] jeffrey  thinks  all  women  are  [ __ ]  i 
 hate  them  all  they're  all  [ __ ]  they're 
 all  stupid  why  won't  they  be  my  [ __ ]
[00:05] jeffrey  spends  40  days  and  40  nights 
 trying  to  learn  how  to  approach  women 
 but  he  does  it  all  in  the  wrong  way  he
[00:10] sees  them  as  the  enemy  he  doesn't  even 
 see  them  as  a  human  being  and  so  what 
 you  think  happens  when  jeffrey  goes  out
[00:16] and  tries  to  approach  women  nothing  he 
 never  even  takes  action  he  never  even 
 leaves  his  crusty  computer  chair  but  he
[00:21] just  continuously  watches  videos  on  how 
 to  approach  women  the  right  way  that's 
 not  you  is  it  i  first  learned  about  cold
[00:27] approaching  women  a  few  years  ago  and  i 
 was  hooked  straight  away  me  and  my 
 friend  levi  would  go  to  clubs  and  we'd
[00:32] be  speaking  to  girls  and  we'd  just  be 
 like 
 and  we  actually  did  pretty  well  very 
 often  in  the  middle  of  the  club
[00:37] everyone's  drinking  we'd  end  up  kissing 
 loads  of  girls  and  every  now  and  then 
 every  couple  of  nights  would  bring  a 
 girl  back  to  sleep  with  but  that  was  at
[00:43] night  time  what  about  in  the  daytime 
 what  about  day  game  and  you  know  i'm 
 pretty  blessed  to  say  that  for  me
[00:48] personally  day  game  has  always  pretty 
 much  been  relatively  successful  it's 
 just  that  i've  always  had  the  wrong
[00:53] mindset  so  i  was  never  able  to  do  it 
 properly  i  would  watch  too  many  videos 
 and  start  overthinking  i'd  see  the  girl
[00:58] that  i  wanted  to  talk  to  and  i  would 
 just  not  really  do  it  when  i  would  build 
 up  the  courage  to  go  speak  to  that  girl
[01:03] oftentimes  it  would  go  really  well  i 
 remember  that  i  got  some  of  the  best 
 experiences  of  my  life  in  terms  of 
 getting  girls  with  cold  approaching  and
[01:09] just  going  up  to  a  girl  and  just  asking 
 her  a  random  question  like  hey  excuse  me 
 do  you  know  what  time  this  gym  closes 
 and  she'll  say  something  like  uh  i  think
[01:15] it's  like  10  p.m  i'm  still  there  looking 
 at  her  i  go  to  this  gym  every  single  day 
 i  know  that  the  gym  is  24  hours  and  i'm
[01:20] like  oh  like  yeah 
 thank  you  so  what's  your  name  my  name's 
 samson  you  dumbass  it's  not  10  pm  stupid
[01:25] [ __ ] 
 adonis  isn't  afraid  to  go  speak  to  a 
 woman  why  would  he  he's  7  foot  3  376
[01:32] pounds  what  is  this  puny  human  going  to 
 do  to  him  adonis  hasn't  felt  approach 
 anxiety  since  he  was  a  teenager  and
[01:38] although  things  were  pretty  difficult 
 when  he  would  go  up  and  try  and  speak  to 
 girls  when  he  was  younger  he  overcame 
 the  trials  and  tribulations  and  learnt
[01:44] the  skills  and  the  right  mindset  and  now 
 adonis  feels  comfortable  around  new 
 women  the  best  mindset  that  you  can  have
[01:50] when  you're  going  out  to  approach  women 
 is  simply  success  equals  approaching
[01:55] instantly  focus  entirely  on  that  the 
 reason  why  approaching  seems  so  hard  the
[02:00] reason  why  sometimes  when  you  get  the 
 thought  okay  i  should  speak  to  her  and 
 you  start  overthinking  and  you  don't 
 want  to  do  it  is  because  we  play  out  the
[02:05] conversation  in  our  mind  and  we're 
 trying  to  think  okay  what  should  i  say 
 how  do  i  get  her  into  bed  with  the 
 highest  percentage  conversion  rate  of
[02:10] the  thing  that  i  can  say  but  there's 
 people  looking  and  we  overthink  things 
 too  much  we  simply  need  to  build  up  the
[02:15] habit  of  literally  just  going  up  to  a 
 girl  as  fast  as  possible  and  saying 
 anything  with  the  mindset  and  the
[02:21] humility  to  understand  that  the  first 
 tens  if  not  hundreds  of  times  that  we  go
[02:26] up  to  speak  to  girls  it's  gonna  be 
 pretty  trash  you  can't  expect  to  walk 
 into  the  gym  and  have  the  perfect  gym 
 workout  on  your  first  ever  session  can
[02:32] you  but  that's  what  a  lot  of  people  do 
 that's  what  a  lot  of  people  who  have 
 waited  for  the  new  year's  resolutions
[02:37] and  everything  they  think  of  the 
 ultimate  hardcore  workout  and  that's 
 exactly  why  they  don't  go  to  the  gym
[02:42] consistently  because  they've  set  the  bar 
 of  success  too  damn  high  when  you  go  out 
 to  approach  girls  or  when  you've  had  the
[02:47] thought  to  do  it  you've  set  the  bar  of 
 success  too  high  for  you  the  bar  of 
 successes  oh  like  the  the  number  closed
[02:52] and  she's  gonna  fall  in  love  with  me 
 maybe  we  can  have  a  sex  straight  away 
 and  maybe  we'll  go  on  a  date  straight 
 away  and  i've  got  to  be  able  to  be
[02:58] really  good  at  no  you  can't  expect  any 
 of  those  other  things  like  the  more 
 advanced  things  just  yet  that's  like
[03:03] hitting  a  pr  that's  like  hitting  three 
 plate  bench  press  it  takes  time  to 
 practice  to  get  to  those  results  right
[03:08] now  we  need  you  to  just  show  up  and  just 
 go  speak  and  say  anything  to  a  girl  just 
 like  for  the  beginner  we  need  this
[03:13] beginner  to  literally  just  show  up  to 
 the  gym  forget  the  best  workout  forget 
 like  you  know  overthinking  about  so  many
[03:18] uh  strength  training  or  hypertrophic 
 traits  before  rapper  two  second  he  said 
 forget  about  everything  else  bro  just
[03:23] come  to  the  gym  come  to  the  gym  for  20 
 minutes  you'll  make  progress  go  outside 
 speak  to  a  girl  stutter  mess  up  your
[03:29] words  slow  your  words  save  some  random 
 [ __ ]  doesn't  matter  specifically 
 training  that  habit  of  walking  up  and
[03:34] just  saying  something  is  the  most 
 important  part  that's  like  the 
 bottleneck  that  you  need  to  be  focused
[03:39] on  right  now  and  imagine  that  imagine 
 training  the  habit  that  would  allow  you 
 to  literally  just  go  up  smoothly
[03:44] instantly  and  go  speak  to  a  girl 
 hey  yo  you're  disturbing  her  she  doesn't
[03:49] want  to  speak  to  straight  shut  up  bro 
 she  doesn't  want  to  speak  the  strange 
 shut  up  it's  always  guys  who  say  this 
 like  i  don't  want  to  disturb  a  girl's
[03:54] work  bro  trust  me  when  i  say  and  anyone 
 who's  like  done  a  fair  amount  of 
 approaching  can  back  me  up  in  the 
 comments  the  overwhelming  pretty  much
[04:01] all  the  time  when  you  go  up  and  you 
 speak  in  like  a  nice  friendly  way  she  is 
 pleasant  she  actually  speaks  to  you  with
[04:06] a  massive  smile  on  your  face  there's 
 barely  ever  any  times  of  the 
 stereotypical  time  of  like  you'll  go  up 
 to  speak  to  a  girl  she'll  be  scared  and
[04:12] she'll  be  like  getting  ready  to  fight 
 you  some  it  doesn't  happen  in  real  life 
 bro  almost  every  time  i  go  to  speak  to  a
[04:17] girl  afterwards  i  just  think  like  why 
 was  i  overthinking  so  much  you  might 
 overthink  so  what  are  these  people  gonna
[04:22] say  okay  what's  the  best  sentence  to  use 
 i'd  go  up  say  something  silly  like  say 
 anything  and  it  ends  we  end  up  having  a
[04:27] pleasant  conversation  and  even  if  i 
 don't  get  her  number  even  if  i  don't  end 
 up  dating  her  or  sleeping  with  her  it's
[04:32] always  quite  a  pleasant  interaction  and 
 i  always  think  to  myself  why  did  my 
 brain  overthink  beforehand  it's  because
[04:37] i  have  set  the  intention  that  the 
 success  in  this  interaction  is  like  me 
 getting  the  number  close  success  simply
[04:43] equals  you  going  up  and  speaking  to  us 
 saying  anything  you  need  to  do  that  like 
 a  hundred  times  first  before  you  can
[04:48] actually  get  into  the  groove  and  get 
 used  to  this  then  you  can  start  having 
 the  better  intellectual  attractive
[04:53] conversations  but  first  we  need  you  to 
 at  least  enter  those  conversations  i 
 could  make  this  video  longer  and  i  could
[04:58] tell  you  that  the  best  uh  sentence  is  to 
 say  the  eye  contact  body  language  and 
 all  of  that  stuff  bro  but  get  everything
[05:04] because  that's  what's  making  you 
 overthink  and  that's  what's  stopping  you 
 from  actually  going  out  there  and  at 
 least  starting  the  initial  process  i
[05:11] love  my  mindset  more  than  everyone 
 else's  i've  seen  on  youtube  get  into  a 
 hundred  conversations  even  if  the
[05:16] conversation  is  trashed  you've  made 
 progress  you've  shown  up  to  the  gym  even 
 if  the  workout  is  trash  if  you've  shown
[05:21] up  as  a  beginner  you're  making  progress 
 do  not  be  like  that  fat  43  year  old 
 susan  who's  waiting  for  the  new  years
[05:26] because  she  had  one  workout  of  like  the 
 body  power  class  where  they  do  like  a 
 bunch  of  [ __ ]  cardio  and  like  50  reps
[05:31] and  she  never  comes  to  the  gym  again 
 because  it's  too  hard  because  success 
 equals  going  to  that  class  in  her  mind
[05:36] for  you  success  equals  having  the  best 
 conversation  and  too  often  when  i  speak 
 about  approaching  and  going  up  to  speak
[05:41] to  girls  a  lot  of  guys  will  come  to 
 comment  about  hamsa  tell  us  what  to  say 
 tell  me  what  to  say  hamza  if  that's  what 
 your  mindset  is  like  right  now  i  see  you
[05:47] scrolling  down  looking  for  those 
 comments  and  also  ready  to  like  type  one 
 if  no  one  else  don't  want  if  that  is 
 your  mindset  i  have  full  confidence  that
[05:52] you're  not  gonna  do  this  because  you're 
 overthinking  you're  like  the  guy  who 
 writes  a  [ __ ]  script  before  he  calls
[05:57] like  his  local  takeaway  before  you  call 
 someone  you've  already  prepared  the 
 script  you  don't  need  to  know  what  to 
 say  because  even  if  you  prepare  the
[06:03] script  even  if  you  know  what  to  say  or 
 you  don't  know  what  to  say  the  first  few 
 conversations  are  gonna  be  awkward
[06:08] they're  gonna  be  trash  but  the  guy  who's 
 prepared  the  script  will  overthink  so 
 much  more  that  he'll  miss  the
[06:13] opportunity  of  the  first  few 
 interactions  whereas  the  guy  who  has 
 like  the  lean  startup  like  you  know  hit
[06:18] the  ground  running  type  of  mindset  he'll 
 go  up  and  breeze  through  that  progress 
 forget  about  everything  else  literally
[06:24] just  focus  on  approaching  as  fast  as 
 possible  do  the hard  work  especially 
 when  you  don't  feel  like  it
