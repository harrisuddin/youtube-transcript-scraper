[00:00] jeffrey  is  like  the  bottom  80  of  men  who 
 don't  even  try  he  doesn't  exercise  he 
 doesn't  meditate  he  doesn't  practice
[00:05] gratitude  he  doesn't  read  he  doesn't 
 learn  he  doesn't  do  anything  productive 
 but  he  thinks  that  playing  video  games
[00:11] is  productive  he  thinks  that  practicing 
 to  be  an  esports  player  is  productive 
 what  a  dumbass  adonis  on  the  other  hand
[00:16] well  he's  the  best  of  us  he's  the 
 ultimate  man  that  we  aspire  to  be  like 
 he's  the  tribe  leader  the  one  who  gives
[00:22] back  the  most  he  delays  gratification 
 for  the  sake  of  other  people  because 
 adonis  understands  manhood  he
[00:27] understands  what  it  takes  to  feel 
 fulfilled  to  work  on  yourself  to  make 
 sacrifices  to  delay  gratification
[00:32] instead  of  pursuing  pleasure  to  fill 
 your  cup  to  the  brim  so  that  you  can 
 start  filling  up  the  cups  of  the  people
[00:37] that  you  love  two  very  different  lives 
 think  back  to  the  choices  that  you've 
 made  over  the  last  month  which  one  does
[00:43] it  sound  like  a  couple  of  weeks  ago  i 
 messaged  a  guy  on  instagram  his  name  is 
 iman  gadzi  and  you  might  have  seen  a
[00:48] previous  video  where  i  mentioned  him  and 
 how  he  retired  his  mother  at  such  a 
 young  age  i  messaged  him  and  said  that
[00:53] we  should  do  a  podcast  and  he  was  down 
 and  he  said  that  he'd  pay  for  the 
 travels  and  everything  for  me  to  come  to 
 him  and  so  i  was  thinking  oh  like  you
[00:59] know  it'd  be  nice  to  come  to  london  for 
 a  night  or  something  this  muff  calls  me 
 to  be  like  oh  yeah  we'll  we'll  fly  you 
 out  to  business  class  huh  so  he's  in
[01:05] dubai  at  the  moment  slide  me  out 
 business  class  nice  and  fancy  trip  this 
 was  actually  the  first  experience  i've
[01:10] had  of  being  surrounded  by  like  wealth 
 and  like  ultra  successful  young  people
[01:15] so  it's  a  very  eye  opening  experience 
 for  me  and  so  i  lived  with  iman  in  his 
 apartment  for  like  four  days  we  slept  in
[01:20] the  same  bed 
 and  i  gave  me  a  separate  bed  they  slept 
 in  that  one  with  me
[01:26] um  and  i  got  to  see  what  kind  of  person 
 he  was  what  his  lifestyle  was  and  i 
 think  it's  very  interesting  because  we
[01:32] talk  a  lot  on  my  channel  in  like  the  red 
 pill  self-improvement  spaces  of  like 
 getting  into  the  certain  percentage  of
[01:37] men  who  are  like  very  successful 
 attractive  confident 
 i  would  go  as  far  to  say  that  this  right
[01:43] here  is  a  0.1  percent  man  that  isn't  me 
 like  you  know  trying  to  suck  his  dick  or 
 anything  the  truth  is  that  80  percent  of
[01:48] men  are  total  [ __ ]  losers  and  in 
 terms  of  his  wealth  i  believe  he'd  be 
 like  0.0001
[01:53] or  something  especially  for  young  people 
 but  even  in  his  physique  something  that 
 he  doesn't  necessarily  show  off  but  this
[01:58] is  a  well-rounded  man  who  built  up  like 
 a  fantastic  physique  i'm  bigger  than  him
[02:04] and  the  life  set  up  that  he  has  living 
 in  a  fancy  place  that's  very  central  in 
 dubai  he  has  like  popping  social  circles
[02:10] who  goes  on  trips  with  like  supermodels 
 and  does  almost  like  a  mini  done 
 berserian  lifestyle  it's  very 
 interesting  he's  like  a  successful
[02:16] focused  guy  who  does  focus  periods  of 
 monk  mode  for  like  six  months  and  then 
 also  does  like  the  partying  so  he  does
[02:22] the  iconic  work  hard  play  hard  and  since 
 i  got  to  know  him  i  saw  like  a  softer 
 side  to  him  where  we're  talking  about
[02:28] childhood  trauma  and  the  reason  why  it 
 does  all  this  and  so  much  of  his  work 
 and  the  sacrifices  that  he's  made  the
[02:33] dedication  that  he  put  in  revolved 
 around  just  helping  his  mother  because 
 he  saw  her  work  minimum  wage  and  being
[02:39] unemployed  sometimes  being  on  benefits 
 and  that  to  me  is  like  a  very  ambitious 
 like  beautiful  goal  to  have  i  do
[02:45] consider  iman  as  like  a  very 
 well-rounded  young  man  and  also  as  my 
 friend  now  so  i  wanted  to  do  almost  like
[02:50] an  autistic  case  study  to  kind  of 
 explain  to  you  what  i  saw  there  it's 
 specifically  in  terms  of  things  like
[02:55] sexual  market  value  and  i  think  this  is 
 going  to  be  beneficial  to  the  ambitious 
 guys  who  see  this  guy  and  think  yeah  i
[03:02] could  probably  accomplish  the  same 
 things  as  him  so  he  made  most  of  his 
 money  through  a  social  media  marketing
[03:07] agency  and  through  like  investments  like 
 crypto  and  he  is  worth  i  believe  around
[03:12] 10  million  right  now  at  the  age  of  22. 
 when  he  was  around  16  or  17  that's  when 
 he  started  making  like  50  to  100k  profit
[03:18] per  month  and  i  believe  now  he  makes 
 like  a  few  hundred  thousand  profit  per 
 month  from  the  business  plus  investments
[03:24] so  that  already  is  like  a  huge  level  of 
 income  and  what  it  equals  to  in  terms  of 
 sexual  market  value  is  the  life  setup
[03:30] that  he  gets  to  have  from  this  a 
 youtuber  i  really  like  first  man  spoke 
 about  this  where  he  said  that  just 
 numbers  in  your  bank  account  they're  not
[03:36] sexy  it  doesn't  mean  anything  to  be  rich 
 there's  lots  of  like  rich  guys  who  are 
 just  [ __ ]  disgusting  it  doesn't 
 matter  what  the  numbers  are  in  your  bank
[03:42] account  in  terms  of  sexual  market  value 
 in  terms  of  attracting  women  what  truly 
 matters  is  how  that  money  is  used  he-man
[03:47] uses  his  money  by  living  in  like  a  very 
 central  beautiful  like  up-level  place  in
[03:52] dubai  i  remember  when  i  went  to  the  show 
 first  service  that  he  organized  for  me 
 to  get  like  a  chauffeur  ride  and  they
[03:57] asked  me  which  address  i  was  going  to  i 
 told  them  the  place  that  i  was  going  to 
 where  he  lives  and  they  actually  looked 
 like  very  almost  stunned  and  impressed  i
[04:03] get  into  the  show  for  like  the  taxi  tell 
 the  same  guy  he  looks  back  at  me 
 impressed  that's  the  best  place  that's 
 one  of  the  newest  buildings  and  i  ended
[04:09] up  telling  a 
 escort  it's  a  long  story  i ended  up 
 telling  an  escort  where  we  were  staying
[04:15] and  again  as  i  saw  our  eyes  can  light  up 
 i  know  i  didn't  escort  bro  relax  i  think
[04:20] what  i  liked  most  about  the  level  of 
 wealth  that  he  had  was  that  he  used  it 
 in  very  like  sophisticated  like  posh
[04:26] ways  where  for  example  he  had  like  good 
 whiskey  and  vodka  always  ready  for  us  he 
 smoked  cigars  he  was  getting  like  you
[04:32] know  the  fancy  wine  and  he  knew  how  to 
 do  like  the  wine  tasting  thing  where  the 
 waiter  will  bring  you  the  bottle  and  you 
 have  to  like  you  have  to  nod  and  be  like
[04:38] yes  that  that  is  the  bottle  that  i 
 ordered  then  the  waiter  will  pour  like 
 one  sip  into  the  glass  and  you've  got  to
[04:44] do  this  [ __ ]  like 
 swirl  it 
 smell  it  drink  it  and  be  like
[04:49] yes  it  seems  to  be  wine  to  me 
 and  then  on  the  second  night  that  i  was
[04:54] staying  over  in  dubai  and  we  end  up 
 going  to  a  club  with  like  he  knows  like 
 a  bunch  of  people  there  we  walk  in  and 
 he  introduces  me  it's  like  a  couple  of
[05:00] girls  they've  got  like  table  service  and 
 he  is  the  guy  who  like  orders  like  the 
 bottles  you  know  like  the  champagne  and
[05:05] stuff  and  i'm  not  gonna  lie  i  always  and 
 still  somewhat  do  have  that  feeling  of 
 like  oh  what  a  [ __ ]  like  he  just
[05:10] spent  like  two  thousand  dollars  on  like 
 a  couple  bottles  of  champagne  but  it's 
 all  relevant  to  how  much  money  that  you
[05:15] make  so  there  was  a  point  when  he 
 casually  said  something  which  i  think  a 
 lot  of  people  would  see  it  as  like 
 arrogance  and  everything  but  to  me  i  saw
[05:21] it  as  inspiring  he  said  something  like 
 yeah  but  that's  like  20  pounds  to  me 
 when  you  make  so  much  your  barrier  to
[05:26] how  much  you  spend  of  course  increases 
 you  can  live  the  full  on  like  lifestyle 
 deflation  you  know  the  don't  buy  coffee
[05:32] type  of  financial  advice  but  the  truth 
 is  like  if  you're  a  young  guy  and  you've 
 been  financially  free  for  [ __ ]  years
[05:38] and  you're  just  railing  in  money  like 
 why  wouldn't  you  [ __ ]  you  like  i  i 
 think  it's  easy  for  me  and  you  right  now
[05:45] to  be  sat  here  be  like  but  we  i  wouldn't 
 spend  it  on  money  like  that  when  you 
 have  every  need  checked  off  when  you've 
 secured  financial  freedom  years  ago  and
[05:51] your  business  and  your  investments  are 
 just  making  more  and  more  and  more  and 
 more 
 why  not  and  you  know  it's  not  so  much
[05:57] related  to  smv  but  i  think  one  of  the 
 most  beautiful  things  that  iman  has  done
[06:02] is  that  he's  actually  gave  back  so  he 
 retired  his  mother  which  is  a  beautiful 
 story  but  he's  literally  paid  for
[06:08] schools  to  be  built  in  like  less 
 fortunate  countries  you  know  i  didn't 
 even  [ __ ]  like  this  guy  i'm  going  to
[06:13] be  completely  honest  i  told  this  to  to 
 his  face  the  first  time  that  i  actually 
 saw  his  videos  about  two  and  a  half
[06:18] years  ago  i've  told  you  the  same  story 
 previously  that  i  was  down  bad  i  was 
 smoking  weed  all  day  just  before  i  moved 
 back  home  and  when  i  discovered  online
[06:24] income  and  you  know i  was  trying  to  like 
 build  money  online  and  drop  shipping  and 
 all  this 
 his  adverts  would  play  on  youtube  and  i
[06:29] hated  this  [ __ ]  because  i  was  so 
 certain  that  he  was  lying  i  was  so 
 certain  that  it  was  all  bullsh  that
[06:35] there's  no  way  that  this  guy's  made  made 
 so  much  money  when  he's  younger  than  me 
 and  once  i  got  to  know  him  and  i've  seen 
 like  the  random  stuff  he's  done  which  is
[06:41] like  he's  literally  paid  for  [ __ ] 
 schools  there's  more  than  what  meets  the 
 eye  and  so  how  does  this  all  relate  to
[06:47] women  dating  and  having  sex  the  truth  is 
 that  i  went  to  dubai  and  it's  probably 
 what  you  would  have  expected  i  was
[06:52] surrounded  by  definitely  the  most 
 beautiful  like  instagram  model  but  not 
 really  like  the  trashy  instagram  model
[06:58] as  in  like  the  the  model  model  type  of 
 girls  very  interesting  dynamic  that  i 
 saw  which  again  is  kind  of  like  common
[07:04] sense  but  when  you  see  it  it  just  kind 
 of  like  you  know  makes  you  think 
 something  was  that  we  went  to  like  some 
 parties  and  everything  and  it  was  that
[07:09] same  dynamic  that  i  kept  on  scene  which 
 was  like  an  older  guy  with  a  young 
 beautiful  woman  kind  of like  stuff  that 
 chris  from  the  youtube  channel  first  man
[07:15] talks  about  the  male  advantage  but  in 
 terms  of  e-man  and  the  women  that  were 
 around  him  they  looked  beautiful  and 
 they  seemed  like  nice  sophisticated
[07:21] girls  and  he  had  like  an  aura  around  him 
 like  this  magnet  around  him  of  this  like 
 attention  and  like  everyone's  focus  is
[07:26] going  there  and  so  when  i  asked  him  some 
 autistic  questions  like  how  attractive 
 are  the  girls  that  you  get  you  know  what
[07:32] is  dating  like  for  you  and  he's  showing 
 me  like  some  girls  on  like  instagram  i'm 
 not  gonna  lie  like  they  were  like  fully
[07:38] fully  like  the  [ __ ]  like  nines  and 
 tens  like  the  real  nines  and  tons  it  was 
 funniest  he  literally  showed  me  that
[07:43] he's  been  with  like  the  same  girls  that 
 like  famous  rappers  have  been  with  like 
 showing  me  like  that  guy  like  some
[07:49] famous  rapper  like  i  won't  say  his  name 
 or  anything  just  in  cases  but  like 
 famous  rappers  are  following  the  same 
 girl  that  he's  been  with  i  think  one  of
[07:54] the  most  important  parts  of  all  this  was 
 the  level  of  confidence  that  he  gained 
 through  these  experiences  so  there  was  a
[08:00] moment  we  were  speaking  about  like 
 hooking  up  and  you  know  being  a 
 degenerate  and  he  was  saying  that  he
[08:05] doesn't  like  the  idea  of  chasing  women 
 and  being  in  a  club  and  you  know  going 
 out  the  specific  word  to  use  was  that
[08:11] before  he  goes  out  to  like  a  club  or  a 
 party  he  already  knows  which  girl  is 
 going  to  come  back  with  him  here  we  have
[08:16] a  young  man  who's  built  a  certain 
 lifestyle  that  i  think  an  overwhelming 
 majority  of  young  men  actually  somewhat
[08:21] aspire  to  be  like 
 [Music] 
 i  don't  know if  this  video  is  making  him
[08:26] to 
 be  seen  as  a  degenerate 
 you  know  what  i  was  just  kind  of  saying
[08:32] underneath  my  breath  just  then  i  like 
 wasn't  really  expecting  to  put  that  in 
 the  video  where  i  just  thought  to  myself
[08:37] wait  is  this  it's  like  i  like  this  guy 
 what  kind  of  friends  like  is  this  video 
 making  him  seem  like  a  degenerate  like
[08:42] is  it  making  him  seem  like  he's  too  much 
 into  casual  sex  i  think  it's  important 
 that  we  talk  about  that  like  let's  let's 
 be  unfiltered  for  a little  bit  because
[08:48] whilst  i  don't  want  to  offend  him  and 
 say  like  oh  yeah  maybe  he's  doing  like 
 you  know  too  much  casual  the  thing  is
[08:53] yeah  like  if  i'll  be  completely 
 truthfully  honest  like  yeah  i  do  like 
 [ __ ]
[08:58] [ __ ]  light  but  i'm  being  truthfully 
 honest  then  yes  he  is  living  like  a  bit 
 of  like  the  degenerate  casual  sex
[09:03] lifestyle  he  does  say  this  stuff  himself 
 he  made  a  video  where  he  talked  about 
 his  top  life  lessons  and  he  said  that
[09:08] hedonism  does  not  equal  happiness 
 hedonism  is  kind  of  like  the  chase  of 
 pleasure  i  personally  relate  to  that  i
[09:13] think  you  might  be  able  to  but  i  can 
 understand  and  somewhat  relate  that  it 
 would  be  very  difficult  to  abstain  from
[09:20] like  you  know  cashing  in  and  being  able 
 to  sleep  with  girls  when  like  you've 
 reached  that  point  when  a  lot  of 
 attractive  women  do  want  to  be  with  you
[09:27] it's  something  that  i  i'm  not  i  sound 
 like  a  dick  a  lot  of  girls  not  even  me 
 but  it's  something  that  i  have  struggled 
 with  and  i've  spoke  about  on  my  channel
[09:33] over  the  last  few  months  that  i've 
 struggled  with  restraining  from  casual 
 sex  because  as  my  value  goes  up  as  i'm
[09:38] getting  more  confident  and  successful 
 and  wealthy  i'm  getting  more  and  more 
 women  who  are  attracted  to  me  who  are 
 putting  in  the  work  like  they  seem  to  be
[09:44] like  chasing  me  they  watch  me  on  youtube 
 and  everything  and 
 it's  hard  to
[09:49] not 
 indulge  when  you  have  the  capability  to 
 enjoy  a  part  of  life  that  for  me
[09:55] probably  many  years  you  never  really  got 
 to  experience  and  you  know  it's  like  a 
 rare  experience  for  a  guy  to  have  i
[10:00] think  as  young  men  who  are  on 
 self-improvement  and  young  men  of  faith 
 especially  we  have  this  idea  that  the
[10:06] best  case  scenario  is  to  you  know  not  be 
 a  total  degenerate  to  not  be  like  you 
 know  into  rampant  casual  sex  scene  that
[10:11] kind  of  destroys  your  soul  but  the  truth 
 is  that  the  related  unfiltered  truth  is 
 that  the  majority  of  us  don't  really
[10:16] have  the  opportunity  to  do  that  so  it's 
 easy  for  us  to  you  know  say  like  oh  i'm 
 not  going  to  sleep  around  because  i'm
[10:21] christian  but  the  real  truth  is  would 
 women  want  to  sleep  with  you  because 
 once  you  have  that  offer  in  front  of  you
[10:27] i  think  a  man  does  change  and  i  think 
 that's  when  your  values  truly  get  tested 
 and  i'll  be  completely  totally  honest
[10:32] like 
 when  my  values  are  tested  like  that  bro 
 i  often  fail  100  it  does  sometimes  feel
[10:37] like  an  addiction  or  something  that  i 
 feel  somewhat  powerless  to  that  i've 
 expressed  that  i  don't  want  to  be  in
[10:42] like  a  casual  sex  scene  anymore  i  don't 
 want  to  hook  up  with  girls  because  it 
 just  like  it  hurts  my  soul  when  i've
[10:48] somewhat  connected  to  like  girls  that  i 
 don't  want  to  be  with  or  that  i've  just 
 got  an  intimate  with  a  girl  that  like
[10:53] whose  name  i  don't  even  know  and  yet 
 when  the  offer  is  in  front  of  me  when 
 that  girl  is  i'm  looking  up  at  me  bro
[10:58] it's  so  [ __ ]  hard  to  like  not  pursue 
 that  and  i  think  it's  especially  hard 
 when  you  have  experienced  the  yearning
[11:04] for  that  for  so  long  it's  a  very 
 interesting  point  that  being  said  i  have 
 nothing  but  respect  and  gratitude  for
[11:09] iman  he  invited  me  over  to  his  home 
 she'll  be  nothing  but  great  hospitality 
 and  i  got  to  witness  a  side  of  life  that
[11:15] i  might  not  have  experienced  for  a  while 
 the  video  where  he  talks  about  his  life 
 lessons  it's  like  50  minutes  long  i've
[11:20] linked  in  the  description  scroll  down  to 
 the  description  right  now  and  click  on 
 that  top  link  and  you  can  see  his 
 channel  also  share  this  video  to  a
[11:26] friend  who  might  be  interested  in  this 
 topic  do  the  hard  work  especially  when 
 you  don't  feel  like  it
