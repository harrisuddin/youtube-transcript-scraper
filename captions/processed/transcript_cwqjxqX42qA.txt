[00:10] jungles  grassy  plains  and  the  dark 
 depths  of  the  oceans  to  meet  and  learn 
 surprising  facts  about  the  magnificent
[00:16] animals  that  lived  here  jeffrey  has 
 struggled  with  being  masculine  for  all 
 of  his  life  he's  had  a  lack  of  drive  and
[00:22] purpose  and  mission  he  has  no  aggression 
 inside  of  him  he's  more  like  a  coward  he 
 can't  seem  to  sit  down  and  focus  on  his
[00:28] work  for  all  the  porn  that  jeffrey 
 watches  he  still  has  a  low  sex  drive  his 
 body  accumulates  fat  more  in  the  places
[00:35] that  women  would  like  his  hips  and 
 breasts  but  worst  of  all  jeffrey  does 
 nothing  to  even  try  to  improve
[00:41] adonis 
 adonis  is  a  masculine  man  full  of 
 testosterone  his  muscle  mass  is  high  his
[00:48] body  fat  percentage  is  low  his  libido  is 
 through  the  roof  this  is  a  way  that  a 
 man  should  feel  the  testosterone  courses
[00:54] through  his  veins  and  because  of  that 
 adonis  can  sit  down  and  focus  on  his 
 work 
 exactly  how  a  man  should  live
[01:04] this  may  be  the  first  time  in  history 
 that  a  lot  of  young  men  teenagers  men  in
[01:10] their  twenties  have  got  low  testosterone 
 now  fair  enough  you  know  what  i'm  just 
 going  to  be  brutally  [ __ ]  insulting
[01:16] here  the  majority  of  men  deserve  this 
 the  majority  of  men  deserve  to  have  low
[01:21] testosterone  because  they  live  like 
 idiots  they  live  like  jefferies  they  go 
 to  sleep  at  like  3  a.m  they  eat  like
[01:26] lots  of  sugar  they  just  drink  like  they 
 literally  just  sat  there  inside  of  their 
 homes  and  they  just  [ __ ]  drink 
 alcohol  if  these  guys  are  doing  that
[01:32] they  deserve  to  have  [ __ ]  up  health 
 they  deserve  to  have  [ __ ]  up  hormones 
 that's  not  me  being  like  insulting  or
[01:37] disrespectful  or  horrible  everything  is 
 cause  and  effect  and  if  you  are  doing 
 particular  actions  you  deserve  the
[01:42] particular  consequences  of  that  so 
 there's  certain  guys  like  a  big  majority 
 of  guys  who  are  living  like  idiots  who
[01:47] deserve  to  have  ill  health  symptoms  but 
 the  sad  reality  is  that  there's  a  lot  of
[01:53] guys  who  are  actually  doing  the  right 
 things  you're  on  self-improvements 
 you've  been  trying  to  improve  your  sleep
[01:58] you're  exercising  you're  lifting  heavy 
 weights  you're  not  eating  as  much  sugar 
 or  processed  foods  you  barely  even  drink
[02:03] so  why  are  your  testosterone  levels 
 lower  than  every  other  man  in  your 
 entire  bloodline  what  should  you  do
[02:09] about  it  chances  are  you're  watching 
 this  video  on  testosterone  you've 
 probably  watched  a  bunch  of  other  videos
[02:14] on  testosterone  2  and  i  remember  when  i 
 was  like  doing  some  research  you  know 
 you  get  into  those  moods  where  you're 
 somewhat  like  really  obsessed  over  a
[02:19] certain  thing  so  at  one  point  it's  sleep 
 another  point  is  like  you  know  the 
 perfect  workout  routine  and  right  now
[02:24] it's  testosterone  when  i  was  currently 
 like  obsessed  over  testosterone  i  would 
 watching  when  you  search  for  it  on 
 youtube  you  watch  all  these  videos  which
[02:30] say  like  are  the  benefits  of 
 testosterone  how  to  raise  your 
 testosterone  naturally  and  they  all  say 
 the  same  things  and  it  was  so
[02:35] anti-climatic  when  i'd  watched  this 
 video  hoping  to  get  some  new  information 
 and  it  would  literally  just  say  like  the
[02:40] ways  to  improve  your  testosterone  are  to 
 sleep  and  to  lift  heavy  weights  and  to
[02:45] have  a  clean  diet  and  not  drink  and  yeah 
 that's  about  it  and  then  they'd  give  you 
 every  now  and  then  it's  like  oh  you  can
[02:50] buy  my  ashwagandha  supplements 
 like  a  link  in  the  description  [ __ ]  go 
 [ __ ]  yourself  go  [ __ ]  yourself  like  all
[02:55] these  [ __ ]  bro  such  a  sensitive 
 topic  and  all  these  like  youtubers  were 
 trying  to  sell  me  [ __ ]  when  i  was  like  i
[03:00] was  sat  there  with  [ __ ]  titty  masks 
 bro  i'm  making  this  video  right  now  it's 
 like  gonna  teach  you  how  to  get  higher
[03:05] testosterone  my  levels  with  like  i 
 didn't  ever  get  tested  when  i  was  a 
 teenager  i  got  tested  recently  we'll 
 talk  about  that  but  when  i  was  a
[03:11] teenager  i  was  way  way  way  more  feminine 
 and  you  know  this  could  potentially  be
[03:17] incorrect  but  chances  are  that  my 
 estrogen  when  i  was  going  through 
 puberty  was  way  higher  than  it  should
[03:23] have  been  and  my  testosterone  was  way 
 lower  so  i  was  one  of  the  the  unlucky 
 few  about  40  to  50  of  men  who  developed
[03:30] literal  [ __ ]  breast  mass  through 
 puberty  so  through  puberty  essentially 
 if  you've  got  like  you  know  great
[03:35] genetics  and  everything's  going  right 
 you  should  be  pumped  full  of 
 testosterone  you  should  start  to  look 
 like  a  young  man  at  age  16  you  should
[03:40] start  getting  like  facial  hair  muscle 
 mass  deeper  voice  at  age  16  i  still  look 
 like  a  little  boy  and  suddenly  i  started
[03:46] getting  like  man  boobs  even  though  i 
 wasn't  like  fat  fat  and  the  majority  of 
 young  men  like  50  of  young  men  can
[03:52] relate  to  this  visualize  that  in  your 
 mind  right  now  visualize  boys  like 
 teenage  boys  all  around  the  world  and
[03:58] like  50  of  them 
 are  developing 
 breast  mass  like  literally  what's
[04:04] supposed  to  happen  to  women  why  are  our 
 hormone  levels  so  [ __ ]  up  i  remember
[04:09] feeling  so  [ __ ]  self-conscious  i 
 didn't  wear  normal  clothes  for  a  while 
 because  my  man  boobs  were  [ __ ]
[04:15] showing  that  was  tight  like  i  remember 
 this  one  time  i  wore  an  orange  t-shirt  i 
 was  age  17  and  one  of  my  friends  pointed
[04:20] it  out  in  front  of  everyone  oh  you  can 
 see  hums  his  nipples  through  his  shirt 
 and  it's  like  they  were  poking  out  and 
 they  were  like  sensitive  and  [ __ ]  like
[04:25] when  you're  growing  like  t  [ __ ]  hell 
 bro  how  [ __ ]  is  that  when  you  really
[04:30] think  about  it  the  time  that  we  should 
 have  been  growing  muscle  and  becoming 
 more  masculine  we  should  have  been 
 pumped  for  testosterone
[04:37] something  is  very  very  very  wrong  in 
 modern  society  and  there's  you  know
[04:42] there's  10  different  reasons  why  we 
 could  go  with  you  know  there's  oestrogen 
 in  the  plastics  of  like  the  water 
 bottles  and  this  [ __ ]  in  the  air  or
[04:48] there's  too  many  things  and  it's  very 
 stressful  to  talk  about  this  especially 
 with  those  sort  of  like  big  societal
[04:54] things  like  oh  well  there's  estrogen  in 
 the  tap  water  and  in  plastics  and  if 
 that  feels  somewhat  unavoidable  and  in
[05:00] soaps  and  you  know  shampoos  and  even  in 
 toothpaste  and  all  this  like  random  [ __ ] 
 that's  negatively  affecting  our  hormones
[05:06] it's  a  very  very  sad  reality  for  modern 
 young  men  i  remember  even  age  17  18
[05:11] being  on  youtube  like  trying  to  search 
 for  answers  and  you  know  this  is  the 
 first  time  i  was  like  really  getting 
 into  lifting  and  you  hear  that  when
[05:16] you're  lifting  weights  you  need 
 testosterone  to  build  muscle  so  you  want 
 more  testosterone  and  you're  trying  to 
 you  know  research  how  i  literally
[05:21] remember  going  through  those  videos 
 which  said  the  benefits  of  testosterone 
 or  you  know  the  symptoms  of  low
[05:26] testosterone  and  you  might  be  able  to 
 relate  to  this  when  they  would  talk 
 about  the  symptoms  of  low  testosterone  i 
 had  this  like  feeling  of  insecurity
[05:33] humiliation  embarrassment  as  you  know 
 they  list  negatives  of  low  testosterone 
 so  it  was  like  you'll  develop  breast
[05:39] mass  you'll  be  less  manly  you'll  develop 
 like  higher  body  fat  percentage  and 
 you'll  struggle  gaining  muscle  and
[05:44] you'll  have  lower  drive  and  libido  and 
 all  you  know  all  this  like  and  brain  fog 
 and  all  these  like  negative  symptoms  i 
 would  be  sat  there  whilst  they're
[05:49] listening  that  feeling  so  [ __ ] 
 humiliated  because  that  symbolized  my 
 experience  maybe  it  was  a  testosterone
[05:55] issue  maybe  not  but  like  i  can  tell  you 
 something  very  personal  when  i  started 
 having  sex  when  i  was  age  19  20  and  i
[06:00] was  like  you  know  being  a  party  [ __ ]  boy 
 and  i  was  going  out  to  like  parties  and 
 clubs  and  i  was  hooking  up  with  girls 
 for  more  than  10  girls  more  than  imagine
[06:07] that  imagine  bringing  10  different  you 
 know  over  the  course  of  months  like 
 bringing  you  know  kissing  a  girl 
 everything  bringing  her  back  to  your
[06:12] place  you've  done  like  the  hard  work 
 you're  ready  to  have  sex  with  her  and 
 you  literally  can't  even  get  [ __ ] 
 hard  you've  got  like  a  girlfriend  and
[06:17] you  literally  struggle  to  stay  hard  with 
 a  if  there's  one  thing  like  you're 
 supposed  to  do  is  obviously  like  you 
 know  there's  other  things  and  everything
[06:22] but  like  the  one  thing  that  symbolizes 
 us  come  on  truthfully  is  like  our  dick 
 it  means  a  lot  to  us  being  able  to  like
[06:29] get  hard  and  have  like  a  healthy  penis 
 and  we're  not  supposed  you  know  i'm 
 weird  as  [ __ ]  for  talking  about  this
[06:34] we're  not  supposed  to  talk  about  this  as 
 guys  are  we  we were  supposed  to  keep  it 
 quiet  and  just  [ __ ]  kill  ourselves 
 instead  there's  a  lot  of  people  watching
[06:39] this  a  lot  of  [ __ ]  jeffreys  like 
 judgmental  [ __ ]  watching  this 
 who  are  like  making  fun  of  me  and 
 laughing  at  me  right  now  oh  he  he
[06:44] couldn't  get  hard  he  had  mental  health 
 problems  yeah  and  then  when  it's  like 
 men's  mental  health  month  these
[06:49] [ __ ]  will  post  it  on  instagram 
 like  oh  make  sure  you  just  shut  the  [ __ ] 
 up  you  care  about  men's  mental  health
[06:54] we've  got  to  talk  about  these  sensitive 
 topics  because  it's  these  topics  talks 
 of  testosterone  talks  of  like  sex  which
[07:00] is  the  reason  why  men  have  mental  health 
 problems  because  we're  not  allowed  to 
 talk  about  these  things  because  we'll 
 get  judged  by  dumbasses  by  jefferies  by
[07:06] hostile  aggressive  bullies  there  are 
 certainly  psychological  problems  at  the
[07:12] time  when  you  know  i  was  having  sex  and 
 my  dick  wasn't  getting  hard  with  a  bunch 
 of  girls  certainly  you  know  i  had  levels 
 of  like  performance  anxiety  but  100
[07:19] there  was  also  testosterone  issues  at 
 the  time  and  like  elevations  of  estrogen 
 and  you  know  there's  going  to  be  some
[07:24] nerd  critiquing  me  right  now  and  saying 
 oh  well  actually  it's  it's  estradiol 
 [ __ ]  up  okay  we're  going  to  talk  in  like
[07:29] simple  understandable  ways  because  we 
 aren't  scientists  here  so  i've  went 
 about  a  journey  for  the  last  six  to  nine
[07:35] months  which  i  think  you  might  be 
 interested  in  i  got  my  testosterone 
 checked  in  2021  near  the  end  of  the  year
[07:40] in  october  and  then  also  in  november  so 
 about  a  30-day  gap  in  between  and  both
[07:46] of  the  results  were  actually  pretty  much 
 exactly  the  same  you  know  the  big  like 
 data  and  i  had  to  explain  it  and
[07:51] everything  it's  kind  of  complicated 
 because  testosterone  is  way  more 
 complicated  than  just  like  what  your 
 testosterone  number  was  so  mine  was  like
[07:56] 444  nanograms  per  deciliter  but  you  need 
 to  understand  like  a  bunch  of  other 
 nerdy  [ __ ]  but  we'll  just  go  with  the
[08:01] assumption  that  generally  whatever  your 
 total  testosterone  is  generally  will 
 show  you  like  a  good  understanding  of
[08:07] everything  else  and  of  course  like 
 you've  got  to  look  into  like  free  tests 
 and  get  all  these  complicated  [ __ ]  we're 
 just  gonna  go  with  the  total  number
[08:12] because  we  aren't  scientists  and  we  just 
 kind  of  kind  of  assume  that  it  relates 
 to  the  symptoms  that  we're  talking  about
[08:17] so  my  total  testosterone  in  october  and 
 also  in  november  was  around  440
[08:22] nanograms  per  deciliter  which  i  was  told 
 was  in  the  healthy  range  when  i  talked 
 about  that  online  people  criticized  me  i
[08:28] literally  made  a  video  saying  i  want 
 more  testosterone  people  who  were  like 
 like  more  plates  more  dates  that  big 
 youtuber  he  criticized  me  a  bunch  of  his
[08:34] fans  criticized  me  a bunch  of  people 
 called  me  crazy  for  saying  that  i  wanted 
 more  testosterone  because  i  was  in  the 
 normal  range  the  normal  range  in  the  uk
[08:40] or  in  most  countries  in  western 
 countries  is  between  250  nanograms  to 
 around  950.  if  you  are  in  the  middle  of
[08:46] this  you're  deemed  healthy  shut  the  [ __ ] 
 up  go  live  your  life  kill  yourself  you 
 don't  give  a  [ __ ]  mine  was  440.  i  was  in
[08:52] the  normal  range  but  they  don't  tell  you 
 that  the  range  is  based  up  of  like  men 
 of  all  ages  and  health  so  the  number
[08:58] that  i  got  the  testosterone  that  was 
 inside  of  my  blood  was  normal  and 
 healthy  for  probably  a  50  to  60  year  old
[09:04] but  because  of  these  like  [ __ ]  kind 
 of  sexist  like  standards  i  was  deemed 
 healthy  and  normal  and  i'm  crazy  for
[09:10] wanting  to  improve  my  testosterone 
 levels  think  about  how  [ __ ]  that  is  and 
 think  about  the  worst  part  of  this  is
[09:15] that  there's  no  solidarity  with  this 
 that  like  we  should  rise  up  together  as 
 brothers  and  say  like  yeah  that  is 
 unacceptable  that  there's  all  these  like
[09:21] soft  [ __ ]  who  are  like  nerds 
 talking  about  like  oh  no  but  but  it's  in 
 the  healthy  range  you  know  you  need  to
[09:26] like  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  i  always  consult 
 your  dog  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  my  doctor's 
 fat  okay  i  know  i  sound  like  a  crazy  guy
[09:31] right  now  because  you're  not  supposed  to 
 ever  criticize  doctors  because  they're 
 really  special  bro 
 your  doctor's  fat  and  he's  got  man  boobs
[09:37] and  he  doesn't  exercise  how  are  we 
 taking  [ __ ]  testosterone  like  advice 
 from  a  guy  who  literally  has  low  tests
[09:43] himself  i  got  this  test  440  broth  i  knew 
 that  that  was  the  number  i  really  tried 
 for  it  to  not  negatively  affect  me
[09:49] because  the  power  of  belief  in  my 
 opinion  is  very  very  important  and  you 
 don't  want  to  like 
 ingrain  something  inside  of  your
[09:55] subconscious  i  know  this  sounds  like 
 very  pseudo  science  but  i  personally  do 
 believe  it's  very  very  important  of  like
[10:00] how  you  see  yourself  is  generally  what 
 will  happen  to  even  real  things  like 
 testosterone  so  if  i  have  the  belief
[10:05] okay  i've  got  low  testosterone  you'll 
 pick  up  on  more  of  the  low  testosterone 
 symptoms  does  that  make  sense  i  know
[10:10] this  is  kind  of  a  side  tangent  but  the 
 worst  thing  that  i  could  have  done  at 
 the  time  was  like  really  say  to  myself 
 like  oh  gee  whiz  i've  got  no
[10:15] testosterone  i'm  gonna  get  all  these 
 negative  symptoms  i  fought  against  that 
 i  used  like  male  aggression  like  this
[10:20] sense  of  like  anger  against  it  to  say 
 like  no  [ __ ]  this  you  know  what  i've  got 
 high  testosterone  and  it's  cringe  as
[10:25] [ __ ]  bro  i'm  gonna  tell  you  the  truth 
 right  i'm  gonna  tell  you  something 
 that's  so  [ __ ]  cringy  so  you  know 
 that  i'm  not  lying  about  this  [ __ ]
[10:30] because  everyone's  gonna  think  i'm 
 [ __ ]  cringe  i  literally  started 
 saying  them  into  my  mind  i'm  an  alpha 
 male  i'm  a  leader  i've  got  a high  test
[10:36] i've  got  high  test  i've  got  a high  test 
 everyone's  gonna  [ __ ]  cringe  oh  he's 
 so  cringy  bro
[10:41] it  worked  i  just  got  re-tested  now  i've 
 made  changes  some  changes  but  like 
 really  what  have  i  even  changed  because
[10:47] when  i  got  the  the  original  test  i  was 
 already  living  like  a  healthy  life  that
[10:52] standard  advice  everyone  said  oh  well 
 where  are you  sleeping  eight  hours  where 
 you  lifting  yes  [ __ ]  what  the  [ __ ]  yes
[10:57] i  was  bro  i  was  on  [ __ ] 
 self-improvement  for  a  year  and  a  half  i 
 tracked  my  sleep  relentlessly  i  had  like
[11:02] a  [ __ ]  ring  on  24  7  that  would  track 
 my  sleep  and  i  fully  dedicated  myself  to 
 i  would  go  to  bed  at  9  00  pm  every
[11:07] single  night  full  on  like  military 
 routine  were  you  lifting  yes  i  was  [ __ ]
[11:12] were  you  getting  involved  i  tried 
 getting  sunlight  bro  i'm  in  the  uk  but  i 
 was  taking  vitamin  supplements  that  it's 
 one  of  the  best  things  i  mean  if  you're
[11:17] in  the  [ __ ]  uk  you  know  you  go 
 outside  in  the  sun  if  you  can  but  it's 
 not  going  to  be  enough  so  it's  taking 
 vitamin  d  supplements  things  up  you  know
[11:23] i  did  a  good  amount  of  research  for  this 
 and  my  numbers  were  low  now  i'm  supposed 
 to  be  fine  with  where  i'm  at  this  is
[11:29] where  most  people  even  people  who  were 
 just  agreeing  with  me  for  all  this  video 
 i'm  gonna  start  disagreeing  with  me  so
[11:34] my  number  now  i  got  tested  just  about  a 
 week  ago  my  number  has  increased 
 drastically  my  total  testosterone  is  up
[11:39] to  734  i  was  visualizing  724  so  that  was 
 like  what  i  was  saying  to  myself  for  the
[11:44] last  few  months  or  the  last  like  60  days 
 or  something  i  was  saying  okay  it  was 
 just  the  random  number  i  made  up  in  my 
 mind  i was  saying  i've  got  724  nanograms
[11:50] per  deciliter  of  testosterone  i  got  734. 
 that's  a  bit  weird  isn't  it  i  literally 
 like  i  don't  know  if  you  understand
[11:56] visualizations  but  i  literally  was  like 
 just  kind  of  like  saying  like  you  know 
 like  falsely  believing  to  myself  yeah 
 i've  got  724  nano  liters  per  whatever
[12:03] the  [ __ ]  the  metric  is  and  i  scored  734. 
 and  you  can  say  oh  well  yeah  coincidence
[12:09] or  oh  pseudoscience  or  something  you  can 
 say  and  yeah  okay  it  is  it  is  a 
 coincidence  it  is  pseudoscience  but
[12:15] it's  my  benefit 
 so  i  visualized  that  for  a  while  i 
 scored  734  my  free  testosterone  is  very
[12:21] high  it  was  on  the  upper  end  of  the 
 limit  it  was  it  was  above  the  upper  end 
 i  also  got  my  vitamin  d  tested  as  well
[12:27] that  was  on  like  the  healthy  range  but  a 
 bit  on  the  lower  end  it  was  like  30 
 whatever  the  the  numerical  like  a  unit
[12:33] was  it's  probably  better  if  it  was  maybe 
 double  that  734  so  that's  a  big  increase 
 that's  why  an  increase  of  about  70
[12:39] there's  a lot  of  things  that  go  into 
 testosterone  so  100  maybe  the  reason  i'm 
 in  thailand  right  now  and  the  extra  i
[12:44] mean  the  sun  is  the  vitamin  d  which  i 
 got  tested  and  that  was  on  the  lower  end 
 but  you  know  it  can  just  be  random  just
[12:49] fluctuations  but  that's  a  big  increase 
 from  444  and  i  got  tested  twice  by  the
[12:54] way  i  got  tested  twice  and  both  times  in 
 october  and  november  i  got  around  400 
 and  something  so  i  got  tested  twice  400
[12:59] was  probably  about  the  real  number  that 
 i  was  on  and  this  time  i  got  734  big
[13:04] increase  the  number  one  thing  that  i 
 changed  which  i  wanted  like  really 
 really  like  drill  into  you  because  you
[13:10] watched  the  other  videos  right  so  i 
 could  make  another  [ __ ]  normal 
 testosterone  video  like  make  sure  you're 
 lifting  heavy  weights  i  can  say  the  same
[13:16] [ __ ]  as  everyone  else  and  i'll  get  more 
 views  if  i  did  that  and  i'll  get  like 
 less  criticism  because  everyone's  like
[13:21] yep 
 it  checks  out  on  the  research  the 
 research  says  sleepy  so  yeah  100  do
[13:26] those  things  100 
 sleep  well  dedicate  more  than  eight 
 hours  to  bed  this  is  something  i  learned 
 from  the  book  why  we  sleep  by  matthew
[13:32] walker  you  have  to  allocate  more  hours 
 to  bed  than  you  actually  want  to  sleep 
 there's  a  quick  side  note  but  like
[13:37] you'll  really  benefit  this  could 
 literally  change  your  life  everyone  says 
 okay  get  seven  to  eight  hours  of  sleep 
 but  sleep  is  not  the  same  as  hours  in
[13:43] bed  everyone  allocates  like  eight  hours 
 to  bed  seven  hours  to  bed  if  you 
 actually  like  tracked  your  sleep
[13:48] meticulously  you'll  realize  that  i  was 
 in  bed  is  not  the  same  as  i  was  actually 
 asleep  because  you  actually  wake  up  for 
 like  a  large  portion  of  the  night  like
[13:54] 30  minutes  16  minutes  90  minutes 
 sometimes  so  in  general  you  need  to 
 allocate  like  literally  more  like  nine 
 to  maybe  10  hours  to  bedtime  to  actually
[14:00] get  around  eight  hours  of  actual  sleep 
 this  is  a  quick  side  note  that's 
 something  i've  learned  which  has  been
[14:05] very  helpful  so  i  don't  want  to  go  over 
 the  basic  advice  that  you've  heard  you 
 can  go  click  on  any  other  testosterone
[14:10] video  and  they'll  tell  you  you  know 
 healthy  diets  and  stuff  and  again  100 
 you  should  do  those  things  i'm  gonna  do 
 those  things  for  the  rest  of  my  life
[14:15] what  i  want  to  do  is  speak  to  you  about 
 the  power  of  belief  which  seems  really
[14:20] wishy-washy  i'm  not  like  some  [ __ ] 
 hippie  weirdo  i  don't  have  anything  to 
 sell  you  like  i  know  my  buy  my  [ __ ]
[14:25] course  or  any  i  don't  have  anything  to 
 tell  you  i'm  just  telling  you  what's 
 worked  for  me  i'm  telling  you  right  now 
 i  am  quite  like  a  logical  no  bs  kind  of
[14:31] guy  and  so  wishy-washy  advice  i've 
 always  hated  it  and  i  know  this  is  gonna 
 sound  like  very  spiritual  and
[14:36] wishy-washy  there  is  something  weirdly 
 effective  about  the  power  of  like  belief 
 like  what  you  believe
[14:43] it's  look 
 the  placebo  effect  you've  heard  that 
 before  the  placebo  effect  is  the  power
[14:49] of  belief  scientists  you  know  when 
 they're  trying  to  make  like  a  treatment 
 or  a  medication  what  they  do  is  they
[14:54] have  to  make  sure  that  their  treatment 
 that  they're  trying  to  work  on  is  more 
 effective  than  the  placebo  effect  this
[14:59] is  actually  hard  for  them  to  do  it's 
 actually  like  a  big  thing  if  a  scientist 
 comes  out  with  something  which  is  more
[15:05] effective  than  the  placebo  effect  the 
 placebo  effect  is  kind  of  like  if  you're 
 given  a  pill  that  says  okay  it  has  this
[15:10] effect  that  you  know  it'll  stop  this 
 headache  or  it'll  make  you  lose  weight 
 you  know  you're  fully  told  by  a 
 scientist  okay  this  this  pill  will  do
[15:16] this  you  believe  it  you  take  the  pill 
 and  it  has  the  effect  but  the  pill  was 
 nothing  it  was  like  literally  just  like
[15:21] an  empty  pill  it  didn't  have  medication 
 inside  of  it  what  you  believe  is 
 extremely  powerful  if  you  believe  that
[15:27] you  have  low  testosterone  and  even  if 
 that's  true  by  the  way  if  you  believe 
 that  you've  got  low  testosterone  you'll 
 pick  up  on  more  of  the  symptoms  because
[15:33] you  know  it'll  be  in  your  mind  right  so 
 i've  got  losses  and  i've  got  low 
 testosterone  every  time  i  go  to  the 
 mirror  i'll  see  like  i'll  see  like  i'm
[15:39] getting  more  fat  around  my  chest  i'll 
 see  like  i'm  gaining  fat  around  my 
 stomach  and  stuff  and  like  my  voice  is
[15:44] going  higher  pitch  you  pick  up  on  those 
 things  because  you  believe  it  but  if  you 
 just  suddenly  almost  like  a  dumbass  like
[15:49] an  idiot  convince  yourself  like  i'm 
 saying  this  in  a  good  way  like  an  idiot 
 convince  yourself  that  you've  got  high
[15:54] testosterone  and  you  research  some  of 
 the  symptoms  so  the  symptoms  is  like 
 okay  well  you  put  on  muscle  mass  easy 
 and  you're  like  yep  i've  got  high
[15:59] testosterone  i've  got  high  testosterone 
 i've  got  high  tension  you're  going 
 through  the  mirror  and  you're  like  yeah 
 see  see  i'm  putting  on  so  much  muscle
[16:04] mass  wow  like  you  you're  like  making 
 yourself  believe  it  in  a  really  silly 
 like  almost  like  normies  and  jeffries
[16:10] will  consider  this  cringe  but  you're 
 doing  this  obviously  for  your  own 
 [ __ ]  benefit  and  you'll  pick  up  more 
 on  those  like  positive  you  know  high
[16:16] testosterone  things  inside  of  you  like 
 oh  yeah  see  my  voice  is  deep  i  know  it 
 sounds  cringe  but  when  you  can  you  keep 
 this  belief  in  your  mind  i've  got  high
[16:22] testosterone  my  testosterone  is 
 increasing  it's  getting  higher  and 
 higher  because  i'm  doing  the  right 
 things  it's  like  you'll  pick  up  on  the
[16:27] symptoms  of  higher  testosterone  because 
 you  know  you're  looking  out  for  them  so 
 you  further  solidify  the  belief  and  when 
 you  further  solidify  the  belief  it  seems
[16:34] like  your  body  literally  reacts  to  it 
 i'm  gonna  really  bro  i  never  do  this  if 
 you  watched  a  bunch  of  my  videos  i  never
[16:40] ever  link  anything  else  in  the 
 description  in  terms  of  like  resources 
 and  science  and  [ __ ]  i  hate  doing  that  i
[16:45] hate  this  culture  of  like  we're  supposed 
 to  find  like  sources  for  the  [ __ ]  that 
 we  talk  about  i've  always  hated  that  i 
 just  find  it  cringe  that  all  these  nerds
[16:51] are  like  they'll  say  oh  well  you  know  at 
 15  minutes  you  said  this  sentence  can 
 you  give  me  a  source  for  that  shut  the 
 [ __ ]  up  bro  do  i  look  like  a  nerd  for
[16:56] you  but  this  one  time  i'm  gonna  link 
 something  in  the  description  i'm  gonna
[17:01] go  and  find  the  podcast  by  this  dr 
 andrew  huberman  he's  popped  off  he's  a 
 very  very  good  guy  he's  like  a  very  very
[17:07] very  high  quality  podcast  he's  like  a 
 big  like  proper  scientist  doctor  kind  of 
 guy  and  he  talks  over  like  a  bunch  of
[17:12] like  scientific  research  there  is  one 
 particular  study  that  i'm  gonna  explain 
 to  you  in  my  words  and  i'll  link  the 
 exact  part  where  he  talks  about  it  so  if
[17:18] you  want  to  listen  to  his  sort  of  like 
 proper  scientist  way  listen  to  him  if 
 you  want  to  listen  to  my  soul  bro 
 science  just  dumbed  down  explanation
[17:24] listen  to  me  the  power  of  belief  even 
 scientists  are  [ __ ]  brain  like
[17:29] there  was  a  study  that  this  scientist 
 talks  about  and  he  links  like  you  know 
 the  full  study  okay  a  person  is  given
[17:35] two  milkshakes  one  of  the  milkshakes  is 
 a  healthy  one  it's  high  protein  low  low
[17:41] carbs  low  fat  whatever  i  said  really 
 healthy  and  the  other  milkshake  is  wait 
 you  know  one  of  those  like  unhealthy
[17:46] ones  like  like  high  fat  high  sugar  you 
 know  really  really  high  calories  and 
 everything  right  they  drink  each
[17:51] milkshake  so  they  drink  one  milkshake 
 and  then  their  body  is  analyzed  you  know 
 like  those  in  your  body  like  things 
 change  depending  on  the  macros  that
[17:57] you've  ate  so  for  example  if  you  drink 
 something  with  a  lot  of  sugar  your 
 insulin  spikes  and  all  the  hormones  in 
 your  body  start  like  going  up  or  down
[18:03] and  if  you  drink  something  like  protein 
 then  like  other  things  inside  of  your 
 body  your  muscle  protein  like  all  this 
 like  [ __ ]  inside  of  your  body  changes 
 depending  on  what  you  consume  right  the
[18:09] participant  drinks  the  first  milkshake 
 the  protein  one  and  inside  of  the  body 
 the  protein  like  whatever  was  inside  of
[18:15] the  milkshake  has  the  effect  on  their 
 body  as  assumed  they  wait  a  little  bit 
 the  participant  then  drinks  the  second
[18:20] milkshake  the  high  sugar  high  fat  one 
 whatever  like  you  know  whatever  whatever 
 was  in  this  milkshake  they  do  the
[18:25] analysis  of  what's  inside  their  body  the 
 hormones  and  all  this  stuff  and  as 
 expected  their  insulin  skyrockets
[18:30] essentially  their  body  processed  more 
 calories  because  the  milkshake  was  more 
 calories  so  far  it's  common  sense  they
[18:36] had  a  healthy  shake  and  their  body 
 responded  to  it  in  a  healthy  way  the 
 body  got  essentially  healthier  they  had
[18:41] an  unhealthy  shake  their  body  got  one 
 healthier 
 it  was  the  same  milkshake
[18:46] they  were  given  the  same  milkshake  twice 
 but  their  body  literally  responded  to  it 
 in  a  different  way  they  put  on  more
[18:52] calories  and  more  fat  just  because  they 
 were  told  the  second  milkshake  was  more
[18:57] unhealthy  that  should  blow  your  [ __ ] 
 mind  because  we've  been  told  in  this 
 modern  day  we've  been  told  you  know 
 trust  the  practical  real  world  scientist
[19:04] don't  listen  to  like  you  know  this 
 wishy-washy  kind  of  pseudo  science  and 
 like  imagination  and  visualizations  that
[19:09] seems  very  silly  and  i've  always  anytime 
 someone  used  to  talk  about 
 visualizations  and  affirmations  broke  i 
 thought  they  were  [ __ ]  dumbasses  i
[19:14] thought  that's  weird  as  [ __ ]  get  away 
 from  me  with  your  [ __ ]  i  am  a  strong 
 confident  but  i  always  thought  that  was
[19:19] [ __ ]  cringe  bro  and  now  i  wake  up 
 every  single  day  i  am  a  strong  confident 
 bro  i  wake  up  every  single  day  literally
[19:24] saying  to  myself  yep  i'm  i'm  strong  and 
 i'm  confident  and  i've  got  high 
 testosterone  please  and  it  [ __ ]  works
[19:29] and  there's  another  story  that  the  same 
 the  same  scientist  andrew  huberman  i 
 think  it's  in  the  same  podcast  he
[19:34] mentions  hotel  staff  you  know  the  the 
 ladies  who  work  in  hotels  where  they'll 
 go  and  like  clean  each  room  when  you
[19:40] really  think  about  it  they  do  like  an 
 incredible  amount  of  exercise  imagine 
 like  an  eight  hour  sometimes  ten  hour 
 shift  of  going  through  hotels  changing
[19:46] the  bed  sheets  and  literally  going  from 
 room  to  room  with  like  a  massive  like 
 you  know  they've  got  those  big  trolleys 
 that  you're  like  you  can  steal  from
[19:52] every  now  and  then  they  post  these  big 
 trolleys  go  into  the  room  clean  the  room 
 mop  the  floors  or  whatever  change  the
[19:57] bed  sheet  then  they  go  to  the  next  room 
 the  next  room  the  next  room  they're 
 literally  active  like  they're  on  their 
 feet  for  literally  eight  hours  right
[20:02] every  single  day  they  split  up  into  two 
 groups  so  these  hotel  staff  these  hotel 
 like  cleaners  they  split  up  into  two
[20:08] groups  one  group  nothing  is  changed 
 they're  our  control  group  the  other 
 group  are  told  just  how  much  exercise
[20:13] they're  actually  getting  so  they're  you 
 know  they  sat  down  and  they're 
 instructed  look  you  do  15  000  steps  a
[20:18] day  and  you're  pushing  like  this  much  of 
 this  trolley  and  you  you  know  you  change 
 the  bed  like  this  we've  estimated  that
[20:23] your  total  calorie  burns  for  the  day  is 
 700.  it's  way  more  more  than  you  thought
[20:28] it  was  they're  really  told  okay  you're 
 burning  way  more  calories  than  you  think 
 you  are  and  then  very  importantly  both
[20:33] groups  were  very  controlled  for  their 
 diet  and  their  exercise  outside  of  this 
 study  what  do you  think  happened  so
[20:38] nothing  changed  literally  nothing 
 changed  out  of  these  two  groups  of  women 
 these  cleaners  apart  from  one  was  just
[20:43] told  yeah  you  burn  a lot  of  calories 
 nothing  else  was  changed  they  fully 
 fully  you  know  like  they  control 
 everything  else  and  of  course  you  know
[20:48] you  can't  control  that  one  woman  has 
 like  sex  five  times  in  one  random  day 
 and  she's  [ __ ]  burning  way  more
[20:53] calories  or  one  woman  just  ended  up  like 
 eating  less  on  a  random  day  of  course 
 you  can't  change  everything  but 
 generally  they're  told  this  this  group
[20:59] of  women  burned  way  more  fat  they  lost 
 way  more  weight  simply  by  just  being 
 told  you're  burning  a  lot  of  calories
[21:04] they  burnt  more  calories  they  lost  more 
 weight  the  other  group  of  women  the 
 other  group  of  cleaners  didn't  lose  any
[21:10] extra  weight  even  though  they  were  doing 
 the  exact  same  amount  they  didn't  lose 
 anything  extra  simply  the  power  of 
 belief  the  power  of  like  new  information
[21:16] of  being  told  yep  what  you're  doing  is 
 going  to  have  this  effect  on  you  made 
 that  effect  a  reality  scientists  are
[21:22] pretty  much  just  now  really  discovering 
 the  real  power  of  belief  i  hope  now
[21:27] after  i've  spoke  about  these  two  like 
 studies  and  i'm  sure  like  the  podcast 
 that  i'm  gonna  link  he'll  have  it  all
[21:32] like  all  the  nerdy  [ __ ]  if  you  wanna  go 
 like  yeah  check  the  sources  if  you're  a 
 [ __ ]  geek  but  hopefully  that  adds 
 some  validity  to  what  i'm  saying  here
[21:38] the  power  of  belief  is  extremely 
 important  and  once  again  in  terms  of
[21:43] improving  your  testosterone 
 do  the  right  things  don't  drink  alcohol 
 don't  eat  much  sugar  get  some  sunlight
[21:48] have  some  competition  have  sex  speak  to 
 attractive  women  lift  heavy  weights  get
[21:53] good  amount  of  sleep  okay  we  know  those 
 things  we've  always  known  those  things 
 and  no  one  goes  any  further  than  that 
 but  i  think  the  one  missing  key  for  the
[21:59] majority  of  young  men  if  you've  been 
 watching  those  videos  and  you've  always 
 felt  like  a  level  of  like 
 dissatisfaction  because  you're  like  okay
[22:04] i  do  all  them  and  but  i  still  feel  like 
 i've  got  low  testosterone  the  one  final 
 thing  is  to  start  utilizing  the  power  of 
 belief  to  literally  like  brainwash
[22:10] yourself  to  say  yup  i'm  doing  the  right 
 thing  so  i  have  high  testosterone  i  am 
 experiencing  the  symptoms  of  high
[22:15] testosterone  look  at  that  some  extra 
 muscle  that's  come  to  me  because  i've 
 got  higher  testosterone  when  you  go  to
[22:20] the  gym  this  is  kind  of  separate  but 
 when  i  go  to  the gym  me  and  my  friend 
 chris  back  home  in  warrington  we  really 
 started  doing  this  with  each  other  when
[22:25] we  were  literally  because  we  spoke  about 
 these  studies  and  the  power  of  belief 
 after  we  would  do  our  workout  we  would 
 literally  say  to  each  other  bro  you
[22:30] smash  that  bench  press  today  your  chest 
 is  going  to  get  bigger  and  he's  like 
 yeah  yeah  100  my  chest  is  going to  get 
 bigger  because  of  this  i  really  saw  you
[22:36] push  hard  on  those  tricep  extensions  you 
 went  to  failure  so  your  tricep  going 
 gonna  get  bigger  look  they're  already 
 bigger  right  now  we're  almost  like
[22:41] brainwashing  each  other  because  we 
 understand  that  this  is  how  this  [ __ ] 
 actually  works  best  case  scenario  this 
 is  gonna  get  [ __ ]  deep  inside  best
[22:47] case  scenario  we  got  hyped  like  this  by 
 our  parents  when  we  were  like  little
[22:52] babies  and  children  when  you're  a  little 
 child  it  would  have  been  so  [ __ ] 
 awesome  if  your  your  parents  when  you
[22:57] did  something  like  okay  you  just  stood 
 up  they're  like  oh  my  god  yes  you're  so 
 strong  look  how  well  you're  you're
[23:02] standing  up  and  you  like  catch  a  ball  or 
 you  know  you  like  throw  a  ball  and  it's 
 a  [ __ ]  it's  a  like  [ __ ]  throw  as  you
[23:08] know  little  child  would  but  they're  like 
 oh  my  god  yes  you're  so  good  at  throwing 
 you  would  have  become  better  why  because
[23:13] think  about  it  that's  your  caregiver 
 that's  like  okay  the  person  your  brain 
 and  your  body  is  attached  to  you're  a
[23:18] little  kid  that's  your  caregiver  that's 
 very  important  right  well  if  they're 
 like  hyping  up  after  you've  done 
 something  and  saying  like  you're  so  good
[23:23] at  this  then  you're  gonna  be  more 
 positively  encouraged  to  be  good  at  it 
 to  try  it  again  because  you  know  you've
[23:28] just  seen  your  caregivers  smiling  that 
 does  something  like  a  little  baby  like 
 evolutionarily  it  makes  them  feel  really
[23:33] safe  and  loved  but  if  you  had  more 
 critical  parents  the  kind  of  parents 
 were  when  you  threw  the  ball  we're  like 
 no  no  throw  it  further  come  on  you  can
[23:39] do  better  than  that  no  that  was  a  bad 
 throw  that's  not  how  you  spelled  that 
 word  well 
 what's  that  gonna  do  to  your  beliefs
[23:45] about  yourself  we  can  sit  here 
 and  get  very  sad  about  the  beliefs  that 
 we  have  ingrained  from  childhood  and
[23:51] from  our  experiences  in  school  i  think 
 those  things  are  very  important  but  but 
 all  we  can  do  like  the  best  thing  we  can
[23:57] do  is  think  productively  think 
 positively  and  ask  ourselves  okay  what 
 are  the  best  most  beneficial  thoughts
[24:03] beliefs  and  attitudes  for  me  to  hold 
 right  now  this  is  very  weird  specific
[24:08] practical  advice  these  are  things  like 
 these  general  beliefs  the  word  for  me 
 which  really  means  a  lot  is  force  these
[24:14] beliefs  you  have  to  force  inside  of 
 yourself  because  generally  the  automatic
[24:19] thoughts  that  our  brain  processes  about 
 ourselves  aren't  so  positive  generally 
 our  brains  are  more  critical  because  of
[24:25] things  like  you  know  bad  mental  health 
 and  social  media  and  like  you  know  if 
 you've  been  going  to  the  gym  for  a  while 
 but  there's  a  billion  guys  who  are  on
[24:30] instagram  who've  got  six  packs  and 
 they're  always  posting  like  towel 
 pictures  with  his  eyebrow  like  this 
 [ __ ]
[24:35] dumbass  hamza  in  a  stinky  bathrobe  you 
 know  there's  all  these  other  guys  and  so 
 when  you  see  yourself  in  the  mirror  like
[24:40] and  you've  been  going  to  the  gym  for  a 
 while  you  look  like  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and 
 you  know  compared  to  other  people  now  of 
 course  you've  made  fantastic  progress
[24:45] you  look  [ __ ]  phenomenal  compared  to 
 what  you  look  like  but  compared  to  some 
 big  bodybuilder  you  look  like  [ __ ]  and
[24:50] that's  the  nature  of  social  media  and  so 
 your  brain  processes  and  says  yep  i'm 
 not  muscular  at  all  in  fact  my  physique
[24:55] is  actually  trash  compared  to  all  these 
 other  guys  that  i'm  seeing  your  brains 
 automatically  visualizing  against  you
[25:01] your  brain  is  automatically  believing 
 things  that  are  bad  for  you  you  have  to
[25:06] consciously  and  almost  forcefully 
 manually 
 say  these  things  you  have  to  like 
 manually  as  if  it  sounds  like  [ __ ]
[25:12] cringe  but  go  look  at  yourself  in  the 
 mirror  and  literally  just  like  force  the 
 words  out  of  your  mouth  and  literally
[25:17] say  yes  i  have  high  testosterone  i  have 
 the  symptoms  of  high  testosterone  muscle 
 look  at  this  muscle  yeah  look  at  this 
 like  lower  body  fat  look  at  like  my
[25:23] jawline  i've  got  the  symptoms  of  high 
 testosterone  because  i  slept  really  well 
 yesterday  so  i'm  gonna  have  higher 
 testosterone  today  i  hit  like  that
[25:29] really  really  good  leg  workout  today  so 
 look  at  my  legs  my  legs  are  gonna  grow 
 today  i'm  eating  this  high  protein  meal
[25:34] right  now  chicken  and  rice  this  is  gonna 
 go  straight  to  my  [ __ ]  quads  and  i'm 
 gonna  get  bigger  and  stronger  because  of 
 this  you  process  these  thoughts  manually
[25:40] forcefully  into  your  mind  and  just  see 
 what  happens  do  this  for  the  next  couple 
 of  months  i  know  that  this  sounds  like
[25:45] wishy-washy  [ __ ]  stupid  advice  but  it 
 truly  truly  transformed  my  life  and  i 
 will  never  go  back  to  not  purposely
[25:51] forcefully  like  visualizing  for  myself  i 
 really  really  hope  it  works  for  you  to
[25:56] do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it
