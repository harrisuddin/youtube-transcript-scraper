[00:00] Jeffrey  gets  nervous  around  girls  every 
 day  he  obsesses  over  Jessica  watching
[00:05] her  in  class  dreaming  about  asking  her 
 out  and  thinking  of  her  when  he  listens 
 to  the  music  but  he's  never  even  spoke
[00:11] to  her  every  time  she  walks  near  him 
 Jeffrey  feels  a  spike  of  anxiety  his
[00:16] palms  begin  to  sweat  and  he  tries  to 
 avoid  her  or  he  overthinks  about  what  to 
 say  to  her  but  then  he  never  even  speaks
[00:22] to  her  Adonis 
 Adonis  sees  Jeffrey  struggling  and
[00:27] understands  exactly  what  he's  going 
 through  young  Adonis  also  used  to  obsess 
 over  women  and  he  was  so  nervous  and  he
[00:33] never  spoke  to  any  of  them  but  then 
 Adonis  did  something  to  destroy  his
[00:38] nervousness  and  now  he  could  not  be  more 
 confident  around  women  Adonis  puts  his 
 hands  on  Jeffrey's  shoulders  There's  A
[00:44] Better  Way  young  Jeffrey  I'll  teach  you 
 how  to  start  there's  a  quote  from  Andrew 
 Tate  that  I  really  like  so  I'm  gonna
[00:50] read  it  to  you  if  you  approach  a  girl 
 and  try  to  talk  to  her  and  you  fail 
 completely  within  30  seconds  she's  gone
[00:56] she's  forgotten  whatever  you've  been 
 through  in  your  life  has  yet  to  kill  you 
 going  over  to  that  girl  and  her
[01:01] rejecting  you  you  won't  die  come  on  now 
 little  bro  let's  go  over  10  ways  to  be
[01:06] less  nervous  around  women  number  one  and 
 probably  most  important  why  bro  every 
 time  I  do  one  of  these  clickbait  videos
[01:12] you  know  there's  seven  ways  to  get  girls 
 the  three  things  you  know  I  do  these 
 like  somewhat  clickbait  titles  and  try 
 to  still  make  them  like  really
[01:17] educational  inside  the  video  but  every 
 single  time  I  do  a  video  like  this
[01:22] number  one  the  first  point  that  I  always 
 tell  you  when  comes  to  getting  girls  is 
 to  stop  watching  more  and  even  the  soft
[01:28] core  stuff  that  you  see  on  Tick  Tock  and 
 Instagram's  literally  just  off  or  tick 
 tock's  mostly  softcore  you  can  cope  all
[01:34] you  want  and  say  like  oh  no  my  tick 
 tock's  full  of  Andrew  T  shorts  and  yeah 
 it  probably  is  and  you  know  my  Instagram
[01:39] is  full  of  just  UFC  and  you  know 
 football  stuff  yeah  it  probably  is  but 
 he's  still  probably  seeing  more  ass  on
[01:45] your  Instagram  than  your  entire 
 bloodline  has  seen  before  you  so  it's 
 still  gonna  mess  you  up  isn't  it  why  is 
 it  that  one  makes  you  nervous  around
[01:51] women  well  just  think  about  it  it's 
 messing  up  your  brain  and  it's  doing  it 
 in  such  a  malicious  way  because  when  you
[01:56] watch  porn  especially  you  know  like 
 video  content  that  you  see  on  whenever 
 something  usually  what  you're  watching
[02:01] is  another  man  piping  the  girl  that  you 
 want  and  so  you're  sat  there  like  some
[02:06] weird  man  who's  gonna  be  in  the  corner 
 watching  this  couple  have  sex  and  your 
 conditioning  and  programming  and
[02:12] training  your  brain  to  be  aroused  at  the 
 fantasy  of  other  people  having  sex  in
[02:17] front  of  you  you  train  your  brain  to 
 like  that  and  then  eventually  when  it 
 comes  to  speaking  to  girls  you  can't
[02:23] help  but  to  have  images  and  feelings  of 
 feeling  like  a  you  can't  help  but 
 think  about  the  other  guys  that  she's
[02:28] maybe  spoke  to  or  been  with  or  on  the 
 other  hand  there  are  a  lot  of  guys  it 
 makes  you  quite  weird  at  speaking  to
[02:34] girls  because  you  have  the  flashes  of 
 thousands  of  images  and  videos  of  you
[02:39] know  girls  getting  nailed  in  this  way 
 and  like  some  big  gang  bang  with  bbcs 
 and  everything  it  messes  up  your
[02:45] expectations  you're  so  conditioned  to 
 watching  these  women  who  have  had 
 surgery  and  even  this  video  editing
[02:50] going  on  and  everything  so  eventually 
 when  you  see  just  like  a  normal  woman  in 
 front  of  you  it's  disappointing  her
[02:56] titties  aren't  perfect  they're  like 
 they're  not  like  Double  D's  standard  yet 
 she's  not  making  moans  like  Madison  Ivy
[03:03] does 
 we  were  watching  a  lot  of  porn  and 
 especially  the  softcore  stuff  that  you
[03:08] see  on  social  media  it  makes  you  nervous 
 around  girls  because  I  want  you  to 
 imagine  that's  our  school  boy  he's  in 
 high  school  right  he's  like  15  years  old
[03:14] and  he  maybe  has  like  a  crush  on  the 
 girl  that  is  in  his  class  you  know  he's 
 15  it's  normal  to  be  like  you  know  a
[03:19] little  bit  of  a  Jeffrey  so  he  goes  home 
 he's  on  his  phone  and  he's  on  Tick  Tock 
 and  Snapchat  and  Instagram  and  that  girl
[03:24] that  he's  kind  of  got  a  crush  on  has 
 just  Folks  at  a  tick  tock  today  where 
 she's  doing  one  of  those  challenges  that
[03:29] are  like  child  baits  which  is  literally 
 like  you  know  it's  the  culture  of  tick 
 tock  to  promote  child  it's
[03:34] disgusting  Tick  Tock  is  weird  bro  but 
 yeah  so  he  sees  her  doing  one  of  these 
 sexual  dances  on  Tick  Tock  right  and  he
[03:39] watches  it  maybe  four  times  five  times 
 and  he  sends  the  link  to  his  friends  and 
 she's  not  even  nude  or  anything  you  know
[03:45] that'd  be  way  too  far  she's  fully 
 clothed  but  it's  like  yeah  she's  still 
 young  and  he's  seeing  this  and  seeing 
 her  in  this  sexually  provocative  way
[03:51] when  he  sees  her  next  is  he  gonna  speak 
 to  her  just  completely  normally  with
[03:56] that  image  in  his  mind  or  is  he  gonna 
 stumble  over  his  words  a  bit  more  is  he 
 going  to  be  nervous  and  a  little  bit
[04:01] weird  around  her  you  know  we're  very 
 deep  into  this  like  modern 
 hypersexualized  narrative  but  it's
[04:06] extremely  hard  to  have  normal  healthy 
 conversations  and  developments  and
[04:11] relationships  with  women  who  have  shown 
 off  their  bodies  in  a  sexual  way  online 
 it's  extremely  hard  and  it's  never  worth
[04:16] it  anyway  a  man  who  respects  himself  I 
 don't  think  would  really  go  there  so 
 she's  been  making  all  these  like  sexual
[04:21] tick  tocks  and  ass  pics  on  Instagram  and 
 everything  it  makes  you  weirdly  nervous 
 around  her  because  it  just  does
[04:27] something  to  your  brain  which  is  you 
 know  it  just  feels  weird  it's  probably 
 some  caveman  stuff  of  like  seeing  her 
 hypersexualized  online  you  know  you
[04:33] create  my  brain  thinks  yep  she's  easy 
 but  then  she  acts  like  she's  not  easy  in 
 person  so  it's  this  weird  mix  that  you
[04:38] know  it's  just  that  our  Primal  brains 
 aren't  used  to  this  it's  not  used  to 
 this  hyposexualized  nature  it's  not
[04:43] usually  you  being  able  to  log  onto  a 
 website  and  see  the  unreal  infinite 
 amount  of  variety  in  women  and  for  you
[04:49] to  trick  your  body  and  your  soul  and 
 your  brain  to  thinking  that  you're 
 ejaculating  with  one  of  these  women
[04:54] right  now  when  you're  literally  just 
 tugging  it  by  yourself  so  of  course 
 you're  gonna  feel  weird  and  nervous 
 around  girls  and  I  don't  say  this  that
[05:00] humiliate  you  or  to  make  you  feel  bad  if 
 you  do  watch  you  know  porn  still  but  you 
 can  see  from  there  are  so  many  videos
[05:05] online  so  many  guys  are  taking  a  big 
 step  back  from  porn  because  we  just  are 
 realizing  like  it's  actually  so  bad  for
[05:11] us  and  so  here's  yet  another  thing  that 
 it's  bad  for  us  with  the  second  way  to 
 be  less  nervous  around  girls  is  to  be
[05:17] around  them  more  now  I  don't  mean  you 
 have  to  go  out  there  and  you  know  date 
 more  women  or  anything  but  simply  being
[05:22] around  girls  more  whether  it's  in  class 
 or  it's  in  sports  or  events  or  cafes 
 anywhere  literally  just  having  more
[05:28] women  around  you  that  you're  casually 
 speaking  to  maybe  it's  a  female  Breezer 
 that  you're  ordering  from  maybe  there's
[05:33] a  girl  in  your  little  study  group  in 
 high  school  or  college  that  you've 
 developed  these  small  things  of  just
[05:38] having  like  a  woman  who's  somewhat 
 friends  with  you  you  know  you're  not 
 even  like  close  close  but  you  know  you 
 just  yeah  you  sit  and  you  do  work
[05:43] together  you  her  and  like  five  other 
 people  this  will  actually  let  you  subtly 
 practice  some  small  things  because  you
[05:48] know  it  just  seems  so  weird  sometimes  to 
 speak  to  girls  and  so  this  can  normalize 
 it  because  for  me  personally  when  I  was
[05:53] younger  and  I  was  in  high  school  my  mom 
 had  this  level  of  control  over  me  where 
 she  didn't  want  me  to  like  you  know  be
[05:59] around  girls  or  to  speak  to  them  in  any 
 way  because  she  thought  they  were  a 
 distraction  and  she  was  100  right  but 
 obviously  I'm  still  distracted
[06:05] and  I  was  desperate  and  my  brother  had 
 the  same  kind  of  influence  on  me  as  well 
 of  you  know  this  kind  of  thing  no  no  we
[06:10] don't  speak  to  girls  you  know  they're 
 just  weird  whatever  the  distraction  and 
 so  what  happened  was  that  I  was  quite
[06:15] awkward  and  nervous  around  girls  for  a 
 very  long  time  I  can  tell  you  that  you 
 know  I  went  to  some  like  parties  when  I
[06:20] was  15  or  16  and  there's  girls  there  and 
 I  was  just  weird  around  them  not  you 
 know  I  wasn't  saying  anything  weird  I
[06:25] wasn't  being  like  creepy  or  anything  but 
 I  just  you  know  I  didn't  know  what  to  do 
 because  it  imagined  that  one  of  the 
 first  times  that  like  a  girl's  next  to
[06:31] you  outside  of  school  and  you  just  kind 
 of  freeze  up  when  she's  talking  to  you 
 and  you  know  you're  like  you  can't  even 
 hold  eye  contact  we  sat  on  the  couch  in
[06:37] a  party  or  something  you  know  like  some 
 young  party  you  go  to  at  16  years  old 
 it's  your  friend's  birthday  party  or 
 something  and  I'm  like  barely  even
[06:42] holding  her  eye  contact  looking  straight 
 forward  and  like  you  know  laughing  at 
 jokes  that  aren't  even  funny  or  anything
[06:47] when  I  compare  that  one  random  party  it 
 was  like  one  of  my  friend's  16th 
 birthday  party  so  how  I  am  around  women
[06:52] now  and  I'm  not  no  Pro  or  anything  like 
 that  but  there's  been  a  big  amount  of 
 progress  to  like  how  comfortable  and
[06:58] confident  I  am  around  the  opposite  sex 
 because  I  have  now  actually  had  a  good 
 level  of  like  practice  of  not  even  just
[07:04] dating  but  you  know  just  literally  just 
 having  women  around  me  and  I  think 
 University  really  did  that  for  me
[07:09] because  I  lived  in  like  a  student 
 accommodation  building  so  there  was  a 
 bunch  of  guys  a  bunch  of  girls  that  I 
 knew  you  go  to  the  gym  there's  girls
[07:14] there  that  have  spoke  to  people  come  to 
 my  place  for  like  a  party  or  you  know  to 
 drink  or  whatever  so  I  was  starting  to
[07:19] surround  myself  around  women  and 
 suddenly  being  one-on-one  even  getting 
 more  intimate  it  didn't  feel  anywhere
[07:25] near  as  nerve-wracking  as  it  used  to 
 just  like  a  year  or  two  before  I  went  to 
 UNI  the  third  tip  I  can  give  you  means  a
[07:31] lot  to  me  but  most  people  will  think 
 that  this  is  a  terrible  tip  and  maybe 
 they're  right  maybe  I'm  wrong  but  this
[07:36] genuinely  helped  me  to  destroy 
 nervousness  and  this  was  the  start  to 
 find  guys  whether  in  real  life  or  online
[07:42] who  are  good  with  girls  who  you  can 
 literally  see  how  they  are  with  girls 
 there's  a  video  of  like  a  guy  who's
[07:47] flirting  with  a  girl  or  you're  like  a 
 male  friend  who  you  see  who  speaks  the 
 girls  find  the  guy  who's  actually  good
[07:53] around  girls  who  doesn't  seem  nervous 
 who  actually  seems  to  attract  them  and 
 then  this  is  what  gets  me  hated  all  the
[07:58] time  when  I  say  this  copy  them  I  promise 
 you  right  now  that  this  is  the  truth  I 
 would  not  be  the  man  that  I  am  today  I
[08:03] would  not  act  in  the  way  that  I  do 
 especially  around  women  if  it  wasn't  for 
 this  one  YouTuber  named  Joe  Delaney  he's
[08:09] a  fitness  YouTuber  and  he  seems  to  have 
 a  very  good  mature  relationship  right 
 now  but  rewind  a  bunch  of  years  and  he
[08:14] was  more  like  in  this  sort  of  party 
 aesthetic  lifestyle  and  you  know  when  I 
 was  like  18  years  old  that's  what  I  was
[08:19] looking  up  to  was  like  guys  who  were 
 like  quite  fit  and  muscular  and  who  were 
 going  out  and  being  like  confident
[08:24] around  girls  and  partying  and  so 
 watching  this  guy's  older  videos  I  think 
 they're  like  five  years  old  now  where
[08:29] he's  like  vlogging  and  showing 
 highlights  of  like  parties  and 
 everything  and  he  just  seems  so 
 confident  and  comfortable  around  women
[08:34] watching  that  and  I  promise  that  this  is 
 the  truth  because  it  sounds  kind  of  lame 
 I'd  literally  just  watch  this  guy  you
[08:39] know  his  videos  where  he's  with  some 
 girl  or  something  and  I'd  copy  the  way 
 that  he  spoke  and  his  mannerisms  and  you
[08:44] know  imitate  it  in  my  own  kind  of 
 personality  so  I  was  copying  his  style 
 with  my  interpretation  of  it  which  at
[08:51] that  point  you  know  becomes  like  almost 
 like  a  unique  version  you  know  I  mean 
 it's  technically  copying  but  then  the 
 way  that  you  copy  isn't  always  100  exact
[08:57] because  you've  got  your  own  bite  you 
 know  I  mean  so  essentially  I  copied  but 
 it's  not  100  copy  because  I'm  still  a
[09:02] hero  person  and  stuff  right  I  think  a 
 lot  of  people  find  this  like  incredibly 
 lame  or  something  so  you  don't  have  to 
 follow  this  advice  but  personally  for  me
[09:07] this  changed  my  life  forever  honestly  I 
 just  found  this  one  random  YouTuber 
 who's  really  really  good  YouTuber  it's
[09:12] just  the  way  that  he  talks  and  he's  so 
 casual  and  confident  and  he's  still  got 
 like  this  boyish  personality  which
[09:17] resonates  with  me  because  I've  kind  of 
 got  that  as  well  maybe  I've  got  it  just 
 because  I  was  watching  his  videos  but 
 either  way  I  just  saw  how  he  navigated
[09:23] the  state  that  he  went  on  on  like  a 
 picnic  date  with  some  girl  from  Tinder 
 and  I  kind  of  like  integrated  that
[09:28] myself  and  this  was  one  of  the  fastest 
 improvements  that  I've  had  with  women  or 
 even  just  life  in  general  just  because
[09:33] it  was  just  so  easy  for  me  to  just 
 pretend  to  be  a  little  bit  more  like  him 
 and  it  sounds  so  weird  to  say  this
[09:38] because  in  this  modern  day  like  we 
 extremely  value  individuality  and  we 
 think  copying  is  a  really  really  bad
[09:44] thing  and  again  you  know  if  you  copy 
 someone  of  course  you're  not  going  to 
 copy  them  100  it's  pretty  much
[09:49] impossible  to  do  that  so  it  has  your  own 
 twist  to  it  anyway  so  at  that  point  it's 
 like  you  become  a  hybrid  not  a  copy  of
[09:54] the  you  don't  mean  so  I  can  cope  and 
 tell  you  yeah  it's  not  copying  whatever 
 you  want  to  say  it  is  just  what  I  would 
 say  if  you  are  open  to  this  go  and  find
[10:00] someone  either  in  person  or  online  some 
 guy  who  is  like  a  role  model  to  you  that
[10:05] you  know  is  pretty  good  with  girls  and 
 search  specifically  for  if  it's  online 
 like  you  know  video  where  your  role
[10:10] model  is  with  a  woman  and  to  see  how 
 they  navigate  their  relationship  and  the
[10:15] small  mannerisms  and  the  way  they  talk 
 and  how  they  present  themselves  and  how 
 they  flirt  with  the  girl  YouTube  is
[10:20] amazing  for  this  because  if  you've  got 
 like  a  role  model  who's  some  kind  of 
 YouTuber  or  you  know  he's  got  a  YouTube
[10:25] channel  Jordan  Peterson  Jocko  willink 
 David  Goggins  you  know  all  these  guys  it 
 could  even  be  me  you  can  probably  go  and
[10:30] find  a  video  of  these  guys  who  are  your 
 role  models  online  where  they're  with
[10:35] their  girlfriends  or  wives  and  you  can 
 just  see  how  the  dynamic  is  with  them 
 and  if  you  really  like  that  then  you  can
[10:40] copy  that  the  fourth  way  to  stop  being 
 nervous  around  women  is  to  actually 
 devalue  women  and  especially  sex  and  to
[10:47] lower  them  off  the  pedestal  that  you've 
 put  them  on  and  honestly  it  might  not 
 even  be  you  who's  put  them  on  a  pedestal
[10:53] we  live  in  a  very 
 hyper-sexualized  era  right  now  where 
 women  are  promoted  to  take  off  as  many
[10:58] clothes  as  possible  for  the  cope  that 
 this  is  empowerments  but  they  are  more
[11:03] valuable  when  they're  naked  which  is 
 kind  of  like  what  the  patriarchy  was 
 saying  you  know  feminism  stupid  as
[11:08] feminists  aren't  very  clever  are 
 they  because  they  think  that  women 
 taking  their  clothes  off  his  empowerment 
 when  it's  actually  more  empowering  if
[11:14] it's  the  opposite  way  of  feminists  on 
 Smart  we  know  that  right  but  we  live  in 
 a  very  weird  place  where  sex  is  seen  as
[11:21] like  so  so  important  the  thing  is  yeah 
 for  a  good  relationship  it  is  incredibly 
 important  but  with  the  amount  of  Social
[11:27] and  cultural  and  even  government 
 pressure  that  you're  going  through  it's 
 gonna  be  so  much  higher  in  your  like
[11:32] list  of  things  to  care  about  for  most 
 guys  which  means  that  it's  on  a  pedestal 
 right  now  especially  if  you've  grown  up
[11:38] watching  porn  and  you  know  looking  at 
 girls  on  Instagram  and  everything 
 especially  Tech  talk  as  well  it  makes 
 you  worship  not  just  women  but  just  sex
[11:45] and  pleasure  and  Hedonism  because  is  it 
 not  worship  if  every  day  you  give  it 
 your  complete  devotion  your  complete
[11:51] attention  every  day  staring  into  the 
 phone  of  this  girl  that  you  follow  on 
 Tick  Tock  or  Instagram  of  this  porn  star
[11:57] that  you  really  really  like  is  that  not 
 worship  are  you  not  worshiping  an 
 underage  girl  if  you  check  her  Tick  Tock
[12:03] five  times  a  day  that  that's  what  we  do 
 instead  of  praying  these  days  and  so  we 
 have  women  and  especially  casual  sex  and
[12:09] Hedonism  on  a  pedestal  we're  told  that 
 that's  the  most  important  thing  ever  I 
 think  love  is  extremely  important  I
[12:14] think  good  solid  secure  healthy 
 relationships  extremely  important  maybe 
 the  most  important  thing  in  your  life  is
[12:20] your  relationships  honestly  the  people 
 you  have  in  your  life  your  friends 
 family  and  also  romantic  Partners 
 probably  the  most  important  and  valuable
[12:25] thing  that  you  have  in  your  life  but  we 
 don't  think  about  our  family  24  7  do  we 
 especially  if  you're  a  young  man  you
[12:31] wake  up  thinking  about  ass  don't  you  and 
 so  how  do  you  get  this  off  the  pedestal 
 how  do  you  stop  overvaluing  things  like
[12:36] casual  sex  so  that  you're  less  nervous 
 around  women  well  the  fifth  thing  that 
 we  can  talk  about  is  to  have  a  mission
[12:41] and  purpose  that  take  the  priority  to 
 set  up  your  life  as  a  man  is  very  very
[12:46] simple  but  you've  never  been  really  told 
 this  before  select  one  or  two  extremely
[12:51] ambitious  goals  and  then  sacrifice  most 
 of  your  life  for  them  it's  as  simple  as 
 that  it's  not  easy  if  it  was  easy  you
[12:56] know  every  guy  would  be  extremely 
 wealthy  or  the  best  father  possible  or 
 have  such  a  successful  business  or
[13:02] career  or  whatever  it's  not  easy  but  it 
 is  very  simple  have  a  very  very 
 important  mission  that  you  wake  up  and
[13:08] you  think  about  that  you  go  through  the 
 day  and  you're  thinking  about  it  that 
 you're  literally  sat  on  the  toilet  and
[13:13] you're  thinking  about  it  that  you're  in 
 the  shower  thinking  about  it  that  you're 
 getting  ready  to  go  to  bed  and  you're 
 still  preparing  for  tomorrow  because  of
[13:19] this  mission  that  you  want  to  conquer 
 most  guys  don't  have  this  and  it's  such 
 a  shame  because  most  guys  won't  just 
 spend  the  hours  that  it  takes  to  sit
[13:25] there  in  total  solitude  no  distractions 
 with  no  phone  no  computer  nothing  and  to 
 try  and  think  okay  what  could  be  a
[13:32] worthwhile  mission  for  me  for  the  next 
 few  years  of  my  life  for  the  next  10 
 maybe  for  the  rest  of  my  life  what  could
[13:37] be  a  worthwhile  Mission  an  incredible 
 goal  to  accomplish  to  sacrifice  for  most
[13:42] guys  don't  ask  themselves  these 
 questions  because  of  maybe  because  of 
 Point  number  one  they're  just  watching
[13:47] porn  all  the  time  but  if  you  can  do  this 
 maybe  right  now  maybe  you've  already 
 done  it  before  maybe  you  will  do  this 
 and  to  try  and  figure  out  okay  what  is
[13:53] this  huge  important  mission  that  will 
 reward  you  incredibly  and  yet  you're  not
[13:58] even  doing  it  for  the  reward  you're 
 doing  it  for  the  act  of  doing  it  you 
 need  a  mission  an  ambitious  goal  which
[14:04] is  like  that  and  when  you  found  that 
 when  you  found  this  goal  that's  so 
 important  to  you  it  becomes  so  easy  to
[14:09] feel  less  nervous  around  women  because 
 you  have  something  more  important  to 
 care  about  and  again  I  just  want  to 
 clarify  something  there's  a  lot  of
[14:14] YouTubers  and  social  media  guys  out 
 there  who  seem  so  cool  and  they  tell  you 
 like  yeah  I  don't  care  about  getting
[14:19] girls  and  everything  yeah  this  is  not 
 what  I'm  saying  it  would  be  such  a  shame 
 for  you  to  close  your  heart  and  to  think
[14:24] yeah  you  know  women  aren't  important  sex 
 is  an  important  I  don't  care  about  any 
 of  this  stuff  trust  me  when  I  say  that 
 women  are  incredibly  important  trust  me
[14:31] when  I  say  that  you  should  care  deeply 
 about  your  relationships  of  course  you 
 should  the  love  should  be  an  incredibly
[14:37] important  and  value  thing  in  your  life 
 it's  one  of  the  greatest  experiences 
 that  you  can  have  as  a  man  of  you  know
[14:43] conquering  a  goal  and  stuff  is  amazing 
 it's  probably  way  better  than  love  but 
 don't  be  like  one  of  these  Sigma  male
[14:48] guys  who  say  yeah  like  you  know  they 
 value  women  too  little  in  my  opinion  but 
 then  obviously  that's  my  bias  and  they
[14:53] can  do  what  they  want  fine  but  I  don't 
 think  that's  the  right  way  to  navigate 
 the  world  just  quickly  if  I  was  gonna 
 give  you  my  current  understanding  and
[14:59] sort  of  Life  plan  for  women  as  of  Monday 
 the  23rd  of  January  2023  is  to  live  with
[15:06] an  open  and  full  heart  I  don't  want  it 
 to  sound  wishy-washy  what  I'm  saying  but
[15:11] I  did  have  a  realization  recently 
 because  it  can  be  valuable  to  close  your 
 heart  to  not  think  about  women  at  all
[15:16] and  to  go  monk  mode  and  that's  what  you 
 know  a  lot  of  people  are  really  like 
 crazy  about  these  days  on  YouTube  it's 
 like  yeah  monk  mode  yeah  let's  do  it
[15:22] guys  and  that  can  be  awesome  sometimes 
 you  need  to  do  that  sometimes  you  can't 
 have  the  destruction  of  women  around  you 
 sometimes  you're  not  the  level  that  you
[15:28] want  to  be  to  attract  the  women  that  you 
 want  and  maybe  you're  getting  some  women 
 right  now  but  they're  not  of  the  quality 
 that  you  want  because  you  need  to  up
[15:33] yourself  first  so  at  that  point  you 
 could  take  a  big  step  back  from  women 
 but  in  my  opinion  you  should  always  have
[15:38] it  in  your  mind  that  the  best  case 
 scenario  is  that  you  get  to  develop 
 yourself  and  to  keep  conquering  this
[15:43] Mission  this  goal  that  you  set  for 
 yourself  whilst  having  the  love  and  the 
 flow  of  feminine  energy  in  your  life
[15:48] because  that's  the  best  case  scenario  in 
 my  opinion  it's  not  to  close  away  from 
 women  with  the  hassle  that  they  cause  or
[15:53] anything  like  this  it's  to  be  such  a 
 superior  man  so  that  you  can  take  her
[15:58] chaotic  moods  so  that  you  don't  get 
 distracted  by  her  because  there's  men 
 out  there  who  have  women  in  their  lives
[16:03] and  they're  not  even  distracted  by  those 
 women  these  kinds  of  men  these  Superior 
 men  have  learned  how  to  I  won't  even  say
[16:10] handle  or  manage  they've  learned  how  to 
 conquer  women  they've  learned  how  to 
 dominate  in  the  correct  way  and  that's
[16:16] an  absolutely  beautiful  experience  and 
 so  that's  my  current  view  of 
 relationships  and  love  is  I  want  that  in
[16:22] my  life  it  might  be  rare  for  you  to  see 
 like  a  man  who's  actually  broadcasting 
 this  to  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people
[16:27] telling  yeah  like  Love's  important  yeah 
 women  are  important  the  sigma  male  stuff 
 has  got  to  end  soon  of  so  many  guys
[16:32] saying  like  oh  yeah  I  don't  care  about 
 getting  I  don't  care  about  girls  bro 
 yeah  they're  just  girls  bro  like  yeah  I
[16:37] don't  think  you  should  obsessle 
 especially  over  things  like  casual  sex 
 and  porn  and  everything  fine  but  to  get
[16:42] into  an  amazing  relationship  should  be 
 one  of  your  life  goals  in  my  opinion  to 
 find  an  incredible  woman  that  you  want
[16:47] to  have  children  with  I  think  that's  an 
 amazing  goal  to  set  the  sixth  way  we  can 
 make  sure  that  you  don't  get  nervous
[16:52] around  girls  is  actually  to  think  about 
 the  other  things  that  you're  nervous 
 around  this  is  interesting  right  because
[16:57] for  a  lot  of  guys  they're  nervous  around 
 girls  but  also  they're  quite  nervous  not
[17:02] just  around  the  women  but  around  the 
 Social  Circle  as  well  you  see  a  lot  of 
 guys  aren't  just  nervous  about  you  know
[17:08] going  to  speak  to  that  girl  over  there 
 in  the  coffee  shop  they're  also  nervous 
 around  everyone  else  in  the  coffee  shop
[17:14] looking  at  him  and  seeing  him  get 
 rejected  for  example  a  lot  of  guys  have 
 social  anxiety  or  social  nervousness  and
[17:19] then  of  course  that's  like  compounded 
 when  they're  around  a  woman  as  well  so  I 
 have  a  video  on  my  channel  which  is
[17:24] about  social  anxiety  and  that  might  help 
 you  number  seven  is  one  that  I  really 
 like  and  it's  so  quick  mentally  reframe
[17:30] the  nervousness  for  excitements  when  you 
 feel  a  little  bit  nervous  it  doesn't
[17:35] really  help  you  to  think  oh  yeah  I'm 
 nervous  because  it  just  makes  you  you 
 know  feel  more  nervous  more  nervous 
 right  what  I  found  which  is  so  nice  and
[17:41] I  got  this  from  like  some  Instagram  post 
 or  something  right  it  was  like  you  know 
 like  one  of  those  cringe  like  Instagram 
 mottos  kind  of  things  and  actually  like
[17:47] those  models  honestly  hit  because  this 
 one's  so  true  it  said  when  you  feel 
 nervous  just  mentally  reframe  it  to
[17:53] excitement  because  nervousness  and 
 excitement  actually  just  feel  the  same 
 in  your  body  they're  the  same  thing  your
[17:58] heartbeat  goes  faster  your  pupils  dilate 
 you  know  the  physiological  stuff  is  the
[18:03] same  for  nervousness  and  excitement  the 
 only  thing  that's  different  between 
 these  two  is  how  you  perceive  them  so
[18:09] the  next  time  you  feel  nervous  around 
 women  just  tell  yourself  I  feel  excited 
 because  it  is  probably  true  if  you're
[18:14] nervous  around  this  girl  you're  probably 
 also  quite  excited  to  be  around  her  and 
 just  you  know  go  on  this  date  with  her
[18:19] for  example  bro  this  this  I  have  to  give 
 this  disclaimer  all  the  time  and  there's 
 like  this  culture  online  yeah  like  oh  I
[18:25] don't  care  about  girls  and  stuff  but 
 it's  like  it's  cute  to  be  excited  for  a 
 date  that  doesn't  make  you  a  simp  you
[18:30] could  broke  you  should  be  excited  for 
 every  time  you  every  date  that  you  go  on 
 every  time  you  see  your  woman  you  should
[18:35] feel  excited  you  know  all  these  guys  who 
 pretend  like  they're  too  cool  Sigma  mail 
 and  stuff  there's  gonna  be  guys  watching
[18:40] this  right  now  thinking  oh  yeah  I'm  just 
 gonna  create  object  cares  too  much  about 
 girls  it's  like  it's  so  weird  bro  these
[18:45] days  it's  lame  to  say  that  you're 
 excited  to  go  see  a  girl  think  about 
 that  it's  lame  to  say  that  you're  going
[18:51] on  an  audition  for  you  know  a  double 
 interview  for  love  love  is  lame  in  2023
[18:57] and  I  don't  know  about  you  but  I  don't 
 want  to  live  like  that  I  want  to  live  in 
 a  way  that  I  can  have  a  relationship  and
[19:02] feel  genuinely  excited  every  time  I'm  to 
 spend  time  with  her  no  matter  what  the 
 little  Jeffries  of  the  world  want  to
[19:08] call  me  they  want  to  call  me  a  simp  or 
 something  because  he  oh  yeah  he's 
 excited  for  a  date  that  means  he's  a 
 simp  it's  like  okay  then  if  that's  your
[19:14] definition  of  a  symptom  but  I'm  clearly 
 not  simp  anyone's  saying  this  is  like 
 just  a  total  Jeffrey  who's  like  doesn't
[19:20] understand  oh  whatever  I'm  not  gonna 
  write  about  these  guys  but  yeah 
 reframe  it  to  excitement  just  before  you
[19:25] get  ready  for  a  date  and  you  start  to 
 feel  your  heart  go  a  little  bit  faster 
 just  say  I'm  excited  not  nervous  I'm 
 excited  sometimes  the  girl  will  know  us
[19:31] let's  say  you  actually  go  on  the  days 
 and  you're  actually  really  really 
 nervous  she  might  even  see  in  you  and 
 she  might  even  say  like  oh  you  nervous
[19:36] and  you  may  as  well  just  say  no  no  not 
 nervous  I  was  pretty  excited  for  this 
 date  you  seemed  kind  of  cool  and  see  how
[19:42] you've  just  reframed  it  because  if  she 
 asks  you  are  you  nervous  and  you  said 
 yes  the  thing  is  you  could  tell  her  the
[19:47] truth  but  it's  a  bit  uncool  to  be 
 nervous  but  it's  way  more  of  a 
 connecting  moment  when  you  tell  her  you
[19:52] were  excited  for  the  dates  because  you 
 were  impressed  by  the  way  that  you  guys 
 spoke  online  or  something  just  keep  that
[19:57] one  in  mind  that's  such  a  quick  tip  you 
 can  use  anytime  you  feel  nervous  just 
 tell  yourself  yep  it's  excitement  sorry
[20:02] bro  I  had  to  run  off  to  Jitsu  we  still 
 have  three  more  points  to  go  so  the 
 eighth  points  I  want  to  walk  you  through
[20:08] in  terms  of  feeling  nervous  around  girls 
 is  to  actually  feel  grateful  and  happy
[20:13] that  you  have  this  feeling  because  it 
 might  go  away  and  you  might  think  wait 
 yeah  I  want  my  nerves  to  go  away  but
[20:18] trust  me  when  I  say  like  having  this 
 huge  level  of  excitement  and  nerves  and 
 butterflies  especially  when  you're  quite
[20:24] young  or  quite  inexperienced  it's  a  very 
 beautiful  experience  once  you're  looking 
 back  but  there  probably  will  be  a  point
[20:30] where  you  feel  totally  comfortable  and 
 confident  around  your  woman  and  that's 
 awesome  you  know  that  means  you're  a
[20:35] masculine  stoic  man  nice  but  sometimes 
 you  will  reminisce  of  the  days  where  she 
 made  your  heart  jump  and  extra  beats  you
[20:42] will  think  back  to  those  moments  when 
 you  had  that  intense  High  School  Crush 
 but  you  were  too  nervous  to  say  hi  to
[20:48] her  in  the  end  you'll  realize  that  those 
 moments  of  you  being  so  nervous  around 
 girls  were  actually  such  a  beautiful
[20:53] developmental  period  And  I  know  right 
 now  you're  trying  to  escape  it  I  know 
 right  now  you're  trying  to  run  away  from
[20:58] it  but  what  I'm  just  saying  is  you're 
 experiencing  it  anyway  why  not  reframe 
 it  again  just  like  we  reframed  it  in  the
[21:03] previous  points  where  we  reframed 
 nervousness  to  excitement  also  if  you 
 know  your  surgery  it's  not  excitement
[21:08] bro  it's  not  excitement  I'm  really 
 nervous  right  even  if  you  are  nervous 
 why  not  just  try  and  feel  grateful  for
[21:13] it  and  I  know  this  sounds  silly  and 
 you'll  want  to  skip  on  to  the  next  point 
 but  I  just  try  this  one  thing  for  10 
 seconds  just  ask  yourself  how  could  I  be
[21:19] grateful  for  these  nerves  how  could  I  be 
 grateful  that  I'm  nervous  around  girls 
 because  it's  not  a  good  thing  I'll  tell
[21:24] you  right  now  it's  not  really  a  good 
 thing  but  if  you  ask  this  question 
 honestly  about  any  part  of  life  how  can
[21:30] I  be  grateful  for  this  it's  one  of  the 
 most  powerful  questions  that  you  know
[21:35] I've  made  hundreds  of  videos  I've 
 broadcasted  to  the  internet  to  the  world 
 to  you  as  many  life  lessons  of  mine  and
[21:41] you  know  I'm  a  young  guy  I  don't  have 
 that  many  but  like  you  know  I've  tried 
 to  help  you  in  all  the  random  ideas  I 
 get  and  this  could  be  one  of  the  most
[21:47] powerful  life-changing  things  I  could 
 ever  recommend  to  you  ask  yourself  that 
 question  as  many  times  as  possible
[21:53] especially  during  bad  things  not  just 
 you  know  what  we're  talking  about  here 
 because  this  can  go  so  much  deeper  how
[21:58] could  I  be  grateful  for  this  what  is 
 there  to  be  grateful  about  in  this 
 situation  I  know  it's  a  little  bit  topic
[22:04] but  when  I  asked  myself  this  question 
 when  I  had  just  spent  a  year  living  like
[22:09] a  total  degenerate  I  just  spent  a  year 
 with  absolutely  zero  communication  to  my
[22:15] family  I  literally  bro  I  had  my  family 
 my  entire  family  blocked  all  their 
 numbers  Facebook  Instagram  WhatsApp
[22:20] everything  blocked  I  lived  like  I  didn't 
 have  a  family  for  an  entire  year  when  I 
 was  around  22  years  old  I  hope  you  can
[22:26] take  this  seriously  I  genuinely  lived  as 
 if  I  didn't  have  a  family  for  about  a 
 year  I  do  have  a  family  of  mother  father
[22:32] brother  sister  everything  but  like  you 
 know  we  had  a  massive  fight  and 
 everything  and  it  was  all  trauma  and 
 abuse  and  everything  so  I  essentially
[22:38] like  ran  away  from  home  even  though  I 
 was  22  or  something  so  I  was  old  enough 
 I  hated  my  father  I  hated  my  brother  I
[22:43] hated  the  house  that  we  lived  in  I  hated 
 the  relationship  the  family  that  we  have 
 you  know  I  started  living  like  a  man  who
[22:49] doesn't  have  a  family  would  live  porn 
 video  games  weed  every  single  day  on
[22:54] average  I  was  flapping  like  three  times 
 a  day  at  least  that's  already  bad  enough 
 isn't  it  three  times  a  day  fapping  bro  I
[22:59] had  a  girlfriend  and  I  lived  with  her 
 the  levels  to  which  I  have  been  down  bad 
 of  very  very  high  bro  I've  been  very
[23:06] down  bad  before  the  reason  why  I'm 
 telling  you  all  this  you  know  it's  so 
 weird  this  video  is  about  nervousness 
 with  girls  and  this  isn't  about  the  girl
[23:11] that  you  know  my  girlfriend  who  I  lived 
 with  we're  not  together  now  but  the 
 reason  why  I'm  telling  you  this  right 
 now  because  after  the  worst  year  of  my
[23:17] entire  life  I  discovered  gratitude 
 training  and  I  asked  myself  the  question
[23:22] how  could  I  be  grateful  for  my  family 
 specifically  I  asked  how  could  I  be 
 grateful  for  my  father  no  he's  ruined  my
[23:28] life  there's  nothing  to  be  grateful  for 
 no  I  I  hate  him  he's  abused  me  he 
 traumatized  me  still  to  this  day  I  can't
[23:33] sleep  right  still  to  this  day  I  have 
 nightmares  three  times  a  week  there's 
 nothing  to  be  grateful  about  him  you
[23:38] know  I'm  getting  angry  asking  myself 
 this  question  maybe  you  are  remember  I 
 just  asked  you  how  could  you  be  grateful
[23:43] for  being  nervous  around  girls  the  first 
 answer  is  like  no  no  I  can't  be  grateful 
 for  this  it's  a  bad  thing  it's  a 
 horrible  thing  and  you  know  I  was
[23:48] indulging  in  this  feeling  for  a  while 
 when  I  was  thinking  about  my  father  how 
 could  it  be  grateful  friend  and  the 
 first  little  thing  comes  up  he  brought
[23:54] us  to  the  UK  I  was  born  in  Pakistan  and 
 I  would  have  had  like  the  life  of  a 
 Pakistani  essentially  in  Pakistan  right
[23:59] which  you  take  that  as  it  is  but  it 
 generally  means  like  somewhat  of  a  worse 
 upbringing  in  terms  of  of  education  and
[24:05] wealth  and  finances  opportunity  compared 
 to  the  UK  okay  he  brought  me  to  the  UK 
 but  I  oh  whatever  I  don't  even  like  the
[24:11] UK  that  much  the  weather's  not  even  that 
 nice  anything  he  provided  for  a  family 
 of  five  as  a  sole  earner  because  my  mom
[24:17] is  a  housewife  it's  a  traditional 
 relationship  she's  the  housewife  he  goes 
 out  and  works  solo  wanna  work  in  two
[24:22] jobs  for  10  20  years  and  not  very 
 desirable  jobs  jobs  that  he's  admitted 
 he  doesn't  even  like  he  literally  does
[24:27] not  like  them  you  know  one  by  one  I'm 
 starting  to  fill  up  a  page  so  I'm 
 journaling  right  now  fill  up  a  page  of
[24:33] the  things  that  I  could  be  grateful  for 
 and  eventually  I'm  bursting  into  tears 
 as  I  write  more  and  more  and  more  and  I
[24:38] realized  for  the  first  time  in  my  entire 
 life  maybe  I'm  23  years  old  at  this 
 point  for  the  first  time  I've  reframed
[24:43] something  positively  what  once  felt  like 
 quite  an  insulting  question  how  could  I
[24:48] be  grateful  for  this  changed  my  life 
 forever  because  with  that  question  and 
 the  answer  say  you're  not  grateful  for
[24:53] my  father  for  so  many  different  things  I 
 patched  things  up  with  my  family  I  moved 
 out  of  the  apartment  I  was  staying  in
[24:59] with  that  girlfriend  broke  up  with  her 
 went  back  home  got  onto  a  dopamine  detox 
 fully  put  my  head  down  to  try  and  spread
[25:05] any  level  of  knowledge  that  I  have  to 
 you  this  what  you  see  here  right  now  if 
 you  see  the  YouTube  channel  and  the
[25:11] movements  and  the  comments  and  the 
 channel  profile  picture  the  amount  of 
 guys  who  come  up  and  say  like  you  know
[25:16] the  stuff  that  they've  learned  recently 
 is  changing  their  lives  forever  this 
 stemmed  from  one  question  how  can  I  be
[25:21] grateful  for  this  so  I'll  ask  you  one 
 last  time  in  terms  of  the  nervousness 
 that  you  have  around  girls  how  can  you
[25:27] be  grateful  for  that  I  totally 
 understand  if  you  think  it's  like  an 
 insulting  question  you  don't  want  to 
 answer  it  but  it'd  be  actually  really
[25:32] interesting  for  you  to  just  take  a 
 minute  and  just  you  know  almost  have 
 like  a  little  kind  of  smile  on  your  face 
 and  just  think  you  know  what  I'll
[25:37] probably  look  back  to  where  I  am  right 
 now  and  think  that  that  was  kind  of  cute 
 it's  like  a  nice  memory  like  you  know
[25:42] like  I  personally  look  back  to  my  high 
 school  years  and  I  was  so  nervous  around 
 girls  but  it's  like  I  wouldn't  change  it
[25:47] it's  only  when  you  look  back  and  you 
 connect  the  dots  and  you're  like  oh  okay 
 fair  enough  it  was  kind  of  cute  when  I
[25:52] was  like  that  again  you  don't  want  to  be 
 nervous  around  girls  for  the  rest  of 
 your  life  or  anything  of  course  but  you 
 know  you're  already  on  the  right  path  so
[25:57] you're  already  making  progress  so  why 
 not  just  think  to  yourself  like  yeah 
 I'll  probably  be  looking  back  to  this 
 moment  as  a  symbol  of  Innocence  Essence
[26:04] and  experience  developments  the  ninth 
 way  to  stop  getting  nervous  around  girls
[26:09] is  to  know  exactly  what  to  do  there  and 
 then  when  you  get  nervous  so  let's  say
[26:14] that  I'm  sat  next  to  a  girl  right  now 
 there  she  is
[26:23] so  let's  say  we're  sat  back  home  next  to 
 a  girl  and  you  know  it's  a  first  date  or 
 something  I'm  feeling  nervous  right  it's
[26:28] really  valuable  to  try  and  physically 
 feel  the  nerves  that  you  have  right  now 
 because  most  of  the  time  you  know  what
[26:33] you'll  realize  it's  actually  getting 
 worse  through  your  control  you  see  you
[26:38] have  a  lot  of  control  over  your  body  and 
 how  comfortable  you  are  and  how  relaxed 
 you  are  or  how  hyper  sensitive  and
[26:44] anxious  and  nervous  you  are  you 
 literally  get  to  choose  you  literally 
 get  to  control  this  so  what  if  we  do
[26:49] this  the  next  time  we're  nervous  and 
 there's  a  girl  next  to  us  and  we  become 
 aware  that  we're  nervous  right  so  you 
 know  you're  on  this  first  date  and  you
[26:55] have  the  thought  maybe  while  she's 
 speaking  because  you're  not  very  present 
 said  enough  I'm  really  nervous  like  as 
 soon  as  you're  consciously  aware  of  that
[27:01] why  not  just  open  up  the  front  of  your 
 body  a  little  bit  more  this  may  seem 
 like  silly  so  some  guys  out  there  but  I
[27:06] promise  you  if  you  can  just  try  this  and 
 trust  me  if  you  physically  I'm  talking 
 literally  like  in  the  real  world  open  up
[27:12] your  heart  your  rib  cage  the  front  of 
 your  body  you  will  feel  so  much  more
[27:17] powerful  when  I'm  nervous  or  when  I'm 
 scared  or  when  I'm  anxious  I'm  sat  like 
 this  this  is  why  I'm  like  looking  around
[27:23] like  this  I'm  closing  my  body  I'm  a 
 little  bit  scared  I'm  you  know 
 presenting  to  be  on  my  phone  pretending
[27:28] to  do  something  I'm  like  this  I'm  closed 
 up  even  though  it  seems  too  simple  to  be 
 true  I've  found  that  you  can  make  such  a
[27:33] big  difference  in  your  mood  by  literally 
 just  changing  the  way  that  you  sit  or 
 you  stand  I  see  this  all  the  time  with
[27:38] people  who  don't  feel  good  they're 
 always  like  this  and  people  who  mostly 
 feel  good  they're  always  open  up
[27:43] especially  men  open  up  the  front  of  your 
 body  look  there's  different  ways  to  sit 
 you  can  sit  like  this  and  you  know  my
[27:48] stomach  right  now  is  like  all  curled  up 
 a  little  bit  how  do  you  think  I'm  gonna 
 be  breathing  if  my  body's  like  this  am  I
[27:53] going  to  be  breathing  deep  breaths  like 
 a  king  like  a  superior  man  or  am  I  going 
 to  be  hardly  breathing  at  all  probably
[27:58] hardly  but  if  I  open  up  right  now 
 imagine  how  I'm  gonna  breathe  when  like 
 I'm  taking  up  space  literally  it's  as
[28:03] simple  as  that  just  physically  take  more 
 space  open  your  stomach  open  your  heart 
 your  rib  cage  open  all  this  even  like
[28:09] right  now  I've  got  my  legs  kind  of 
 crossed  even  just  open  them  up  as  well 
 there's  real  science  behind  this  I  won't
[28:14] try  and  explain  the  science  to  you 
 because  I  kind  of  like  you  know 
 understand  it  but  I  don't  to  a  good 
 level  that  I  could  teach  you  anything
[28:19] but  from  my  perspective  when  we  open  up 
 and  we  change  our  breathing  and  we  take
[28:24] more  of  like  a  control  Superior  strong 
 posture  it  changes  the  state  that  our
[28:29] body  is  in  because  when  you're  proper 
 clothes  and  you're  breathing  too  fast  or 
 shallow  your  body's  in  that
[28:34] parasympathetic  or  which  one  I  don't 
 know  which  one  it  is  but  like  another 
 fight  or  flight  one  where  it  thinks  like 
 okay  you're  scared  you're  prepared  for
[28:39] an  attack  but  if  you  just  relax  a  little 
 bit  you  know  feel  good  take  some  good 
 breath  don't  close  your  legs  Don't  Close
[28:44] Your  Eyes  I  mean  you  can  do  sometimes  to 
 be  honest  this  is  just  weird  to  say  like 
 yeah  Alexa  I  like  this  bro  this  is  like
[28:50] how  my  character  would  stand  in  a  game
[28:55] foreign 
 open  everything  up  and  especially 
 breathe  slowly  so  the  next  time  you're 
 feeling  nervous  you  know  the  easiest
[29:01] thing  you  can  do  cold  deep  breath  it 
 should  be  so  full  that  you  actually 
 think  that  it's  like  it's  too  much  this
[29:06] feels  almost  a  bit  weird  she's  gonna 
 notice  that  I'm  taking  a  deep  breath 
 that's  like  the  level  of  breath  that  you
[29:11] should  be  taking  I'm  gonna  take  one  full 
 breath  with  you  right  now  I  know  that  my 
 YouTube  retention  rate's  gonna  drop  just 
 because  there's  no  dope  for  me  I'll  get
[29:17] my  Editor  to  like  make  some  explosions 
 or  some  it's  just  so  we  can 
 maintain  the  Jeffrey's  attention  but 
 take  one  full  breath  with  me  and  I'll
[29:23] symbolize  with  my  arms  right 
 foreign
[29:37] should  last  about  10  seconds  10  seconds 
 most  people  on  average  breathe  like  two
[29:43] to  four  seconds  per  breath  but  a  full 
 deep  breath  the  kind  of  one  that  relaxes 
 you  always  remember  this  a  full  breath
[29:48] that  relaxes  you  lasts  more  than  six 
 seconds  the  next  time  you  feel  a  bit
[29:53] nervous  why  don't  you  just  try  and 
 roughly  count  how  long  each  breath  is 
 and  I  guarantee  you'll  be  literally  like
[29:58] two  seconds  it's  almost  as  simple  as 
 this  bro  make  your  breath  at  least  six 
 seconds  long  three  seconds  in  three 
 seconds  out  or  even  better  make  it
[30:04] closer  to  ten  seconds  five  in  five  hours 
 and  finally  the  last  way  to  stop  getting 
 nervous  around  girls  is  to  drastically
[30:10] improve  yourself  when  I  was  a  lot 
 younger  before  I  went  through  my  own 
 self-improvement  Journey  before  I
[30:15] started  going  to  the  gym  or  building  a 
 business  or  trying  to  actually  be 
 productive  and  trying  to  improve  my
[30:20] mental  health  and  understanding  the 
 world  more  when  I  was  just  a  kid  who 
 just  you  know  played  video  games  and 
 everything  I  was  very  very  nervous
[30:26] around  the  girls  like  so  nervous  that  I 
 wasn't  even  next  to  girls  you  know  like 
 I  wasn't  going  on  dates  or  anything  I
[30:31] was  so  nervous  that  because  of  like  you 
 know  mixture  of  things  but  you  know 
 what's  helped  me  long  term  over  years
[30:36] it's  just  becoming  like  a  higher  tier 
 man  becoming  more  of  a  successful  man 
 more  of  a  Driven  Man  and  I've  got  like  a
[30:41] list  of  accomplishments  which  I  noticed 
 some  other  people  it's  like  not  that 
 impressive  but  to  me  especially  because
[30:46] I  was  a  total  Jeffrey  just  a  few  years 
 ago  I'm  still  like  a  part-time  Jeffrey 
 sometimes  anyway  but  like  for  me  the
[30:52] progress  that  I  made  and  the 
 accomplishments  that  I  have  racked  up  it 
 means  a  lot  to  me  and  what  I've  found  is 
 it's  created  some  level  not  all  but  like
[30:59] some  level  of  like  self-love  and 
 self-respect  that  now  I  don't  seem  to 
 get  nervous  around  that  many  girls  it's
[31:04] usually  like  the  woman  that  I'm  really 
 impressed  by  I  feel  a  little  bit  nervous 
 sometimes  like  for  my  first  date  with  my
[31:10] girl  we  met  in  a  coffee  shop  in  Thailand 
 so  we're  in  the  same  island  that  we  met 
 this  is  where  I  am  by  the  way I  didn't
[31:15] really  announce  this  but  I'm  in  Thailand 
 we  met  on  this  island  around  six  months 
 ago  and  for  our  first  date  we  met  in  a
[31:20] coffee  shop  and  it  was  very  proper  cute 
 and  everything  and  before  I  went  there  I 
 was  actually  like  nervously  excited  so  I
[31:25] already  followed  you  know  that  tip  I 
 told  you  like  tip  number  seven  mentally 
 reframe  to  excitement  so  certainly  bro  I
[31:31] was  certainly  feeling  some  nerves  I  was 
 like  very  attracted  to  her  and  the 
 conversations  we  were  having  were 
 rejuvenating  and  so  I  felt  like  you  know
[31:38] some  nerves  but  the  thing  is  like  you 
 know  I've  done  well  she's  by  my  side 
 she's  totally  into  me  and  that's 
 interesting  I  was  quite  nervous  and
[31:43] quite  excited  for  our  first  date  but  it 
 went  fine  because  being  nervous  around 
 girls  isn't  that  terrible  you  know  still
[31:49] to  this  day  I  get  it  sometimes  now  she's 
 by  my  side  waiting  for  me  to  finish 
 recording  so  she  can  just  hang  out  with
[31:54] me  if  you  stay  on  this  path  this  path  of 
 self-improvement  the  Journey  of  becoming
[31:59] more  like  a  Donuts  great  things  will 
 come  your  way  there  will  be  a  time  that 
 you  will  look  back  to  your  younger  self
[32:04] and  you'll  just  have  so  much  gratitude 
 and  love  for  the  progress  that  you've
[32:09] made  that's  what  I  wish  for  you  usually 
 at  the  end  of  like  these  YouTube  videos 
 I  know  a  bunch  of  YouTubers  will  try  and
[32:14] sell  you  their  products  I  don't  really 
 have  anything  to  sell  like  that  like  we 
 do  have  some  products  but  I  don't  really 
 like  to  like  push  them  in  your  face  so
[32:20] if  you  wanted  to  try  and  find  them  you 
 probably  could  but  it  takes  a  little 
 while  to  even  find  anything  that  I  sell 
 but  what  we  do  have  which  we've  just
[32:26] recently  started  is  the  YouTube  channel 
 memberships  so  there's  no  pressure  but 
 if  you'd  like  you  can  support  the
[32:31] movement  moments  and  support  my  editors 
 and  everything  because  we  have  a  whole 
 team  behind  this  I  know  like  on  the
[32:36] channels  my  picture  it's  my  name  it's  me 
 on  the  camera  but  we  literally  have  10 
 employees  like  full  time  on  the  YouTube
[32:41] edit  to  this  personal  assistant 
 thumbnail  team  leader  everything  and  I 
 like  to  pay  him  well  the  channel
[32:46] memberships  will  pop  up  as  a  card  or 
 Link  in  the  description  it's  like  a 
 couple  of  bucks  if  you  want  like  an 
 emoji  next  to  your  name  when  you  comment
[32:51] just  so  you  get  like  a  feeling  of 
 importance  and  people  cover  like  well 
 how  do  you  get  an  emoji  next  to  your 
 name  bro  and  you  can  tell  me  a  channel
[32:57] members  you  can  just  mark  it  for  me  bro 
 affiliate  marketing  Andrew  you  should 
 have  done  this  instead  bro  you  can  watch
[33:03] this  video  right  now  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
