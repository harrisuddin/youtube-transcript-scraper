[00:00] you're  really  gonna  go  for  the  third 
 relapse  of  the  day  Jeffrey 
 the  third  relapse
[00:21] yo  cut  the  intro  bro  [ __ ]  me  man  I  did  a 
 podcast  interview  like  Discord  call
[00:26] there  was  a  point  when  I  was  like  live 
 streaming  and  one  of  the  guys  who  I 
 invited  up  to  come  speak  to  me  whilst  I 
 was  live  streaming  was  a  13  year  old  kid
[00:32] he  said  that  he  was  given  an  iPad  at  the 
 age  of  four  and  that  he  discovered  I
[00:37] think  he  said  age  nine  or  ten  and  that 
 he  had  an  addiction  before  he  was  11
[00:42] years  old  I  will  say  that  again  an  11 
 year  old  had  a  pawn  addiction  you  want
[00:47] to  do  something  interesting  close  your 
 eyes  see  yourself  as  a  father  a  few 
 years  from  now  and  just  see  your  son  in
[00:53] his  room  with  an  addiction  to  porn  a  bad 
 addiction  to  porn  and  maybe  video  games
[00:58] too  and  imagine  seeing  that  in  your  son 
 and  imagine  not  even  being  able  to  help 
 him  because  of  how  hyper  stimulating  and
[01:04] addicting  it  is  and  I  think  what  makes 
 it  so  much  harder  now  is  that  it's  no 
 longer  even  like  these  porn  companies
[01:10] that  are  pushing  this  onto  kids  it's 
 kids  putting  it  onto  other  kids  it's 
 some  little  girl  12  years  olds  working
[01:16] on  Tick  Tock  kids  in  high  school  like 
 the  boys  in  high  school  bro  a  lot  of 
 them  are  addicted  to  like  Tick  Tock  and
[01:21] stuff  imaginable  imagine  literally  if 
 you  see  this  like  generation  of  high 
 school  boys  on  Tick  Tock  literally
[01:26] seeing  their  generation  of  girls  showing 
 their  bodies  sexually  and  when  you  think 
 about  the  age  of  the  girls  who  are  going
[01:31] viral  on  Tick  Tock  that's  when  it  gets 
 really  [ __ ]  bro  I  remember  the  day 
 that  I  got  into  nofap  like  I  knew  about
[01:36] it  for  a  little  while  but  I  was  age  17 
 I'm  25  now  I  knew  about  it  for  a  while 
 people  talking  about  it  online  or  day  90
[01:41] and  you'll  be  able  to  levitate  and  [ __ ] 
 right  you  know  I  tried  it  here  and  there 
 one  day  two  day  relapse  whatever  I  don't
[01:46] really  care  yeah  whatever  I  remember  the 
 day  that  I  took  it  seriously  bro  I  woke 
 up  and  this  was  somewhat  of  like  a  habit
[01:51] for  me  I'd  wake  up  and  just  grab  my 
 phone  and  just  go  on  like  Reddit  and 
 Instagram  and  stuff  and  fact  once
[01:56] cleaned  up  stayed  in  bed  or  lying  down 
 just  scrolled  more  and  more  and  more 
 click  on  some  more  porn  on  Instagram  you
[02:01] see  ass  or  on  Reddit  it's  like  a  sexual 
 post  or  some  [ __ ]  even  talking  about 
 this  [ __ ]  I  don't  want  to  take  you  out
[02:06] this  story  but  even  just  describing  the 
 story  to  you  and  you  know  just 
 describing  over  on  Reddit  there's  like  a 
 sexual  thing  I  promise  you  I  literally
[02:11] just  had  like  a  little  bit  of  a  desire 
 to  go  and  watch  porn  right  now  years 
 after  I've  watched  that  [ __ ]  the  second
[02:16] time  still  I  haven't  left  the  bed  yet 
 it's  the  second  time  fap  I  remember  the 
 third  time  was  when  I  went  on  to  Pornhub 
 and  watched  like  this  video  of  like  this
[02:22] blonde  girl  getting  railed  and  how 
 [ __ ]  is  that  as  well  not  like  seeing  a 
 sexual  picture  it's  like  it's  still  not 
 good  for  you  and  stuff  but  you  know  of
[02:27] like  a  girl  or  seeing  like  some  video  of 
 her  twerking  or  some  [ __ ]  yeah  fine  but 
 like  actual  porn  where  you  see  like  a
[02:33] man  [ __ ]  a  woman  and  you're  like  the 
 little  monkey  in  the  corner  just 
 checking  off  to  that  what  does  that  do 
 to  your  brain  and  your  beliefs  just
[02:38] everything  about  you  you're  kind  of 
 conditioning  yourself  to  just  be  like 
 this  weirdo  who  isn't  having  sex  but
[02:43] who's  just  watching  bro  the  third  time 
 by  the  time  that  I  finished  I  wasn't 
 even  fully  hard  I'm  looking  down  at  my
[02:50] semi-limp  dick  and  thinking  this  is 
 [ __ ]  bro  I  was  17  years  old  and  my  PP
[02:55] wasn't  even  getting  hard  I  took  no  Fab 
 seriously  after  that  because  bro  that  is 
 gut-wrenching  as  a  man  that's  your
[03:00] manhood  your  PP  is  your  manhood  to  see 
 that  it's  not  working  well  because 
 you've  been  death  gripping  it  whilst
[03:05] watching  porn  oh  that  is  so  upsetting 
 you  need  to  stop  castrating  yourself
[03:10] because  that's  what  this  is  I  always 
 give  this  analogy  and  it  always  opens 
 people's  eyes  so  I'm  gonna  tell  you  it 
 what  happens  if  you  have  a  male  cat  and
[03:16] you  castrate  it  and  essentially  castrate 
 you  like  chop  off  it's  peanuts  and  balls 
 or  something  you  castrate  it  it  goes
[03:21] from  being  like  this  adventurous  cat 
 that's  almost  challenging  you  jumping 
 around  everywhere  being  a  bit  aggressive
[03:26] to  this  like  docile  weak  lazy  submissive 
 little  being  we  know  this  oh  yeah  we  get
[03:32] pets  castrated  it's  like  a  normal  thing 
 right  and  we  see  the  transformation  oh 
 yeah  you  know  if  your  cat's  being 
 misbehaving  yeah  go  get  a  castrate  it  is
[03:38] a  normal  thing  have  you  ever  really 
 stopped  to  just  think  like  [ __ ]  like 
 that's  kind  of  what  I'm  doing  to  myself 
 when  I  check  off  you're  castrating
[03:43] yourself  that  life  that  you're  supposed 
 to  have  inside  of  you  that  drive  that
[03:48] you're  supposed  to  have  to  either  go  and 
 get  women  or  go  and  work  yourself  up  to 
 be  attractive  and  successful  enough  to
[03:53] get  women  that  drive  inside  of  you  just 
 gets  diminished  and  thrown  into  Kleenex 
 I  can't  tell  if  this  is  a  conspiracy
[03:59] theory  but  you'll  remember  being  told 
 that  masturbating  and  watching  porn  was 
 good  for  you  I  swear  so  many  guys  can
[04:04] remember  that  being  like  a  general 
 consensus  by  teachers  perhaps  by  parents 
 for  some  reason  it  feels  like  the
[04:09] government  told  me  that  masturbating  and 
 watching  porn  was  good  for  me  so  many 
 guys  have  been  able  to  agree  we  can't
[04:14] pinpoint  whether  we  were  told  to  this  by 
 the  government  but  it  feels  like  that 
 was  the  message  that  they  conveyed  to  us
[04:19] is  this  a  conspiracy  theory  to  think 
 that  was  convey  to  us  because  they  want 
 a  generation  of  like  submissive  men
[04:24] especially  men  of  like  the  warrior  class 
 the  younger  men  full  of  testosterone  to 
 just  castrate  themselves  so  they're
[04:29] easier  to  control  you're  probably 
 thinking  well  yeah  like  I  want  to  stop  I 
 want  to  stop  but  like  I  keep  fapping  I 
 keep  messing  up  I  keep  relapsing  and
[04:35] honestly  yeah  of  course  you  do  it's 
 normal  that  when  you're  trying  to  stop  a 
 habit  you  still  keep  doing  that  thing
[04:40] for  some  time  it  took  me  a  couple  of 
 years  to  really  actually  make  nofap  work 
 because  it's  not  just  like  you  can  just
[04:45] declare  yeah  I'm  on  nofap  now  I'm  not 
 gonna  fap  anymore  it's  more  so  that  if 
 you've  been  fapping  for  10  years  it's
[04:50] gonna  take  you  some  time  to  be  able  to 
 fully  quit  because  it's  just  like 
 counteracting  those  bad  habits  so  a  lot
[04:56] of  young  guys  really  do  get  obsessed 
 with  this  and  you  know  they  say  like  oh 
 you  know  Hamza  Ramon  no  fap  and  I  get  to 
 day  seven  then  I  keep  relapse  and  I  keep
[05:02] relapsing  keep  relapsing  and  I  tell  them 
 how  long  have  you  been  fapping  for  when 
 did  you  start  at  all  like  you  know  12 
 years  old  13  years  old  so  you've  been
[05:08] fapping  for  four  years  five  years  and 
 you've  been  on  Nova  like  two  months  bro 
 so  it's  like  you  can't  just  expect  it  to 
 be  perfect  overnight  it's  like  are  you
[05:14] fapping  like  once  a  week  that's  probably 
 like  a  good  level  of  progress  perhaps  a 
 month  from  now  fap  every  eight  days  nine
[05:19] days  ten  days  perhaps  six  months  from 
 now  up  every  three  weeks  perhaps  a  year 
 from  now  fap  less  than  once  a  month  and
[05:25] at  that  point  it's  like  yeah  it's  fine 
 bro  why  do  the  people  of  nofa  become 
 successful  and  of  course  this  is  a 
 little  bit  cringe  it's  like  other  guys
[05:30] who  get  onto  nofap  still  stay  losers  but 
 generally  a  lot  of  the  successful  men 
 have  this  in  common  they  stopped
[05:35] masturbating  and  what's  important  the 
 greatest  motivator  that  you  have  is  the 
 drive  to  [ __ ]  women  honestly  like  I  know
[05:41] it's  kind  of  offensive  or  controversial 
 but  it  is  true  the  greatest  motivator  as 
 a  matter  but  if  you  really  think  of
[05:46] yourself  as  an  animal  what's  your 
 motivator  bro  because  this  too  there's 
 one  to  survive  so  if  you're  hungry  or 
 thirsty  or  some  [ __ ]  or  you  need  shelter
[05:52] that's  the  biggest  motivator  you  have  to 
 survive  but  once  your  survival  needs  a 
 met  which  it  is  for  99.99  of  guys  here
[05:58] then  what's  left  is  the  biggest  need  the 
 biggest  desire  to  [ __ ]  and  when  you  get 
 rid  of  that  desire  it's  like  well  you've
[06:04] achieved  like  most  of  what  you  needed  to 
 do  with  your  life  and  so  of  course  you 
 feel  kind  of  lethargic  and  lazy  and
[06:09] shameful  and  just  tired  of  course  you 
 don't  feel  motivated  to  do  hard  work  of 
 course  you  don't  even  enjoy  hard  work 
 after  you've  just  bust  50  nuts  over  the
[06:15] last  two  months  the  men  with  no  fat 
 become  successful  because  they're  able 
 to  harness  their  sexual  energy  which  is
[06:20] so  incred  incredibly  important  and  I 
 know  it  does  sound  cringe  I'll  have  the 
 men  of  no  [ __ ]  stuff  it  sounds  cringe
[06:25] but  the  thing  is  your  sexual  desire  is 
 incredibly  important  and  it's  being 
 Stripped  Away  from  you  by  your  own  hand
[06:31] but  by  the  cause  I  think  of  external 
 influences  which  are  telling  young  men 
 that  it's  okay  to  just  spill  their  seed
[06:37] just  because  it's  normal  I  gave  this 
 analogy  once  and  I  think  you'll  be 
 interested  imagine  you  put  two  men  in  a 
 cage  this  weird  [ __ ]  up  Social
[06:43] experiments  and  you  tell  them  fight  and 
 don't  stop  till  one  of  you  are  dead 
 imagine  you  did  this  like  psychological 
 experiments  and  you  wanted  to  see  what
[06:49] mine  would  fight  harder  one  of  the  men 
 we  fill  him  up  with  food  first  and  we 
 also  tell  them  yeah  you're  a  masturbate
[06:54] oh  you  know  here's  a  woman  have  sex  so 
 he's  empty  of  nut  and  full  of  belly  the 
 other  guy  no  food  for  you  and  also  full
[06:59] balls  for  you  no  nothing  he's  got  an 
 empty  stomach  and  full  heavy  balls  I
[07:04] know  this  sounds  silly  but  I  really  just 
 want  you  to  imagine  this  competition 
 this  fight  we  have  this  man  with  a  full
[07:09] stomach  his  digesting  [ __ ]  refined 
 carbs  right  now  and  empty  balls  and  this 
 man  with  an  empty  stomach  and  full  balls
[07:15] and  we  tell  them  fight  to  the  death 
 honestly  bro  do  I  even  have  to  ask  you 
 who's  gonna  win  all  of  us  right  now  I
[07:20] think  every  single  person  right  now 
 would  say  this  guy  right  some  nerd  might 
 come  in  oh  but  this  guy's  got  more  Cubs
[07:25] and  cubs  like  it  just  shut  the  [ __ ]  up 
 if  you  really  imagine  like  a  realistic 
 scenario  of  some  guy  eating  a  big  meal 
 and  then  like  nothing  and  the  other  guy
[07:30] staying  faster  bro  this  guy  who  stayed 
 fasted  he's  literally  hungry  and  he's 
 horny  bro  he's  gonna  [ __ ]  this  guy  like
[07:37] not  like  that  but  he's  gonna  [ __ ]  him  up 
 though  right  now  okay  this  experiment's 
 like  really  weird  and  stuff  right  but  is 
 it  that  different  from  what's  just
[07:43] happening  in  normal  life  anyway  because 
 we  as  men  we're  in  competition  bro  if 
 you  want  to  study  and  get  good  grades
[07:48] your  grades  are  not  just  in  a  vacuum 
 your  grade  is  based  on  what  other  people 
 get  your  grade  is  actually  a  competition
[07:54] against  other  people  in  your  business  in 
 your  career  you're  competing  against 
 other  people  to  attract  women  you're
[07:59] competing  against  other  men  why  are  we 
 spilling  our  drive  to  compete  why  not 
 hold  that  and  actually  use  it  for
[08:04] something  that's  worth  more  than  just  a 
 few  seconds  of  hedonistic  pleasure 
 that's  why  the  men  of  nofap  become  more
[08:10] successful  because  they're  able  to 
 harness  what  may  be  the  greatest  drive 
 we  have  is  our  sexual  drive  and  this
[08:15] isn't  some  like  weird  ass  advice  I  get  a 
 day  90  or  some  [ __ ]  I'm  not  saying  to 
 get  to  a  particular  day  I've  never  been
[08:20] one  of  these  guys  I  hate  that  advice 
 advice  of  like  yeah  I  get  to  day  90  or 
 something  I  don't  think  the  benefit  of 
 nofa  comes  in  streaks  I  think  the
[08:26] benefit  of  nofap  comes  when  you  just 
 reduce  the  quantity  of  like  nuts  per 
 month  per  year  I  have  a  problem  with
[08:32] most  of  the  nofap  YouTubers  you  can 
 think  of  a  nofap  YouTuber  right  now 
 chances  are  I  don't  like  them  I  think 
 they're  bad  for  you  even  though  that's
[08:38] weird  to  say  it's  like  I  think  they're 
 actually  bad  influences  because  their 
 pressure  needs  to  stay  on  the  street  and 
 they've  convinced  you  that  if  you
[08:43] relapse  if  you  you  know  mess  up  the 
 streak  you  lose  all  the  benefits  and  you 
 have  to  start  again  bro  that  sounds
[08:48] [ __ ]  up to  me  because  imagine  a 
 fitness  channel  telling  a  fat  guy  of  all 
 these  benefits  that  he  could  get  if  he
[08:53] gets  onto  exercise  and  then  tells  him 
 like  oh  yeah  by  the  way  like  if  you  mess 
 up  your  streak  and  you  miss  one  workout
[08:58] all  of  the  benefits  reset  imagine 
 telling  a  fat  guy  that  he  has  to  go  to 
 the  gym  every  single  day  and  if  he
[09:04] misses  one  day  all  of  the  benefits  reset 
 that  is  inhumane  and  that's  what  these 
 nofap  YouTubers  do  to  you  and  they
[09:09] convince  you  that  you  need  to  be  on  a 
 streak  you  don't  need  to  be  on  a  streak 
 you  just  need  to  reduce  how  often  you 
 fap  per  month  per  six  months  per  three
[09:15] months  per  week  keep  your  balls  full  bro 
 like  nice  and  happy  click  on  this  video 
 right  now  do  the  hard  work  especially
[09:20] when  you  don't  feel  like  it  mmm
