[00:07] can  i  tell  you  why  it's  not  funny  if 
 this  was  the  other  way  around  and  a 
 woman  was  sat  here  and  a  bloke  had
[00:12] locked  her  in  a  flat  and  she  had  to  jump 
 out  and  injure  herself  you  lot  would  not 
 be  laughing  somehow  if  it  happens  to  a
[00:17] bloke  that's  funny  that's  not  funny  is 
 it  that  isn't 
 it  all  started  when  the  government
[00:22] replaced  the  father  the  father  role  in 
 the  family  has  been  killed  off  which
[00:27] means  the  biggest  purpose  in  our  lives 
 has  been  destroyed  marriage  divorce  and 
 child  care  laws  are  blatantly  sexist  you
[00:34] are  not  needed  anymore 
 the  average  marriage  lasts  11  years  and 
 then  through  the  divorce  you  will  get
[00:39] the  kids  and  the  finances  why  would  she 
 stay  in  a  relationship  with  little  to  no 
 benefit  but  with  extra  responsibility
[00:45] young  men  have  been  raised  with  no 
 father  figure  or  a  father  who  wasn't 
 around  due  to  overworking  long  hours  in
[00:51] the  capitalistic  materialistic  society 
 that  we  live  in  and  so  we  look  for 
 father  figures  elsewhere  from  the  media
[00:58] from  society  from  our  female  teachers  in 
 school  and  all  of  them  lied  to  us  they 
 fed  us  a  script  that  doesn't  work  they
[01:05] set  us  up  with  a  trajectory  to  fail  just 
 be  yourself  but  you're  actually  a  loser 
 and  we  want  you  to  stay  a  loser  because
[01:11] that's  more  profitable  men  should 
 embrace  their  feminine  side  but  we'll 
 lose  attraction  to  you  if  you  do  treat
[01:16] her  like  a  princess  like  a  queen  but  we 
 won't  treat  you  like  a  king  stop  trying 
 to  be  masculine  but  no  woman's  gonna
[01:21] have  sex  with  you  if  you  do  everyone  in 
 society  has  made  it  so  clear  to  you  to 
 not  sexualize  women  guess  who  the  women
[01:27] are  dating  and  sleeping  with 
 the  men  who  sexualized  them  the  ultimate 
  test  of  the  modern  world  was  to
[01:33] make  all  men  blue  pilled  and  scared  of 
 their  masculinity  when  you  are  this 
 normal  blue  pill  guy  you  get  such  little
[01:39] attraction  from  women  because  you've 
 ultimately  lost  your  masculine  frame 
 most  important  part  of  our  frame  is  that
[01:45] we  are  men  we  are  masculine  we  are 
 supposed  to  be  the  strong  stoic  leader 
 and  listening  to  society  takes  that  away
[01:51] from  you  and  by  listening  to  society's 
 lies  you  ultimately  lost  frame  and  now 
 you're  ugly  to  women  then  the
[01:57] jerk  gets  the  women  that  you  feel  you 
 deserve  and  then  something  happens
[02:02] you  rip  the  script  you  begin  to  do  the 
 opposite  of  everything  society  has
[02:07] advised  you  and  so  women  naturally 
 gravitate  towards  you  you  close  more 
 deals  in  your  business  than  ever  before
[02:13] your  confidence  skyrockets  it's  obvious 
 the  conventional  advice  was  all  one  big
[02:18] test  and  any  man  who  crumbled  to 
 that  test  lost  his  frame  the  only  men
[02:23] who  naturally  overcame  this  test  were 
 those  who  had  a  strong  male  role  model 
 in  their  lives  and  so  i  thank  you
[02:30] i  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  be  that 
 strong  role  model  for  you  you  want  to
