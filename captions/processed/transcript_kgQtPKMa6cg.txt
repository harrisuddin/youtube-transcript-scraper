[00:00] jeffrey  is  happy  exactly  how  he  is 
 i'm  fine  video  games  aren't  even  that 
 bad  for  you  he  doesn't  realize  just  how
[00:06] much  time  he's  wasting  on  the  modern 
 addictions  he  says  that  video  games 
 aren't  that  bad  for  you  that  he  only
[00:11] plays  for  one  hour  a  day  but  that's  not 
 true  every  video  gamer  who  says  that  he 
 only  plays  for  one  hour  a  day  is  a  big 
 fat  stinky  liar  oh  they  pissed  me  off
[00:18] but  after  a  full  day  of  work  hamza  i 
 worked  for  someone  shut  the  [ __ ]  up
[00:23] oh  you  crack  it  they  pissed  me  off  me 
 because  i  used  to  use  that  exact  same 
 excuse  as  well  it's  just  cringe  you're
[00:28] obviously  not  playing  for  an  hour  bro  by 
 the  time  you've  like  gotten  into  a 
 [ __ ]  like  league  of  legends  game  you
[00:33] literally  have  less  time  to  finish  the 
 game 
 you're  just  lying  to  yourself  and  you 
 know  what  the  reason  why  so  many  [ __ ]
[00:39] video  gamers  say  this  [ __ ]  like  oh 
 but  i  only  play  for  one  hour  a  day  after 
 i  do  all  of  my  good  chores  and  it's
[00:44] because  they  know  that  they  think  open 
 they  know  that  they're  talking  about  bad 
 habit  here  and  that's  why  they  have  to 
 tell  you  because  if  they  truly  thought
[00:50] it  wasn't  bad  for  you  they  wouldn't  have 
 to  like  [ __ ]  tell  you  like  i  only 
 played  for  one  hour 
 oh  yeah  jeffrey
[00:56] just  went  on  our  side  around  i  can 
 remember  the  exact  moment  that  my  life 
 changed  in  may  2020  i  gave  up  all  of  my
[01:03] addictions  i  used  to  smoke  weed  all  day 
 every  day  and  that  is  not  an 
 exaggeration  i  used  to  wake  up  grab  the
[01:09] [ __ ]  crack  pipe  put  weed  into  it 
 blaze  that  [ __ ]  up  and  continue  smoking 
 throughout  the  entire  [ __ ]  day  i
[01:15] would  get  high  before  work  and  get  high 
 after  work  i'd  get  high  before  going  to 
 sleep  and  get  high  after  waking  up  from
[01:20] sleep  i  was  playing  a  fair  amount  of 
 video  games  i  just  spent  a  lot  of  time 
 on  youtube  and  just  watching  random
[01:25] shows  on  netflix  on  tv  i'd  scroll  on 
 social  media  on  reddit  especially  i'd
[01:30] spend  like  three  hours  a  day  on  reddit 
 my  entire  day  revolved  around  consuming 
 and  it  felt  uncontrollable  in  my  mind  i
[01:37] would  get  the  thoughts  that  i  wanted  to 
 stop  but  i  didn't  want  to  do  this 
 [ __ ]  anymore  that  i  didn't  want  to 
 continue  smoking  weed  i  couldn't  even
[01:42] afford  it  i  was  done  with  spending  three 
 hours  a  day  on  reddit  i  felt  like  after 
 fapping  but  day  in  and  day  out  i  kept  on
[01:48] doing  the  same  things  if  you  can  relate 
 to  what  i'm  saying  i  hope  this  video  can 
 help  you  adorn
[01:53] adonis  lives  like  an  old-school  man  like 
 a  caveman  he  drastically  limits  his
[01:58] technology  use  instead  adonis  prefers  to 
 be  out  in  nature  amongst  animals  seeing
[02:03] the  sun  rise  and  the  sun  sets  spending 
 time  with  his  loved  ones  it  isn't 
 adonis's  preference  to  be  sat  hunkered
[02:09] down  with  poor  posture  looking  at  his 
 screen  all  day  he  knows  that  that  causes 
 sickness  and  so  adonis  looks  around  so
[02:15] confused  at  the  majority  of  people  who 
 spend  all  their  time  like  that  gather 
 around  boys  we've  got  a
[02:22] the  topic  of  this  video  is  simple  enough 
 to  say  okay  you  know  stop  spending  time 
 on  youtube  and  reddit  and  social  media
[02:27] but  i  think  it  goes  so  much  deeper  than 
 that  because  these  things  are  totally 
 ingrained  in  our  lives  and  we  don't  even
[02:33] realize  how  detrimental  it  is  we  are  in 
 the  most  safest  the  best  time  to  have
[02:38] ever  existed  and  yet  the  majority  of  us 
 are  unhappy  depressed  and  anxious  and  i
[02:43] think  it's  almost  totally  down  to  the 
 fact  that  our  lives  are  just  based  on 
 this  virtue  of  reality  that  we  spend  so
[02:48] many  hours  looking  at  screens  when  was 
 the  last  time  that  you  touched  grass  i 
 know  that  that  sounds  like  a  silly
[02:53] question  but  just  answer  it  truthfully 
 when  was  the  last  time  that  you  touched 
 grass  when  was  the last  time  that  you 
 went  on  a  walk  and  you  picked  like  some
[02:59] random  leaf  and  you  just  kind  of  instead 
 of  mindlessly  doing  it  you  actually 
 looked  at  the  leaf  and  you're  like  oh 
 this  is this  is  a  nice  leaf  when  was  the
[03:04] last  time  that  you  actually  stepped  on  a 
 crunchy  leaf  on  the  floor  i'm  telling 
 you  right  now  that  all  of  that  stuff  all
[03:09] that  natural  behavior  that  we  used  to  do 
 as  a  child  like  you  know  stepping  inside 
 of  a  puddle  that  exactly  correlates  to
[03:15] how  happy  you  are  and  apart  from 
 accidentally  and  getting  pissed  off  the 
 last  time  you  jumped  in  a  puddle  was
[03:20] probably  10  years  ago  i  know  that  this 
 sounds  like  bro  science  but  i'm  telling 
 you  that  this  is  the  truth  your 
 happiness  correlates  with  how  much  you
[03:25] jump  into  puddles 
 and  no  one  jumps  into  puddles  anymore 
 because  why  it would  be  it's  weird  just
[03:30] in  case  someone  records  us  and  so  we'll 
 spend  all  of  our  time  just  looking  at 
 the  screen  like  you  are  right  now  you 
 think  you're  relating  to  me  and  you
[03:36] think  that  oh  yeah  he's  onto  something 
 like  people  are  so  so  [ __ ]  up  but  i'm 
 talking  to  you  you're  still  watching  me 
 through  a  [ __ ]  screen  when  i  made
[03:41] this  youtube  channel  the  original 
 purpose  that  i  had  which  eventually  i 
 actually  went  on  to  like  somewhat  quit
[03:46] this  youtube  no  one  actually  knows  this 
 apart  from  one  person  actually  kind  of 
 quit  this  youtube  channel  after  it  like
[03:51] popped  off  and  everything  because  the 
 one  purpose  i  had  with  this  channel  was 
 to  spread  specifically  the  knowledge  of
[03:56] dopamine  detoxing  of  stopping  those  bad 
 habits  of  drastically  reducing  how  long 
 we  spent  on  our  screens  and  there  was  a
[04:02] moment  where  i  felt  like  i  kind  of 
 ticked  it  off  i  told  you  everything  i 
 knew  about  reducing  your  content 
 consumption  and  so  by  the  time  we  hit
[04:07] like  30  000  subscribers  and  you  know  it 
 was  all  popping  off  unless  you  called 
 the  video  editor  sam  and  told  them  like
[04:12] yeah  i'm  like  bro  i'm  done  not  even  in  a 
 sad  way  i  literally  feel  like  i've 
 fulfilled  the  purpose  like  that's  as 
 much  as  i  can  say  now  i  can  continue
[04:18] making  videos  like  you  know  it's  a 
 business  and  everyone's  going  to  be 
 proud  of  me  because  i'm  just  making  so 
 much  money  and  he's  so  famous  and  stuff
[04:23] and  he's  you  know  he's  helping  the 
 family  but  it's  like  i'm  contributing  to 
 the  problem  i  have  to  take  a  [ __ ]  hit 
 to  like  my  moral  system  my  like  soul  by
[04:30] sometimes  making  these  videos  and 
 thinking  like  i'm  literally  contributing 
 to  some  random  kids  internet  addiction
[04:35] hopefully  there's  like  a  net  gain  that 
 the  videos  i  make  are  hopefully  a 
 positive  influence  and  sometimes  you
[04:40] know  people  comment  and  they  say  like  oh 
 yeah  hamza  really  helped  me  and  stuff 
 and  so  that  kind  of  like  reminds  me  that 
 yeah  maybe  i  am  doing  good  work  here  but
[04:46] the  issue  still  stands  we  are  totally 
 surrounded  with  technology  and  it  isn't 
 really  that  good  for  us  the  issue  is
[04:52] that  you  are  just  one  person  one  young 
 man  and  quite  frankly  you're  not  that 
 great  you're  not  that  smart  you're  not
[04:57] that  disciplined  you  know  you're  working 
 on  it  fair  enough  fantastic  but  you're 
 not  at  the  ultimate  point  right  you're 
 not  at  the  you  know  the  10  out  of  10
[05:03] discipline  right  you  are  alone  against 
 an  army  against  hundreds  of  thousands  of
[05:08] scientists  and  data  analysts  and 
 software  developers  smart  [ __ ] 
 it's  you  versus  them  they  have  found  the
[05:14] exact  like  the  exact  every  single  minute 
 detail  to  keep  you  hooked  because  that's
[05:19] how  they  make  money  that's  just 
 technology  that's  the  social  media  but 
 even  with  the  food  that  we  consume
[05:24] you're  again  you're  against  hundreds  of 
 thousands  of  nutritionists  like  these 
 [ __ ]  evil  people  who  are  modifying
[05:30] food  for  it  to  be  so  addictive  that 
 you're  literally  killing  yourself  whilst 
 eating  it  you're  just  one  young  man
[05:35] against  maybe  a  million  scientists  the 
 fact  that  you're  making  any  progress 
 right  now  is  [ __ ]  remarkable  when  you
[05:41] really  think  of  it  like  this  i  want  you 
 to  like  sit  up  straight  put  your 
 shoulders  back  your  chest  out  high  and
[05:46] think  like  [ __ ]  those  scientists  broke 
 those  [ __ ]  nerds  destroy  them  bro 
 they  are  your  competition  like  they  are
[05:52] the  enemy  the  fact  that  you're  making 
 any  progress  right  now  is  insane  it's
[05:57] unimaginable  you  aren't  supposed  to  be 
 able  to  make  the  progress  that  we  are 
 making  to  take  a  step  back  from  the
[06:02] modern  addictions  to  improve  your  diet 
 it's  not  supposed  to  be  possible  it  is 
 literally  not  supposed  to  be  possible  to
[06:07] be  on  self-improvement  with  what  we  are 
 against  so  again  if  you've  made  any 
 progress  you  should  be  so  proud  and
[06:13] grateful  for  yourself  it  started  with  a 
 sense  of  anger  and  hatred  for  me  and  i
[06:18] think  that's  really  important  because 
 i've  seen  the  personality  differences  of 
 the  people  who  try  to  take  control  of
[06:23] their  lives  and  there's  usually  two 
 there's  like  the  depressed  quite  feeble 
 sad  guy  who's  like  oh  perhaps  i'm
[06:28] spending  too  long  on  youtube  then 
 there's  the  guy  who's  aggressive  about 
 it  [ __ ]  youtube  [ __ ]  the  drugs  that  i'm
[06:33] taking  and  the  junk  food  this  is  the  guy 
 who  makes  progress  you  need  like  a  bit 
 of  aggression  to  take  back  control  over
[06:39] your  life  you  can't  do  this  passively 
 you  can't  be  like  one  of  those  people 
 who  like  oh  like  my  goal  is  to  only
[06:44] watch  one  hour  of  youtuber  that  you  have 
 to  hate  that  for  me  personally  i 
 couldn't  do  the  wishy-washy  modern  day
[06:49] [ __ ]  of  like  you  know  trying  to 
 reduce  it  i  had  to  eliminate  this  i  tell 
 this  story  all  the  time  and  i  really
[06:54] hope  you  can  take  how  significant  it  is 
 for  me  i  had  to  literally  move  cities  i 
 had  to  break  up  with  my  girlfriend  to
[06:59] move  back  into  my  parents  house  so  that 
 i  didn't  do  these  bad  habits  because 
 that  was  literally  like  the  new  chapter
[07:04] of  my  life  i  had  literally  for  almost  an 
 entire  year  or  visualize  exactly  how  it 
 would  grow  that  i  would  move  back  and  i
[07:10] literally  saw  myself  like  running  around 
 my  town  here  and  like  use  like  doing 
 outdoor  workouts  meditating  journaling
[07:15] and  just  staying  away  from  the  screen 
 you  can  do  all  the  small  level  tactics 
 that  you  want  every  other  youtuber  is
[07:20] going to  tell  you  the  same  advice  get 
 one  of  the  youtube  blockers  and  you  can 
 install  the  google  chrome
[07:26] i'm  telling  you  right  now  that  every 
 person  who's  got  one  of  those  youtube 
 blockers  has  failed  their  goal  they 
 still  go  onto  youtube  that's  the  dumbass
[07:31] who  goes  to  the  party  and  says  oh  no 
 thanks  i'm  trying  to  quit  drinking 
 you're  a  coward  you're  a  [ __ ]  you're 
 not  gonna  make  progress  you're  not
[07:37] trying  to  quit  drinking  you  don't  drink 
 update  your  self-image  you  are  not 
 trying  to  reduce  youtube  you're  not
[07:42] trying  to  stop  smoking  or  anything  you 
 don't  smoke  you  don't  watch  youtube 
 anymore  whatever  your  goal  is  ingrain  it
[07:48] into  your  self-image  right  now  there  is 
 no  more  trying  there's  not  uh  you  know 
 this  year  my  new  years  like  we  make  fun
[07:54] of  people  who  make  new  year's 
 resolutions  yeah  most  of  us  on 
 self-improvement  are  the  exact  same  as 
 them  that  fat  42  year  old  karen  who
[08:00] wants  to  like  you  know  this  is  the  year 
 that  she's  gonna  get  into  shape  we  make 
 fun  of  her  we  always  like  heartlessly 
 make  fun  of  those  people  because  we  say
[08:05] oh  you  know  they're  gonna  go  to  the  gym 
 for  three  days  they're  gonna  quit  it's 
 the  exact  same  for  us  young  dumbasses 
 who  think  we're  so  great  because  you're
[08:10] going  about  it  in  the  coward  way  but 
 you're  not  trying  to  do  like  a  big 
 change  you're  not  trying  to  have  like  a
[08:15] level  of  accountability  to  tell  everyone 
 again  i  don't  drink  because  you  fear 
 that  you  will  fail  i  don't  play  video
[08:20] games  anymore  when  i  moved  back  home  i 
 made  videos  on  youtube  where  i  said  that 
 so  many  times  to  the  point  that  every
[08:25] single  time  i  got  like  a  bit  of  a 
 feeling  to  play  i  literally  got  like  a 
 sense  of  guilt  and  i  was  like  no  no
[08:30] because  like  my  50  subscribers  my  200 
 subscribers  will  find  out  and  i  wouldn't 
 be  able  to  like  truthfully  tell  them
[08:35] that  i  have  not  played  one  second  in 
 video  games  for  like  one  and  a  half 
 years  not  one  second  and  i'm  not  like 
 you  know  some  special  guy  who  like  was
[08:41] never  really  into  video  games  i  was  a 
 video  gamer  i  had  more  than  10  000  hours 
 in  like  the  big  games  that  i  used  to 
 play  runescape  minecraft  league  of
[08:47] legends  i  have  not  played  one  second  in 
 a  long  time  the  same  with  movies  i  have 
 not  watched  one  second  of  a  movie  with
[08:52] these  modern  addictions  you  can't  do 
 this  wishy-washy  [ __ ]  of  just  trying 
 to  like  you  know  just  trying  to  reduce
[08:57] it  it's  like  the  equivalent  of  that 
 dumbass  who  sounds  like  oh  i  don't  want 
 to  get  too  big  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  but  i 
 just  want  to  get  a little  bit  toned  you
[09:03] know  my  shoulders  still  shut  up  no  you 
 know  no  you  know  you're  literally  not 
 going  to  get  that  goal  then  because 
 you're  too  much  of  a  [ __ ]  coward  to
[09:08] set  a  good  goal  i  just  wanna  get  it  no 
 you  don't 
 go  if  you  set  your  goal  to  be  so  [ __ ] 
 just  trashed  just  so  unrewarding  i  just
[09:15] want  to  get  toned  shoulders  are  like  oh 
 i  just  want  to  reduce  my  my  we  didn't 
 take  us  shut  up  you  quit  weed  you  quit
[09:20] sugar  dumbass 
 how  do  you  take  back  control  of  your 
 life  i  remember  for  the  first  couple  of
[09:26] weeks  i  technically  would  have  failed  by 
 everyone  else's  standards  in  the  sense 
 that  i  would  spend  too  much  time  on
[09:31] youtube  so  i  said  you  know i  was  going 
 to  be  on  a  dopamine  detox  i  wasn't  going 
 to  do  the  bad  habits  but  i  still  spent 
 like  an  hour  a  night  on  youtube  and  i'm
[09:37] so  so  glad  that  i  had  this  positive 
 mindset  thinking  that  yeah  like  this  is 
 how  i'm  gonna  start  but  a  month  from  now
[09:43] it  would  be  less  than  an  hour  a  day  and 
 five  months  from  then  it  might  be  just  a 
 couple  hours  per  week  and  a  couple  of 
 months  more  from  then  it  might  be  like
[09:49] two  hours  a  week  you  have  to  have  like 
 that  level  of  positive  mindset  to  think 
 it's  kind  of  like  progressive  overload
[09:54] set  the  big  goal  the  big  intention 
 update  your  self-image  right  now  but 
 also  understand  that  you  won't  be  able 
 to  lift  that  heaviest  weight  you  won't
[10:00] be  able  to  completely  eliminate  all  your 
 addictions  your  intention  should  be  but 
 you  probably  won't  after  a  certain
[10:05] amount  of  time  you'll  find  yourself 
 lighting  up  the  [ __ ]  crack  pipe  again 
 you  find  yourself  browsing  the  hub  again 
 that's  okay  if  you  consider  that  as
[10:11] failure  and  you  said  oh  but  i  failed  my 
 goal  now  then  you're  a  little  that's 
 kind  of  like  going  to  the  gym  trying  to
[10:16] get  more  stronger  and  then  there's  one 
 time  when  you  fail  the  rep  you  fail  the 
 set  and  you  have  to  like  you  know  drag
[10:21] the  barbell  off  you  imagine  if  a  guy  did 
 that  he  failed  bench  press  and  he  was 
 like  oh  like  uh  i  failed  the  set  so  um
[10:26] guess  i  have  to  quit  weightlifting  now 
 that's  what  so  many  guys  do  on  nofap 
 that's  what  so  many  guys  do  when  they 
 set  some  kind  of  goal  is  to do  some
[10:31] bulky  little  nofap  challenge  90  day 
 challenge  or  something  that  doesn't  even 
 work  and  then  once  they  do  fail
[10:38] and  you  know  they  have  a  little  setback 
 they  just  quit  because  they  weren't  able 
 to  complete  the  original  goal  that  they
[10:43] set  them  this  is  not  a  [ __ ]  challenge 
 this  is  not  something  you  do  for  like  90 
 days  like  this  is  for  life  this  is  your
[10:48] new  identity  this  is  your  new  lifestyle
[10:53] do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it
