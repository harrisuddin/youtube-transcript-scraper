[00:00] 271  how  can  it  be  so  low  how  can  your 
 testosterone  levels  be  so  low  is  that
[00:06] really  what  you're  going  to  ask  yourself 
 whilst  you  dip  your  greasy  hands  in  that 
 packet  of  Doritos  they  must  have  made  a
[00:11] mistake  I'm  really  healthy  I  only  play 
 video  games  for  one  hour  a  day  and  uh
[00:16] Jeffrey  it's  more  like  six  and  I 
 exercise  all  the  time  you  have  two 
 workouts  tracked  on  the  strong  app  come
[00:21] on  Jeffrey  I'm  an  alpha  male  you  are 
 nothing 
 Adonis
[00:26] Adonis  is  also  receiving  his 
 testosterone  results  he  opens  the 
 message  and  his  number  flies  off  the
[00:32] screen  oh  yes  seven  billion  nanograms 
 per  deciliter  men  are  supposed  to  have
[00:37] high  levels  of  testosterone  coursing 
 through  their  veins  just  like  Adonis
[00:43] I  thought  this  video  with  some  words 
 from  Adonis  about  the  consequences  of 
 having  low  testosterone  low  testosterone
[00:49] will  destroy  you  as  a  man  for  it  makes  a 
 man  weak  docile  and  emotional  I  might  be
[00:54] releasing  some  merch  soon  I  was  going  to 
 release  like  a  bathrobe  and  stuff  don't 
 skip  this  section  because  this  is 
 relevant  to  the  video  and  so  you  know  I
[00:59] was  gonna  okay  yes  we  will  release  the 
 bathrobe  right  and  I  think  okay  let's 
 maybe  do  like  a  shirt  or  a  vest  and  my
[01:04] friend  Sam  makes  this  joke  that's 
 relevant  for  this  video  which  you're 
 probably  gonna  be  able  to  relate  to  even
[01:09] though  it's  going  to  piss  you  off  and  he 
 said  we  should  make  a  line  of  the 
 clothing  for  men  who  have  got  [ __ ]  tits
[01:14] and  actually  like  for  a  marketing  idea  I 
 think  that's  actually  a  good  idea  you 
 know  just  because  they'll  go  viral  like
[01:19] people  will  talk  about  it  oh  this  guy's 
 like  made  you  know  like  a  guy  no  T-shirt 
 or  something  but  it's  actually  such  a
[01:24] common  problem  that  did  you  know  about 
 50  or  57  of  young  men  have  got
[01:29] gynecomastia  I've  got  [ __ ]  titties  50 
 of  men  so  one  in  two  has  breasts  think
[01:35] about  how  [ __ ]  that  actually  is  that's 
 something  that  has  went  so  wrong  inside 
 of  us  that  men  have  started  to  develop
[01:42] like  women  wood  something  is  so  entirely 
 wrong  and  I  think  testosterone  is  just 
 one  of  those  things  I  think  the
[01:47] psychological  subversion  the 
 conditioning  that  we've  been  through  as 
 young  men  not  not  so  much  you  know  the
[01:52] Plastics  and  the  testosterone  but  the 
 message  that's  been  implanted  into  us  to 
 be  weak  and  docile  and  emotional  to  open
[01:57] up  about  our  feelings  because  that  seems 
 like  good  advice  doesn't  it  and  then 
 every  man  who  opens  up  to  his  girlfriend 
 eventually  says  yeah  like  she  won't  have
[02:03] sex  with  me  anymore  like  low 
 testosterone  is  just  one  of  the  issues 
 that  men  are  facing  there's  seven  things 
 that  we're  going  to  speak  about  today
[02:08] and  the  first  thing  that's  destroying 
 your  testosterone  levels  and  your 
 ability  to  feel  like  a  man  is  actually
[02:14] poor  mental  health  you  might  not  have 
 considered  that  you  might  have  thought 
 that  the  first  thing  I  was  going  to  say 
 is  that  you  need  to  [ __ ]  more  [ __ ]
[02:19] you  need  to  lift  more  weights  but 
 actually  most  guys  I  promise  you  this  is 
 the  truth  most  guys  would  get  the
[02:24] greatest  Roi  the  increase  of 
 testosterone  if  they  first  improve  their 
 mental  health  because  if  you  have 
 anxiety  or  paranoid  thoughts  if  you  feel
[02:31] unsafe  you  know  you've  went  through  some 
 [ __ ]  before  maybe  you  got  attacked  maybe 
 you  got  traumatized  and  now  you  don't 
 really  feel  safe  even  in  like  what
[02:37] should  be  a  safe  environment  you  know 
 what's  actually  going  on  like 
 scientifically  inside  of  your  body  your 
 fight  or  flight  system  is  activated
[02:43] cortisol  is  through  the  roof  and 
 cortisol  and  testosterone  work  in 
 opposites  when  cortisol  goes  up
[02:48] testosterone  goes  down  when  testosterone 
 goes  up  cortisone  goes  down  when  your 
 cortisol  is  going  up  because  you  keep 
 getting  thoughts  of  like  feelings  of
[02:54] unsafety  and  paranoid  and  stress  from 
 exams  and  maybe  you're  still  thinking 
 about  the  time  that  your  dad  beat  your 
 ass  or  that  kid  in  school  your  friend
[03:00] beat  your  ass  and  you're  thinking  about 
 this  more  and  more  and  more  every  time 
 that  you  get  like  a  negative  hostile
[03:05] thought  in  your  mind  causes  our  spiking 
 up  testosterone  going  down  and  what  if 
 you  got  depression  a  lack  of  enjoyment  a
[03:11] lack  of  pleasure  a  lack  of  color  to  your 
 life  you  feel  unable  to  go  to  it  and  do 
 even  the  basic  things  they  feel
[03:16] pointless  for  many  young  men  symptoms  of 
 depression  are  they  don't  even  brush 
 their  teeth  every  day  again  my  best
[03:21] friend  Sam  when  I  first  met  him  he  was 
 at  the  level  of  like  brushing  his  teeth 
 every  few  days  he's  obviously  changed
[03:26] now  he  lives  with  me  here  within  Dubai  a 
 lot  of  men  have  depression  and  if  you  do 
 have  it  you  can't  go  and  do  the  other
[03:31] things  that  we  need  to  recommend  if  I 
 tell  you  okay  you've  got  depression  I 
 tell  you  to  stop  drinking  alcohol  or
[03:36] stop  smoking  weed  or  you  know  whatever 
 your  vices  video  games  or  something  you 
 wouldn't  be  able  to  because  you're 
 depressed  we  need  to  fix  the  depression
[03:41] first  and  then  those  like  poor  habits  go 
 away  there  is  an  easy  way  for  you  to
[03:46] improve  your  mental  health  without  going 
 to  therapy  and  spending  thousands  of 
 dollars  in  therapy  not  without  going  to
[03:51] the  hospital  and  getting  ostrich  eyes 
 and  labeled  as  like  you  know  someone's 
 something's  wrong  with  you  without 
 needing  to  go  on  medications  without
[03:56] needing  to  spend  months  or  years  trying 
 to  change  things  and  it's  literally  just 
 follow  my  mental  health  guide  I  have
[04:01] made  a  full  mental  health  guide 
 completely  for  free  there's  nothing  to 
 sell  you  at  all  it  will  walk  you  step  by
[04:06] step  through  everything  that  you  need  to 
 do  if  you  put  your  100  trust  in  me 
 within  two  weeks  you  will  see  the
[04:11] greatest  improvements  to  your  mental 
 health  since  you  were  a  child  that 
 mental  health  guys  a  YouTube  video  is 
 linked  right  now  and  as  a  card  in  in  the
[04:17] description  I  promise  you  that  that 
 video  will  save  your  life  go  to  it  right 
 now  the  second  thing  [ __ ]  up  the 
 testosterone  levels  is  poor  sleep  and  I
[04:23] always  ask  this  question  maybe  you'll 
 know  by  now  how  many  hours  of  sleep  does 
 an  average  person  need  on  average  eight 
 hours  right  that's  what  we  always  hear
[04:29] right  if  you  want  eight  hours  of  sleep 
 and  you  need  to  wake  up  at  six  a.m  what 
 time  do  you  go  to  bed  most  people  will 
 do  the  math  and  say  okay  if  I  need  to
[04:35] wake  up  at  six  then  eight  hours  before 
 that  would  be  10  pm  so  10  pm  would  be  my 
 bedtime  most  people  would  say  that  right
[04:40] but  that's  not  how  it  works  most  people 
 don't  realize  this  maybe  you  didn't  but 
 there's  such  a  thing  called  Sleep 
 efficiency  and  that  is  how  efficient  you
[04:46] are  at  sleeping  at  the  time  that  you 
 were  in  bed  because  you  see  the  time 
 that  you  spend  in  bed  is  not  actually
[04:51] the  time  that  you  have  asleep  most 
 people  on  average  have  around  an  80  to 
 85  sleep  efficiency  that's  like  if
[04:57] that's  a  pretty  good  level  right  if 
 there's  like  nothing  psychologically 
 wrong  with  you  about  80  that  means  that 
 if  you  want  eight  hours  of  sleep  with  80
[05:04] efficiency  in  bed  that  means  you  need  to 
 be  in  bed  for  10  hours  so  if  you  want  to 
 wake  up  at  6am  and  get  eight  hours  of
[05:10] sleep  and  you  have  an  80  sleep 
 efficiency  you  need  to  go  to  bed  at  8  pm 
 and  that  is  if  you  have  an  80  sleep
[05:15] efficiency  if  you've  got  something  wrong 
 with  you  like  I  do  mine  is  down  to  like 
 71  so  if  I  leave  10  hours  for  bed  I'll
[05:22] on  average  sleep  seven  hours  most  people 
 will  never  even  consider  this  and 
 they'll  think  oh  yeah  well  you  know  if  I
[05:27] go  to  sleep  at  12  and  I  wake  up  at  six 
 that's  six  hours  no  it's  not  if  you  want 
 to  sleep  at  12  and  you  wake  up  at  six 
 you're  gonna  sleep  for  maybe  about  four
[05:32] and  a  half hours  you  need  to  start  to 
 prioritize  your  sleep  and  the  only  thing 
 you  can  do  bro  stop  being  a  Jeffrey  at
[05:37] night  time  when  it  gets  the  7  PM  8  PM 
 you  should  be  unwinded  now  fair  enough 
 if  it's  7  PM  or  8  pm  and  you've  got  like
[05:42] a  late  sport  colossal  League  class  or 
 something  okay  fair  enough  maybe  you're 
 going  to  be on  technology  maybe  you're 
 going  to  be  exhilarated  fine  but  when
[05:48] you're  in  the  home  at  8pm  9  pm  10  p.m 
 there  should  not  be  anything  in  front  of 
 you  you  shouldn't  be  watching  Andrew
[05:53] take  motivational  podcasts  you  shouldn't 
 be  watching  country  Tate  shorts  you 
 shouldn't  be  on  Tick  Tock  you  should  be 
 watching  porn  or  playing  video  games
[05:58] that  is  not  the  time  to  stimulate 
 yourself  so  many  guys  say  this  and  you 
 might  have  said  this  to  be  honest  and
[06:03] just  openly  admit  have  you  coped  like 
 this  because  a  lot  of  guys  say  at  the 
 end  of  a  hard  day  they  want  to  unwind  by
[06:08] watching  their  favorite  show  or  playing 
 some  video  games  they  just  want  to  rest 
 and  do  that  so  many  guys  have  said  that
[06:13] to  me  and  every  time  when  I  say  this 
 upcoming  sentence  they  realize  how  wrong 
 they  were  and  I  literally  just  say  to 
 them  do  you  really  think  that  your  brain
[06:19] is  resting  when  you  play  video  games  do 
 you  really  think  if  we  were  able  to  like 
 you  know  do  some  kind  of  scan  on  your
[06:24] brain  it  would  just  be  perfectly  still 
 when  you  play  games  honestly  and  then 
 straight  away  they're  like  oh  yeah  fair
[06:29] enough  again  video  games  TV  shows  all  of 
 that  [ __ ]  is  hyper  stimulating  it 
 doesn't  help  you  rest  it  does  the  exact
[06:35] opposite  this  is  why  like  for  most  guys 
 when  they  say  oh  I  just  can't  sleep 
 early  I  can't  go  to  sleep  at  10  pm  I  am
[06:41] 100  certain  up  until  proven  otherwise 
 that  the  reason  why  they  say  this  is 
 because  they're  literally  just
[06:46] stimulating  themselves  at  9pm  or  10  pm 
 and  saying  oh  well  I'm  not  I'm  not  oh 
 but  I'm  not  tired  I'm  not  sleepy  you've
[06:51] got  like  [ __ ] 
 blue  on  your  phone  right  now  like  oh  but 
 I'm  not  sleepy  I'll  go  to  bed  when  I'm 
 sleepy  no  you'll  be  sleepy  when  you  go
[06:57] off  your  computer  you'll  be  sleepy  when 
 you  literally  turn  off  this  [ __ ]  Bro  our 
 parents  were  right  all  this  time 
 honestly  my  mom  knew  this  [ __ ]  back  like
[07:03] before  there  was  ever  any  research  on 
 this  and  I  thought  that  she  was  being 
 silly  and  over  dramatic  and  now  I've
[07:08] become  like  my  mom  saying  like  to  young 
 guys  like  you're  better  than  playing 
 video  games  for  this  many  hours  because 
 the  thing  is  there's  some  guys  watching
[07:13] this  right  now  who  may  have  skipped  it 
 because  they're  Jeffries  and  they  don't 
 have  humility  but  there's  some  guys 
 maybe  if  you're  just  that  kind  of  guy
[07:18] who  you  don't  play  video  games  you're 
 not  a  Jeffrey  anymore  and  you're 
 thinking  like  oh  this  advice  is  for 
 someone  else  I'm  not  like  this  anymore 
 but  there's  probably  still  something
[07:23] that  you  can  improve  on  isn't  there  you 
 should  never  be  easy  on  yourself  you 
 should  literally  think  to  yourself  okay 
 there's  still  some  [ __ ]  that  I'm
[07:29] doing  at  like  8pm  they're  still  making 
 me  stimulated  because  bro  if  you  see  a 
 comment  or  a  message  from  someone  at  APM
[07:34] I  guarantee  your  brain  is  more 
 stimulated  for  the  next  half  an  hour  so 
 if  you're  seeing  it  at  9pm  just  before
[07:39] you're  about  to  get  ready  for  bed  and 
 some  prick  sends  you  a  message  which 
 like  you  know  triggers  you  emotionally 
 your  friend  says  like  oh  they  can't  come
[07:45] to  the  workout  tomorrow  or  someone 
 messages  you  have  you  done  the  thing 
 then  you  can't  sleep  and  you  want  to 
 know  the  beautiful  thing  about  sleeping
[07:50] when  you're  sleeping  that's  when  you 
 make  taking  testosterone  the  third 
 reason  why  your  testosterone  levels  are
[07:55] all  messed  up  you're  coming  too  much  bro 
 I  know  this  is  weird  and  I've  recently
[08:00] just  gotten  more  into  the  the  niche  of 
 like  speaking  about  ejaculation  and 
 semen  retention  and  nofap  I've  been  on
[08:05] this  ship  for  a  while  right  I  discovered 
 nofap  age  17  right  and  I  think  I  did  it
[08:10] better  than  everyone  else  any  other 
 YouTuber  you've  seen  there  no  fap  advice 
 is  worse  than  mine  I  know  for  a  fact  it 
 is  because  when  people  follow  my  advice
[08:16] they  don't  ever  go  back  to  porn  and 
 masturbation  when  people  follow  some 
 [ __ ]  YouTubers  advice  they
[08:21] constantly  commenting  oh  guys  I  only  got 
 a  day  through  when  you  follow  my  advice 
 your  life  changes  forever  in  terms  of  no 
 Fab  like  I  was  the  one  who  just  luckily
[08:27] honestly  I  was  just  lucky  I  just  cracked 
 the  code  of  nofap  when  I  was  like  18 
 years  old  and  I  just  realized  you  have 
 to  progressively  unload  instead  of  just
[08:34] cutting  it  out  completely  and  trying  to 
 get  to  day  90.  anyone  who  tells  you 
 they're  on  day  x  of  nofap  I  know  for  100
[08:39] certainty  they're  they're  actually  going 
 to  fail  if  you  know  what  day  you're  on 
 right  now  I  know  for  100  for  certainty
[08:44] that  you're  gonna  fail  you're  gonna 
 relapse  again  if  I  ask  some  guy  what  day 
 of  no  fap  are  you  on  and  he  just 
 Shrugged  in  my  like  I  don't  know  I  don't
[08:49] count  it  I  know  for  a  fact  he's  gonna  be 
 absolutely  fine  you  wanna  know  why 
 because  when  you're  counting  these  days 
 and  like  dropping  a  knife  and  like
[08:55] etching  it  into  your  wallet  I'm  almost 
 on  day  90  I  can  start  to  levitate  some 
 [ __ ]  you're  so  obsessed  with it  that 
 it's  still  part  of  your  identity  you're
[09:01] a  guy  who's  trying  to  quit  porn  and 
 masturbation  I  don't  want  to  insult  guys 
 but  bro  I  see  this  in  my  Discord  server
[09:06] we  have  a  massive  Discord  server  maybe 
 we've  joined  you  can  find  the  link  in 
 the  description  but  I  see  a  fair  amount
[09:11] of  guys  who  have  literally  got  their 
 nofap  day  in  their  Discord  name  oh  my  my 
 name's  Steve  and  I'm  on  day  73  and  I
[09:17] just  think  bro  you're  gonna  relapse  and 
 it's  actually  gonna  [ __ ]  you  up  because 
 of  how  much  you've  added  this  to  your
[09:22] identity  this  was  never  the  plan  was  it 
 when  we  discovered  the  [ __ ]  and  we 
 discovered  you  know  like  we  went  through
[09:27] Jeffrey  propaganda  when  we  grew  up 
 didn't  we  how  how  accessible  porn  was 
 remember  some  [ __ ]  teachers  and  like
[09:32] government  propaganda  told  us  that 
 masturbation  and  porn  was  healthy  do  you 
 ever  remember  that  propaganda  because  I 
 do  I  get  pissed  like  bro  it'll  be  it'll
[09:38] be  9pm  on  a  Tuesday  [ __ ]  December  or 
 something  and  I  literally  just  wake  up 
 and  think  hang  on  a  minute  I  literally
[09:44] vividly  remember  propaganda  where 
 sophisticated  clean  shirt  [ __ ] 
 teachers  on  posters  and  [ __ ]  who  told  us
[09:51] that  masturbation  would  have  been  good 
 for  who  told  us  how  to  masturbate  that 
 was  my  sex  ed  class  they  told  like  that
[09:56] pisses  me  off  right  but  having  said  that 
 if  you  are  currently  so  obsessed  with  no 
 Fabs  even  retention  that  is  literally
[10:01] your  Discord  name  is  like  how  many  days 
 you're  on  bro  it's  a  part  of  your 
 identity  or  a  guy  who's  trying  to  quit
[10:06] right  now  which  means  that  you  are  also 
 the  guy  who's  going  to  fail  don't  be  the 
 guy  who's  trying  to  quit  be  the  guy  who
[10:11] just  simply  doesn't  do  it  because 
 imagine  there's  two  people  right  and 
 let's  use  a  different  example  let's  say 
 that  they  both  smoke  so  there's  Jeffrey
[10:17] and  we  won't  say  Adonis  because  Adonis 
 obviously  doesn't  smoke  cigarettes  but 
 we'll  say  Jeffrey  and  then  there's 
 Jessica  and  Jessica's  on  her  way  to  be
[10:22] Anastasia  right  Jeffrey  and  Jessica  both 
 smoke  and  then  they  realize  that  they 
 want  to  stop  smoking  cigarettes  and  they
[10:27] just  want  to  go  clean  from  that  right 
 Jeffrey  goes  to  the  nofap  route  which 
 all  these  [ __ ]  YouTubers  will  tell 
 him  okay  if  you  want  to  get  to  day  90
[10:32] then  your  lungs  will  be  cured  until 
 Jeffrey's  okay  I  really  want  to  go  today 
 Jessica  does  more  of  like  a
[10:37] psychological  analysis  on  herself  and 
 realizes  you  know  what  I  don't  want  to 
 be  this  kind  of  person  anymore  I'm  not  a
[10:42] smoker  anymore  okay  they're  both  on 
 three  days  four  days  five  days  Jeffrey's 
 etching  it  into  his  wall  yes  come  on
[10:47] getting  closer  getting  closer  Jessica's 
 just  living  her  life  and  she's  becoming 
 more  and  more  like  Anastasia  suddenly
[10:52] let's  say  they  both  go  out  to  a  social 
 event  maybe  a  party  Jeffries  offered  a 
 cigarette  and  Jessica's  offered  a
[10:57] cigarette  what  do  you  think  Jeffrey  and 
 Jessica  say  Jeffrey  says  oh  no  no  thanks 
 I'm  trying  to  quit  but  his  friends  keep 
 on  offering  him  the  cigarette  and  they
[11:03] smoke  next  to  him  and  he  likes  the  smell 
 then  his  Cravings  go  through  the  roof 
 till  eventually
[11:09] Jeffrey's  back  to  smoking  again  he's 
 relapsed  but  what  about  Jessica  she 
 meets  some  new  people  there  and  they 
 tell  her  oh  you  want  to  smoke  and  she
[11:15] says  no  thanks  I  don't  smoke  they  don't 
 ask  her  again  and  she  doesn't  even  get 
 the  craving  because  she  doesn't  smoke 
 because  she  changed  who  she  was  not  just
[11:22] got  obsessed  with  the  act  of  quitting 
 because  if  you  get  obsessed  with  the  act 
 of  quitting  it's  still  a  part  of  your 
 identity  you're  not  over  it's  the  exact
[11:28] same  with  nofap  all  of  these  YouTubers 
 bro  I  promise  you  I've  watched  a  lot  of 
 YouTube  there  isn't  a  single  good  nofap
[11:33] YouTuber  out  there  right  now  I've  made 
 like  maybe  five  videos  on  nofap  which 
 are  better  than  their  entire  Channel 
 their  channels  when  I  just  see  the
[11:38] titles  and  I  just  think  like  you're 
 ruining  young  men's  mental  health  what 
 the  [ __ ]  are  you  doing  telling  people 
 about  like  oh  but  the  nofaps  benefit
[11:44] timeline  go  [ __ ]  yourself  it  pisses  me 
 off  every  time  I  have  to  speak  about 
 these  little  cretins  bro  they're  just
[11:49] weird  guys  who  sit  at  home  and  like 
 count  [ __ ]  etching  in  their  wall  and 
 stuff  man  yeah  they  might  be  trying  to
[11:54] help  guys  but  I  don't  think  they're 
 doing  it  in  a  good  way  I  think  they're 
 not  really  trying  to  help  they're  just 
 trying  to  make  videos  which  perform  well
[11:59] the  issue  with  ejaculating  too  much  is 
 that  you're  prolactin  spikes  the  [ __ ]  up 
 which  means  that  then  your  testosterone
[12:04] levels  go  down  so  just  like  cortisol  and 
 testosterone  the  same  thing  actually 
 happens  with  prolacting  and  test
[12:09] testosterone  because  you  know  the  post 
 not  Clarity  you  know  after  you  bust  them 
 out  whether  you've  masturbated  or  you've 
 had  sex  you  get  this  like  dip  this  like
[12:15] dip  in  your  energy  you  feel  lethargic 
 you  don't  you  know  you've  lost  all  of 
 your  horniness  for  like  at  least  20
[12:20] minutes  right  that  is  a  huge  spike  in 
 prolactin  and  prolactin  is  like  a 
 counter  to  testosterone  which  then  goes
[12:25] down  now  for  most  guys  this  issue  is 
 coming  from  porn  and  masturbation  but 
 actually  for  some  guys  who  think  that
[12:30] they're  Above  This  which  could  be  you 
 soon  they  actually  are  going  through 
 this  issue  even  in  sex  even  when  you 
 have  sex  and  you  ejaculate  them  that
[12:36] still  decreases  your  testosterone  that 
 still  makes  you  feel  lethargic  and  tired 
 honestly  you  might  think  like  sex  is 
 amazing  and  stuff  but  there  are  some
[12:41] consequences  to  this  and  any  guy  who 
 who's  [ __ ]  a  lot  knows  that  if  you 
 meet  a  girl  you  have  sex  like  four  times
[12:46] in  a  day  after  that  you're  like  you're 
 just  not  interested  in  women  for  like  at 
 least  hours  there's  a  lot  of  like
[12:51] bedroom  mistakes  that  young  men  are 
 making  and  there  isn't  a  lot  of  good 
 advice  for  this  there's  a  lot  of  Jeffrey
[12:56] propaganda  out  there  I've  made  a  private 
 video  for  that  which  is  in  the 
 description  three  bedroom  mistakes  to 
 watch  out  for  go  and  click  on  that  right
[13:02] now  the  fourth  thing  that's  destroying 
 your  testosterone  levels  is  a 
 sedimentary  lifestyle  it's  9  45  a.m  in
[13:08] about  15  minutes  I'm  gonna  go  get  ready 
 to  go  hit  an  upper  body  session  and  then 
 go  hit  an  MMA  one-to-one  class  with  the
[13:14] coach  they're  the  UFC  coach  so  I'm  gonna 
 go  exercise  for  about  two  and  a  half 
 hours  after  this  then  we'll  be  out  and
[13:19] about  going  to  buy  food  everything  going 
 to  like  The  Barbers  and  stuff  that's 
 pretty  good  but  that's  not  even  at  the
[13:24] level  that  we  should  be  exercising  it 
 depends  where  you're  at  because  a  lot  of 
 guys  are  in  that  total  Jeffrey  Zone 
 where  they  don't  even  go  and  do  anything
[13:30] but  you've  been  watching  my  videos  for  a 
 little  while  you've  already  considered 
 you  know  getting  into  the  gym  more 
 seriously  getting  more  fits  so  you're
[13:36] probably  someone  who's  a  big  step 
 further  than  the  hordes  of  Jeffries  in 
 the  world  aren't  you  but  having  said
[13:41] that  I  still  don't  actually  think  that's 
 enough  because  when  you  get  into  the  gym 
 and  you  do  resistance  training 
 weightlifting  calisthenics  you  start
[13:47] hearing  this  term  called  over  training 
 and  you  start  getting  scared  of  like 
 doing  too  much  and  you  want  to  minimize 
 it  and  everything  and  I  think  that's
[13:53] [ __ ]  Jeffrey  propaganda  honestly  I 
 don't  think  there  is  maybe  0.1  percent 
 maybe  less  of  the  population  actually
[13:58] over  train  I  think  it's  overblown  and  I 
 think  to  live  like  natural  Primal  humans
[14:03] with  maxed  out  levels  of  testosterone 
 they  were  over  training  by  like  the  fat 
 scientists  standards  of  today  this  fat
[14:10] scientists  fat  doctors  these  days 
 telling  you  that  you're  over  training  if 
 you  lift  weights  for  like  45  minutes  I 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  because  if  you  don't
[14:16] consider  the  scientific  [ __ ]  and  if  you 
 don't  track  with  like  Fitness  track  you 
 know  I've  got  the  aura  ring  right  but 
 I'm  even  starting  not  to  use  it  anymore
[14:21] because  I've  just  realized  like  it  just 
 invokes  weakness  in  you  if  you  want  to 
 be  like  David  Goggins  you  think  David 
 Goggins  are  sat  there  like  oh  what  if
[14:27] what  if  I'm  over  trading  how  many  sets 
 have  I  done  today  you  know  because  after 
 25  sets  the  recovery  is  shut  the  [ __ ]  no
[14:32] one  he's  not  thinking  that  you  think 
 that  any  of  these  like  [ __ ]  hard 
 disciplined  guys  attracting  their  sleep 
 thinking  like  oh  well  you  know  I've  only
[14:38] got  for  53  minutes  of  REM  sleep  I  should 
 probably  take  the  day  off  work  today  are 
 they  [ __ ]  is  Andrew  Tate  waking  up
[14:43] looking  at  his  [ __ ]  sleep  stats  and 
 saying  like  oh  well  I'll  just  have  an 
 easy  day  today  like  [ __ ]  that  bro  what
[14:48] I've  noticed  the  reason  why  I'm  not 
 wearing  my  uh  ring  today  my  auto  ring  I 
 only  wear  it  at  night  time  now  I  don't 
 wear  it  through  the  day  and  I  don't  even
[14:53] look  at  the  stats  anymore  because  it 
 invokes  weakness  in  you  so  the  sedentary 
 lifestyle  affects  two  different  kinds  of
[14:58] people  it  affects  the  total  Jeffries  who 
 just  don't  do  anything  but  it  also 
 affects  the  sort  of  guys  who  are  on
[15:03] self-improvement  but  we've  been  told 
 that  we  should  do  less  and  we  should 
 spend  more  day  just  you  know  just 
 sitting  around  and  relaxing  and  like  oh
[15:08] but  you  know  if  you're  your  rest  score 
 is  less  than  73  in  this  health  tracker 
 then  you  should  just  take  the  day  off  it 
 affects  People  Like  Us  who  are  on  our
[15:14] way  to  becoming  more  like  Adonis  more 
 like  these  alpha  males  but  those  guys 
 who  are  already  at  the  top  they  don't 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  this  like  oh  you  know
[15:20] maximum  17  sets  per  workout  otherwise 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  honestly  yeah  sure
[15:25] you  don't  want  to  injure  yourself  fine 
 absolutely  make  sure  you've  got  good 
 form  with  everything  you  do  you  don't 
 want  to  be  a  [ __ ]  and  go  lift  with
[15:30] some  [ __ ]  form  and  then  get  hurt 
 obviously  but  that's  not  what  we're 
 talking  about  I  think  a  human  can  work
[15:35] out  for  hours  every  single  day  no 
 problem  I  think  it's  a  modern  invention 
 to  say  that  you  should  exercise  for  less
[15:40] than  like  45  minutes  a  day  because  at 
 least  for  me  personally  you  want  to  know 
 my  own  like  particular  experience  when  I
[15:45] do  like  a  minimalistic  kind  of  workout 
 routine  bro  I'm  not  even  happy  I  become 
 like  a  the  shell  of  a  person  that  I'm
[15:50] supposed  to  be  I  am  supposed  to  be  like 
 a  man  like  David  Goggins  I'm  supposed  to 
 be  ultra  disciplined  I'm  supposed  to
[15:55] have  like  aching  [ __ ]  joints  and 
 going  to  work  out  anyway  because  when  I 
 do  that  I  am  on  top  of  the  world
[16:01] yesterday  bro  I  woke  up  the  day  that  the 
 morning  after  our  Meetup  so  we  just  did 
 a  meet  up  in  Dubai  I  spot  about  20  guys
[16:07] I  want  you  to  think  about  that  I  spared 
 about  about  20  guys  spot  about  20  guys 
 that's  deeply  [ __ ]  like  like
[16:13] intenseful  right  that's  that's  intense 
 you're  literally  fighting  guys  I'm 
 punching  kicking  grappling  and 
 everything  when  I  came  home  from  that
[16:19] meal  after  being  there  for  hours  on  my 
 feet  for  fighting  people  I  literally  was 
 so  sore  that  it  was  hurting  me  to  walk
[16:25] and  I  was  limping  I  woke  up  text  Sam 
 like  an  excuse  telling  him  like  oh  you 
 know  I'm  not  gonna  come  today  you  know
[16:31] I'm  over  training  and  [ __ ]  I'm  watching 
 the  David  Goggins  podcast  I'm 
 re-watching  the  one  with  uh  Joe  Rogan 
 the  first  one  and  just  hearing  this  guy
[16:36] talk  is  so  inspiring  that  I'm  like  man 
 [ __ ]  this  I'll  mess  it  up  bro  let's  go 
 do  David  gogan's  workout  man  so  it's
[16:41] like  the  previous  message  was  like  oh 
 bro  you  know  I'm  really  tired  let's  miss 
 it  the  next  message  oh  bro  let's  go  do 
 it  David  Goggins  work  come  on  let's  go
[16:46] do  500  pull-ups  bro  I  think  that's  the 
 better  way  to  live  if  you  want  to  know 
 more  about  my  personal  life  for  the  last
[16:52] years  I've  like  meticulously  tracked  my 
 sleep  and  all  this  [ __ ]  and  really  cared 
 about  like  you  know  health  and  stay
[16:57] underneath  like  you  know  I  don't  want  to 
 over  train  I  don't  want  to  stretch  my 
 body  and  I  just  think  back  to  the  times 
 where  I  was  living  like  this  Ultra
[17:03] disciplined  lifestyle  where  I  was  waking 
 up  not  even  thinking  a  bit  like  oh  you 
 know  like  if  I  woke  up  too  early  for 
 example  for  the  sake  of  discipline  you
[17:09] know  to  wake  up  at  five  or  half  four  to 
 go  outside  for  a  run  at  that  time  when  I 
 was  shredded  in  2020  and  I  was  like
[17:14] literally  exercising  for  like  four  hours 
 a  day  bro  that  was  the  happiest  time  of 
 my  life  honestly  and  I  wasn't  waking  up 
 thinking  like  oh  man  like  I  don't  know
[17:20] if  I  slept  enough  or  anything  I  still 
 had  fantastic  habits  so  we  need  to 
 follow  you  know  the  second  thing  we 
 spoke  about  we  don't  want  to  have  poor
[17:25] sleep  I  still  had  fantastic  habits  I  was 
 in  bed  at  like  half  eight  but  I  wasn't 
 ever  thinking  like  oh  man  let  me  track
[17:30] my  sleep  and  just  make  sure  because  if 
 I've  not  slept  enough  then  I'll  just 
 take  the  day  off  like  oh  I  was  getting 
 it  done  bro  and  when  you  see  pictures  of
[17:35] me  when  I  was  bald  in  2020  early  2021 
 bro  like  I  was  shredded  as  [ __ ]  I  was
[17:40] like  I'm  happy  with  that  man  honestly 
 maybe  I  was  over  training  in  some  [ __ ] 
 but  bro  [ __ ]  that  man  I  was  so  [ __ ]
[17:45] happy  with  my  life  I  felt  like  a  [ __ ] 
 man  back  then  so  you  need  to  figure  out 
 what  kind  of  said  it  said  in  Terry
[17:50] lifestyle  that  you  have  you  need  to 
 figure  out  if  you're  a  total  Geoffrey 
 who  doesn't  do  anything  you  need  to 
 increase  it  but  if  you  are  a  bit  more
[17:55] advanced  you  need  to  figure  out  what's 
 holding  you  back  because  our  [ __ ] 
 natural  Primal  caveman  ancestors  were
[18:01] not  thinking  about  over  training  or  any 
 [ __ ]  bro  they  were  getting  it  done 
 they  were  men  who  had  to  go  out  for  the 
 hunt  the  fifth  thing  that's  destroying
[18:07] many  men's  testosterone  levels  now 
 yourself  is  alcohol  and  a  party 
 environment  the  late  night  environment
[18:12] alcohol  itself  is  a  poison  substance 
 that  should  be  absolutely  limited  to
[18:17] maybe  just  maybe  the  smallest  amount  per 
 year  if  not  just  completely  cut  out  I 
 think  it's  better  if  you  completely  cut
[18:22] it  out  but  I  also  understand  some  people 
 want  to  drink  like  every  now  and  then 
 which  is  like  it's  acceptable  a  little 
 bit  if  you're  drinking  every  month  if
[18:28] you're  drinking  every  week  if  you're 
 drinking  multiple  times  a  week  hold  your 
 hand  up  right  now  and  say  that  you're  a 
 Jeffrey  there's  no  excuse  there's  no
[18:33] like  you  have  to  say  this  you  have  to 
 say  that  you're  a  chef  if  you're 
 drinking  more  than  once  a  week  even  if 
 you're  drinking  like  two  three  times  a
[18:39] month  you  have  to  hold  your  hand  up  and 
 say  Jeffrey  like  and  the  thing  is  some 
 [ __ ]  are going  to watch  ah  no 
 having  a  glass  of  wine  every  day  at
[18:44] dinner  is  not  being  me  just  shut  the 
 [ __ ]  up  bro  wine  is  the  biggest  [ __ ] 
 cope  that  I  see  of  these  people  all  the
[18:49] time  man  all  biggest  [ __ ]  cope  like 
 as  I  see  intellectual  people  always 
 saying  I  want  one  glass  of  wine  I  know
[18:54] sometimes  I  have  two  like  shut  up  just 
 shut  up  and  go  for  a  run  bro  what  the
[18:59] [ __ ]  what's  gonna  need  a  drinking 
 alcohol  when  it  does  nothing  bro  it's 
 like  it  tastes  like  [ __ ]  and  if  you  want 
 to  get  drunk  for  the  sake  of  being  drunk
[19:04] fair  enough  you  probably  got  some 
 problems  but  fair  enough  but  if  you  just 
 want  to  drink  for  all  your  a  lot  let's 
 go  let's  not  get  drunk  let's  just  go  for
[19:11] a  drink  Club  why  it  tastes  horrible  if 
 you're  not  gonna  get  the  sort  of  drunk 
 effects  from  it  then  what's  the  point  of
[19:16] it  it  tastes  like  [ __ ]  usually  it's 
 consumed  in  an  environment  where  you're 
 surrounded  by  total  [ __ ]  Jeffries
[19:21] like  the  great  old  British  pub  [ __ ] 
 weather  spoons  from  alcohol  has  been 
 proven  time  and  time  again  to  destroy
[19:28] not  only  your  testosterone  but  your 
 health  in  general  if  you  want  the 
 fastest  way  to  destroy  your  testosterone
[19:33] to  develop  man  boobs  to  gain  up  to  25 
 body  fat  to  look  like  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  to
[19:38] feel  like  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  go  start 
 drinking  consistently  simple  as  that 
 this  is  then  coupled  with  the
[19:43] environment  which  the  alcohol  is 
 consumed  in  the  party  environment  the 
 nighttime  environment  those  things  can 
 be  very  fun  honestly  those  things  can  be
[19:49] very  fun  and  I  think  maybe  it's  somewhat 
 valuable  for  a  lot  of  young  men  to  go 
 and  experience  that  stuff  if  you  have
[19:54] the  total  desire  to  you  know  like  really 
 want  to  go  and  see  what  like  a  party  is 
 like  and  stuff  yeah  go  ahead  if  you  like 
 really  enjoy  it  fair  enough  go  ahead
[20:00] maybe  go  maybe  just  don't  get  drunk  as 
 simple  as  that  but  like  maybe  it's  like 
 it's  hard  to  say  this  because  obviously 
 I've  experienced  all  this  myself  I  was
[20:06] like  a  total  [ __ ]  dumbass  student  on 
 drugs  drinking  all  the  time  for  years 
 and  years  so  for  me  to  tell  you  to  not
[20:12] try  those  things  it's  a  bit 
 contradictory  but  obviously  like  I  can 
 only  tell  you  not  to  try  those  things 
 because  I've  experienced  them  myself  so
[20:18] even  though  I'm  telling  you  to  do 
 something  that  I've  not  done  this  is  how 
 teaching  someone  to  avoid  your  mistakes
[20:23] Works  does  that  make  sense  because  when 
 I  speak  about  partying  that's  when  I  get 
 a  bunch  of  comments  from  Jeffries  who 
 said  oh  my  Hamza  like  I  party  all  the
[20:29] time  and  how  can  you  tell  us  not  to 
 party  because  you  used  about  it  do  you 
 realize  like  the  common  sense  of  the 
 concept  of  teaching  a  mistake  to  someone
[20:34] is  that  you  had  to  do  the  thing  that's 
 my  cool  response  to  comments  like  that 
 and  I  don't  know  if  I'm  wrong  but
[20:39] they're  wrong  but  this  is  common  sense 
 isn't  it  like  I  can  only  tell  you  to 
 avoid  a  mistake  that  I've  done  myself 
 and  it  shouldn't  be  like  oh  Hamza  you
[20:44] did  that  thing  well  well  yeah  that's  why 
 I'm  telling  you  not  to  do  it  bro  because 
 I  did  it  what  the  [ __ ]  you  want  about 
 like  oh  but  you  did  it  why  you  why  can't
[20:49] I  do  it  like  yeah  of  course  you  can  you 
 can  go  make  the  same  mistake  as  me  but 
 wise  men  learn  from  the  mistakes  of 
 others  if  you  then  think  about  this
[20:55] environment  the  party  nighttime  you  know 
 collabs  type  of  [ __ ]  environment  that 
 leads  to  the  second  point  with  Paul
[21:00] sleep  because  you're  staying  up  late 
 there's  no  way  that  you're  going  to  a 
 club  or  a  party  and  you're  leaving  at
[21:05] half  nine  to  get  back  into  bed  at  10  pm 
 are  you  of  course  not  right  so  you're 
 staying  up  right  you've  gone  to  a  party 
 you're  going  to  stay  up  late  and  that
[21:10] can  be  fine  every  now  and  then  it  can  be 
 fine  but  if  when  you're  like  a  proper 
 student  and  you've  actually  got  some
[21:15] Ambitions  and  you  want  to  build  some 
 muscle  you  want  to  look  good  you  want  to 
 have  high  testosterone  like  a  rock  hard 
 dick  bro  you  can't  be  staying  up  late
[21:20] three  four  five  times  a  week  staying  up 
 like  three  a.m  4  a.m  that's  the  [ __ ]  I 
 used  to  do  bro  literally  staying  up  till
[21:25] 3am  was  like  an  absolutely  normal  thing 
 and  sometimes  we'd  push  it  to  six  seven 
 you  know  sometimes  just  do  an  all  night
[21:31] and  not  even  sleep  and  everything  when 
 you're  20  years  old  you  don't  really 
 feel  like  you  know  you  don't  really  feel 
 the  consequences  and  you  know  why  you
[21:36] don't  it's  because  you  just  feel  like 
 [ __ ]  in  general  people  who  say  like  oh 
 you're  Invincible  when  you're  like
[21:41] you're  20  years  old  you  can  go  drinking 
 all  the  time  no  the  reason  why  you  feel 
 all  sickly  and  you  get  fresh  is  flu  and
[21:46] all  this  [ __ ]  it's  because  you're 
 literally  mildly  sick  literally 
 throughout  the  entire  year  it's  only 
 once  you  actually  start  to  eat  clean
[21:52] sleep  right  train  hard  you  start  to 
 realize  okay  this  is  what  like  I'm 
 supposed  to  feel  like  now  if  I  go  on  a
[21:57] night  out  and  drink  some  some  alcohol 
 I'll  feel  how  different  it  is  it's  not 
 because  I'm  25  and  you  know  at  22  I  was
[22:03] like  Invincible  like  three  year 
 different  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  obviously 
 it's  not  it's  just  because  I'm  more 
 aware  of  it  now  now  I'm  actually  living
[22:08] in  hell  healthy  life  now  I  can  feel  how 
 different  it  is  if  I  go  out  now  and 
 drink  I  feel  [ __ ]  and  this  is  the
[22:13] feeling  I  would  have  had  around  the 
 clock  around  the  year  instead  of  just 
 sporadically  the  sixth  thing  destroying
[22:18] testosterone  levels  which  is  a  really 
 big  one  is  the  modern  diet  not  just  that 
 you  know  it's  processed  and  it's 
 unnatural  just  that  it's  got  so  much
[22:24] [ __ ]  in  it  it's  got  so  much  sugar  sugar 
 directly  decreases  your  testosterone  I 
 don't  want  to go  totally  into  this
[22:29] because  I  made  a  full  I've  got  two  full 
 like  Diet  guides  I've  done  the  perfect 
 diet  and  I've  also  done  like  the  full
[22:35] diet  advice  that  could  change  lives  I 
 could  save  lives  both  filament  Linked  In 
 the  card  description  below  they're  very
[22:40] good  videos  in  my  opinion  I  really  do 
 think  that  like  I  conveyed  the  message 
 properly  those  videos  both  of  them  have 
 got  like  over  a  million  views  each  so
[22:46] obviously  that  says  something  so  just  go 
 and  have  a  look  at  those  videos  if  you 
 think  your  diet's  not  great  for 
 testosterone  for  health  go  and  have  a
[22:51] look  at  those  videos  the  seventh  thing 
 that's  destroying  testosterone  levels 
 people  are  simply  too  fat  for  about  70
[22:57] of  the  UK's  population  for  most  Western 
 countries  about  70  of  people  are  fat  not
[23:02] just  overweight  fat  30  of  people  in 
 Western  countries  are  obese  obese  means
[23:07] like  250  pounds  300  pounds  it's  almost 
 too  controversial  to  say  that  these  days 
 for  me  to  simply  just  even  saying  the
[23:13] word  fat  seems  quite  unacceptable  these 
 days  isn't  it  it's  not  very  PC  is  it 
 we've  got  a  state  hashtag  stay  woke  yeah
[23:20] stay  woke  with  your  limp  dick  that's 
 what  they  want  bro  but  yeah  70  of  people 
 fat  when  you're  fat  your  testosterone
[23:25] levels  dip  down  and  you  also  look  like 
 [ __ ]  and  you  also  feel  like  [ __ ]  you  get 
 no  [ __ ]  all  these  little  fat  guys
[23:30] well  but  I  still  get  a  bit  okay  yeah 
 sure  you  do  okay  when  your  body  fat 
 percentage  is  too  high  you  don't  even 
 feel  like  a  man  honestly  like  you  begin
[23:35] to  feel  like  effeminate  and  your 
 estrogen  kicks  up  your  testosterone  goes 
 down  like  literally  this  like  proven
[23:40] studies  to  show  the  higher  body  fat 
 percentage  you  are  the  lower  your 
 testosterone  will  go  down  at  the  same
[23:45] time  we  don't  want  to  be  ultra  Ultra 
 lean  but  the  reason  why  I'm  not  gonna 
 include  that  as  a  point  here  is  because
[23:50] that's  not  an  issue  for  literally  Mo 
 like  almost  any  person  to  be  too  lean 
 it's  like  a  bodybuilders  issue  like  if
[23:56] you're  a  full-on  steroid  taking 
 bodybuilder  going  for  a  competition  and 
 you're  gonna  cut  down  to  seven  percent 
 body  fat  yeah  your  testosterone  is  going
[24:02] to  go  down  but  pretty  much  you  and  I  are 
 never  gonna  get  to  seven  percent  body 
 part  if  you  think  that  you've  ever  been 
 there  you're  totally  mistaken  you
[24:08] haven't  not  you're  so  certain  you  know 
 if  there's  some  dick  head  watching  this 
 who  says  yeah  I've  been  at  six  minutes 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  no  you  know  like  unless
[24:13] you  were  a  professional  bodybuilder 
 going  into  a  show  and  stuff  fair  enough 
 if  you're  some  average  guy  yeah  who  goes 
 to  the  gym  and  you  know  cuts  down  and
[24:18] you  went  on  low  calories  you  were  at 
 like  10  body  fat  and  you  thought  it  was 
 like  six  literally  like  no  one  gets
[24:23] below  10  on  accident  it's  literally 
 impossible  you  have  to  like  fully 
 meticulously  track  every  grain  of  rice
[24:29] to  get  that  low  so  I  don't  think  low 
 body  fat  is  an  issue  for  most  people  I 
 think  too  high  body  fat  is  an  issue  and
[24:34] the  way  to  fix  that  the  previous  point 
 just  go  and  research  diet  General  this 
 pisses  me  off  right  you  know  all  the
[24:39] years  that  we  went  into  the  education 
 system  did  you  ever  get  told  about  diet 
 and  nutrition  did  you  ever  have  a  class
[24:44] or  not  through  high  school  we  got  told 
 so  much  [ __ ]  about  [ __ ]  osmosis  and
[24:49] the  propaganda  like  whitewashed  history 
 of  the  UK  where  they  only  show  like  the 
 UK  you  know  I'm  from  the  UK  like  they
[24:55] only  show  your  country  in  good  light  if 
 you're  American  they  do  this  as  well 
 like  you  do  realize  the  history  that  you 
 learned  in  your  schools  isn't  actually
[25:00] the  real  history  like  it's  actually  very 
 different  from  what  you  learned  you 
 realize  once  you  get  out  of  school  and
[25:05] you  actually  like  start  becoming  like  a 
 real  student  outside  of  school  you 
 realize  like  oh  the  [ __ ]  that  you 
 learned  in  terms  of  history  and
[25:10] geography  and  all  this  [ __ ]  it's  like 
 it's  all  just  propaganda  bro  it's 
 propaganda  to  make  you  weak  and  docile
[25:15] to  make  you  fit  into  the  perfect  little 
 brain  dead  employee  afterwards  and 
 that's  why  they'd  rather  keep  you  like
[25:20] unhealthy  and  fat  and  low  testosterone 
 because  otherwise  you'll  revital  against 
 the  system  but  I  don't  know  maybe  that's
[25:25] a  conspiracy  theory  but  who  knows  if  you 
 feel  offended  then  you  know  that  there's 
 gonna  be  some  truth  to  that  right  now 
 click  and  watch  this  video  right  now  do
[25:30] the  hard  work  especially  when  you  don't 
 feel  like  it  mwah
