[00:00] Jeffrey  indulges  in  the  six  main  habits 
 for  keeping  men  weak  and  now  just  look 
 at  his  life  he's  a  young  man  with  no
[00:07] energy  no  drive  no  male  aggression  he's 
 a  wimp  a  coward  a  [ __ ]  he  obsesses  over
[00:13] girls  that  don't  even  know  that  he 
 exists  they  never  even  message  him  back 
 zero  matches  per  day  on  Tinder  it's  a
[00:20] sad  reality  being  a  weak  man  Adonis 
 what  kind  of  man  do  you  think  Adonis  is
[00:26] weak  or  strong  neither  Adonis  is  the
[00:31] ultimate  man  but  he  isn't  lucky  he 
 wasn't  born  like  this  Adonis  developed 
 himself  as  a  young  man  through  doing  the
[00:37] right  good  habits  he  stayed  away  from 
 the  instant  gratification  activities 
 that  he  saw  other  young  men  indulging  in
[00:43] the  six  main  bad  habits  that  are  keeping 
 you  weak  and  if  you  watch  till  the  end 
 of  this  video  I'll  explain  to  you  a  way
[00:48] to  overcome  them  much  easier  than 
 everything  else  that  you've  tried  so  far 
 the  first  two  bad  habits  we're  going  to
[00:54] couple  together  and  they  are  social 
 media  and  porn  and  it's  [ __ ] 
 it's  interesting  that  I  can  couple  them
[00:59] two  together  isn't  it  because  it's 
 pretty  much  the  same  thing  social  media 
 is  literally  Soft  Core  Pawn  these  days
[01:04] if  you  go  onto  Instagram  you  see  us  if 
 you're  going  to  tick  tock  you  see  ass  if 
 you  go  on  to  YouTube  you  see  like  sexy
[01:09] [ __ ]  in  a  bathrobe  honestly  I 
 was  just  gonna  make  this  video  as  like 
 one  of  those  clickbait  in  like  a  shorter
[01:14] video  and  it's  gonna  get  lots  of views 
 and  like  you  know  Alpha  M  kind  of  video 
 the  top  seven  bad  habits  to  number  one
[01:19] uh  number  two  but  wait  first  a  moment 
 from  our  sponsor  that  the  Timeless  piece
[01:24] like  [ __ ]  I'm  just  gonna  make  a  basic 
 ass  video  to  get  some  [ __ ]  views  and 
 as  soon  as  I  said  like  social  media  is
[01:29] pretty  much  just  like  porn  I  just  felt 
 [ __ ]  sick  I  [ __ ]  hate  what  the 
 world  has  come  to  bro  honestly  I  [ __ ]
[01:35] hate  that  my  generation  of  men  are  so 
 consumed  by  like  this  modern  technology 
 that's  so  bad  for  them  and  it's  so
[01:40] [ __ ]  hard  to  pull  a  young  man  out  of 
 this  this  is  my  work  this  is  my  purpose 
 my  mission  gives  me  a  great  deal  of
[01:46] fulfillment  but  I  wish  it  wasn't  like 
 this  when  you  overindulge  in  social
[01:51] media  which  is  extremely  hard  not  to  do 
 like  these  platforms  have  been  made  to 
 be  addictive  they've  been  made  to  like
[01:56] put  you  in  a  trance-like  state  you  can't 
 even  remember  like  you  know  what  time  it
[02:01] is  how  long  you've  spent  you  think 
 you've  spent  like  five  minutes  watching 
 YouTube  shorts  and  an  hour  passes  by  the
[02:07] same  with  Tick  Tock  if  you  only  want  to 
 keep  it  to  that  very  practical  level 
 you're  losing  a  lot  of  time  to  social
[02:13] media  and  porn  but  I  think  it's  what  it 
 does  to  like  the  rest  of  your  life  your 
 perception  of  the  world  especially
[02:18] because  of  how  sexualized  social  media 
 is  important  in  itself  is  just  [ __ ]  I 
 said  once  I  gave  this  analogy  which  you
[02:24] might  be  interested  in  what  happens  when 
 you're  watching  porn  in  like  your 
 evolutionary  caveman  kind  of  brain
[02:30] because  our  brain  hasn't  evolved  you 
 know  Evolution  takes  millions  of  years 
 isn't  it  so  our  brain  hasn't  really 
 evolved  we've  only  had  modern  technology
[02:36] for  like  10  20  years  our  brain  hasn't 
 involved  for  this  so  what  does  our  brain 
 think  is  happening  when  we  are  watching
[02:41] porn  it  thinks  it's  real  of  course 
 there's  a  part  of  our  brain  you  know 
 like  the  most  advanced  part  of  our  brain
[02:46] which  of  course  understands  Yep  this  is 
 porn  and  you  know  I'm  actually  a  loser 
 I'm  actually  just  looking  into  a  screen 
 but  there  is  like  an  evolutionary  part
[02:51] of  our  brain  like  the  brainstem  you  know 
 the  oldest  part  of  our  brain  the  caveman 
 kind  of  brain  which  literally  thinks 
 it's  real  it  thinks  that  you  have  such  a
[02:58] variety  city  of  sexual  options  I  know 
 that's  going  to  be  offensive  that  part 
 of  your  brain  doesn't  realize  that  you 
 are  a  [ __ ]  loser  that  you  are  the  one
[03:04] looking  into  a  screen  so  this  part  of 
 your  brain  is  like  caveman  part  of  your 
 brain  thinks  that  you  are  a  winner  it
[03:10] thinks  that  these  women  have  submitted 
 to  you  they're  they're  sexual  that's  why 
 your  dick  gets  hard  and  when  you  bust 
 the  nut  it's  like  oh  wow  like  we've
[03:15] achieved  the  height  of  male  life  we  have 
 successfully  fulfilled  our  sexual
[03:20] strategy  as  men  which  is  you  know  to 
 spread  our  seed  to  like  many  many 
 different  women  if  you  achieve  that
[03:25] ultimate  goal  of  male  life  what  would  be 
 after  that  well  rest  recover  get  some
[03:31] like  high  fat  High  processed  foods  go  to 
 sleep  feel  lethargic  you  don't  need  to 
 work  you  don't  need  to  go  to  the  gym  you
[03:37] don't  need  to  like  work  out  be 
 productive  you  don't  need  those  things 
 because  you've  just  achieved  the  height 
 of  male  life  that's  what  happens  when
[03:42] you  watch  things  like  porn  and  you  go  on 
 social  media  a  part  of  your  brain  just 
 thinks  that  you  are  like  the  ultimate 
 [ __ ]  Legend  and  because  of  that  it
[03:48] strips  you  of  your  motivation  to  go  and 
 do  the  things  that  would  actually  build 
 you  up  to  be  the  kind  of  man  who  can
[03:53] attract  the  women  that  you  actually  want 
 the  third  habit  that  keeps  you  weak  is 
 video  games  and  this  is
[03:58] this  is  a  controversial  it's 
 controversial  to  literally  say  video 
 games  are  bad  because  all  these  nerds
[04:03] will  disagree  with  me  and  they'll  say  oh 
 but  actually  if  I  want  to  shut  the  [ __ ] 
 up  any  argument  that  you  have  against 
 this  the  video  games  actually  help  you
[04:09] to  be  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  they  actually 
 help  you  to  be  creative  shut  up  shut  the 
 [ __ ]  up  the  reason  why  video  games  are
[04:14] fun  is  because  you  are  getting  like  this 
 virtual  stimulation  of  the  real  thing 
 that  you  wanted  you  never  wanted  to
[04:20] [ __ ]  level  up  in  Call  of  Duty  you 
 never  cared  like  we  evolutionarily  don't 
 care  about  prestiging  in  a  [ __ ]  video
[04:26] game  we  care  about  climbing  up  the  ranks 
 of  men  around  us  we  care  about  obtaining 
 status  and  power  and  having  Brotherhood
[04:33] in  our  lives  and  video  games  manipulate 
 those  core  masculine  desires  that  we 
 have  and  make  you  invest  into  the  game
[04:39] instead  because  it's  so  much  easier 
 getting  that  status  that  level  up  in  the 
 virtual  world  where  there's  no  real 
 discomfort  than  there  is  to  actually  go
[04:45] outside  in  the  real  world  and  level  up 
 the  day  in  day  out  after  months  years  a
[04:50] decade  you've  invested  so  much  of  your 
 time  your  mental  energy  that  it  becomes 
 so  hard  to  take  a  step  back  because  now
[04:56] your  life  in  the  real  world  is  so  much 
 worse  unless  you're  a  [ __ ]  gamer  so 
 here  you  are  in  the  Video  Game  World  you
[05:01] are  a  warrior  a  dragon  slayer  Prestige 
 seven  and  you've  left  the  gold  Famas  gun 
 on  [ __ ]  Black  Ops  you  can  tell  how
[05:07] long  I've  not  played  video  games  for 
 like  the  last  Call  of  Duty  I  played  was 
 [ __ ]  Black  Ops  one  the  more  of  a 
 legend  you  are  in  the  virtual  world  the
[05:13] more  of  a  loser  you  are  in  the  real 
 world  the  fourth  habit  that  keeps  you 
 weak  and  I  promise  I  promise  that  you
[05:19] are  suffering  from  this  [ __ ]  up  sleep 
 a  poor  sleeping  pattern  you  thought  all 
 of  the  things  I  was  gonna  say  was  just
[05:24] gonna  be  like  oh  yeah  like  porn  and 
 video  games  bro  sleep  is  the  fundamental 
 thing  that  you  need  to  improve  on  that
[05:29] the  majority  of  young  men  need  to 
 improve  on  I  want  to  ask  you  a  question 
 I'm  gonna  see  how  smart  you  really  are
[05:34] how  many  hours  of  sleep  do  we  need  per 
 night  yeah  everyone  says  like  seven  to 
 eight  or  whatever  right  let's  say  eight 
 if  you  want  eight  hours  of  sleep  and  you
[05:40] need  to  wake  up  at  six  a.m  what  time  do 
 you  go  to  bed  answer  that  question  right
[05:45] now  answer  that  [ __ ]  question  right 
 now  everyone  will  say  10  pm  won't  they 
 one  of  the  truths  that  not  many  people
[05:50] ever  like  to  think  about  is  that  the 
 time  that  you  spend  in  bed  is  not  the
[05:55] same  as  the  hours  of  sleep  that  you  get 
 this  ring  is  very  expensive  it's  like
[06:00] 300  400  but  it  tracks  your  sleep 
 meticulously  and  when  you  track  your 
 sleep  with  a  device  like  this  you
[06:06] realize  that  there's  such  a  thing  called 
 Sleep  efficiency  and  sleep  efficiency  is 
 kind  of  like  the  percentage  of  time  that
[06:12] you  are  asleep  of  the  time  that  you're 
 actually  in  bed  and  a  good  sleep 
 efficiency  is  80  you  know  what  that
[06:19] means  if  you  want  eight  hours  of  sleep 
 like  what's  recommended  by  all  these 
 people  you  know  uh  if  you  want  higher
[06:25] testosterone  asleep  at  least  eight  hours 
 a  night  you  know  you've  always  heard 
 that  right  if  you  want  eight  hours  of 
 sleep  you  need  to  be  in  bed  for  10  hours
[06:31] if  you  need  to  wake  up  at  6am  you  need 
 to  go  to  bed  at  8pm  no  one  is  doing  that
[06:37] so  you  need  to  right  now  not  think  that 
 this  is  talking  about  someone  else  you 
 need  to  hold  your  hand  up  right  now  and
[06:42] say  [ __ ]  my  sleeping  pattern  could  use 
 some  improvements  I  will  do  it  right  now 
 my  sleeping  pattern  me  my  sleeping
[06:48] pattern  could  use  some  improvements  when 
 you  track  your  sleep  you  realize  just 
 how  shitty  sleep  you're  actually  getting
[06:53] even  though  it  kind  of  felt  okay  the 
 fifth  bad  habit  that's  keeping  you  weak
[06:58] is  a  poor  modern  Western  diets  fast  food 
 and  sugar  but  I'm  not  going  to  spend 
 much  time  on  this  because  it's  just
[07:03] common  [ __ ]  sense  if  you're  eating 
 [ __ ]  if  your  diet  isn't  great  and  you're 
 eating  quite  like  processed  you  know  it 
 is  right  A  lot  of  people  will  just  spend
[07:09] so  long  grilling  you  on  it  but  no  one 
 will  tell  you  what  is  literally  the  most 
 practical  specific  advice  that  you  can
[07:14] do  to  like  how  do  you  actually  start 
 eating  healthy  and  no  one  actually  gives 
 you  good  advice  on  that  you  know  people 
 tell  you  oh  well  eat  fruits  and
[07:19] vegetables  but  they  don't  tell  you  okay 
 how  can  a  guy  who's  normally  eating 
 three  to  four  unhealthy  meals  per  day
[07:24] how  can  he  actually  transform  that 
 realistically  in  a  way  that  he  literally 
 would  do  the  specific  advice  that  you
[07:29] can  Implement  is  literally  choose  one 
 meal  a  day  to  change  to  a  meal  that  is
[07:34] just  entirely  of  vegetables  specifically 
 potatoes  as  like  the  main  carb  sauce  and
[07:39] then  if  you  are  a  meat  eater  with  a  bit 
 of  meat  so  essentially  just  one  meal  per 
 day  have  salmon  chicken  whatever  you  can
[07:44] like  bake  in  the  oven  alongside  a  bunch 
 of  vegetables  like  potatoes  drizzled  in
[07:49] olive  oil  and  that  is  like  one  meal 
 that's  now  incredibly  healthy  it's  very 
 minimally  processed  compared  to  like  all 
 the  [ __ ]  that  you  get  from  like
[07:54] McDonald's  like  hyper  processed  foods 
 it's  easy  to  cook  and  it'll  even  taste 
 nice  if  you  bake  it  and  you  actually
[07:59] drizzle  it  with  olive  oil  and  olive  oil 
 is  very  healthy  as  well  finally  the  last 
 habit  that's  keeping  you  weak  is  a  lot
[08:04] less  like  practical  it's  more  bushy 
 washy  but  it's  maybe  one  of  the  most 
 important  and  it's  being  emotional
[08:10] you've  been  convinced  as  a  young  man 
 that  you  should  be  in  touch  with  your 
 emotions  that  you  should  show  your 
 emotions  you  should  be  in  touch  with
[08:16] your  feminine  side  that  makes  you  weak 
 if  you  want  to  be  weak  if  you  want  to 
 not  have  the  respect  of  the  people  in
[08:22] your  life  if  you  want  to  lose  the 
 attraction  of  women  in  your  life  you 
 should  follow  that  [ __ ]  advice
[08:27] that's  pushed  down  young  boys  throats 
 when  they're  in  school  be  emotional  it's 
 okay  to  be  weak  be  in  touch  with  your
[08:32] [ __ ]  off  be  in  touch  with  your  emotions 
 now  that  isn't  to  say  that  you  shouldn't 
 be  aware  of  them  meditation  is  amazing
[08:37] for  this  meditation  will  make  you  aware 
 of  your  emotions  with  more  of  a  distance 
 journaling  does  a  very  similar  thing  and
[08:42] just  being  away  from  technology  and 
 stimulation  and  just  spending  time  in 
 like  nature  will  allow  you  to  observe
[08:47] your  emotions  at  a  distance  that's  an 
 incredibly  powerful  skill  because  a  man 
 who  can't  do  that  is  [ __ ]  worthless  I
[08:53] will  say  this  again  a  man  who  cannot 
 control  his  emotions  is  worthless  and 
 now  yet  again  you're  like  dumbass
[08:59] [ __ ]  Jeffrey  brain  lack  of  humility 
 things  that  I'm  talking  about  someone 
 else  this  may  be  one  of  the  first  times
[09:04] that  you  actually  hear  the  cold  hard 
 truth  like  the  [ __ ]  that  you  don't 
 really  want  to  hear  but  you  needed  to 
 hear  you  are  probably  you  are  my  you  are
[09:11] likely  an  emotional  young  man  you  have 
 been  raised  conditioned  brainwashed  to
[09:16] be  emotional  that  makes  you  worthless  as 
 a  man  no  one  will  speak  to  you  in  this 
 way  because  everyone's  so  used  to
[09:21] sugarcoating  things  and  just  saying 
 we're  all  beautiful  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  if 
 you  cannot  control  your  emotions  as  a 
 man  you  are  worthless  you  must  look  into
[09:28] what  is  called  stoicism  it's  kind  of 
 like  a  philosophy  but  it's  more  so  a  way 
 of  living  stoicism  and  then  also  get
[09:35] into  those  practices  meditation 
 journaling  time  away  from  like 
 stimulating  content  you'll  never  stop
[09:41] having  emotions  remember  this  you  will 
 always  get  emotions  bro  I  really  don't 
 want  to  record  these  videos  today
[09:46] honestly  I  just  didn't  really  feel  like 
 it  it's  11  54  a.m  right  now  I  was
[09:51] supposed  to  start  at  10  and  I  literally 
 just  kept  on  pushing  it  off  pushing  it 
 off  feeling  like  a  little  [ __ ]  oh  you 
 know  I'll  do  it  later  maybe  I  should  go
[09:57] eat  first  because  muscle  protein 
 assistant  all  this  other  [ __ ]  I  was  like 
 Bro  [ __ ]  this  like  the  reason  why  I'm
[10:02] not  recording  right  now  is  simply 
 because  I  don't  feel  like  it  [ __ ]  what  I 
 feel  like  if  you  allow  your  emotions  to 
 dictate  your  actions  you  will  live  such
[10:09] a  pathetic  existence  as  a  man  no  one 
 will  respect  you  no  woman  will  be 
 attracted  to  you  you  must  create  a
[10:15] distance  between  yourself  and  your 
 emotions  now  that  means  that  you  will 
 feel  the  emotion  of  being  a  little  [ __ ]
[10:20] you  will  feel  the  emotion  of  stress  and 
 anger  guilt  shame  whatever  you  will  feel 
 these  emotions  but  you  do  not  allow  them
[10:26] to  control  you  and  in  fact  you  start  to 
 control  your  emotions  now  how  can  you
[10:32] reverse  these  bad  habits  because  you've 
 probably  tried  you've  probably  tried  to 
 you  know  like  quit  porn  and  go  on  to 
 semen  retention  and  no  fat  and  take  a
[10:38] detox  away  from  like  social  media  and 
 video  games  and  you  know  try  a  new  diet 
 you've  probably  tried  those  things  and 
 you've  probably  struggled  a  little  bit
[10:43] the  reason  why  is  because  all  of  the 
 habits  that  we've  just  spoke  about  are 
 not  actually  problems  they  are  symptoms
[10:49] all  of  these  things  are  symptoms  of  the 
 real  core  problem  the  plight  of  modern
[10:55] young  men  and  it  is  mental  health  your 
 problems  right  now  are  not  problems  they
[11:00] are  simply  just  a  symptom  of  your  poor 
 mental  health  I've  made  videos  on  Mental 
 Health  that  you  can  find  you  can  just
[11:05] search  like  Hamza  mental  health  onto 
 YouTube  or  click  on  my  channel  and 
 you'll  be  able  to  find  them  if  you 
 invest  your  time  instead  about  learning
[11:11] and  then  improving  your  mental  health 
 you'll  find  that  these  bad  habits 
 they'll  automatically  with  ease  start
[11:17] dropping  away  from  your  life  a  person 
 with  good  mental  health  does  not  jack 
 off  six  times  a  day  a  person  with  good
[11:22] mental  health  does  not  eat  [ __ ]  food  a 
 person  with  good  mental  health  has  good 
 sleep  focus  on  Mental  Health  First  and
[11:27] you'll  find  that  all  of  these  other 
 things  just  fix  themselves  click  on  this 
 video  to  learn  more  right  now  do  the 
 hard  work  especially  when  you  don't  feel
[11:32] like  it
