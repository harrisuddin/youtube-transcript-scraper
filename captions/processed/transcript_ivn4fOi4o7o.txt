[00:00] you've  been  making  really  good  progress 
 on  your  nofap
[00:05] but  your  jeffree  friend  keeps  making  fun 
 of  you 
 adonis
[00:10] however  congratulates  you  on  your 
 progress  towards  the  golden  point  of
[00:15] nofap  it's  not  as  easy  as  it  seems  not 
 at  all  yeah  so  now  you  know  why  i
[00:20] started  so  much  and  you  always  make  fun 
 of  me  i'm  still  going  to  piss  look  this 
 isn't  my  job
[00:25] this  is  all  you  have  to  do  bro 
 what  was  your  selfie  was  like  when  you 
 used  to  jack  off
[00:31] jesus 
 so  when  i  was  jacking  off  there  was  a
[00:36] massive  combination  of  geoffrey 
 activities  that  i  would  participate  in
[00:41] mainly  you  know  video  games  not  leaving 
 the  house  wasting  a  disgusting  amount  of
[00:48] time  on  [ __ ]  that  didn't  matter 
 generally  my  self-image  was  incredibly
[00:53] low  i  was  doing  that  since  the  age  of 
 like  15  to  about  21  to  22  years  old  with
[01:01] no  awareness  of  improvements  that  could 
 be  made  and  i've  only  just  recently
[01:06] started  to  actually  improve  that  mental 
 self-image  of  myself  because  it  was  so
[01:11] deeply  ingrained  in  me  that  i  was  this 
 weird  pale  bad  posture  addicted  to  video
[01:18] games  zero  social  skills  sort  of  this 
 weird  fellow 
 so  it's  taken  me  a  really  long  time  to
[01:24] actually  sort  of  break  out  that  still 
 very  much  so  a  work  in  progress  so  yeah 
 no  my  self  image  was  horrible  i  can
[01:30] relate  to  what  you're  saying  about  it 
 mixing  with  the  other  jeffrey  activities 
 because  like  you  don't  fap  in  a  vacuum
[01:36] by  itself  usually  if  you're  a  guy  who 
 faps  you  watch  porn  you  also  do  a  bunch 
 of  other  things  and  i'd  say  the  most
[01:41] common  one  is  staying  up  late  having  a 
 [ __ ]  up  nighttime  routine  morning 
 routine  for  me  i  never  used  to  stay  up
[01:46] actually  no  i  did  i  remember  like  i  just 
 got  a  flash  of  like  feeling  sweaty  as 
 [ __ ]  underneath  the  covers  just  like
[01:51] going  for  round  three  literally  waking 
 up  with  like  a  raw  dick  and  then  [ __ ] 
 my  bed  sheets  and  then  she's  just  like
[01:57] busting  all  over  [ __ ]  sake 
 i  bro  i  did  that  a  lot  i  remember 
 there's  multiple  times  i'd  wake  up  and
[02:03] literally  go  three  rounds  without 
 getting  out  of  bed  you  don't  realize  a 
 bit  much  of  a  problem  that  is  how
[02:09] just  practically  it  loses  a lot  of  time 
 i've  always  said  personally  because  as  a 
 guy  who  values  my  time  a  lot  i've  said
[02:15] one  of  the  worst  things  of  fapping  so 
 much  is  that  you  lose  time  but  i'm 
 realizing  today  with  the  title  of  this
[02:20] video  that  probably  the  worst 
 consequence  of  fapping  and  watching  porn
[02:25] is  what  it  does  to  your  self-image  and 
 probably  the  best  benefit  of  nofap  which 
 so  many  people  don't  really  talk  about
[02:30] because  a  lot  of  people  talk  about  these 
 shallow  improvements  which  is  like  oh 
 well  you  know  women  will  hold  eye 
 contact  with  you  and  all  this  but  it's
[02:35] the  self-image  it's  what  you  think  about 
 yourself  because  what  do  you  think  about 
 yourself  when  you  kind  of  deep  down  know
[02:41] you're  the  this  is  gonna  sound  crazy 
 like  you're  the  beta  male  who  has  to 
 [ __ ]  his  own  hand  instead  of  like  having
[02:46] a  woman  around  to  do  it  what  does  that 
 say  about  yourself  and  like  what 
 thoughts  attitudes  and  beliefs  will  you
[02:52] have  about  yourself  because  i've  said 
 previously  that  the  most  important  part 
 of  self-improvement  if  you  want  to
[02:57] improve  your  life  if  you  want  to  make 
 progress  the  most  important  part  is  like 
 those  internal  psychological  things  and
[03:03] i  know  this  seems  like  really 
 wishy-washy  but  i  promise  you  the  most 
 effective  way  of  improving  yourself  is
[03:08] all  mental  it's  all  about  how  you  see 
 yourself  and  you  see  yourself  as  a 
 [ __ ]  loser  when  you're  jacking  off 
 that's  why  when  you  get  onto  nofap  if
[03:14] you  do  nofap  the  right  way  which  i'll 
 briefly  explain  but  like  most  people 
 actually  like  with  all  the  videos  you've
[03:19] watched  on  nofap  they're  all  trash  most 
 videos  most  creators  online  who  talk 
 about  nofap  they  do  worse  for  you  than
[03:25] actually  help  you  because  they  make  you 
 obsess  over  it  and  then  your  self-image 
 instead  of  it  becoming  a  guy  who  checks
[03:31] off  it  becomes  that  of  a  guy  who  can't 
 stop  jacking  off  so  it's  as  bad  if  not
[03:36] even  worse  most  people  actually  worse  on 
 no  fap  than  they  are  like  just  jacking 
 off  normally  the  quick  way  just  i  don't
[03:42] want to  waste  your  time  so  the  quick  way 
 to  do  norfolk  properly  is  to  essentially 
 not  really  care  that  much  about  it  or
[03:48] not  even  keep  it  much  in  your  mind  and 
 when  you  do  relapse  which  is  absolutely
[03:53] normal  if  you  don't  beat  yourself  up  if 
 you  have  a  goal  in  mind  for  nofap  like
[03:58] you  want  to  get  to  x  days  you  want  to 
 get  to  90  days  or  30  days  or  three  days 
 or  nine  days  you're  doing  it  the  wrong
[04:03] way  and  i  really  i  know  that  you'll  want 
 to  keep  the  same  goal  but  i  really 
 really  if  you  could  just  take  any  advice
[04:08] from  me  abandon  all  goals  with  nofap  and 
 just  make  it  your  intention  to  jack  off
[04:13] less  with  this  mindset  that  you've  been 
 building  this  habit  of  jacking  off 
 watching  porn  for  years  since  you  were
[04:18] like  13.  and  so  it's  going  to  take 
 months  if  not  years  to  get  to  the  golden 
 point  of  nofap  which  is  where  you  just
[04:24] literally  it's  not  even  that  you  just 
 don't  jack  off  you  know  you  get  those 
 urges  and  stuff  it's  weird  like  you 
 don't  even  get  the  urge  to  jack  off  like
[04:30] you  still  get  horny  i  get  horny  as  [ __ ] 
 all  the  time  i've  really  i've  increased 
 my  testosterone
[04:35] it  does 
 and  it's  like  it's  disassociated  from 
 wanking  does  that  make  sense  it's  like 
 when  you're  a  normal  like  loser  guy  when
[04:41] you  get  an  urge  you  automatically  relate 
 horniness  to  watching  pawn  and  jacking
[04:47] off  the  best  part  of  nofap  is  to  get  to 
 the  point  where  like  fapping  isn't  even 
 in  your  mind  at  all  and  you  get  that  by
[04:53] not  obsessing  over  it  and  having  that 
 sort  of  like  loose  mind  where  you're 
 just  like  yep  since  i've  been  leveling 
 up  the  fapping  skill  for  [ __ ]  five
[04:59] ten  years  it's  gonna  take  me  like  two  to 
 five  years  to  get  to  the  point  where  i'm 
 not  jacking  off  at  all  anymore  have  that
[05:04] like  sort  of  like  stress-free  mindset  i 
 started  nofap  at  age  17  and  i  struggled
[05:09] every  the  exact  same  thing  of  like  day 
 two  i'd  relapse  and  then  you  know  i'm 
 trying  to  go  for  day  ten  and  then  day 
 three  i'd  relapse  then  then  i'd  jack  off
[05:15] four  times  in  one  day  because  you  know 
 i'm  already  on  day  zero  you  get  worse 
 when  you  count  the  days  you  shouldn't
[05:20] count  the  days  you  should  literally  just 
 have  like  the  overlying  intention  in 
 your  mind  for  this  next  few  years  of
[05:25] just  like  nope  i'm  not  a  fapper  anymore 
 and  really  that's  that's  what  we  should 
 talk  about  is  the  correct  self  image  and
[05:30] look  i  could  give  you  the  [ __ ]  click 
 bait  advice  that  you  want  we  could  be 
 sat  here  right  now  to  get  a  better  video
[05:35] to  perform  well  on  youtube  we  could  tell 
 you  the  exact  same  thing  that  all  these 
 other  [ __ ]  youtubers  do  which  is  like 
 oh  the  nofaps  benefit  timeline  i  know
[05:41] i'm  on  i'm  on  day  1000  and  this  is  the 
 benefits  of  day  night  shut  the  [ __ ]  up 
 anyone  get  more  testosterone  anyone
[05:47] who's  made  a  video  like  that  i  promise 
 you  right  now  that  they  are  [ __ ] 
 trash  i  promise  you  right  now  that  your
[05:52] mental  health  has  gotten  worse  by 
 watching  videos  like  oh  but  at  day  seven 
 i'll  i'll  get  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  shut  the
[05:58] [ __ ]  up  do  you  know  how  heartless  this 
 advice  is  i  said  this  to  chris 
 williamson  he  does  the  modern  wisdom
[06:03] podcast  so  i  was  a  guest  on  there  and  i 
 said  i  said  it  to  him  really  opened  my 
 eyes  imagine  telling  an  obese  guy  who's
[06:08] addicted  to  junk  food  imagine  telling 
 him  of  all  of  the  life-changing  benefits
[06:13] he  will  get  from  going  to  the  gym  hyping 
 him  up  for  it  and  then  telling  him  that 
 if  he  misses  one  day  all  of  those
[06:18] benefits  will  disappear 
 how  [ __ ]  heartless  is  that  that  these 
 youtubers  tell  you  this  [ __ ]  it  doesn't
[06:23] work  on  a  [ __ ]  streak  your  body 
 doesn't  think  like  oh  he's  on  day  90 
 guys  pumping  full  of  tests  oh  no  oh  no
[06:29] he  fapped  once  like  oh  back  to  days  your 
 body  isn't  thinking  that  about  yourself 
 it's  more  how  many  times  have  you  jacked
[06:35] off  in  the  last  three  to  six  months 
 decrease  that  number  by  saying  right  now 
 okay  oh  day  90  okay  i'm  gonna  go  for  day
[06:42] 90.  it  shows  that  you've  got  this  like 
 [ __ ]  up  perception  of  like  success  and 
 if  you  can  relate  to  the  other  [ __ ]  i'm
[06:47] saying  which  is  like  oh  you  go  for  day 
 90  go  for  streaks  i  guarantee  correct  me 
 from  wrong  i  don't  know  this  is  going  to
[06:52] sound  like  an  insult  i  guarantee  you 
 have  less  than  2  000  pounds  in  your  bank 
 account  guarantee  you're  broke  i 
 guarantee  you're  unsuccessful  and  i  know
[06:58] that  hurts  but  the  reason  why  nofap  and 
 success  is  linked  together  is  because 
 when  you  actually  don't  jack  off  as  much
[07:03] you  kind  of  understand  the  process 
 behind  it  which  is  to  like  stop  thinking 
 about  these  stupid  details  i'm  like  oh
[07:09] let  me  do  nine  days  in  a  row  let  me  do 
 this  you  look  at  it  this  overlying 
 mindset  which  is  just  like  yep  i'm  no
[07:15] longer  fap  you  start  taking  control  of 
 your  [ __ ]  self-image  and  that's  how 
 you  reach  any  level  of  success  with  any
[07:20] goal  yeah  so  hamza  mentions  obsessing 
 over  nofap  the  easiest  way  to  stop
[07:25] obsessing  over  nofap  is  to  get  [ __ ] 
 busy  guys  start  thinking  about  things
[07:30] which  will  actually  have  a  much  higher 
 roi  such  as  the  four  pillars  of
[07:35] self-improvement  which  are  reading 
 exercise  gratitude 
 meditation  and  meditation
[07:42] those  things  obsessing  over  those  things 
 are  going  to  give  you  an  incredibly  high 
 return  on  investment  and  it's  also  not
[07:48] coming  with  this  weird  defeatist  binary 
 thinking  of  like  oh  if  i  don't  meditate
[07:53] for  one  day  then  all  of  my  progress  on 
 meditation  is  just  demolished  destroyed
[07:59] it's  worthless  i  have  to  meditate  every 
 single  day  for  the rest  of my  life 
 otherwise  i  will  go  back  to  this
[08:04] horrible  state  of  no  mental  clarity  it 
 doesn't  work  like  that  that  mindset  that
[08:09] binary  thinking  isn't  going  to  get  you 
 anywhere  apart  from  feeling 
 very  depressed  and  miserable  and  have  a
[08:15] very  low  self-esteem  because  the  fact  is 
 you're  jacking  off  ten  times  a  week  for
[08:20] example  okay  if  you  manage  to  jack  off 
 eight  times  a  week  instead  that  is 
 progress  but  these  like  no  fap  streak
[08:27] andes  are  going  to  like  sort  of  implant 
 this  thought  in  your  brain  of  just  like 
 if  you  jack  off  even  once  then  all  of
[08:33] your  progress  is  just  demolished  and  it 
 is  absolutely  ridiculous  it  doesn't  work
[08:38] like  that  it's  just  very 
 marketable  to  young  people  who  want  the
[08:43] fix  all  answer  just  like  if  you  don't 
 touch  your  dick  for  x  amount  of  time  you 
 will  be  gigger  chad  you  will  be  adonis
[08:48] it  doesn't  work  like  that  guys  the 
 reality  is  these  things  take  a  lot  of
[08:53] work  and  a  lot  of  discipline  in  many 
 different  areas  of  self-development 
 there  is  no  if  you  don't  touch  your  dick
[08:59] for  x  amount  of  days  you  will  become 
 adonis  it  doesn't  work  like  that  guys 
 it's  just  marketable  and  these  youtubers
[09:05] are  selling  you  [ __ ]  complete 
 [ __ ]  yeah  100  on  nofap  and  also  just
[09:10] living  the  normal  life  of  jacking  off 
 your  self-image  is  going  to  be  decreased
[09:15] and  that's  completely  unacceptable  it's 
 one  of  the  worst  things  that  can  ever 
 happen  to  you  what  you  need  to  do  is  get 
 on  to  the  part  of  know  like  the  kind  of
[09:22] nofap  which  increases  your  self-image  so 
 i  want  to  take  you  almost  through  like  a 
 visualization  like  a  practice  like  an
[09:27] affirmation  exercise  right  now  maybe 
 just  close  your  eyes  just  see  yourself 
 and  do  no  longer  see  yourself  as  the  guy
[09:34] who  jacks  off  no  longer  even  see 
 yourself  as  the  guy  who's  on  nofap
[09:41] just  see  yourself  as  the  guy  who  simply 
 doesn't  fap  does  that  make  sense  you 
 need  to  start  like  this  is  the  best
[09:47] advice  i  could  give  you  for  nofap  and 
 trust  me  when  i  say  like  i'm  a  youtuber 
 and  i  could  make  so  many  videos  about
[09:52] getting  so  many  views  and  like  these 
 videos  get  a  [ __ ]  lot  of  views  when 
 you  make  a  video  on  nofap  that's  why  all
[09:57] these  [ __ ]  dumbass  creators  make  them 
 and  they  make  videos  that  [ __ ]  up  your 
 mental  health  and  you  know  which  ones 
 i'm  talking  about  even  though  they're
[10:02] like  they're  like  to  my  community  and 
 [ __ ]  and  they  don't  know  what  the  [ __ ] 
 they're  talking  about  but  what  you  need
[10:07] to  do  is  to  start  seeing  yourself  not  as 
 the  man  who  is  on  nofap  but  as  the  guy
[10:12] who  simply  doesn't  jack  off  i'm  not  on 
 nofap  i've  checked  off  maybe  once  in 
 like  [ __ ]  three  years  i'm  not  on
[10:18] nofap  i  just  don't  jack  off  there's  a 
 difference  because  when  you're  on  nofap 
 you're  a  [ __ ]  loser  this  is  like  the
[10:23] difference  between  a  guy  saying  to  you 
 oh  i'm  trying  to  quit  alcohol  you're  a 
 little  [ __ ]  visualize  your  standard
[10:29] sort  of  person  just  like  a  really 
 standard  dude  right  and  then  go  up  to
[10:34] him  and  say  like  oh  yeah  i'm  actually  on 
 nofap  guys  i'm  on  day  x  or  y  and  then 
 visualize  the  sort  of  response  that
[10:40] would  elicit  you  would  look  like  a 
 [ __ ]  weirdo  and  the  truth  is  it's 
 pretty  [ __ ]  weird  guys  to  obsess  over
[10:46] not  touching  your  dick  it's  not  a  good 
 luck  it's  just  strange  nah  i  disagree 
 because  although  that's  true  we
[10:52] shouldn't  be  basing  the  things  we  do 
 based  on  like  how  normal  people  would 
 react  because  a  lot  of  the  [ __ ]  we  do
[10:57] would  be  perceived  as  strange  anyway 
 that  is  trim  yeah  i'd  say  more  it's  how 
 you  perceive  it  and  how  it  affects  your
[11:03] own  psychology  so  as  i  was  saying  it's 
 before  sam  [ __ ]  brutally  interrupted
[11:09] what  you  need  to  do  is  see  yourself  as 
 the  guy  who  simply  just  doesn't  jack  off 
 and  watch  porn  anymore  you're  not  on
[11:14] nofap  you're  not  trying  not  to  you  just 
 simply  don't  see  yourself  as  that  guy 
 write  down  yep  i  don't  watch  porn  i
[11:20] don't  jack  off  it's  just  not  something  i 
 do  i  feel  horniness  i  feel  like  the  urge 
 is  the  desire  for  sex  and  intimacy  and  i
[11:26] feel  those  urges  they  are  disassociated 
 away  from  [ __ ]  wanking  my  meat  like  a
[11:31] monkey 
 it's  the  difference  between  a  guy  coming
[11:36] up  to  you  and  saying  oh  well  i'm  trying 
 to  quit  drinking  that's  the  guy  on  nofap 
 compared  to  the  guy  who  just  says  i
[11:42] don't  drink  which  one  of  those  is 
 definitely  not  going  to  drink  in  this 
 party  well  the  guy  who  said  i  don't
[11:47] drink  because  the  guy  who  says  well  i'm 
 trying  not  to  drink  everyone's  going  to 
 be  oh  god  yeah  get  it  down  your  son  and
[11:52] it's  the  same  for  you  if  you're  saying 
 oh  well  i'm  on  don't  no  fap  day  63  the 
 thing  is  right  i  have  full  confidence
[11:57] that  you  are  going  to  fail  you  tell  me 
 you're  on  nofap  i  have  full  confidence 
 you're  going  to  fap  again  you  tell  me 
 you're  on  day  x  i  have  full  confidence
[12:03] that  you're  going  to  relapse  you  tell  me 
 you  don't  watch  porn  and  that  you  don't 
 masturbate  you  probably  won't  for  the
[12:09] next  year  multiple  years  you  need  to 
 have  this  self-image  of  the  upgraded 
 version  of  yourself  in  your  mind  at  all
[12:15] times  because  too  many  young  men  are 
 living  with  this  pathetic  self-image  of 
 like  uh  oh  fapping  is  a  problem  for  me
[12:20] and  i'm  really  trying  to  prove  it  like 
 why  the  [ __ ]  would  you  like  would  you 
 place  limitations  on  your  own  self 
 belief  about  yourself  i  hope  this  is
[12:25] like  making  sense  it  might  not  do 
 because  if  i  was  watching  this  when  i 
 was  17  years  old  and  and  ohanka  i
[12:31] wouldn't  have  understood  it  personally  i 
 would  have  thought  okay  this  is  wishy 
 washy  just  tell  me  which  which  pawn 
 blocker  to  download  onto  my  phone  or
[12:37] some  [ __ ]  you  want  the  easy  answer  and 
 you  want  these  like  clickbait  videos  of 
 these  dumbass  youtubers  talking  about  90
[12:42] day  benefits  timeline  i  [ __ ]  hate 
 them  so  much  bro  there's  one  kind  of 
 youtuber  i  hate  the  most  it's  the  nofap
[12:47] ones  day  1000  updates  [ __ ]  you  uh  the 
 better  [ __ ]  you  they  don't  realize  what
[12:52] they're  doing  to  your  mind  and  and  you 
 watching  this  right  now  you  are 
 suffering  from  this  [ __ ]  that  these  guys
[12:57] have  done  to  you  by  by  putting  you  on  to 
 like  this  sort  of  like  fixated  of  this 
 obsessive  belief  about  getting  to  day
[13:03] 90.  i'm  telling  you  right  now  that  guy 
 that  you're  looking  up  to  the  [ __ ] 
 chad  that  you're  thinking  oh  you  know  i 
 want  to  be  more  like  him  i'm  telling  you
[13:08] right  now  he's  not  on  [ __ ]  day  90. 
 you  need  to  take  this  like  this  weird 
 obsession  away  from  streaks  from  nofap
[13:15] from  semen  retention  and  just  live  your 
 life  as  if  you're  a  guy  who's  just 
 totally  ingrained  it  that  is  how  you  get
[13:20] to  the  best  part  of  nofap  that  is  how 
 you  improve  your  self-image  it's 
 important  to  say  this  but  at  the  same
[13:25] time  we  do  need  to  also  speak  about  the 
 self-image  you  have  when  you're  just  a 
 normal  guy  and  you're  watching  porn  and 
 like  you  feel  okay  with  that  it's  like
[13:31] it  does  seem  cringe  to  talk  about  like 
 alpha  male  and  beta  male  but  if  there's 
 any  action  of  the  alpha  and  any  action
[13:37] which  symbolizes  the  beta  it  is  that  the 
 alpha  is  the  one  sleeping  like  having 
 sex  and  the  beta  is  the  one  masturbating
[13:44] you  can  say  it's  hard  to  cringe  to  talk 
 about  this  but  it  is  the  truth  if  you 
 really  thought  about  it  right  now  what 
 is  like  the  one  action  that  symbolizes
[13:50] an  alpha  male  it  is  having  sex  with  the 
 woman  or  you  know  the  female  primates  or 
 some  [ __ ]  in  like  some  some  animal
[13:56] kingdom  and  the  baiters  jack  off  it's 
 not  good  for  your  mental  health  for  your 
 self-image  to  say  like  oh  well  you  know
[14:02] it's  okay  to  like  just  wank  every  now 
 and  then  you  can  live  life  not  jacking 
 off  a  lot  of  guys  don't  actually
[14:07] understand  this  and  it  really  comes  from 
 like  a  long-term  disassociation  from  the 
 horniness  that  arises  as  you're  a  normal
[14:14] man  and  disassociating  detaching  that 
 from  the  desire  to  jack  off  does  that
[14:19] make  sense  so  most  guys  get  that  feeling 
 that  okay  i'm  horny  my  dick  is  hard  and 
 they  automatically  think  that  means  that
[14:24] they  have  to  jack  off  you  need  to  detach 
 that  relationship  so  again  i  get  horny
[14:29] all  the  time  my  dick  gets  hard  all  the 
 time  but  i  just  don't  really  do  anything 
 with  it  maybe  i'll  go  have  sex  with  a
[14:34] woman  when  i'm  not  gonna  have  sex  it's 
 like  it's  there  and  i'm  just  kind  of 
 enjoying  the  thing  of  like  yup  like  my 
 dick's  hard  and  i'm  honey  boom  it
[14:39] doesn't  mean  oh  i'm  horny  so  i  should  go 
 jack  off  you  need  to  detach  that  and 
 you've  got  this  like  it's  a  habit  you've
[14:44] got  you've  built  this  habit  for  for  what 
 years  the  average  guy  starts  checking 
 off  like  13  years  old  yeah  i  was  gonna
[14:50] ask  you  hamsa  why  were  we  told  that 
 jacking  off  is  like  normal  and  okay  and 
 it's  somewhat  like  weirdly  encouraged  to
[14:57] like  you  know  oh  it's  not  it's  healthy 
 like  why  why  was  that  it's  the  same  as
[15:02] like  every  week  jeffrey  activity  being 
 encouraged  to  young  men  these  days  maybe 
 the  conspiracy  theories  like  the  society
[15:08] wants  like  weaker  men  that  can't  create 
 like  a  revolution  or  quite  frankly  it's 
 just  like  the  weaker  all  the  people  who
[15:14] just  are  coping  so  hard  that  they  want 
 other  men  other  people  to  follow  in 
 their  footsteps  literally  crabs  yeah
[15:19] [ __ ]  crabs  yeah  most  most  people 
 especially  older  like  40  40  year  old 
 people  their  ignorance  and  their  crabs
[15:25] this  is  no  disrespect  to  some  like 
 successful  like  educated  40  year  old  but 
 the  truth  is  you  want  to  know  the
[15:30] [ __ ]  raw  truth  your  teachers  are 
 unsuccessful  broke  and  uneducated  your 
 parents  are  probably  unsuccessful  broke
[15:36] and  uneducated  it's  the  [ __ ]  truth 
 it's  a  hard  to  swallow  pill  but  when  you
[15:41] look  at  like  research  and  data  and  you 
 read  books  and  then  you  just  see  how 
 wrong  all  of  like  the  adults  were  when
[15:47] we  were  growing  up  and  they  told  us  like 
 all  this  like  this  [ __ ]  you  can't 
 take  advice  from  people  who  are  fine
[15:53] living  in  mediocrity  i  hope  this  helps 
 you  and  i  sincerely  hope  you  can  find 
 ways  to  improve  your  self-image  and
[15:59] detach  away  from  like  the  nofap  identity 
 that's  like  you  know  that's  part  of  your 
 your  self-image  because  you'll  do  so
[16:05] much  better  you'll  get  to  higher  streaks 
 if  you  don't  think  about  streets  do  the 
 hard  work  especially  when  you  don't  feel
[16:11] like  it's
