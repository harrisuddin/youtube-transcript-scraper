[00:00] Jeffrey  looks  into  his  dirty  mirror  and 
 he  is  disgusted  with  his  body  how  do  I 
 get  rid  of  this  he  says  while  he  grabs
[00:06] onto  his  lower  belly  fat  but  Jeffrey 
 you've  only  been  going  to  the  gym  for  a 
 couple  of  weeks  have  patience
[00:13] Adonis  has  the  physique  of  a  Greek  God 
 these  results  didn't  arrive  in  a  week  or
[00:19] a  month  or  even  a  year  Adonis  has  been 
 working  hard  in  the  gym  for  decades  in
[00:24] fact  when  Adonis  was  in  the  womb  he  was 
 bench  pressing  this  is  how  he  has  built 
 the  perfect  male  physique  picture  this
[00:30] I'm  a  16  year  old  skinny  fat  Brown  kid 
 and  I've  just  really  really  really  gone
[00:36] horny  I'm  in  high  school  and  totally 
 noticing  the  girls  around  me  and  I  want 
 to  actually  start  to  date  but  I  look
[00:41] into  the  mirror  and  I  don't  feel 
 attracted  particularly  because  I  had 
 grown  up  quite  skinny  for  most  of  my 
 life  and  yet  at  this  point  I'd  been
[00:46] eating  the  school  lunches  the  [ __ ] 
 disgusting  Western  diet  literally  just 
 eating  like  carbs  and  bread  and  [ __ ]
[00:52] pizzas  and  [ __ ]  whatever  why  do  they 
 feed  that  [ __ ]  to  kids  bro  you  really 
 are  what  you  eat  bro  I  know  this  is  a
[00:57] separate  topic  but  you  really  are  what 
 you  eat  don't  trust  anyone  who  tells  you 
 you  can  eat  whatever  you  want  as  long  as 
 you  eat  this  the  right  calories  it's
[01:02] [ __ ]  [ __ ]  it's  [ __ ]  evil 
 advice  so  me  and  the  school  meals  for 
 about  a  year  I  gained  fat  and  I'm  15  16
[01:07] years  old  and  I'm  kind  of  chubby  now  I 
 remember  one  day  bro  I  walked  into  my 
 school  classroom  with  my  [ __ ]  my
[01:13] friends  were  there  and  just  abruptly 
 they  walked  up  to  me  and  said  oh  yeah 
 we've  all  decided  like  you're  the 
 fattest  one  now  you're  out  of  all  of  us
[01:19] and  then  bro  there  was  a  little  fat  kid 
 next  to  me  bro  I  still  remember  him  he 
 was  he  was  definitely  fatter  than  me  but 
 I  was  like  no  no  he's  he's  fine  no  no
[01:24] you  are  you've  gotten  really  fat  answer 
 it  was  really  embarrassing  but  you  know 
 what  I  actually  looked  back  with 
 gratitude  because  it's  so  interesting
[01:30] they  said  that  I  hated  it  you  know  I  got 
 so  upset  and  stuff  three  months  later  I 
 was  lean  again  it  actually  changed  my
[01:35] life  being  body  shamed  so  you're  a  fat 
 [ __ ]  bro  I  hope  this  helps  you 
 so  age  17  I  started  weightlifting
[01:41] because  my  brother  got  me  into  it  so  my 
 brother  first  went  on  a  low  calorie  diet 
 like  literally  just  ate  like  [ __ ] 
 chicken  and  vegetables  and  [ __ ]
[01:46] disgusting  about  it  and  he  lost  weight 
 then  he  got  me  to  do  the  same  thing  we 
 were  eating  literally  600  calorie
[01:51] [ __ ]  stupid  bro  600  calories  a  day  I 
 think  that's  like  stunted  my  puberty 
 growth  now  I've  got  like  very  skinny
[01:56] wrists  and  [ __ ]  so  600  calories  a  day 
 bro  lost  some  weight  and  stuff  and  then 
 he  started  going  to  the  gym  and  watching
[02:01] like  the  old  school  YouTubers  Fitness 
 YouTubers  the  good  ones  so  there  was 
 like  Scooby  he  watched  the  Hodge  twins  I
[02:06] started  watching  them  as  well  these  were 
 like  the  good  guys  bro  these  [ __ ] 
 YouTubers  were  Prime  man  wait  let  me  put
[02:11] some  respect  on  his  name  bro  Scooby 
 1961.  oh  so  that's  that's  probably  when 
 he  was  born  he's  still  making  videos  man
[02:16] he  was  making  videos  like  how  to 
 dumbbell  press  like  on  the  floor  of  your 
 home  and  stuff  that's  the  kind  of  guy  he
[02:21] was  like  for  this  video  title  healthy 
 meals  for  students  and  other  busy  people 
 six-pack  abs  and  gain  muscle  with  good
[02:27] nutrition  13  years  ago  [ __ ]  wholesome 
 so  this  was  Scooby  my  brother  really 
 liked  him  then  I  started  watching  him
[02:32] there's  a  couple  of  other  guys  I  think 
 athlean  X  was  around  the  scene  as  well 
 yeah  this  was  like  the  Golden  Era  of
[02:37] like  YouTube  Fitness  it's  very  [ __ ]  now 
 almost  YouTubers  are  just  [ __ ] 
 disgusting  people  just  telling  you  to
[02:42] eat  [ __ ]  Krispy  Kreme  donuts  and 
 stuff  but  yeah  they  were  good  people  man 
 I  started  watching  them  going  to  the  gym 
 training  and  I  got  more  and  more  into
[02:48] the  niche  my  brother  stayed  there  with 
 like  oh  yeah  you  know  just  like  eat 
 protein  and  stuff  and  they  focus  on 
 other  things  I  got  way  more  into  the
[02:53] niche  of  like  the  aesthetic  lifestyle 
 and  I  started  watching  like  the  OG's  Joe 
 Delaney  most  Samuels  and  I  fully
[02:58] ingrained  my  personality  to  be  a  guy 
 who's  going  to  the  gym  getting  more 
 musculine  wanting  to  use  that  to  get
[03:03] girls  into  party  and  everything  you  know 
 like  those  are  Degen  days  but  it  was 
 kind  of  nice  when  I  was  like  18  years
[03:08] old  so  I've  been  working  out  now  for 
 many  years  honestly  like  about  eight 
 years  nine  years  if  you  work  out  hard
[03:14] for  like  nine  years  you  can  be  way 
 bigger  way  more  muscular  than  me 
 honestly  for  the  first  like  five  years 
 of  my  training  even  though  I  was  really
[03:20] into  it  I  just  wasn't  very  disciplined 
 so  I  was  just  working  out  like  a  [ __ ] 
 like  I'd  get  to  like  for  example  if  I 
 had  you  know  10  reps  really  did  have  10
[03:26] reps  in  the  bank  I'd  get  to  six  fuel  the 
 burn  and  stuff  and  just  put  the  weights 
 down  and  just  like  go  on  my  phone  for  a 
 bit  so  even  though  I  really  cared  about
[03:31] the  journey  I  didn't  have  the  discipline 
 and  I  was  eating  [ __ ]  food  and  my  sleep 
 was  really  bad  so  obviously  like  I
[03:36] wasn't  like  you  know  making  as  much 
 progress  as  possible  but  about  two  years 
 ago  I  I  just  skyrocketed  my  discipline
[03:41] really  got  shredded  doing  gymnastic 
 training  just  eating  clean  as  [ __ ] 
 improving  my  sleep  and  my  physique
[03:46] changed  so  much  in  just  the  space  of 
 like  six  months  like  I've  said  this  in 
 just  a  recent  video  I've  created  like  a
[03:52] global  movement  I've  helped  hundreds 
 maybe  thousands  of  men  and  honestly  the 
 best  thing  that  I've  still  done  is  just
[03:57] build  my  physique  because  it  really  was 
 the  first  thing  that  I  actually  had  like 
 this  desire  in  the  real  world  to  do  it
[04:02] was  the  thing  that  got  me  away  from 
 video  games  because  playing  video  games 
 just  seemed  pointless  as  soon  as  I 
 realized  you  could  level  up  in  real  life
[04:07] I  just  became  silly  to  be  on  RuneScape 
 leveling  up  my  strength  skill  instead  of 
 just  going  to  the  gym  and  leveling  up  my
[04:13] IRL  strength  skill  there  so  it  made  me 
 quit  video  games  it  helped  me  to  get 
 girls  and  stop  being  lonely  changed  my
[04:18] life  forever  if  you're  on  this  right  now 
 and  you're  wondering  how  long  does  it 
 take  to  get  jacked  and  you  know  without 
 taking  anything  it's  hard  to  say  because
[04:24] honestly  it  changes  very  much  between 
 people  I  have  been  totally  a  guy  who
[04:29] says  like  you  know  don't  think  about 
 genetics  and  stuff  but  at  least  for  this 
 let's  just  talk  right  I'm  not  saying 
 that  you  should  be  sat  here  and  upset 
 saying  your  genetics  are  bad  because
[04:35] either  way  you're  gonna  get  to  the  same 
 point  but  I  have  actually  seen  in  my  own 
 eyes  some  people  who  got  seemingly  good
[04:40] genetics  or  testosterone  whatever  it  is 
 and  they  make  progress  incredibly  fast 
 I'm  talking  literally  six  months  of  a
[04:46] guy  with  like  pretty  good  genetics  he 
 builds  a  more  attractive  physique  than  a 
 guy  who's  put  it  in  three  years  I  found
[04:51] personally  that  people  of  my  sort  of 
 race  of  like  brown  India  and  Pakistan  we
[04:56] have  like  the  worst  muscle  building 
 genetics  most  guys  who  start  with  my 
 sort  of  genetics  and  my  Heritage 
 literally  starts  getting  fat  a  year
[05:02] later  two  years  later  they  still  look 
 kind  of  skinny  fat  where  I  found  this 
 interesting  thing  once  that  the  gene 
 variants  in  Africa  is  actually  the
[05:08] biggest  even  in  every  other  country  so 
 like  a  person  from  Nigeria  is 
 genetically  more  different  than  a  person
[05:14] from  like  Kenya  or  something  like  this 
 than  literally  like  someone  from  Israel 
 is  to  someone  from  America  it's  like  the
[05:19] biggest  Gene  diversity  is  in  Africa 
 that's  why  you  see  like  the  Fallen  Elite 
 athletes  from  there  my  uni  friend  who  is
[05:24] Kenyan  and  he  went  to  the  gym  for  about 
 three  months  and  he  looked  better  than 
 me  then  I  went  for  about  three  years  he
[05:29] literally  looked  better  than  me  I  have  a 
 course  where  I've  taught  like  how  to 
 build  your  dream  body  and  I  see  people's 
 progress  pictures  I  see  some  guys  who
[05:34] have  the  same  gymnastics  as  me  one  year 
 in  you  know  if  they're  looking  better 
 and  better  but  they're  not  like 
 aesthetic  they  don't  look  amazing
[05:39] actually  some  other  guys  that  showed 
 progress  pictures  and  it  seems  real 
 because  I've  seen  them  in  my  Discord  and 
 everything  for  months  they've  literally
[05:44] been  working  out  for  like  six  months  and 
 they  look  better  than  I  did  like  two 
 years  four  years  later  so  the  genetics
[05:49] can  definitely  play  a  part  but  I've  had 
 to  give  you  just  a  very  random  time 
 scale  I'd  say  by  around  two  to  three
[05:54] years  you  should  be  that  muscular  guy 
 two  to  three  years  if  you're  not  seen  as 
 like  the  muscular  guy  if  you  don't  have
[05:59] like  a  good  amount  of  muscle  where  like 
 people  are  at  War  you  know  if  you're 
 like  flexing  someone  be  like  oh  it  means 
 you've  been  doing  something  totally
[06:04] wrong  and  you  need  to  accept  this  I 
 found  a  bodybuilding  it's  such  a 
 beautiful  Journey  because  if  you've  been
[06:09] bullshitting  yourself  it  will  show  now 
 fair  enough  you  know  some  people  have 
 got  genetics  and  stuff  but  your  race  of 
 muscle  growth  is  your  own  personal
[06:14] Journey  so  you  you  know  after  a  couple 
 of  months  you  know  if  your  rate  is  fast 
 or  slow  and  then  after  that  if  you  had 
 slow  growth  and  three  years  in  you  don't
[06:20] even  look  good  it's  because  you've  been 
 bullshitting  yourself  and  you  must 
 accept  this  is  maybe  you've  been  working 
 out  like  a  posse  maybe  you've  just  been
[06:25] a  [ __ ]  complete  [ __ ]  and  maybe 
 you're  just  like  like  I  used  to  just  put 
 the  weight  down  even  though  you're  not 
 even  close  to  failure  maybe  you've  just
[06:30] been  missing  too  many  days  because  you 
 say  you're  busy  maybe  you've  been 
 sleeping  like  a  dumbass  or  you  need  to 
 accept  these  things  I  wish  someone  told
[06:36] me  this  when  I  was  younger  I  wish  you 
 know  someone  who's  more  into  this  just 
 told  me  you  you  know  in  University  like 
 hey  you  say  that  this  is  the  most
[06:41] important  thing  of  your  life  why  the 
 [ __ ]  are  you  staying  up  to  like  4am 
 partying  then  dumbass  you  know  you're
[06:46] not  Invincible  I  wish  someone  told  me 
 that  back  in  the  day  obviously  it's  kind 
 of  common  sense  but  like  I  didn't  think 
 about  it  when  I  was  like  you  know  going
[06:51] out  partying  taking  drugs  drinking 
 alcohol  and  stuff  eating  [ __ ]  food  I 
 wish  someone  sat  down  and  said  like  you 
 do  realize  the  [ __ ]  food  the  sugar  and
[06:57] stuff  that  you're  eating  it's  just  gonna 
 gain  body  fat  and  no  muscle  at  all  why 
 don't  you  just  go  and  eat  chicken  and 
 rice  every  day  you  need  to  figure  out
[07:02] what  right  now  what's  holding  you  back 
 so  two  to  three  years  you  should  be  like 
 muscular  you  should  show  like  a  really
[07:07] really  good  amount  of  muscle  to  the 
 point  that  like  everyone  around  you  can 
 tell  that  you  work  out  there's  two  big
[07:12] mistakes  that  I  made  that  honestly  have 
 slowed  my  progress  down  by  about  two  to 
 three  years  and  it  probably  is  doing  it
[07:17] to  you  because  like  no  one  actually  like 
 made  this  so  clear  to  me  number  one 
 cutting  too  much  losing  too  much  body 
 weight  and  like  one  inside  gonna  be  on  a
[07:23] calorie  deficit  wanting  to  be  lean  to 
 begin  with  you  need  to  build  it  it's  the 
 whole  point  of  like  bodybuilding  of 
 building  muscle  is  that  you  should  bulk
[07:29] you  should  eat  more  calories  good 
 calories  not  [ __ ]  but  like  you  know 
 not  [ __ ]  pancakes  but  like  [ __ ] 
 chicken  and  rice  and  stuff  you  need  to
[07:34] eat  more  calories  of  that  to  gain  weight 
 you're  probably  not  making  muscle  in  a 
 calorie  deficit  honestly  like  potion
[07:39] Progressive  overload  getting  an  extra 
 rep  or  an  extra  increase  in  weight  is  so 
 difficult  even  on  a  bulk  never  mind  on  a
[07:44] calorie  deficit  I  wasted  so  many  years 
 of  my  life  just  trying  to  get  like  lean 
 before  I  even  had  the  muscle  to  you  know
[07:49] really  show  it  off  but  actually  the 
 worst  mistake  that  I  made  even  just 
 recently  even  for  the  most  of  the  last
[07:55] year  is  such  a  silly  one  that  no  one 
 really  spoke  about  because  all  these 
 [ __ ]  Fitness  YouTubers  have  been 
 doing  it  wrong  I  was  training  like  a
[08:01] weightlifter  like  a  power  lifter  instead 
 of  a  bodybuilder  every  Fitness  YouTuber 
 video  you've  seen  says  the  same  thing
[08:06] don't  they  every  single  one  of  them  just 
 a  [ __ ]  copy  paste  all  day  a  heavy 
 compound  lifts  bodybuilders  don't  do
[08:11] that  [ __ ]  Bro  all  these  [ __ ]  Fitness 
 YouTubers  telling  you  like  heavy  combat 
 oh  don't  do  isolation  exercise  why  would
[08:16] you  waste  your time  doing  curls  because 
 you  want  to  build  biceps  any  guy  who's 
 telling  you  right  now  like  oh  don't  do 
 curls  just  do  pull  up  oh  don't  don't
[08:22] train  you  why  would  you  just  do 
 isolation  just  do  lots  of  benchmarks 
 just  do  heavy  bench  press  five  times 
 five  bro  I  know  I  seems  silly  I  know
[08:27] that  every  other  YouTuber  is  going  to 
 disagree  with  me  and  you're  probably 
 thinking  wait  wait  but  more  qualified 
 bigger  guys  than  Hamza  have  been  saying
[08:33] other  things  so  obviously  they  must  be 
 right  I'm  just  wrong  you  can  take  their 
 advice  and  if  you  see  good  progress  fine 
 but  I'm  telling  you  right  now  what  you
[08:38] want  if  you  watch  this  video  is 
 hypertrophy  what  you  want  is  just  muscle 
 gain  right  muscle  gain  is  very  little
[08:44] and  just  low  Roi  if  you're  doing  heavy 
 sets  of  like  two  three  four  five  six
[08:49] seven  even  eight  reps  you  know  you've 
 always  heard  like  the  rep  ranges  one  to 
 five  is  like  strength  and  ship  eight  is
[08:54] hyper  trophy  Pro  I  found  you'll  get  the 
 best  gains  of  your  life  if  you  do  more 
 than  10  reps  10  to  like  15  10  to  20  is
[09:00] the  best  range  for  building  muscle 
 because  it's  light  enough  that  you 
 really  get  the  [ __ ]  good  squeeze  if 
 all  these  guys  saying  oh  yeah  do  heavy
[09:06] squats  just  do  five  times  five  do  three 
 rep  squats  bro  you're  not  going  to  build 
 much  muscle  from  that  it's  entirely 
 fatiguing  you're  more  likely  to  get
[09:11] injuries  which  if  you've  got  good  form 
 find  your  little  void  but  like  you  know 
 over  an  entire  year  of  training  if 
 you're  lifting  three  reps  or  five  reps
[09:17] you  probably  are  gonna  get  one  kind  of 
 injury  if  you're  doing  bodybuilder 
 training  probably  not  you  know  there's 
 this  culture  online  like  oh  you're  not
[09:22] really  training  if  you're  not  doing 
 heavy  weights  tell  those  same  fat  power 
 lifters  to  do  a  15  rep  set  of  squats  go
[09:27] on  if  you  think  you're  discipline  bro 
 you  think  you're  discipline  because  you 
 can  lift  heavy  ways  you  can  do  a  one  rep 
 deadlift  bro  doing  a  one  rep  isn't
[09:34] actually  hard  because  you  can  just  hit 
 it  I  mean  you  hit  it  or  you  don't  hit  it 
 it's  simple  right  it's  not  actually  that 
 difficult  you  know  what's  actually
[09:39] difficult  go  and  do  a  30  reps  if  you 
 want  to  train  your  discipline  I'm  going 
 to  do  a  20  to  30  rep  set  of  something
[09:44] and  now  let's  see  how  disciplined  your 
 mind  actually  is  do  one  set  of  30  reps
[09:49] of  lateral  raises  of  light  weights  till 
 the  point  that  you're  [ __ ]  like 
 weirdly  [ __ ]  like  shaking  like  this 
 and  you'll  realize  that  all  those  like
[09:55] heavy  weight  sets  that  you  did  were  just 
 [ __ ]  Coke  if  I  could  go  back  now  I'd 
 tell  younger  Hamza  you're  a  bodybuilder 
 not  a  weightlifter  do  not  watch  any  of
[10:01] these  [ __ ]  online  that  are  telling 
 you  heavy  compound  lifts  I  tell  them 
 lift  but  within  the  10  to  20  rep  range 
 for  every  exercise  including  compound
[10:07] like  you  should  do  some  you  know  big 
 compound  movements  squats  and  bench  and 
 stuff  that's  still  nice  of  course  Lots 
 don't  do  them  for  three  Reps  don't  do
[10:13] them  you  don't  need  to  like  increase 
 your  strength  if  you're  a  bodybuilder  it 
 doesn't  like  there's  no  need  if  you  just 
 care  about  you're  lifting  the  weight  and
[10:18] it's  kind  of  fun  fair  enough  but  if  you 
 are  here  today  because  you  want  to  be 
 like  a  mini  bodybuilder  you  don't  want
[10:23] to  be  a  massive  steroid  one  but  you  know 
 you  just  want  to  build  a  good  fizzy  you 
 don't  need  to  be  strong  for  it  because 
 strength  and  muscle  are  two  different
[10:28] things  there's  been  studies  to  show  they 
 are  correlated  yeah  of  course  they  are 
 but  correlation  does  not  mean  causation
[10:33] trading  and  the  five  rep  range  is  not 
 gonna  build  anywhere  near  as  much  muscle 
 it's  training  in  the  10  to  15  rep  range
[10:38] simple  as  that  I  just  wanted  to  be  more 
 attractive  bro  I  was  tired  of  being 
 lonely  I  wanted  to  get  girls  and  so  I 
 started  eventually  going  to  the  right
[10:43] workout  routines  which  I'll  link  in  the 
 description  if  you  do  want  to  see  them 
 and  there's  seven  free  workout  routines 
 Link  in  the  description  go  click  that
[10:48] right  now  and  I  actually  built  a  body 
 now  that  I'm  proud  of  how  long  does  it
