[00:00] the  first  time  that  I  ever  saw  porn  I 
 was  13  years  old  and  I  was  actually  in
[00:06] class  next  to  one  of  my  friends  and  we 
 were  on  the  computers  in  this  class  and
[00:11] he  told  me  to  go  onto  Google  and  to 
 search  up  Kayla  Collins  clean  Kayla
[00:17] Collins  like  some  um  you  know  some  girl 
 who  takes  like  nudie  pictures 
 and  this  was  back
[00:23] 12  years  ago 
 and  I  searched  it  up  and  it  was  just 
 like  this  woman  posing  provocatively
[00:28] she's  in  like  some  Cafe  she's  got  like 
 cream  all  over  there  to  eat  and 
 everything  and  I'm  literally  13  you  know
[00:34] years  old  like  whoa  my  heart  beats  fast 
 and  everything  I'm  in  class  right  now  so 
 I  closed  it  off  and  it's  just  kind  of
[00:39] like  you  know  smoking  to  himself 
 and  then  I  get  the  idea  what  if  I  write
[00:44] her  name  but  instead  of  writing  clean  at 
 the  end  of  it  I  write  dirty  and  so  I  go
[00:49] home  I  do  that  exact  same  thing  I  go 
 onto  Google  and  I  type  in  her  name  but  I 
 type  in  dirty  and  it's  essentially  the
[00:55] same  kind  of  pictures  but  this  time 
 they're  like  fully  fully  nude  and  so 
 that  was  like  the  first  experience  that
[01:01] I  ever  had  seeing  this  I'm  13  years  old 
 which  is  still  a  little  bit  late  for 
 some  guys  and  it  was  it  was  a  picture  it
[01:08] was  quite  tame 
 and  naturally  I  did  what  every  young  guy
[01:13] would  do  at  that  age  I  did  that  thing 
 that  those  guys  in  you  know  in  class  in
[01:18] sports  class  were  saying  that  you  could 
 do  with  your  penis  and  that  was  really 
 fun  and  um  I  probably  had  like  the
[01:23] strongest  orgasm  of  my  entire  like  a 
 [ __ ]  like
[01:28] so  I  started  jacking  off  right  every 
 single  day  after  this  and
[01:34] at  first  it  was  very  like  tame  tame  porn 
 so  I  used  to  have  a  PSP  and  I  used  to  go
[01:40] on  to  Google  on  the  and  I'd  search  for 
 some  like  interesting  sofa  search  like
[01:46] girls  in  sexy  Santa  costumes  and  I'd 
 just  be  jacking  off  to  that  and  then
[01:51] eventually  it  was  a  big  jump  right  I 
 went  from  that  and  I  swear  to  God  I  went 
 from  that  and  I  ended  up  finding  the
[01:57] glory  whole  niche  of  like  which  is 
 like  a  really  dirty  niche  of  like  people
[02:03] will  be  in  a  bathroom  and  then  they'll 
 just  cut  a  hole  there  so  like  someone 
 some  big  dick  can  like  come  through  the
[02:08] side  and  some  girl  will  be  like  doing 
 [ __ ]  to  that  so  I  went  through  like  a 
 big  jump  but  then  I  kind  of  like 
 gravitated  back  from  that  and  then  went
[02:14] through  a  lot  of  the  normal  progression 
 of  like  you  know  then  I'm  watching 
 um  lesbian  porn  and  stuff  I'm  watching
[02:20] like  mostly  it  was  like  pictures  at 
 first  for  a  long  time  then  it  was  like 
 10  videos  then  it  was  like  kind  of
[02:25] normal  videos  then  you  know  it  levels 
 off  and 
 before  you  know  it  it's
[02:31] three  times  before  I  even  I've  even 
 gotten  out  of  bed
[02:36] I'm  a  young  man  I'm  17  now  I'm  18. 
 I'm  waking  up
[02:42] I'm  not  getting  out  of  bed  I'm  not  doing 
 anything  productive  I'm  not  like  in  a 
 rushing  to  go  fulfill  my  mission  or  my
[02:47] purpose  or  or  to  achieve  some  goals  or 
 to  help  my  family  or  to  to  build  myself
[02:52] I  met  waking  up  and  I'm  the  the  first 
 thing  that  I'm  doing  is  grabbing  my 
 phone  and  going  on  to  Pornhub  and
[02:57] jacking  off  finishing  lying  around 
 scrolling  through  reddits  and  stuff
[03:02] and  then  doing  it  again 
 and  then  again
[03:09] I  remember  I  still  remember  the  first 
 time  that  I  I've  jacked  off  three  times 
 like  in  one  go
[03:16] must  have  taken  me  like  hours  to  you 
 know  like  you  finish  and  then  you  wait  a 
 little  bit  and  everything
[03:21] I  remember  how  like  [ __ ]  dirty  and 
 sweaty  that  I  felt  afterwards
[03:26] it's  like  this  it's  this  shame  that  you 
 know  when  I  went  downstairs  to  make 
 breakfast  or  something  my  family's  there
[03:31] you  just  feel  like  a  goblin  like  you 
 feel  like  this  [ __ ]  like  gremlin
[03:37] it  would  shame  that  they  they  control 
 you  and  make  you  weak
[03:43] and  so  it  was  around  this  time  that 
 nofap  started  to  come  about  online  like 
 you  know  people  openly  started  to  speak
[03:49] like  this  as  I  am  to  you  today 
 it  was  around  this  time  when  I  was  17  18
[03:54] years  old  that  for  the  first  time  in  my 
 life  I  actually  started  to  see  a  lot  of 
 people  start  opening  up  about  their  porn
[04:00] addiction  about  getting  onto  nofap  and 
 everything 
 and  so  I  got  onto  nofap  in
[04:07] 25 
 something  like  that
[04:13] and  it  really  did  change  my  life  forever 
 I  struggled  heavily  right  so  exactly
[04:18] what  happened  was  you  know  I'm  watching 
 all  these  videos  online  and  they're 
 saying  about  nofap  and  all  these 
 benefits  and  girls  will  smell  the
[04:23] retention  on  you  and  all  this  right  and 
 it  sounds  awesome  and  and  the  truth  is 
 like  I  knew  that  I  needed  it  and  I  think
[04:30] most  guys  actually  know  this  most  guys 
 know  that  they  need  this  [ __ ]
[04:37] I'm  gonna  get  to  90  days  and  then  I'm 
 probably  just  not  gonna  fap  again 
 because  it's  for  losers
[04:42] 24  hours  later  I'm  fapping
[04:54] and  again  I'm  gonna  make  some  progress 
 I'm  gonna  make  progress  I'm  gonna  make 
 progress
[05:01] the  next  day  I'm  fapping
[05:10] being  stuck  in  this  cycle  where  you  have 
 no  control  over  your  sexual  impulses
[05:18] what  it  does  to  a  man  is  is 
 horrible
[05:26] it  was  it  felt  like  this 
 it  felt  like  a  full-time  job  being  on
[05:31] nofap  and  constantly  just  snapping  back 
 back  to  to  relapsing  back  to
[05:40] ah
[05:46] back  to  failure  back  to  struggle
[05:55] 24  hours  later  relapse 
 get  up  to  three  days  this  time  so
[06:00] [ __ ]  horny 
 relapse  relapse  relapse  relapse  relapse
[06:06] constantly  get  into  three  days  then  then 
 messing  up  again  three  days  then  messing 
 up  again  three  days  then  messing  up
[06:12] again
[06:23] and  that's  when  I
[06:28] that's  when  I  started  to  realize  the 
 truth  of  this  and  that's  when  I  started 
 to  realize  how  to  actually  do  nofap
[06:33] properly  and  how  to  go  about  your  porn 
 addiction
[06:45] it  was  a  change  in 
 identity
[06:50] I  stopped  seeing  myself  as  the  guy  who's 
 trying  to  quit  porn  I  stopped  seeing
[06:55] myself  as 
 the  guy  on  nofap 
 and  I  started  instead  to  just  see  myself
[07:01] sounds  courageous  [ __ ]  when  I  was  18  to 
 see  myself  as  the  alpha  male  who  [ __ ]
[07:07] the  girls  instead  of  the  beta  male  who 
 just  jacks  off  his  dick  it  sounds  cringe 
 I  was  18  years  old  and  I  said  this  so
[07:13] obviously  it's  fine 
 I  started  to  just  see  myself  in  that  way
[07:18] like  I  used  to  almost  like  daydream 
 about  okay  I  am  this  guy  now  I'm  this 
 guy  I'm  the  alpha  male  now  I'm  the  alpha
[07:24] male  I'm  not  from  beta  male  who  like  you 
 know  some  little  monkey  who  has  to  Jack 
 his  dick  off  instead  of  getting  the  girl
[07:29] I  get  the  girl  I  get  the  girl 
 and  almost  instantly  I'm  now  getting  up 
 to  day  seven  day  eight  day  nine  day  ten
[07:36] and  suddenly  it  starts  getting  weeks  and 
 weeks  and  weeks  and  pretty  much  I'm  just
[07:41] not  watching  porn  or  fapping  anymore  and 
 the  only  time  that  I  was  actually  like
[07:46] ejaculating  was  when  I  was  actually 
 having  sex  so  suddenly  it's  like  okay 
 that's  probably  the  best  case  scenario
[07:53] that's  how  I  personally  fixed  my  my 
 nofap  and  porn  addiction  which  I  think
[07:58] haunts  so  many  men  and  so  today  I  wanna 
 I  wanna  synthesize  10  books  that  are  on
[08:03] Pawn  addiction  and  take  you  know  a 
 lesson  from  each  book  and  then  give  you 
 some  of  my  input  on  it  the  first  book  is
[08:11] the  porn  Circuit  by  Sam  Al  a  lebrando
[08:16] and  one  tip  that  he  says  is  important  is 
 to  seek  professional  help  to  get  therapy
[08:22] and  counseling  this  is  a  quite  a  like  a 
 well-known  book  on  this  space  I  don't
[08:27] like  this  advice  honestly  I  don't 
 personally  like  this  advice  this  this 
 per  like
[08:32] seek  professional  help  go  see  a  doctor 
 like  these  are  the  things  that  sound 
 really  smart  and  you're  almost  crazy  to
[08:38] criticize  this  advice  and  and  your 
 normies  and  like  [ __ ]  Jeffries  and 
 the  the  weak  people  of  the  world  who
[08:44] could  never  question  anything  but  if  you 
 ever  like  the  way  I'm  talking  right  now 
 scares  a  lot  of  people  when  I'm  saying
[08:49] like  yeah  seeking  professional  help 
 isn't  as  as  positive  as  you  think  it  is 
 because  as  someone  who's  been  through 
 therapy  it's  not  as  effective  as  you
[08:55] think  it  is  go  and  actually  look  at  the 
 therapy  statistics  it's  not  one  it's  not 
 as  effective  as  you  think  it  is  two  it's
[09:00] expensive  as  [ __ ]  three  it's  for  a 
 lot  of  people  it  makes  their  condition 
 worse  because  every  day  like  a  [ __ ]
[09:06] you're  there  saying  like  oh  yeah  and 
 this  is  my  problem  I'm  a  fap  around  you 
 know  my  name's  Hamza  and  I'm  an
[09:12] alcoholic  that's  not  good  for  you  to 
 talk  about  your  problem  talking  about 
 your  problems  then  you  know  like
[09:17] feminine  women  who  talk  about  their 
 problems  and  like  to  complain  and  stuff 
 that  all  their  problems  would  be  solved
[09:22] if  talking  about  them  was  helpful 
 right  if  talking  about  your  problems  was 
 helpful  a  lot  of  people's  problems  would
[09:28] be  solved  but  it's  not  that  simple  and 
 you  can  follow  some  psychological 
 framework  that  was  made  in  some
[09:33] University  but  still 
 there's  way  more  effective  ways  to  go 
 through  it  in  my  opinion  and
[09:39] I  am  I'm  a  big  advocate  of 
 self-improvement  and  not  of  like
[09:44] professional  help  when  it  comes  to 
 therapy  and  counseling
[09:50] foreign 
 I  know  this  is  going  to  seem  a  bit
[09:56] backwards  and  a  lot  of  people  won't 
 understand  this  but  chances  are  if 
 you're  watching  my  video  you  will 
 I  think  sometimes  you  need  to  enjoy  the
[10:02] pain  sometimes  you  can't  just  hope  for 
 this  easy  way  out  thinking  yeah  I'll 
 just  go  take  some  medication  yeah  I'll
[10:07] just  go  to  therapy  yeah  I'll  just  go  to 
 see  a  doctor  sometimes  you  need  to 
 Winston  Churchill  says  this  if  you  find
[10:13] yourself  Going  Through  Hell  keep  going
[10:18] the  second  book  is  the  pawn  Trap  by 
 Wendy  and  Larry  maltz  and  they've  said
[10:24] to  set  clear  boundaries  about  how  you'd 
 use  the  internet  and  Technology
[10:31] and  this  is  actually  relevant  to  me  so 
 when  I  was  trying  to  first  get  onto 
 nofap  and  stop  watching  porn  and  you
[10:36] know  I  kept  on  relapsing  every  day  22 
 days  or  something  you  know  the  big 
 mistake  that  I  made  which  you  you  might
[10:41] be  making  right  I  changed  nothing  apart 
 from  like  the  goal  of  wanting  to  not  to
[10:48] fap  right  I  changed  nothing  else  I  just 
 thought  to  myself  yeah  I'm  on  nofap  now 
 yeah  yeah okay  so  I'm  not  gonna  fap
[10:53] anymore  yeah  I'm  not  gonna  watch  porn 
 anymore  right  but  I  didn't  change 
 anything  else 
 so  guess  at  what  time  I  kept  on
[11:01] relapsing 
 first  thing  in  the  morning  because  I 
 didn't  change  my  habits  I'd  grab  my
[11:08] um my  phone  straight  and  you  know  I'm 
 not  gonna  watch  porn  I'm  just  gonna 
 scroll  down  Reddit
[11:13] and  usually  there's  Pawn  in  there  but 
 you  know  I'm  not  gonna  watch  it  I'm  not 
 gonna  watch  you  I'm  literally  in  the
[11:19] environment  where  I  fap  I'm  using  like 
 the  device  that  I  use  the  internet 
 um  social  media  platform  and  everything
[11:24] I'm  just  scrolling  and  oh  there's  the 
 first  post  like  I  just  click  on  it 
 randomly  you  know  like  without  even 
 thinking  about  it  you  click  on  okay
[11:29] there's  a  pair  of  titties  now  now  I'm 
 horny 
 I  didn't  actually  set  boundaries  for  a
[11:34] while  I  struggled  like  this  I  just  kept 
 on  relapsing  and  it  took  me  a  while  to 
 realize  this  that  you  need  to  actually
[11:39] think  of  some  kind  of  restrictions  you 
 can  place  on  yourself  or  like  just
[11:45] restriction  sounds  too  too  negative  but 
 like  more  of  a  boundary  that  you  can 
 place  on  your  habits  so  that  you  don't
[11:50] actually  end  up  in  the  exact  scenario 
 where  you  keep  fat  think  so  for  me  it 
 was  when  I  was  lying  down  all  underneath
[11:55] my  covers  nice  and  warm  and  comfort 
 scrolling  on  Reddit  which  would
[12:00] eventually  lead  to  like  porn  that's  like 
 come  on  that's  a  recipe  for  disaster  it 
 didn't  occur  to  me  that  I  needed  to  set
[12:05] some  kind  of  boundaries  I  think  yeah 
 that's  [ __ ]  stupid  to  keep  doing  this 
 habit  if  I'm  Gonna  Keep  on  um  if  I'm
[12:11] gonna  stay  on  nofa  you  need  to  figure 
 out  right  now  what  is  some  kind  of 
 boundary  that  you  can  place  on  your
[12:17] devices  on  the  internet  because  thing 
 about  it  you  only  have  a  porn  addiction 
 because  of  the  internet  right  you  only 
 have  one  because  it's  very  unlikely  that
[12:23] you're  going  through  like  your  dad's  old 
 magazines  right  now  it's  very  unlikely 
 that  you're  actually  going  to  the  store 
 to  buy  some  VHS  tapes  right  so  it's
[12:30] literally  your  porn  addiction  it's 
 literally  coming  from  like  one  or  two 
 devices  your  computer  or  your  phone 
 right  so  we  need  to  set  some  kind  of
[12:36] boundaries  for  that  now  a  lot  of  people 
 recommend 
 to  get  Pawn  blockers  and  to  get  the
[12:41] website  blockers  and  for  some  people 
 that  seems  to  work  to  a  nice  level  I'd 
 never  liked  that  idea  because  I  had
[12:47] downloaded  I'd  you  know  followed  the 
 craze  I  download  the  um  the  poem  blocker 
 oh  you  can't  go  to  pornhub.com  oh  wow
[12:54] it's  blocked  me  from  going  to 
 pornhub.com 
 oh  man  if  there  was  only  a  hundred
[13:00] million  other  porn  sites  that  I  could  go 
 to  oh  it's  blocked  all  of  the  porn  sites 
 oh  man  if  there's  only  20  different
[13:07] social  media  sites  that  I  could  go  to 
 that  has  Pawn 
 I  don't  think  blocking  it  and  stopping
[13:13] yourself  from  being  able  to  go  there  is 
 like  in  this  kind  of  weight  it's  kind  of
[13:19] like  just  putting  a  blindfold  over  your 
 eye 
 I  think  the  more
[13:25] I  think  the  better  ways  for  you  to  like 
 set  a  psychological  boundary
[13:31] not  some  kind  of  technological  one 
 because  sweet  like  we  should  use
[13:36] technology  to  make  our  life  easier  okay 
 sweet 
 but  I  think  a  lot  more  power  comes  in
[13:42] the  psychological 
 boundary  that  you  can  place  on  yourself 
 and  you  say  these  words  to  yourself  like
[13:48] I'm  not  going  to  go  on  this  app  anymore 
 I  don't  need  this  app  which  you  know
[13:53] Tick  Tock  which  is  where  I  end  up 
 fapping 
 I'm  not  going  to  put  myself  physically
[13:58] in  that  environment  where  I  usually  do 
 fap  so  I'm  not  going  to  just  go  sit  in 
 the  toilet  just  scrolling  pretending  to
[14:04] have  a  [ __ ]  just  scrolling  and  scrolling 
 because  that's  when  I  usually  fat  but 
 I'm  not  just  gonna  go  lie  down  in  the 
 middle  of  the  day  like  some  depressed
[14:10] little  [ __ ]  Goblin 
 anymore  because  I'm  not  like  that  I'm 
 just  gonna  have  a  boundary  I'm  not  gonna
[14:15] do  that  anymore 
 you're  brain  on  porn  by  Gary  Wilson  is  a
[14:20] really  famous  book  and  this  is  one  that 
 a  lot  of  people  speak  about  and  he  talks 
 about  finding  healthier  ways  to  cope  so
[14:27] there's  a  chapter  in  this  where  he  he 
 pretty  much  just  says  like  get  on  to 
 self-improvement  instead  of
[14:33] watching  porn  and  and  fapping  find 
 healthier  ways  to  cope 
 I  don't  really  like  the  word  cope
[14:39] because  it  it  means  that  you  know  where 
 it's  something  to  cope  with  it's
[14:44] something  that  we're  struggling  with 
 it's  something  that  we  need  there's  a 
 lack  when  we're  not  watching  porn 
 there's  a  lack  women  not  fapping  or
[14:50] something  which  I  I  don't  like  that  that 
 thinking  and  so  I  think 
 find  like  a  healthier  outlets  for  your
[14:57] energy  and  also  find  healthier  habits  so 
 your  day  should  be  100  productive  this
[15:04] is  like  you  want  to  know  honestly  the 
 brutal  fact  honestly  which  pisses  a  lot 
 of  people  off  you  want  to  quit  porn  you
[15:10] want  to  quit  fapping  you  want  to  get  all 
 the  success  that  you  want  you  want  to 
 build  yourself  up  to  be  attractive  make
[15:15] money  get  girls  you  want  to  know  all 
 like  really  the  [ __ ]  real  secret  to 
 this  bro  have  a  day  that's  100 
 productive  all  the  like  the  weak
[15:22] seemingly  like  left-wing  people  who  have 
 got  skinny  necks  and  low  testosterone 
 that  they  don't  like  this  advice  and
[15:27] they  always  criticize  me  and  they  always 
 say  like  oh  your  day  shouldn't  just  be 
 productive  and  stuff  you  should  you  know
[15:32] you  should  rest  and  I'm  like  rest  is 
 productive  you  dumbass  oh  no  but  you  you 
 should  also  play  video  games  video  games
[15:38] no  they're  not 
 your  day  should  be  100  productive  your 
 calendar  like  you  should  have  a  blocked
[15:44] military  routine  like  you  know  what 
 you're  doing  at  every  hour  of  the  day 
 right  here  right  now  I  know  what  I'm
[15:50] doing  at  every  hour  of  the  day  because 
 my  calendar  is  already  set  I  have  a 
 video  that's  on  my  channel  you  can  go
[15:55] look  I'm  not  gonna  link  it  but  you  can 
 just  go  look 
 and  it's  about  monk  mode  productivity
[16:00] 2023  like  the  thumbnails  like  a  picture 
 of  my  face  and  it  says  like  oh  he  left 
 and  he  came  back  successful  or  something
[16:05] right  go  and  have  a  look  at  how  I  speak 
 about  the  calendar  and  the  military 
 routine  in  there  you  need  to  be
[16:11] productive  100  of  the  day  this  is  this 
 is  what  men  are  supposed  to  be  like 
 honestly  this  is  what  like  a  man  is
[16:16] supposed  to  get  to  a  certain  age  at  like 
 literally  age  13  you're  supposed  to  be  a 
 man  in  my  opinion  you're  supposed  to  go
[16:21] work  and  literally  just  [ __ ]  work  all 
 day  and  be  productive  all  day  now  you 
 don't  that  doesn't  mean  that  you  need  to
[16:26] like  you  know  grind  hardcore  16  hour 
 days  and  be  sleep  deprived  because  being 
 productive  also  means  sleeping  well  it
[16:32] also  means  going  out  into  nature  but  it 
 just  means  that  you're  not  wasting  any 
 time  because  that  is  a  sin
[16:37] wasting  time  watching  [ __ ]  Rick  and 
 Morty  is  a  sin  watching  pointless  videos
[16:42] that  you're  not  going  to  use  just  to 
 fill  up  the  time  is  a  sin  100  of  your 
 day  should  be  productive  that  does  not
[16:47] mean  that  you  need  to  like  you  know  like 
 grind  at  the  same  task  or  study  for  15
[16:52] hours  a  day  you  should  have  some  kind  of 
 balance  you  should  still  goes  to  the  gym 
 because  that's  productive  you  should 
 still  eat  because  that's  productive  you
[16:58] should  still  meditate  because  that's 
 productive 
 but  when  you  set  up  this  productive  like 
 military  style  routine  this  time  table
[17:05] this  like  okay  day  by  day  exactly  this 
 is  what  we're  gonna  do
[17:10] it's  it's  hard  to  even  consider  to  be  a 
 a  wanker  honestly  it's  hard  to  be  one  at
[17:17] that  point  because  you  you're  you  know 
 like  you  have  this  extra  level  of 
 accountability  you  know  exactly  what  you
[17:22] should  do  at  all  given  times  I  know  that 
 I'm  gonna  record  till  8  30  a.m  today  and
[17:27] so  not  only  am  I  you  know  I'm  I'm  away 
 from  porn  and  fapping  and  stuff  but  when 
 you  know  exactly  what  you're  gonna  do  at
[17:33] all  hours  of  the  day 
 you  automatically  just  start  to  go  and 
 do  it
[17:39] you  have  this  extra  resistance  to  doing 
 anything  that  isn't  in  your  calendar 
 which  means  it's  even  harder  for  you  to
[17:45] go  and  fap  and  watch  porn  because  you 
 know  what  you  could  be  doing  right  now
[17:50] find  like  I  would  say  not  a  healthy  way 
 to  cope  but  I  would  say  [ __ ]  like  set  up
[17:55] a  healthy  masculine  discipline  military 
 style
[18:00] timetable  routine  calendar 
 once  your  Energy's  going  in  there  and
[18:06] you've  got  other  things  to  do  that  are 
 actually  healthy  for  you  that  are 
 productive  for  you  and  your  goals  and 
 your  mission  and  your  purpose
[18:12] I  think  you're  going  to  be  less  likely 
 to  find  yourself  like  falling  back  into 
 Pawn
[18:21] rewired  is  another  book  it's  by  Erica 
 spiel
[18:26] Spielman  and  she  talks  about  uh 
 mindfulness  in  this  so  mindfulness  is
[18:32] something  that's  really  helped  me  and  I 
 think  it  would  really  really  help  any 
 guy  who's  struggling  from  the  situation
[18:38] you've  probably  heard  of  it  before  but 
 let  me  explain  it's  even  a  completely 
 different  way  mindfulness  is  the  reward
[18:45] of  meditation 
 so  we  need  to  just  focus  on  meditation 
 meditation  there's  there's  hundreds  of
[18:52] different  thousands  of  different  ways  to 
 meditate  but  I'm  just  going  to teach  you 
 the  one  that  you  probably  care  about  the 
 most  which  is  going  to  help  you  with 
 addictions  with  porn  it's  going  to  make
[18:58] you  more  successful  more  focused  and 
 have  like  negative  thoughts  right  and 
 the  kind  of  meditation  that  we're  gonna
[19:03] do  this  a  simple  step-by-step  framework 
 which  no  one  else  has  ever  spoke  about 
 but  as  soon  as  you  hear  this  it's  just
[19:09] gonna  click  right  so  step  one  is  that 
 okay  stop  meditating  so  we  just  focus  on 
 something  like  our  breath  do  this  with
[19:14] me  right  just  focus  on  your  breath  this 
 is  step  one  step  one  is  when  we're 
 focusing  on  the  breath  and  we  literally
[19:19] just  feel  like  just  feel  it  right  so 
 just  pick  one  spot  in  your  physical  body 
 where  you  literally  just  want  to  focus
[19:24] imagine  one  millimeter  so  you  could  pick 
 like  right  here  on  your  nose  or  you
[19:29] could  pick  like  on  your  stomach  or 
 whatever  you  want  to  do  so  just  focus  on 
 one  spot 
 and  just  breathe
[19:35] back  step  on  step  two  is  invisible  step 
 two  actually  happens  without  you
[19:41] realizing  it  and  it's  when  your  mind 
 goes  away  from  the  thought  so  literally 
 usually  within  some  milliseconds  like
[19:48] usually  within  a  second  or  two  when 
 we're  focusing  on  the  breath  we're 
 focusing  on  that  exact  millimeter  of
[19:53] somewhere  on  our  skin  for  example  our 
 mind  will  go  somewhere  else  and  we'll
[19:58] start  to  think  of  other  things  and  we 
 don't  actually  realize  it  yet  because 
 when  your  mind  goes  somewhere  else  it's
[20:03] almost  like  you  are  that  you  feel  like 
 you  are  the  thought  at  that  point  and  so 
 you  are  indulging  in  the  thought  and  you
[20:08] don't  really 
 you're  not  very  aware  that  you  are 
 thinking
[20:13] and  so  for  step  two 
 that's  when  your  mind  wanders  now  step 
 three  is  when  you  actually  become
[20:19] consciously  aware  that  your  mind  has 
 wandered  it's  that  that  aha  moment  of 
 like  oh  I  have  drifted  away  into
[20:25] thoughts  man  I  suck  at  meditation  but 
 instead  of  feeling  bad  about  it  and 
 thinking  oh  I'm  not  able  to  focus  you
[20:31] realize  that  actually  step  four  is  when 
 we  just  return  back  to  the  original
[20:37] Point  step  four  straight  after  when  we 
 get  the  thought  oh  yeah  like  I'm  deep  in
[20:42] thought  right  now  step  four  is  simply 
 okay  come  back  to  the  breath  return  back
[20:47] to  the  breath 
 this  bit  here  returning  back  to  the 
 breath  that's  like  one  rep  that's  one
[20:53] push-up  that's  one  bicep  curl  for  the 
 brain  this  is  the  process  you  need  to  go 
 through  this  a  lot  of  guys  try  and
[20:59] meditate  and  then  get  upset  when  they 
 can't  be  focused  but  you  need  to  go 
 through  this  and  the  better  you  get  a 
 meditation  the  faster  that  you'll  get
[21:05] one  rep  you  start  by  focusing  on  that 
 exact  spot  somewhere  in  your  body  and 
 just  feel  your  breath
[21:10] within  literally  a  few  seconds  you  don't 
 even  realize  it  just  yet  obviously  we're 
 very  aware  that  we're  doing  this  but 
 within  a  few  seconds  your  mind  will  just
[21:17] wonder  then  you'll  realize  your  mind  is 
 wandering  you'll  get  that  moment  of  like 
 oh  I  was  deep  in  thought  and  then  all
[21:22] you  have  to  do  is  just  return  back  to 
 that  exact  place  that  you  were 
 previously  focusing  on  and  just 
 completing  this  is  one  rep  do  that  a
[21:29] thousand  times  I  complete  this  four  step 
 cycle  a  thousand  times  and  you  will 
 literally  see  like  a  significant
[21:34] difference  of  a  significant  Improvement 
 of  how  mindful  you  are  and  the  more
[21:39] mindful  you  are  the  more  all  of  your 
 life  gets  better  but  really  how 
 mindfulness  is  used  to  overcome
[21:45] addictions  because  it's  one  of  the  most 
 effective  addiction  treatments  is  that 
 it  kind  of  feels  like  it  gives  you  more
[21:52] control  over  your  Cravings  so  oft  like 
 sometimes  we  get  these  hard  Cravings
[21:57] that  eventually  just  wear  us  down  until 
 eventually  we  just  go  and  do  the  bad 
 habit  right  mindfulness  like  the  more
[22:03] mindful  you  become  it's  like  the 
 stronger  you  get  to  be  able  to  just 
 ignore  those  Cravings  to  be  able  to  just
[22:08] like  understand  that  you  don't  have  to 
 actually  submit  to  the  craving  and  it 
 just  does  less  to  you  so  imagine  this
[22:14] right  you  have  impulses  which  are 
 usually  bad  right  usually  like  most  of
[22:19] our  impulses  are  quite  negative  in  the 
 modern  day  they're  very  like  you  know 
 short  term  instant  gratification  right
[22:24] mindfulness  gives  you  impulse  control 
 so  when  you  want  to  go  and  do  that  thing
[22:29] that's  not  good  for  the  long  term  which 
 is  an  Impulse  because  you  can  get  it 
 right  now
[22:34] mindfulness  helps  you  with  impulse 
 control  by  pushing  what  you  want  further 
 and  further  away  because  you  understand
[22:40] that  delaying  gratification  being 
 patient  going  for  your  long-term  goal  is 
 better  so  literally  we  could  set  up  a
[22:46] study  this  has  been  done  so  many  times 
 but  we  could  set  up  a  study  where  we 
 just  get  two  participants  and  we  just
[22:51] ask  them  do  you  want  this  chocolate  bar 
 the  people  who  meditate  are  more  likely 
 to  say  no  because  it's  not  healthy  for
[22:57] them  it's  simple  as  that  if  you  meditate 
 the  reason  why  it's  genuinely  a 
 superpower  is  because  you're  literally
[23:03] like  it  helps  your  impulse  control  if 
 you've  ever  heard  of  the  term  impulse 
 control  that  is  incredible
[23:09] Amazing  Alex  hamosi  well  an  entrepreneur 
 and  author  I  really  like  he  ended  up
[23:15] looking  into 
 a  bunch  of  uh  six  really  really
[23:20] successful  people  he's  talking  about 
 billionaires  right  and  he  said  they've 
 got  three  traits  in  common  they  have  a
[23:25] superiority  complex  they're  very 
 insecure  and  they  also  have  impulse
[23:30] control 
 so  they  think  they're  better  than 
 everyone  else  but  they've  got  deep 
 rooted  insecurity  that  they  feel  like
[23:35] they  need  to  prove  it  and  they've  got 
 impulse  control  so  that  they're  able  to 
 delay  gratification  that  makes  a
[23:41] billionaire 
 these  two  things  are  psychological 
 things  that's  a  different  video  but 
 impulse  control  is  33  of  being  a
[23:49] billionaire  of  being  a  millionaire 
 whatever  success  that  you  want  a  lot  of 
 it's  going  to  come  from  you  literally
[23:54] just  choosing  to  wait  for  the  long-term 
 goal  isn't  it  right  it's  going  to  be 
 delayed  gratification 
 mindfulness  is  delayed  gratification
[24:01] mindfulness  lets  you  delay  gratification 
 if  there's  one  major  thing  that  allows
[24:06] you  to  choose  that  that  second 
 marshmallow  it's  mindfulness
[24:11] and  so  practice  Mindful  and  stop 
 meditating  so  there's  a  free  app  that 
 you  can  use  and  it's  called  medito  and
[24:17] you  can  also  just  follow  my  meditation 
 it's  a  video  on  YouTube  just  search 
 Hamza  10  minute  meditation  onto  YouTube
[24:23] where  I  literally  just  tell  you  to 
 breathe  alongside  me  so  it's  literally 
 just  me  every  three  seconds  just  saying
[24:28] like  breathe 
 exhale  inhale  exhale  and  just  follow 
 along  and  you  like  deep  breathe  with  me
[24:33] and  you  can  follow  that  or  you  can  use 
 the  app  that  I  use  which  is  medito 
 m-e-d-i-t-o  and  that's  a  really  really
[24:39] good  app 
 my  lights  just  like  stopped  working  this 
 this  is  [ __ ]  low  budget  Productions
[24:45] honestly  I'm  here  I've  got  allergies  I 
 keep  like  using  [ __ ]  toilet  paper  to
[24:50] wipe  my  allergies  on  there 
 so 
 there  is  then  a  book  breaking  the  cycle
[24:57] by  George  Collins  and  he  spoke  about  a 
 support  system  so  having  people  like
[25:02] other  people  who  can  help  you  overcome 
 this  addiction  this  feels  cringe 
 honestly  I  don't  have  the  confidence  to
[25:08] ask  someone  in  my  real  life  hi  I've  got 
 a  porn  addiction  can  you  help  me  but
[25:13] this  is  why  I  think  internet  communities 
 are  really  good  because  if  you  go  on  to 
 for  example  there's  subreddits  for  this
[25:19] this  online  blogs  for  this  this  Discord 
 like  my  I've  got  a  big  Discord  server 
 you  can  just  find  the  link  somewhere
[25:25] that's  got  200  000  guys  in  and  some  you 
 know  there's  a  page  for  on  there  for
[25:30] like  nofap  and  everything  I've  got  a 
 private  Community  which  is  like  super 
 [ __ ]  expensive  so  you  probably  can't 
 afford  it  but  in  there  we'll  speak  about
[25:36] these  things  as  well  and  people  get  to 
 like  actually  hop  on  a  video  call  with 
 me  and  ask  me  questions  when  you  have  a
[25:41] support  network  when  you  have  like  other 
 people  who  can  help  you  with  this  and 
 mostly  honestly  when  you  can  just  speak
[25:46] to  someone  and  kind  of  have  someone 
 who's  more  experienced  than  you  guide 
 you  through  the  like  the  thing  that  you
[25:53] need  to  do  that  becomes  really  valuable 
 but  I  actually  genuinely  think  that  but
[25:58] this  is  going  to  be  controversial  as 
 [ __ ]  but  honestly  I  I  genuinely  think 
 that  getting  coaching  from  someone  is 
 more  valuable  than  therapy  therapy  is
[26:04] very  rishy  washy  we're  not  going  to  do 
 any  practical  [ __ ]  it's  very  feminine 
 right  coaching  is  like  okay  you  will
[26:09] tell  me  what  the  problem  is  and  I  would 
 sit  here  and  listen  to  you 
 and  you'd  ask  me  like  and  you  know  so
[26:14] this  is  why  I'm  struggling  I  just  keep 
 you  know  fapping  every  three  days  every 
 time  you  know  like  I  go  on  to  Reddit  do
[26:19] you  think  I  should  stop  using  Reddit 
 and  a  good  coach  would  say
[26:24] what  do  you  think 
 and  you'll  say  yeah  I  should  probably 
 stop  using  Reddit  because  you  know 
 that's  that's  when  I  stop  you  know  I
[26:29] should  probably  stop  using  Tick  Tock 
 because  that's  when  I  that's  when  I  fap 
 but  like  you  know  I've  got  to  use  tick
[26:34] tock  for  my  business  that  a  good  coach 
 would  say 
 is  there  a  way  that  you  can  still  use 
 tick  tock  for  your  business  but  you
[26:40] wouldn't  be  in  the  vulnerable  situation 
 of  ending  up  watching  porn  oh  yeah  well 
 you  know  there's  this  other  app  where
[26:46] you  can't  even  see  any  of  the  content  on 
 Tick  Tock  or  I  can  use  the  tick  tock 
 website  actually  and  you  can't  even  see 
 anything  there  I  can  just  upload  it
[26:52] there  actually  I  can  try  that  from  now 
 on  like  that  when  you've  got  like  people 
 especially  someone  who's  who's  multiple
[26:58] steps  ahead  of  you  and  you  get  to  ask 
 him  for  advice  it's  like  he's  already 
 paved  the  way  he's  cleared  the  jungle
[27:04] already  so  all  you  have  to  do  is  just  do 
 what  he  says  and  if  he's  like  a  good 
 enough  coach  or  Mentor  that's  fantastic
[27:09] this  is  Again  by  the  same  guy  I  [ __ ] 
 love  Alexi  bro  but  by  the  same  guy  he  is
[27:14] right  now  the  biggest  advocator  for 
 investing  into  mentorships  and  coaching
[27:19] to  spend  money  his  words  is  spend 
 aggressively  on  mental  ships  coaching
[27:24] Community 
 um  education  all  this  stuff  right  and 
 I'm  not  even  just  bringing  this  up  just 
 because  I  sell  my  old  stuff  here  with  my
[27:30] stuff  really  [ __ ]  expensive  so  you 
 probably  can't  afford  it  most  people 
 can't  afford  it  but  that's  fine  because 
 my  private  Community  only  has  like  200
[27:36] guys  in  which  means  that  okay  we're 
 actually  very  close  to  each  other  for 
 reference  so  my  private  Community  Adonis
[27:41] Academy  has  200  guys  we're  close  it's 
 our  support  system  where  people  can  come 
 in  and  speak  about  things  like  porn 
 addiction  my  Discord  Community  has  200
[27:49] 000  guys  we're  not  close  in  there  it's 
 just  like  a  big  [ __ ]  Global  platform 
 so  that's  why  I  genuinely  think  if
[27:55] you've  got  the  money  for  it  right  now 
 you  should  look  for  like  some  kind  of 
 porn  community  and  I'm  not  even  just
[28:00] saying  mine  mine  isn't  really 
 specifically  about  porn  mines  just  like 
 self-improvement  for  men  come  meet  me  in
[28:05] person  hop  on  video  calls  with  me  and 
 stuff  but  I'm  sure  that  there's  going  to 
 be  I've  not  joined  any  but  I'm  sure 
 there's  going  to  be  like  some  actual
[28:10] like  anti  like  you  know  quitting  porn 
 um  communities  mentorships  coaching  if  I
[28:16] if  you  had  like  a  hundred  dollars  or  if 
 I  had  100  100  bro  I'd  be  literally 
 looking  online  right  now  finding  someone
[28:21] who's  giving  good  porn  advice  and 
 literally  going  on  to  calls  with  them 
 asking  them  to  Mentor  me  seeing  if
[28:26] they've  got  some  programs  and  culture 
 courses  and  stuff  and  just  you'd  want  to 
 be  around  other  people  who  are  going
[28:31] through  the  same  problem  especially  to 
 be  leaded  by  someone  who  has  already
[28:36] solved  the  problem  that  you're  going 
 through  so  I  think  a  support  system  is 
 is  10  out  of  10  and  if  you've  got  the
[28:42] money  for  it  Go  and  invest  in  one  if  not 
 there's  so  many  free  Discord  servers  out 
 there  and  you  can  literally  just  you
[28:47] know  message  people  and  hop  on  calls 
 with  them  and  make  your  own  support 
 system  for  free
[28:52] foreign 
 thing  which  it  it  reminds  me  here  is
[28:57] Jordan  Peterson  said  that  you  have  to 
 take  responsibility  for  your  life  and 
 you  cannot  blame  addictions  and  problems
[29:03] and  adversities  onto  other  people 
 because 
 it's  it's  very  easy  at  this  point  when
[29:09] we're  talking  about  support  system  to  to 
 get  upset  here  a  lot  of  guys  will  do 
 this  like  you  know  they'll  be  like  oh
[29:14] woe  is  me  I  don't  have  anyone  and 
 you  can't  you  have  to  take 
 responsibility  for  that  honestly  I  don't
[29:20] think  there's  a  reason  right  now  for  you 
 to  not  have  some  kind  of  support  system 
 or  online  community  like  there's  so  many
[29:26] online  for  free  but  literally  not  mine 
 but  I'm  just  saying  this  free 
 communities  you  should  be  like  a  social
[29:32] active  part  of  at  least  one  of  those 
 because  social  connection  having  a
[29:37] support  system  having  people  you  can 
 speak  to  about  your  problems  having 
 other  people  that  you  can  help  it's  one
[29:42] of  the  most  important  parts  of  life  if 
 you  ever  looked  at  research  for  like 
 life  happiness  literally  always  at  the
[29:47] top  is  social  connection  it's  literally 
 just  having  people  in  your  life  and  so 
 many  guys  just  live  these  These  Quiet
[29:53] lives  of  desperation  so  many  guys  just 
 live  lonely  alone 
 like  you're  an  island
[29:58] men  are  not  meant  to  be  Islands
[30:03] the  porn  myth  by  Matt  farad
[30:08] foreign 
 so  one  of  the  things  in  this  book  was 
 that  he  mentioned  that  we  should  just
[30:14] learn  more  about  addiction  like 
 addiction  science  and
[30:19] when  I  was  reading  like  I  read  a  summary 
 of  This  Book  and  I  read  somewhere  okay 
 Matt  frad  the  porn  myth
[30:25] to  learn  more  about  addictions  I  think 
 there's  one  guy  that  we  should  go  to  and 
 it  is  Andrew  huberman  you've  probably
[30:31] seen  him  before  the  YouTube  channel  is 
 huberman  lab 
 h-u-b-e-r-m-a-n  huberman  Lab  and  he  has
[30:38] a  bunch  of  full-length  podcasts  this  is 
 literally  one  of  the  best  podcasters  in 
 the  entire  world  but  in  my  opinion  and
[30:43] he's  got  multiple  full-length  podcasts 
 one  on  an  addiction  in  general  where  he
[30:48] explains  like  what  happens  to  your 
 neurons  and  everything  and  it  sounds 
 complex  but  when  he's  explaining  it  to 
 you  and  you  get  this  like  knowledge  this
[30:54] aha  moment  it's  like  oh  that's  why  that 
 thing  is  happening  to  me  so  oh  okay  so  I
[31:00] could  probably  do  this  thing  instead  and 
 that  thing  wouldn't  happen  to  me  you 
 know  you  it's  education  think  about  how
[31:05] like  you've  always  heard  of  how 
 important  education  is  and  not  like  the 
 school  system  but  just  how  important 
 knowledge  and  wisdom  is  Right  you've
[31:10] always  heard  this  and  so  we  can  go  get 
 this  [ __ ]  for  free  online  so  huberman 
 has  one  on  on  addiction  he's  got
[31:17] multiply  I  think  on  specific  porn  if 
 you're  watching  this  video  right  now  and 
 you're  still  struggling  with  Porn  Bro
[31:22] and  you've  not  watched  this  podcast 
 you're  literally  it's  all  for  free  it's 
 genuinely  for  free  it's  worth  thousands
[31:27] of  dollars  to  watch  a  few  of  his 
 episodes  go  search  up  huberman  lad  lab 
 porn  addiction  and  just  go  see  like
[31:34] literally  the  full  left  ones  just  put 
 them  on  whilst  you  eat  put  them  on 
 whilst  you're  just  kind  of  like  you  know 
 just  wait  waiting  around  for  something
[31:39] put  them  on  whilst  you  commute  in  whilst 
 you're  running  and  stuff  like  well  I 
 don't  know  why  people  wouldn't  go  and
[31:44] get  like  a  really  good  knowledge  on  the 
 problem  that  they're  they're  trying  to 
 solve  these  days  so  learn  about
[31:49] addiction 
 the  next  book  is  pornography  at 
 pornography  am  I  saying  that  weird
[31:55] pornography  addiction  breaking  the 
 chains  by  David  J
[32:00] and  he  mentioned  like  this  psychological 
 like  he  he  said  to  practice
[32:05] self-compassion 
 to  essentially  understand  like  we're
[32:11] actually  going  through  something 
 difficult  here 
 and  that  we  should  feel
[32:17] positive  and  caring  about  ourselves 
 self-compassion  is  something  that
[32:22] honestly  sounds  like  it's  for  [ __ ] 
 doesn't  it  it  sounds  like  it's  like  some 
 wheat  [ __ ]  but  honestly  it's  actually
[32:27] something  that  I  think  I'm  very  high  in 
 so  I  think  in  in  a  lot  of  ways  I  have  a
[32:32] lot  of  masculine  like  hard  discipline 
 traits  like  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  [ __ ]  go 
 and  do  the  work  but  I  also  have  a  very
[32:37] high  level  of  self-compassion  that  when 
 I'm  going  through  something  difficult  I 
 put  it  into  perspective  and  realize  like
[32:43] oh  this  is  actually  quite  an  uphill 
 battle  this  is  actually  like  you  know
[32:48] like  I'm  just  being  fair  it  is  actually 
 hard  so  when  I  was  trying  to  quit  porn 
 and  when  I  was  also  trying  to  quit 
 social  media  and  I  kept  on  failing  I
[32:54] kept  on  relapsing  and  you  know  there  was 
 points  when  I  would  like  belittle  myself 
 there  was  points  when  I  would  actually
[32:59] say  negative  things  about  myself 
 you  probably  are  doing  the  exact  same 
 right  so  that  that  [ __ ]  exact
[33:05] situation  where  I'd  wake  up  I'd  stay 
 lying  down  in  bed  sideways  just
[33:10] scrolling  and  scrolling  and  scrolling 
 and  hoping  to  find  porn  and  oh  look 
 there's  porn  I'll  click  on  this  name 
 here  I'll  click  on  this  profile  I'll  do
[33:16] this  you  know  you  go  down  the  [ __ ] 
 Rabbit  Hole  we've  all  been  there  by  the 
 end  of  it  you're  looking  at  some  like 
 big  titty  Asian  woman  or  something  like
[33:23] that  you  know  you're  just  down  the 
 rabbit  hole  and  after  you've  messed  up 
 on  this  goal  I  often  did  like  a  straight
[33:29] like  honestly  it  got  to  the  point  when  I 
 wasn't  even  getting  post  nut  Clarity  I
[33:35] was  getting 
 intranut  Clarity  with  with  the  the 
 negative  thoughts  would  happen  as  I  was
[33:42] literally  nothing  like  I  literally  like 
 I'm  not  trying  to  get  detailed  but  in 
 the  moments  of  climax  that's  when  the
[33:49] negative  thought  I  didn't  even  get  like 
 the  10  seconds  of  bliss  anymore  bro  so  I
[33:54] started  to  feel  [ __ ]  what  the  [ __ ]  am  I 
 doing  shame  and  like  oh  this  is  gross  oh 
 like  you're  a  [ __ ]  loser  and  you're
[33:59] like  oh  I'm  so  power  left  towards  this 
 you  know  these  things  that  we  say  to 
 ourselves  is  that  gonna  help  you  think
[34:04] about  it  if  you're  convincing  yourself 
 that  you're  a  loser  that  you're 
 powerless  that  this  is  of  such  a  huge
[34:09] problem  is  that  gonna  help  you  to  feel 
 like  the  kind  of  guy  who  doesn't  need 
 porn
[34:14] because  the  kind  of  guy  who  needs  porn 
 usually  feels  like  a  bit  of  a  loser 
 and  so  telling  our  like  belittling
[34:20] ourselves  I  realized  wasn't  gonna  work 
 and  around  the  time  when  I  was  like  19 
 or  something  that's  when  I  started  to
[34:26] really  practice  a  lot  more 
 self-compassion  and  I  had  like  this  this 
 childlike  energy  come  back  to  me  where  I
[34:32] started  to  understand  the  problems  I  was 
 going  through  and  realized  like  I  have 
 to  be  my  own  best  friend  and  like  I'm
[34:37] gonna  push  myself  hard  and  I'm  gonna  get 
 annoyed  when  like  I'm  being  a  [ __ ]  but 
 at  the  same  time  I  I  do  want  to  be  nice
[34:44] to  myself  I  want  to  have  like  a  nice 
 positive  like  healthy  happy  Pleasant
[34:49] joyful  cheerful  mind  as  many  times  as 
 possible  because  I  don't  want  to  live  in
[34:54] a  state  of  like  constant  like  negativity 
 it's  just  not  how  I  wanted  to  live  and 
 so  I  started  to  actually  like  I  started
[35:00] to  speak  to  myself  in  a  way  that 
 honestly  most  people  watching  maybe  not
[35:05] this  but  like  most  people  in  general 
 would  find  it  so  cringe  and 
 uncomfortable  honestly  I  started  to 
 speak  to  myself  as  if  I  was  a  [ __ ]
[35:12] Legend  I  know  it's  gonna  sound  cringe 
 but  literally  the  term  like  alpha  male 
 meant  a  lot  to  me  this  was  when  I  was  18
[35:17] or  19.  I  I  had  lived  my  entire  life  like 
 a  [ __ ]  loser  okay  I  had  literally 
 been  the  the  guy  who'd  been  playing
[35:23] video  games  who  never  was  able  to  like 
 even  speak  to  girls  never  mind  actually 
 attract  them  the  few  times  I  had
[35:28] confidence  and  enough  to  go  and  speak  to 
 a  girl  I'd  [ __ ]  it  up  so  badly  you  know 
 I  I  really  had  a  lot  of  negativity  I
[35:33] didn't  do  well  in  school  so  my  parents 
 used  to  [ __ ]  beat  my  ass  so  I  you 
 know  I  had  a  lot  of  reasons  to  be
[35:38] negative  and  so  I  could  listen  to 
 everyone  else  and  be  like  this  [ __ ] 
 mundane  guy  who  doesn't  even  think
[35:44] positive  about  himself  because  that's  a 
 bit  cringe  and  it  makes  people 
 uncomfortable  or  I  could  start  to  delude 
 myself  and  think  yeah  I'm  a  [ __ ]
[35:50] Legend  I  would  look  at  myself  in  the 
 mirror  and  say  I'm  a  legend  I  would  Flex 
 my  muscles  when  I  didn't  I  wasn't  even
[35:55] that  big  and  I  would  literally  say  to 
 myself  yeah  I'm  such  an  animal  for  male 
 and  stuff  and  this  sounds  so  [ __ ]
[36:00] cringe  to  like  the  heartless 
 [ __ ]  out  there  who  don't  expect 
 like  they  don't  know  what  we're  actually 
 going  through  because  I'm  telling  you
[36:05] right  now  that  if  you're  anything  like 
 me  doing  this  in  private  and  you  don't 
 have  to  tell  anyone  you  don't  have  to 
 show  anyone  but  the  next  time  you  walk
[36:10] in  front  of  a  mirror  literally  think  to 
 yourself  like  yeah  I  am  a  [ __ ]  Legend 
 look  at  the  type  of  content  that  I'm
[36:15] consuming  compared  to  my  friends  who  are 
 still  Jeffries  I'm  actually  trying  to 
 quit  watching  porn  when  over  2  billion
[36:21] men  in  the  world  are  completely 
 complacent  with  it  I'm  gonna  be 
 successful  as  [ __ ]  I  am  a  legend  I  am  a
[36:27] beast  I  am  an  alpha  male  and  and  this 
 sounds  so  cringe  but  it  helped  me  it  I 
 wouldn't  be  here  today  if  I  didn't  do
[36:32] these  cringe  affirmations  if  I  didn't 
 like  in  a  cringe  way  consider  myself  to 
 be  like  an  alpha  male  before  I  was  one  I
[36:38] was  still  a  [ __ ]  I  was  still  an 
 alcoholic  I  was  addicted  to  drugs  at  the 
 time  when  I  was  saying  this  I  didn't
[36:43] even  have  that  much  muscle  that  I  was 
 flexing  but  it  helped  because  suddenly 
 when  I  would  say  these  things  to  myself
[36:48] it's  like  I  wanted  to  then  ingrain  this 
 new  identity  this  new  personality  these 
 habits  to  make  this  real
[36:54] and  so  then  I'd  go  to  the  gym  straight 
 afterwards  and  so  then  I'd  throw  my 
 phone  away  you  know  when  I  was  thinking
[36:59] about  watching  porn  and  I'm  just  doing 
 the  death  scroll  start  like  suddenly 
 like  the  cringe  thought  the  cringe
[37:04] thought  would  pop  into  my  mind  as  I'm 
 scrolling  I  throw  the  phone  away  but 
 like  yeah  I'm  not  some  beta  male  who's 
 gonna  start  watching  porn  again  I'm  not
[37:10] a  beta  male  I'm  not  a  beta  male 
 and  it  helped  I  never  told  anyone  I  was 
 thinking  about  these  things  up  until  I
[37:16] started  this  YouTube  channel  and  I'm 
 like  I'm  past  doing  that  now  because 
 I've  just  you  know  it's  a  part  of  my
[37:21] personality  I  am  who  I  am  now  and  I've 
 already  made  in  like  fantastic  progress 
 but  I'm  telling  you  right  now  if  I
[37:27] listened  to  all  these  [ __ ]  who  are 
 telling  you  that  this  is  cringe  that  you 
 shouldn't  like  talk  highly  of  yourself
[37:32] that  you  should  just  like  belittle 
 yourself  that  if  you  talk  about  your 
 successes  that's  a  bad  thing  you're 
 egotistical  the  amount  of  people  who've
[37:38] called  me  egotistical  arrogant 
 narcissist  and  they're  all  still  [ __ ] 
 losers
[37:43] but  I'm  actually  loving  my  life  now  so 
 you  can  choose  you  can  be  the  guy  who's 
 in  safety  who's  so  reserved  because
[37:49] there's  a  few  people  who  are  judging  you 
 every  time  you've  tried  to  show  a  bit 
 more  confidence  there's  a  few  people  who 
 judge  you  so  you  can  be  in  their  cage
[37:54] for  the  rest  of  your  life  if  you  want  or 
 you  can  destroy  their  perceptions  of  you
[37:59] and  go  live  the  life  that  you  actually 
 want  you  need  to  destroy  someone's 
 perceptions  either  you  destroy  yourself
[38:04] and  live  a  [ __ ]  shell  of  a  life  or 
 you  destroy  the  perceptions  of  the  of 
 the  people  that  you  don't  even  like
[38:09] anyway  who  are  saying  that  you  know 
 trying  to  be  ultra  confident  is  a  bad 
 thing  especially  for  young  men
[38:15] especially  when  you're  just  trying  to 
 find  yourself  and  you  need  like  an  extra 
 wind  in  your  life  you  need  like  an  extra
[38:20] like  gust  like  some  fire  in  your  belly 
 you  need  to  think  of  yourself  highly  in
[38:26] the  modern  day  this  has  scene  is  so  bad 
 but  I'm  telling  you  right  now  every  King 
 every  great  leader  saw  themselves  as  as
[38:33] almost  like  a  living  God  every  single 
 one  you  don't  get  to  a  place  of  of
[38:38] superiority  without  that  this  bell  curve 
 of  of  we  can  say  ego  you  need  to  get  to
[38:45] the  top  of  this  bell  curve  of  like 
 literally  you  know  saying  I'm  the  best 
 I'm  the  greatest  bro  go  watch  any  go
[38:50] watch  any  [ __ ]  athlete  that  you  look 
 up  to  there's  gonna  be  a  period  you  can 
 watch  in  their  interviews  where  they're 
 literally  saying  I'm  the  best  ever  I'm
[38:56] the  greatest  God  put  me  on  this  Earth  to 
 be  to  win  this  sport  every  single  one  of 
 them  every  great  little  leader  every
[39:02] conqueror  has  been  at  the  top  of  this 
 bell  curve  of  like  of 
 self-compassion  to  a  level  that's
[39:08] narcissistic  and  then  once  you  start  to 
 get  because  that's  what  causes  the 
 success  right  that's  our  feeling  of
[39:14] superiority  that  Alexa  Mosey  talks  about 
 that's  what  causes  the  success  it's  this 
 this  arrogant  self-belief  that  you  you
[39:20] deserve  more  so  I  will  get  there  because 
 that  causes  this  weird  feeling  where 
 you're  right  wait  I  don't  I'm  not  there 
 just  yet  and  there's  extra  attention  so
[39:26] you  get  there  eventually  and  so  every 
 guy  goes  to  the  top  of  this  bell  curve 
 and  then  you  start  to  get  the  success
[39:32] that  you  wanted  all  this  time  and  then 
 you  kind  of  level  off  and  you  don't 
 really  need  to  use  this  like  alpha  male
[39:37] personality  anymore  and  you  just  are  who 
 you  are  because  now  you've  already 
 achieved  this  success  and  maybe  we  when
[39:42] you  go  down  a  little  bit  and  you're 
 achieving  the  success  naturally  maybe 
 you  should  consider  getting  [ __ ]  10
[39:47] times  more  arrogant  again  because  that's 
 what  caused  the  success  in  the  first  but 
 who  knows  but  I'm  telling  you  right  now
[39:52] most  guys  that  I  every  guy  that  I  know 
 has  been  at  the  top  of  this  belt  covert 
 at  some  point  and  a  lot  of  them  won't
[39:57] ever  admit  it  because  it  sounds  cringe 
 to  say  like  you  have  to  be  arrogant  to 
 be  narcissistic  because  we  know  that
[40:02] weak  people  in  the  modern  day  don't 
 don't  really  respect  that 
 but  it's  for  your  own  benefit
[40:08] you  should  you  should  be  so 
 self-compassionate 
 that  people  think  you're  weird  for  how
[40:14] much  you  love  you  that  the  average 
 mediocre  person  thinks  you're  weird
[40:20] the  power  of  meaning  by 
 Emily  s  fonte  so  this  was  this  was  just
[40:27] about  addiction  and  like  recovery  from 
 like  drugs  and  stuff  in  general 
 but  I  like  this  one  because  this  was
[40:33] actually  one  of  the  few  porn  addiction 
 books  that  I  could  find  that  actually 
 mentioned  meaning  and  purpose
[40:40] so  we  should  find  meaning  and  purpose  in 
 our  lives
[40:47] and  I  don't  really  just  want  to 
 I  don't  want  to  actually  summarize  what
[40:52] purpose  is  I  recorded  a  one  and  a  half 
 hour  video  where  I  explained  purpose
[40:58] it's  on  my  channel  I'm  not  gonna  I  can't 
 be  bothered  to  link  it  or  anything  but 
 it's  on  my  channel  and  it's  just  called
[41:03] um  how  purpose  works  full  guide  to 
 purpose  something  like  that  you  can 
 literally  just  go  search  onto  YouTube 
 hamster  purpose  and  they'll  pop  up  and  I
[41:08] highly  recommend  you  watch  that  I  spent 
 quite  a  while  I  spent  about  a  week 
 preparing  my  thoughts  for  that  video  and
[41:14] if  you've  ever  heard  of  the  term  before 
 like  purpose  and  you've  heard  it  with 
 guys  in  my  niche  in  my  area  you  probably
[41:19] are  interested  and  it  probably  would 
 help  you  when  you  find  your  purpose 
 things  start  to  align  in  a  very  very
[41:25] nice  way 
 the  porn  addiction  Cure  by  Joshua  shear
[41:30] he  said  create  healthy  habits  and  so 
 this  is  similar  to  what  we  were  talking 
 about  before  with  the  um  the  healthier
[41:37] ways  to  cope  I  think  we  can  just  merge 
 these  two  but  create  healthy  habits 
 literally  just  you  know  set  up  the  day
[41:43] like  I  said  with  the  the  military 
 timetable  and  if  you're  interested  in 
 that  when  I  was  talking  before  about  the
[41:48] military  timetable  the  the  calendar  and 
 everything  that's  the  monk  mode  video 
 that  I  recently  posted  on  my  channel  so
[41:54] you  can  go  have  a  look  at  that  so  we'll 
 skip  this  one  but  what  I  will  say  is  one 
 thing  that  I  learned  from  Atomic  Habits
[42:00] by  James  Clear  was  that  perhaps  one  of 
 the  best  ways  to  actually  get  rid  of  a
[42:05] bad  habit  so  you  know  porn  and  fapping 
 is  a  bad  habit  one  of  the  best  ways  to 
 get  rid  of  it  is  to  simply  just  replace
[42:12] it  not  like  just  get  rid  of  it  you  know 
 I  try  to  I  try  to  sorry  to  get  rid  of  my
[42:18] Pawn  addiction  right  my  fapping 
 addiction  I  tried  to  get  rid  of  it 
 without  replacing  it  with  anything  and 
 so  I  found  myself  in  the  exact  literally
[42:25] imagine  that  right  imagine  the  guy  who's 
 trying  to  equip  Pawn  but  he's  lying  down 
 underneath  his  covers  and  scrolling  on
[42:30] the  exact  social  media  that  he  usually 
 jacks  off  to 
 it's  not  gonna  work  is  it  so  I  try  to
[42:36] get  rid  of  the  bad  habit  without 
 implementing  a  new  one  and  it  was 
 interesting  that  actually  when  I  started
[42:41] to  go  to  the  gym  in  the  mornings  so 
 first  thing  in  the  morning  I'd  wake  up 
 I'd  poop  I'd  brush  my  teeth  and  I'd  go
[42:46] train  fasted  right  when  I  started  to  do 
 that  and  so  obviously  I  wasn't  going  to 
 spend  time  like  you  know  lying  down  in
[42:51] bed  because  I  just  wanted  to  wake  up  and 
 go  work  out 
 I  stopped  fapping  anywhere  near  as  much
[42:57] replace  the  bad  habits  for  the  good  one 
 so  think  about  right  now  what  it  what  is 
 like  the  Habit  that  the  often  time  that
[43:04] you  fap  maybe  it's  a  specific  time  it's 
 a  specific  area  it's  the  apps  that  you 
 use  it's  a  specific  feeling  that's  a
[43:09] habit  right  replace  that  habit  with 
 something  for  me  it  was  easy  because  I 
 usually  would  wake  up  and  fap  and  so  all
[43:14] I  had  to  do  was  just  wake  up  and  go  to 
 the  gym  instead  for  you  let's  say  if  you 
 end  up  fapping  at  like  6  p.m  you  or
[43:20] every  differently  there's  going  to  be 
 something  that's  consistent  something 
 that's  habitual  maybe  it's  the  feeling
[43:25] that  you  get  maybe  it's  the  thought 
 maybe  it's  some  kind  of  trigger  that 
 you're  on  YouTube  and  you  see  this  this 
 thumbnail  or  you  know  you  go  onto  social
[43:30] media  you're  just  scrolling  and 
 scrolling  and  scrolling  oh  there's  a 
 girl  doing  a  little  [ __ ]  Tick  Tock 
 dance  or  something  and  that's  what  ends
[43:36] up  triggering  you  see  what  the  Habit  is 
 and  see  if  you  can  replace  it  with 
 something  that's  healthier  especially  if
[43:41] you  can  do  it  at  the  same  time  so  a  lot 
 of  people  for  example 
 they'll  fap  before  they  go  to  bed  and
[43:46] this  this  is  really  bad  for  you  you  end 
 up  staying  up  late  you  end  up  like 
 fapping  with  the  like  the  connection
[43:52] built  to  sleeping  and  So  eventually  a 
 lot  of  these  guys  who  always  fat  before 
 going  to  bed  always  end  up  saying  the
[43:57] same  thing  like  oh  but  I  can't  fap  if  I 
 go  to  bed  if  I  can't  go  to  bed  if  I 
 don't  fap  and  to  them  if  this  is  you
[44:02] just  quickly  I've  made  a  video  about 
 this  actually  ages  ago  so  you  can  just 
 go  search  up  on  YouTube  like  Hamza  I
[44:08] can't  sleep  if  I  don't  fap  something 
 like  that  and  I  I  end  up  explaining  this 
 specific  concept  here  of  like  no  no  if
[44:13] you've  built  up  the  link  of  like  fapping 
 and  going  to  sleep  now  you  can't  go  to 
 sleep  without  fapping  right  but  all  you
[44:18] really  need  to  do  like  I  wouldn't  even 
 think  about  quitting  porn  anymore
[44:23] honestly  because  it  was  only  when  I 
 stopped  thinking  about  it  and  I  started
[44:28] to  just  think  about  the  positive  habits 
 and  then  like  the  good  things  I  wanted 
 to  add  to  my  life  that's  when  I  made
[44:33] real  progress  honestly  so  I  think 
 focusing  on  the  negative  focusing  on 
 like  the  fact  that  you  know  we  need  to
[44:38] get  to  day  12  or  something  I  don't  think 
 that's  good  for  you  I  really  don't  and 
 I've  got  so  many  videos  on  my  channel
[44:43] where  I've  explained  in  this  and  I  still 
 want  every  man  in  the  world  to  know  this 
 I  don't  think  it's  good  to  see  yourself
[44:48] as  someone  who's  trying  to  quit  porn  I 
 don't  think  it's  good  being  a  guy  who's 
 on  nofap  I  really  don't  think  it's  good
[44:54] for  you  because  by  by  the  nature  think 
 about  it  by  how  you're  identifying  with 
 yourself  you're  literally  seeing
[45:01] yourself  as  a  guy  who's  got  a  problem 
 that's  hard  what  we  need  to  do  is  see 
 ourselves  as  guys  who  don't  even  think
[45:07] about  porn  or  fapping  like  it's  not  even 
 a  thing  in  our  lives  genuinely  I'm 
 telling  you  right  now  I  don't  get  like
[45:13] the  thought  that  I  should  fap  it's  not 
 something  that  even  happens  to  my  brain
[45:18] because  I'm  not  trying  to  quit  fapping  I 
 just  don't  do  it  it's  like  I  don't  go
[45:23] through  the  the  day  craving  a  cigarette 
 right  you  probably  don't  right  you  don't 
 go  through  the  day  craving  a  cigarette
[45:28] you  don't  go  through  a  day  craving  the 
 next  hit  of  [ __ ]  heroin  or  some  [ __ ] 
 right
[45:33] that's  how  you  like  you  want  it  to  be 
 the  same  thing  where  it's  like  you  don't 
 even  get  the  craving  for  it  and  the  way
[45:38] that  you  do  that  is  by  stopping 
 obsessing  over  the  negative  habit  of 
 like  oh  man  I  really  hope  I  don't  fap
[45:43] again  I'm  like  you  know  get  grabbing  a 
 knife  and  etching  what  day  of  nofap  you 
 are  on  your  on  your  wall  or  something
[45:48] stop  the  identification  with  these  these 
 bad  habits  and  just  start  focusing
[45:53] entirely  on  the  self-improvement  that 
 you  wanted  to  do  anyway  so  whatever  time
[45:58] you  usually  fap  whatever  mood  you're  in 
 whatever  like  you  know  the  environment's 
 like  change  it  so  that  it's  something
[46:03] healthy  it  can  be  as  simple  as  like 
 whenever  you  feel  like  fapping  go  do  100 
 push-ups  go  challenge  yourself  to  to  do
[46:09] 100  push-ups  that's  harder  than  it  seems 
 it's  way  harder  than  it  seems  you  do 
 this  you're  gonna  build  up  a  chest  and
[46:14] also  quit  flapping  at  the  same  time  but 
 in  my  opinion  something  better  is  to  do 
 something  very  consistent  throughout  the
[46:20] day  like  I  mentioned  with  that  military 
 routine  so  like  everything  is  just  set 
 when  your  whole  day  like  the  [ __ ]
[46:25] don't  like  this  advice  but  when  your 
 whole  day  is  productive  you  just  have  so 
 much  less  space  to  actually  care  about
[46:30] watching  porn  anyway 
 and  the  myth  of  sex  addiction  by  David
[46:39] J  lay  talks  about  how  again  it's  like
[46:44] it's  the  support  system  but  this  one 
 actually  went  into  a  lot  more  about  how 
 like  specifically  other  people  can  kind
[46:51] of  make  us  feel  involved  in  our 
 community 
 to  then  we'll  once  a  few  like  like  fap
[46:58] less  so  what  I  mean  by  this  is  this  book 
 taught  me  that
[47:04] I  want  you  to  imagine  right  now  if  you 
 had  a  vibrant  Social  Circle  if  you
[47:09] really  did  have  good  friends  who  are 
 messaging  you  right  now  like  good 
 friends  right  if  you  had  a  good  family 
 family  who  eat  dinner  together  every
[47:16] single  day  and  they  say  grace  and  you 
 know  like  if  you  had  a  this  type  of 
 Social  Circle  and  you  had  an  awesome
[47:21] let's  say  wife  right 
 you'd  probably  be  a  lot  less  likely  to 
 fap  and  watch  porn
[47:27] often  we're  watching  porn  because  of 
 some  kind  of  lack  aren't  we  because  we 
 don't  have  these  things  because  we've
[47:32] got  kind  of  like  a  broken  family  we've 
 got  friends  that  aren't  really  that 
 amazing  and  you  know  like  we're  not  even
[47:38] that  close  to  our  friends  we're  not  even 
 like  100  honest  with  them  these  days  and 
 we've  got  maybe  we  don't  even  have  a
[47:43] girlfriend  or  a  wife  or  we're  not  even 
 close  to  that  and  so  we're  lacking  a  lot 
 of  like  the  tribal  feeling  that  we  were
[47:49] supposed  to  have  you  know  humans  would 
 have  meant  to  be  on  being  tribes  of  150
[47:54] for  all  of  like  our  existence  we've 
 always  been  in  tribes  and  in  the  last 
 like  100  years  200  years  we  now  live  in
[48:01] cities  and  towns  and  Villages  that  are 
 packed  which  have  got  millions  of  people 
 and  actually  we've  got  less  people  in
[48:07] our  tribe  because  of  that 
 and  that's  not  good  for  us  there's  a  lot
[48:13] of  support  that  comes  from  having  a 
 tribe  and  so  you  should  do  what  it  takes 
 I've  got  some  some  videos  again  on  my  on
[48:19] my  channel  where  I've  talked  about 
 building  up  a  try  but  so  you  should  try 
 and  do  what  it  takes  the  way  I  would
[48:24] explain  this  in  a  step-by-step  process 
 is  start  by  learning  some  good  social 
 skills  because  a  lot  of  people's  social
[48:29] skills  aren't  actually  that  good  so 
 keep  this  book  next  to  you  at  all  times
[48:35] How  to  Win  Friends  and  Influence  People 
 keep  it  next  to  you  go  through  this  book
[48:40] and  literally  read  this  book  like  50 
 times  during  your  life  especially  when 
 you're  next  to  other  people  you've  got  a
[48:45] meeting  you've  got  an  interview  you've 
 got  you  know  like  this  social  occasion 
 where  you're  gonna  meet  some  friends  go 
 through  this  book  How  to  Win  Friends  and
[48:50] Influence  People  by  Dale  Carnegie 
 start  to  level  up  your  social  skills  so
[48:55] that  you've  actually  got  the  skills  to 
 you  know  navigate  like  human 
 relationships  in  a  way  that  makes  people
[49:01] feel  heard  and  you  know  people  like  to 
 speak  to  you  when  you've  got  good  social 
 skills  so  that's  like  the  foundation  and
[49:06] then  after  that  honestly  this  is 
 something  I'm  very  interested  in  try  and 
 find  very  weird  practical  ways  to  build
[49:13] a  tribe  around  you  so  this  can  be  as 
 simple  as  like  okay  learn  how  to 
 cultivate  like  a  really  good  long-term
[49:19] relationship  with  a  woman  that's  awesome 
 another  one  can  be  to  improve  your 
 relationship  with  your  family  another
[49:24] one  can  be  to  develop  some  friends  which 
 are  really  really  close  together
[49:31] really  be  honest  with  them  develop 
 secure  attachments  to  people 
 and  then  like  that's  that  slight  level
[49:37] too  right  but  my  brain  likes  to  go 
 extreme  and  so  what  I'm  thinking  about 
 this  on  this  focus  of  of  connection  and
[49:44] this  tribal  feeling  is  to  go  to  the  next 
 level  and  start  to  think  of  some  like 
 quite  crazy  ideas  like  how  do  we  get
[49:49] that  old  school  like  Primal  tribe 
 feeling  back  we  need  to  live  together  we
[49:55] need  to  meet  each  other  so  I  literally  I 
 get  these  crazy  ideas  like  what  if  we 
 all  got  like  a  big  ass  compound  like  we
[50:00] we  bought  out  like  500  acres  of  land  and 
 we've  got  you  know  like  a  little  shop  in
[50:06] there  we've  got  a  town  and  everything 
 like  like  what  if  we  make  our  own  town 
 or  Villages  is  my  idea  and  it  sounds
[50:11] silly  but  like  my  my idea  was  like  hey 
 we  buy  our  big  plot  of  land  we've 
 everyone's  got  like  houses  we  all  vet
[50:16] each  other  so  we  make  sure  that  you  know 
 like  we've  got  a  secure  attachment  we 
 like  each  other  we  see  each  other's 
 values  we  vet  each  other's  wives  and
[50:22] everything  and  we  build  up  like  our  own 
 little  village  and  make  it  really 
 successful  and  so  that's  like  a  crazy 
 level  idea  but  the  simple  idea  to  that
[50:29] which  you  might  not  have  actually 
 thought  of  just  yet  but  I  actually  like 
 I've  gotten  to  the  age  where  this  is
[50:34] kind  of  important  it's  the  sort  of  thing 
 where  do  you  want  to  live  to  build  your 
 family  not  not  just  you  know  to  be  a
[50:40] young  guy  but  to  really  start  to  think 
 okay  when  do  I  want  to  have  children  and 
 where  do  I  want  to  live
[50:45] um  raise  them  in  what  country  and  what 
 area  what  city  what  town 
 and  then  start  to  really  think  okay  the
[50:51] step-by-step  process  would  be  for  me  to 
 move  there  make  sure  it's  all  good  have 
 my  child  there  and  everything  and  then
[50:56] really  encourage  people  who  are  in  my 
 tribe  who  I  like  like  my  family  or  close 
 friends  for  them  to  get  a  house  in  the
[51:01] same  town  as  me  because  previously  this 
 wasn't  really  like  this  wasn't
[51:07] reasonable  because  everyone  had  jobs 
 that  they  had  to  specifically  go  to  but 
 these  days  it's  like  a  lot  of  people  are
[51:13] working  online  right  so  if  you've  got 
 like  I've  got  a  community  of  guys  who 
 all  work  online  and  so  really  like  it's
[51:19] almost  like  everyone's  waiting  for  me 
 I'm  probably  gonna  be  the  like  the 
 soonest  guy  to  have  children  I'm
[51:24] literally  looking  around  right  now  to 
 think  where's  the  best  place  to  raise 
 children  and  I'm  gonna  get  like  a  house 
 there  I'm  gonna  have  like  a  lovely  a
[51:30] huge  [ __ ]  family  I'm  gonna  get  loads 
 of  dogs  and  everything  I'm  gonna  have 
 like  10  children  bro  and  then  once  I 
 found  the  places  like  when  I  really  vet
[51:37] a  guy  and  I  really  like  his  values  and  I 
 think  he'd  be  good  for  me  my  family  my 
 wife  then  I  will  invite  him  into  the
[51:43] town  and  I  will  like  help  guide  him  to 
 buy  a  house  nearby  me  and  obviously 
 we'll  like  spend  all  day  together  we'll 
 go  training  in  the  gym  today  that  and
[51:49] imagine  then  that  okay  you  do  that  with 
 five  guys  or  five  families  with  your
[51:54] with  your  your  own  family  your  own  um 
 your  friends  and  everything  right  and
[51:59] suddenly  it's  like  you've  actually  got 
 that  old  school  tribe  feeling  where  you 
 can  literally  okay  you've  got  your  own
[52:04] Hut  you  walk  out  of  your  Hut  and  then 
 there's  a  guy  that  you  actually  like  and 
 you  can  like  be  around  I  think  that's
[52:09] deeply  important  I  can  imagine  that  kind 
 of  situation
