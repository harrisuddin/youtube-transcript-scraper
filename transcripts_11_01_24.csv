 and  starts  fights  especially  when  he 
 goes  out  drinking  it  makes  him  feel  so
[00:13] powerful  to  get  loud  and  aggressive 
 adonis  adonis  doesn't  fight  unless  he 
 has  to  he  understands  street  fights  are
[00:19] unpredictable  and  he  knows  that  fighting 
 is  high  risk  with  minimal  reward  and  yet
[00:24] adonis  trains  he  prepares  himself  for 
 the  day  that  he  doesn't  have  a  choice 
 other  than  to  protect  himself  and  his
[00:30] tribe  all  of  the  advice  online  on  reddit 
 on  youtube  is  absolutely  trash  men  come 
 fearing  for  their  safety  and  the  advice
[00:36] you're  given  is  run  away  run  run  away

[00:42] we're  gonna  go  into  detail  in  this  video 
 and  i'm  going  to  literally  tell  you  like 
 what  hit  to  throw  at  the  guy  when  you
[00:47] have  to  my  name  is  hamza  i  help  young

 transformation  through  self-improvements
[00:52] scroll  down  right  now  click  on  the 
 subscribe  and  the  post  notification 
 button  it's  a  win-win  for  both  of  us  hey
[00:57] amazing  bro 
 you  dropped  a  guy  this  guy  came  up  to  us
[01:03] bro  free  ribs 
 rips  us  on  the  menu  for  me  personally 
 most  of  the  potential  fights  and
[01:08] arguments  and  aggressive  situations  have 
 been  in  the  nightclub  environments  like
[01:13] the  night  time  alcohol  involved 
 environments  because  this  is  literally 
 the  prime  environment  it's  fueled  by
[01:18] alcohol  there's  usually  hot  girls  there 
 so  all  the  guys  are  like  weirdly  horny 
 and  like  your  testosterone's  probably
[01:23] going  up  we're  all  competing  like 
 obviously  no  one's  thinking  this  but  we 
 all  somewhat  are  competing  to  be  the 
 alpha  male  who  gets  the  [ __ ]  of  the
[01:29] night  it's  a  very  raw  place  to  be  and  so 
 we're  dancing  in  a  circle  me  two  of  my 
 male  friends  and  three  of  my  female
[01:35] friends  we're  all  dancing  in  a  circle 
 and  i  don't  know  where  this  drunk  guy 
 stumbles  in  like  brushes  into  some
[01:40] people  don't  really  think  much  of  it  you 
 know  he's  a  bit  of  a  [ __ ]  so  i  think 
 we  we  say  something  like  this  i  say 
 something  out  like  what  a  what  a  dick
[01:46] and  he  kind  of  like  you  know  stumbles 
 off  like  it's  it's  like  10  p.m  and  he's 
 at  this  point  obviously  he's  a  dumbass
[01:51] right  out  of  nowhere  this  other  guy 
 comes  up  and  he's  like  that's  what  mate 
 that's  my  mate  you're  talking  about 
 within  literally  like  a  second  this  is
[01:57] kicked  off  and  it's  gonna  get  like 
 aggressive  now  my  friend  did  something 
 like  a  10  out  of  10  move  right  here  i'm
[02:02] not  even  gonna  lie  my  friend  just 
 literally  walked  behind  this  guy  and 
 just  held  his  arms  like  almost  like  he 
 was  almost  pretending  like  you  know  he
[02:07] was  like  holding  the  guy  and  he  just 
 kind  of  like  slid  his  arm  down  and  he 
 just  held  both  of  his  arms  like  this  and
[02:12] i  saw  the  guy  like 
 when  my  friend  had  him  held  like  good 
 good  man  thank  you  kai
[02:18] this  guy's  getting  loud  he's  got  his 
 arms  behind  him  he's  like  thrashing 
 everywhere  bouncer  comes  in  takes  him 
 out  now  this  was  like  an  easy  situation
[02:24] this  was  like  a  low  level  situation 
 let's  go  one  step  higher  this  is  in  a 
 different  club  i'm  in  the  smoking  area
[02:29] and  i'm  speaking  to  this  cute  girl  and 
 you  know  it's  going  well  and  flirting 
 with  her  everything  some  asian  guy  comes 
 to  stands  like  to  the  side  of  us  this  is
[02:35] the  first  time  a  brown  skin  okay  i've 
 always  i've  only  ever  had  problems  with 
 white  guys  it's  just  how  it  is  like
[02:40] white  guys  seem  to  like  be  more 
 aggressive  in  these  like  you  know  the 
 drunk  lad  who  who  drinks  pines  and  [ __ ]
[02:45] never  once  as  like  a  black  or  a  brown 
 guy  ever  even  had  an  argument  with  me 
 this  was  the  only  time  i  can  remember
[02:50] this  brown  guy  just  stands  to  the  side 
 of  us  looking  at  me  aggressively  he  goes 
 shut  up  what  sure  bro  what  you're  on
[02:56] about  bro  he  wants  to  speak  to  this  girl 
 or  he  knows  her  maybe  he's  dating  her  or 
 something  i've  just  approached  his 
 girlfriend  or  something  rob  you  know
[03:01] what  i  do  i'm  like  all  right  i  walk  away 
 now  you  might  think  that  oh  that's 
 that's  not  the  alpha  male  thing  to  do
[03:07] hamza  but  i  actually  would  think  that  it 
 is  because  in  your  comfortable  spot
[03:12] right  now  you're  sat  on  your  your  crusty 
 computer  chair  you're  nice  and  safe  it's 
 nice  to  think  like  oh  hamza  you  should
[03:17] have  hit  him 
 it's  nice  to  be  a  little  spur  like  that 
 but  when  you're  in  that  moment  and 
 people  die  in  these  moments  i'd  say  i
[03:24] did  the  alpha  male  thing  of  just  saying 
 like  yeah  whatever  bro  the  girl's  cute 
 but  she's  not  even  worth  the  anxiety  and
[03:29] the  discomfort  of  having  even  an 
 argument  with  a  guy  never  mind  actually 
 hitting  each  other  never  mind  actually
[03:34] getting  dropped  by  his  friends  so  i  turn 
 around  and  i  walk  away  later  on  in  the 
 night  i  walk  back  into  the  smoking  area
[03:39] i'm  speaking  some  more  [ __ ]  and 
 everything  but  then  i  see  him  and  his 
 group  like  his
[03:44] group  of  like  a  lot  of  guys  like  seven 
 eight  guys  all  in  the  corner  and  this 
 guy's  just  staring  at  me  he's  pissed  for
[03:49] some  reason  boys  like  it  wasn't  even  his 
 girlfriend  like  she  wasn't  around  at 
 this  point  she's  she's  just  disappeared
[03:54] or  something  he's  just  staring  at  me  and 
 his  friends  like  talking  to  him  and 
 they're  like  pointing  at  me  and 
 everything  i'm  getting  worried  so  i'm
[04:00] like  pat  and  my  friends  like  you  know  my 
 friend's  speaking  to  a  [ __ ]  or 
 something  so  i  like  him  i'm  like  bro 
 like  it's  me  two  or  three  no  actually  i
[04:06] had  a  fair  amount  of  friends  on  this 
 night  as  well  actually  so  it's  a couple 
 of  my  friends  couple  of  his  friends  and 
 now  it  starts  getting  heated  his  friends
[04:12] are  coming  up  and  they're  like  you  know 
 putting  their  arm  around  me  like  bro 
 what  what  did  you  do  why  is  he  so  pissed 
 off  at  you  like  you  do  realize  we're
[04:17] gonna  have  to  like  do  and  like  they're 
 all  asian  guys  as  well  we're  all  like 
 almost  like  a  couple  of  his  friends  were
[04:23] being  real  nice  and  we're  like  we  don't 
 want  to  start  or  anything  what's  going 
 on  and  i  said  bro  like  i'm  never  gonna 
 start  a  fight  against  an  asian  guy  they
[04:28] seem  to  respect  this  because  i'm  being 
 polite  to  them  i'm  literally  like 
 putting  my  arm  around  them  and  saying 
 like  bro  like  i  might  have  spoke  to  his
[04:33] girlfriend  or  something  and  they're 
 saying  oh  i  think  they  might  have  said 
 like  oh  no  it's  not  his  girlfriend  it 
 might  have  been  but  she  wasn't  around  or
[04:39] anything  it's  getting  heated  my  friends 
 are  speaking  to  him  you  know  everyone's 
 kind  of  doing  this  buddying  up  thing 
 we're  like  no  one  really  wants  to  fight
[04:44] but  everyone  is  on  edge  and  you  can  see 
 like  guys  literally  like  cracking  their 
 knuckles  and  we're  getting  ready  and  to
[04:49] be  honest  it  just  kind  of  diffuses  it's 
 kind  of  anti-climatic  but  it  just  kind 
 of  diffuses  his  friends  kind  of  say  like
[04:54] just  kind  of  like  don't  look  at  it 
 towards  him  my  friend  say  to  him  now  bro 
 come  on  let's  go  get  you  a  drink  or
[04:59] something  this  and  his  friends  kind  of 
 go  with  him  my  friends  go  with  me  no 
 problem  that  was  like  a  medium  situation
[05:04] that  could  have  turned  into  like  a  full 
 blown  brawl  potentially  it  didn't
[05:09] because  of  social  skills  which  we  will 
 get  into  soon  but  that  was  like  a  medium 
 level  thing  let's  go  one  step  higher  so
[05:15] it's  the  end  of  the  night  again  club 
 alcohol  related  it's  probably  3am  me  and 
 my  friend  my  one  friend  are  leaving  the
[05:21] club  we've  just  finished  the  night  and 
 we're  gonna  go  get  some  chicken  wings  so 
 we  crossed  this  big  intersection  so  it's
[05:26] like  a  big  ass  road  right  we're  on  one 
 side  of  it  we're  going  across  and  on  the 
 way  other  side  like  solid  20  30  meters
[05:32] away  like  some  good  distance  away 
 there's  like  a  group  of  people  and 
 obviously  like  you  know  it's  3am  you 
 expect  people  to  be  like  loud  and  drunk
[05:37] and  everything  but  there  was  like  you 
 can  tell  the  difference  between  like  a 
 drunk  loud  [ __ ]  compared  to  like  a
[05:43] drunk  aggressive  guy  and  we  could  hear 
 that  type  of  guy  like  this  guy's  like 
 okay  we  look  to  the  side  this  guy's
[05:48] shirtless  so  he's  white  guy  somewhat 
 short  he's  shirtless  and  he's  just 
 yelling  and  he's  shouting  he's  shouting 
 to  people  and  so  me  and  my  friend  are
[05:53] lit  we  probably  shouldn't  have  done  this 
 but  we  kind  of  like  shout  over  we  didn't 
 say  anything  offensive  but  we  just  kind
[05:58] of  like  encouraged  them  like  yeah  hit 
 them  bro  like  we  were  just  shouting  on 
 [ __ ]  i  don't  even  remember  what  we 
 said  but  i  don't  remember  particularly
[06:04] saying  something  offensive  to  him  but  of 
 course  this  guy's  drunk  he's  shirtless 
 and  he  looks  over  to  the  side  and  he
[06:10] starts  swearing  at  us  and  he  starts 
 walking  towards  us  like  aggressively 
 like  he's  like  he's  pumping  his  conor 
 mcgregor  type  of  [ __ ]  he's  walking
[06:15] towards  us  like  what's  gonna  happen  bro 
 so  he  crosses  from  the  way  other  side 
 like  this  road  is  massive  by  the way  he
[06:21] from  the  way  other  side  of  this  road  he 
 crosses  all  the  way  towards  us  like  it 
 almost  felt  like  kind  of  slow  motion  at
[06:26] this  point  where  it  felt  like  i  was 
 getting  a  hundred  thoughts  in  my  mind 
 what  was  gonna  happen  that  was  gonna  say 
 we're  almost  like  i  almost  felt  like  me
[06:32] and  my  friend  were  kind  of  like  pushing 
 out  a  little  bit  where  we  as  he  was 
 coming  closer  we  kind  of  like  shouted 
 nicer  things  like  oh  yeah  like  nice  nice
[06:38] biceps  bro  or  some  some  [ __ ]  so  he's 
 walking  towards  us  aggressively  his 
 friends  are  on  the  other  side  they
[06:43] haven't  like  really  crossed  over  they're 
 just  kind  of  like  looking  at  to  see 
 what's  happening  and  i  didn't  even  know 
 what  to  think  about  it  when  he  gets
[06:48] close  to  be  honest  you  know  what  when  he 
 gets  close  i  didn't  think  i  had  no 
 thoughts  but  i  remember  one  specific
[06:53] thing  that  i  did  which  i  said  before  but 
 one  specific  thing  i  did  was  this  i 
 clicked  my  knuckles  he  gets  close
[06:59] without  saying  a  single  word  with 
 aggression  he  comes  and  pushes  my  friend 
 pushing  my  friend  with  like  with  force  i
[07:04] didn't  think  about  it  he's  on  the  floor 
 not  my  friend  but  this  drunk  ass  white 
 guy  he's  on  the  floor  within  a  split
[07:09] second  i  had  hooked  this  guy  with  force 
 broke  i  still  remember  the  way  that  he
[07:14] spun  like  he  spun  kind  of  like  inside  of 
 himself  like  a  beyblade  you  know  what  a
[07:19] beyblade  is  bro  like  let  it  rip
[07:24] he  spun  like  that  like  this  fool  crossed 
 over  this  road  if  i  made  him  spin  like  a
[07:29] beyblade  he  falls  down  like  crashes  down 
 he's  like  spurging  out  on  the  floor  his 
 friends  are  running  up  getting  like 
 proper  aggressive  and  everything  and  i
[07:35] specifically  remember  that  one  of  his 
 friends  was  massive  but  he  was  like 
 running  towards  me  a  bit  but  he  was  like
[07:40] you  know  what  what's  going  on  why  did 
 you  hit  him  and  at least  he  just  said  yo 
 like  he  crossed  the  entire  road  he  came 
 up  and  pushed  my  friend  like  you  know
[07:45] i'm  saying  this  again  social  skills  this 
 big  ass  guy  bro  and  he's  just  kind  of 
 like  he  kind  of  agrees  with  me  he  just
[07:50] stops  running  towards  me  goes  towards 
 his  friends  like  picks  him  up  and  me  and 
 my  friend  go  and  get  chicken  wings  yo
[07:55] what'd  he  do  when  he  came  up 
 [Music]
[08:08] because  this  [ __ ]  really  does  happen  and 
 sometimes  you  cannot  as  always  the 
 standard  advice  that  you  see  online  on
[08:14] red  pill  on  reddit  on  youtube  all  this 
 bullsh  is  usually  just  trash  sometimes 
 you  can't  run  away  like  we  could  have
[08:19] run  okay  we  could  have  run  would  you 
 have  run  would  anyone  like  the  drunk 
 guys  like  crossing  the  road  would  you
[08:24] have  like 
 no  you  wouldn't  have  a  [ __ ]  okay  best 
 case  scenario  any  time  a  man  makes  eye
[08:30] contact  with  you  and  he  doesn't  look 
 friendly  ten  toes  away  but  it's  not 
 realistic  because  one  it's  sometimes 
 that  feels  like  social  suicide  because
[08:36] that  feels  awkward  to  like  do  it  and 
 you're  gonna  look  like  a  fool  sometimes 
 look  but  okay  looking  like  a  foolish  is
[08:41] safer  than  getting  your  ass  beat  or 
 beating  someone  getting  put  in  prison 
 fair  enough  but  sometimes  you  won't  even 
 get  like  the  brain  like  signal  to  run
[08:48] because  i  didn't  in  this  point  i  didn't 
 want  to  fight  but  i  froze  because 
 there's  three  responses  you  can  have  in 
 this  type  of  situation  and  that  is  fight
[08:54] flight  or  freeze  and  i  don't  know  about 
 you  but  i  am  a  freezer  up  until  i  fight 
 i  have  never  been  a  flight  type  of
[09:00] person  you  might  be  you  might  be  the 
 type  of  guy  who  runs  away  but  if  you've 
 been  beat  by  your  parents  bro  you're
[09:05] probably  a  freezer  you'll  probably  like 
 stand  there  just  waiting  to  get  hit  by 
 your  dad  bro  and  you  can  usually  tell
[09:10] like  one  thing  that  that  pops  into  mind 
 is  imagine  when  there's  like  a  drunk 
 white 
 white  guy  obviously  drunk  ass  white  guy
[09:15] on  a  train  being  racist  this  has 
 happened  to  me  many  times  right  he's 
 being  racist  the  moment  he  gets  loud  you
[09:20] will  see  the  people  who  are  in  flight 
 mode 
 literally  he  gets  loud  his  first  word  of 
 being  loud  three  four  people  will  stand
[09:27] up  and  start  running  away  everyone  else 
 is  in  either  freeze  or  ready  to  fight 
 mode  i  don't  think  most  people  are  off
[09:33] lights  i  don't  think  most  people  would 
 run  away  and  i'm  not  going  to  tell  you 
 that  stupid  advice  run  away  any  time  you
[09:38] get  in  trouble  bro  sometimes  you  need  to 
 know  how  to  defend  yourself  now  it's 
 unlikely  that  this  drunk  ass  mother  it's
[09:43] unlikely  that  he  would  have  seriously 
 harmed  us  but  he  could  have  because  me 
 and  my  friend  froze  and  he  he  chose  to
[09:49] push  my  friend  what  if  he  came  and  what 
 if  he  knew  how  to  fight  what  if  he 
 actually  punched  my  friend  with  force 
 what  if  he  had  a  knife  what  do  you  have
[09:54] a  gun  so  it's  time  you  need  to  learn 
 these  steps  now  step  zero  the 
 prerequisite  is  to  learn  how  to  fight
[09:59] this  is  a  prerequisite  to  becoming  a  man 
 because  if  you  cannot  protect  yourself 
 or  your  loved  ones  you  are  not  a  man
[10:05] you're  a  liability  now  the  best  case 
 scenario  is  to  train  specifically  to 
 defend  yourself  and  this  you'll  be  able
[10:11] to  find  it  in  different  countries  but 
 this  generally  is  this  martial  arts 
 sports  club  called  krav  maga  you  can
[10:16] search  this  online  on  your  like  google 
 maps  or  something  you'll  probably  be 
 able  to  find  a  club  nearby  this  is
[10:21] probably  one  of  the  best  ones  to  join  if 
 you  specifically  want  to  learn  about 
 self-defense  but  at  the  very  least  just
[10:26] do  three  months  of  any  kind  of  striking 
 martial  arts  striking  means  like  you 
 know  hitting  okay  and  martial  arts  would
[10:32] be  like  boxing  kickboxing  muay  thai  do 
 three  months  of  any  kind  of  striking  and 
 if  you  want  to  be  very  very  well-rounded
[10:38] couple  that  striking  with  any  kind  of 
 grappling  and  ground  work  wrestling  and
[10:43] bazillion  jiu-jitsu  you'll  be  protected 
 all  around  if  you  do  this  most  people 
 say  just  learn  bjj  like  bjj  brazilian
[10:49] jiu  jitsu  has  got  like  this  this  cocky 
 kind  of  what  would  you  say  a  circle  jerk 
 because  of  like  joe  rogan  and  everything
[10:55] and  all  the  guys  like  bjj  like  it's 
 overrated  in  this  sense  in  my  opinion 
 people  say  okay  just  train  bjj  a  lot  of
[11:00] the  stuff  that  you  learn  in  there  you 
 will  not  be  able  to  use  in  a  street 
 fight  bro  get  him  into  the  perfect
[11:05] armbar  you're  about  to  snap  his  arm  off 
 congratulations  bro  you  know  what's 
 gonna  happen  his  friend's  gonna  stomp  on
[11:10] your  face  he's  gonna  bite  your  dick  off 
 or  something  something  like  bjj  is  only 
 good  in  a  street  fight  to  literally  just
[11:15] make  sure  you  don't  get  put  onto  the 
 ground  but  the  moment  you're  on  the 
 ground  you're  trying  to  do  some  [ __ ] 
 [ __ ]  like  playing  chess  with  this  guy's
[11:20] body  bro  his  friend's  gonna  come  and 
 stab  you  in  the  back  so  this  is  the 
 prerequisite  step  zero  learn  some
[11:25] martial  arts  learn  at  least  some  kind  of 
 striking  some  kind  of  grappling  and  so 
 here  is  the  autistic  way  to  implement
[11:30] this  advice  because  i  used  to  see  this 
 advice  and  i  you  know  people  on  red  pill 
 would  say  okay  learn  martial  arts  and
[11:35] i'd  be  like  yeah  that  sounds  awesome  and 
 then  i  just  would  just  not  do  it  and  so 
 you  need  like  this  very  specific  like
[11:40] almost  childish  advice  of  exactly  how  do 
 you  start  one  go  on  to  google  maps
[11:45] search  for  the  type  of  martial  arts  that 
 seems  interesting  to  you  brazilian  jiu 
 jitsu  kickboxing  boxing  muay  thai
[11:50] whatever  just  search  for  that  and  on 
 google  maps  you'll  be  able  to  see  the 
 clubs  that  are  nearby  click  on  their
[11:55] website  and  almost  all  of  them  will  have 
 a  free  first  day  and  even  if  they  don't 
 it'll  be  what  10  15  whatever  just  take
[12:01] some  cash  with  you  you  can  see  their 
 timetable  on  their  website  maybe  their 
 facebook  page  and  just  go  to  the  first
[12:06] nearest  class  that  you  can  attend  don't 
 overthink  it  don't  think  okay  you've  got 
 to  message  them  don't  think  okay
[12:11] how  do  i  know  if 
 it's  going  to  be  good  specifically  you 
 need  to  go  to  their  first  free  day  and
[12:16] then  you'll  be  able  to  tell  from  that 
 point  because  you  could  find  the  best 
 club  in  the  world  and  it's  really  really 
 affordable  but  if  you  don't  go  to  the
[12:21] first  day  you're  never  going  to  join  or 
 you  could  go  to  the  first  day  and 
 everyone  is  a  tall  [ __ ]  to  you  and
[12:26] then  you  don't  want  to  go  but  there's 
 another  club  down  the  road  that  you  then 
 you  go  to  their  first  day  everyone's 
 really  nice  and  you  feel  like  you're
[12:31] leveling  up  anyway  you  need  to  go  to 
 that  first  free  day  usually  free 
 sometimes  take  10  15  with  you  as  soon  as
[12:37] possible  now  step  one  is  anxiety  and 
 mindfulness  because  you've  been  reminded
[12:42] about  this  concept  of  danger  that  other 
 people  could  harm  you  in  this  video  so
[12:47] i'm  willing  to  bet  that  in  the  past  five 
 minutes  you've  probably  sweat  more  than 
 normal  that  since  watching  this  video
[12:52] your  heartbeat's  probably  going  a  little 
 bit  faster  you've  got  this  like  weird 
 sense  of  like  how  do  you say  that  word 
 adrenaline  excitements  and  you  think
[12:59] that  that's  going  to  help  you  in  these 
 fights  and  you're  probably  like  you've 
 probably  got  this  mindset  right  now  like 
 oh  i  could  smash  a  workout  that  feeling
[13:04] that  you've  got  is  anxiety  and  you  think 
 it's  productive  it's  actually  going to 
 be  the  reason  why  you  get  dropped 
 because  think  about  the  master  fighter
[13:10] does  he  have  anxiety  does  he  have 
 excitement  no  he's  calm  he's  stoic  he 
 regulates  his  mind  and  his  body  you
[13:15] think  that  you'd  hit  a  fantastic  workout 
 with  this  rage  you  know  the  people  who 
 hurt  you  and  you  think  about  them  you
[13:20] get  angry  and  you  think  you're  gonna  hit 
 a  fantastic  workout  because  of  that  no 
 it's  mindfulness  flow  concentration
[13:26] being  focused  that's  gonna  help  you  to 
 give  you  the  best  workout  or  even  save 
 your  life  in  the  fights  and  you  wanna
[13:31] know  how  i  know  this  because  i  used  to 
 fuel  my  workouts  with  the  thought  of 
 crushing  the  skull  of  the  racists  who
[13:36] tried  to  stab  me  like  that  was  my  go-to 
 thoughts  and  i  didn't  have  good  workouts 
 i  was  very  distracted  for  them  i  never
[13:41] hit  pr's  in  those  sessions  you  will  get 
 fatigued  from  thoughts  and  these  type  of 
 thoughts  don't  energize  you  they  don't
[13:47] make  you  feel  good  they  don't  give  you 
 confidence  or  strength  or  anything  these 
 type  of  thoughts  mentally  and  physically
[13:52] literally  physically  like  the  real 
 science  is  that  these  type  of  thoughts 
 will  physically  fatigue  you  then  compare
[13:57] that  to  the  times  where  you're  so 
 focused  on  your  workouts  so  mindful  so 
 so  concentrated  that  you  don't  even
[14:03] change  the  song  once  on  spotify  you 
 don't  even  touch  your  phone  you're 
 hitting  pr  after  pr  so  in  terms  of
[14:08] preparing  for  fights  or  danger  or  being 
 threatened  step  one  is  longer  term
[14:13] consistent  meditation  this  will  help  you 
 always  and  no  matter  what  you  want  to  do
[14:18] literally  pick  anything  that  you  want  to 
 do  which  is  completely  random  and  i'll 
 find  a  way  to  explain  how  meditation 
 will  help  you  with  it  and  it's  insane
[14:24] that  people  don't  meditate  but  here's 
 your  chance  meditate  every  single  day 
 for  the  rest  of  your  life  there  and  then 
 in  that  moment  in  that  situation  where
[14:30] it's  about  to  go  down  and  some  guy's 
 swearing  at  you  some  guys  being  racist 
 regulate  your  mind  and  your  body  i'm  not
[14:35] gonna  make  this  a  weird  [ __ ]  guide 
 where  i'm  gonna  tell  you  like  the  10 
 steps  to  do  and  you  know  watch  out  for
[14:40] his  shoulder  and  shoot  your  [ __ ] 
 mouth  one  hopefully  simple  thing  that
[14:45] you  can  remember 
 breathe  that's  it  just  at  that  point 
 when  [ __ ]  is  kicking  off  if  you  just
[14:50] remind  yourself  to  just  breathe  nice  big 
 deep  breath  into  the  stomach  like  into 
 your  balls  as  elliot  hulse  used  to  say
[14:55] breathe  into  your  balls  at  that  point 
 because  when  it's  really  kicking  off 
 you're  taking  shallow  breaths  that's
[15:00] gonna  not  only  make  you  like  weaker  and 
 and  more  fatigued  but  you're  gonna  look 
 weaker  you're  gonna  get  that  closed  body
[15:05] language  start  cowering  over  that's 
 gonna  make  you  look  like  less  of  a 
 threat  less  able  to  defend  yourself  when
[15:11] she's  kicking  off  big  breath  from  your 
 nose  into  your  stomach  open  up  your  body 
 i  know  that  that  seems  way  like  weirdly
[15:17] simple  advice  but  it  could  potentially 
 save  your  life  because  it's  gonna  bring 
 you  back  into  regulating  your  mind  and
[15:22] your  body  then  step  two  is  body  language 
 and  situational  awareness  if  you  aren't
[15:27] even  observing  his  body  language  and  the 
 situation  around  you  what's  gonna  happen 
 you're  gonna  wake  up  being  like  oh  well
[15:32] what  happened  you  didn't  even  realize 
 that  his  friend  just  hit  you  from  the 
 side  you  have  to  keep  your  eyes  open  and
[15:37] you  have  to  stay  aware  of  the  entire 
 situation  not  just  a  tunnel  vision  on 
 the  guy  in  front  of  you  you  can
[15:43] generally  if  you  ever  have  the  the 
 curiosity  to  watch  street  fights  you  can 
 see  that  like  guys  who  watch  football  do
[15:48] this  but  they're  like  they'll  stare  at 
 each  other  or  they'll  like  get  so  close 
 that  they  could  almost  kiss  each  other 
 like  this  is  the  other  guy's  forehead 
 and  they're  like  dude  there's  like  the
[15:53] [ __ ]  rams  this  tunnel  vision  is  gonna 
 get  you  hit  from  the  side  by  his  friend 
 so  again  i'm  not  gonna  overload  you  with
[15:58] information  that  i  did  some  research 
 before  this  and  everyone  said  okay  well 
 if  his  shoulder  drops  by  this  and  if  he
[16:03] does  this  with  his  hand  no  it's  stupid 
 it's  too  much  you're  not  like  anyone 
 who's  been  in  a  real  fight  like  you're
[16:08] not  going  to  remember  this  weird  that  i 
 tell  you  right  now  okay  his  shoulder  is 
 going  to  drop  and  if  if  he  looks  in  a  13
[16:13] degree  angle  you're  not  gonna  remember 
 so  i'm  just  going  to  tell  you  one  main 
 rule  and  i  think  this  is  the  one  that 
 you  can  remember  which  is  never  let
[16:19] anyone  get  to  the  side  or  behind  you  you 
 quickly  observe  the  entire  situation  see 
 like  who's  who  seems  to  be  on  his  side
[16:25] just  make  sure  no  one  is  behind  you  or 
 to  the  side  of  you  now  step  three  is  to 
 avoid  and  this  is  the  step  this  is  the
[16:30] reason  why  the  first  two  stories  that  i 
 told  you  didn't  exactly  get  violence  you
[16:35] can  avoid  a  lot  of  these  aggressive 
 violence  fight  situations  through  social
[16:40] skills  because  let's  put  you  into  this 
 scenario  right  now  you're  in  the  middle 
 of  a  club  alcohol  involved  alcohol's
[16:45] always  [ __ ]  involved  in  fights  right 
 and  someone  starts  chatting  yo 
 and  so  you're  in  the  middle  of  the  club
[16:50] you're  enjoying  yourself  someone  gets 
 aggressive  onto  you  all  the  redditors 
 will  tell  you  to  run  away  this  guy  says 
 [ __ ]  you  to  you  and  you
[16:56] you  run  out  of  club  okay  you're  not 
 gonna  do  that  especially  because  in  in 
 the  situations  where  fights  are
[17:01] happening 
 it's  usually  like  a  packed  place  where 
 you  can't  literally  run  they're  gonna 
 have  to  like  fully  like  excuse  me  excuse
[17:06] me  excuse  me  you're  not  gonna  do  that 
 you  wouldn't  need  to  because  let's  say 
 this  big-ass  meathead  says  yo  you  just
[17:11] bumped  into  me  what  do  you  do  this  is 
 exactly  what  you  do  you  hold  your  hands 
 up  say  yo  i'm  sorry  he'll  swear  even
[17:16] more  he'll  even  say  something  that  like 
 triggers  your  insecurity  you've  got  gyno 
 i  watch  your  youtube  channel  hamster
[17:21] you've  got  guy  i know  i  see  you  talking 
 about  it  whatever  he  says  you  almost 
 take  it  as  like  nonchalance  like  his
[17:26] words  don't  mean  anything  keep  your 
 hands  up  i'm  sorry  and  you  start  walking 
 away  you  do  not  turn  to  the  side  or  to
[17:31] the  back  this  is  the  time  when  if  you 
 like  say  oh  you  know  you  get  scared  and 
 you  start  walking  away  you're  gonna  get
[17:36] [ __ ]  sucked  in  the  back  of your  head 
 that's  happened  to  me  twice  in  the  same 
 night  as  well  by  the  same  [ __ ]  people 
 there's  no  rules  in  a  street  fight
[17:41] there's  no  like  oh  you  know  you  can't 
 hit  him  from  the  back  lad  like  they'll 
 take  the  advantage  that  they  can  get  and
[17:46] if  you're  looking  at  them  like  i  know  it 
 seems  a  bit  socially  weird  to  kind  of 
 stick  your  hands  up  like  this  and  maybe
[17:51] step  away  from  them  whilst  looking  at 
 them 
 completely  fine  because  if  that  saves 
 you  from  turning  around  and  one  of  them
[17:56] just  coming  up  and  hooking  you  in  the 
 jaw  it's  worth  it  and  the  reason 
 specifically  whilst  we're  holding  our 
 hands  up  like  this  is  because  the
[18:02] observation  of  other  people  now  imagine 
 this  cctv  cameras  in  the  club  right
[18:07] think  about  what  they're  gonna  see 
 usually  these  cameras  are  in  like  140p 
 black  and  white  right  all  they're  gonna
[18:12] see  is  like  you  do  this  and  this  guy's 
 coming  at  you  like  this  who's  going  to 
 look  like  the  perpetrator  the  aggressor 
 the  people  around  you  who  potentially
[18:18] could  jump  in  and  help  either  one  of  you 
 who  are  they  more  likely  to  help  the  guy 
 who  looks  angry  with  the  guy  who's  like 
 doing  this  and  also  this  is  a  very  sick
[18:24] if  your  hands  are  lit  up  like  this 
 you're  like  this  right  this  is  a  very 
 safe  position  for  you  to  be  in  you  can 
 catch  attacks  like  this  you  can  block
[18:30] your  face  you  can  even  throw  much  much 
 faster  faster  than  if  you've  got  your 
 hands  like  i  see  some  stupid  ass  video
[18:35] clips  i  used  to  have  an  obsession  with 
 watching  street  fight  videos  and  some  of 
 them  it's  like  the  guy  would  like  want
[18:40] to  show  that  you  know  he  was  confident 
 and  stuff  and  so  he'd  be  he'd  walk  to 
 this  guy  like  with  his  hands  like  up 
 here  with  his  chin  stuck  out  and  so  of
[18:45] course  the  other  guy  would  lightly  hook 
 him  the  guy  falls  oh  i  see  you  see  some 
 fights  with  like  the  guys  originally
[18:50] he's  got  his  hands  in  his  pocket  like  a 
 dumbass  no  we  want  to  shortcut  every 
 little  every  detail  so  that  we  can
[18:56] protect  ourselves  and  the  best  way  to 
 protect  yourself  is  literally  you  know 
 you  keep  your  hands  up  up  here  boxing 
 stance  if  you've  already  got  your  hands
[19:02] here  you're  almost  already  there 
 straight  away  and  so  in  this  situation 
 this  guy's  yelling  at  you  you're  gonna 
 apologize  you're  gonna  walk  away  you're
[19:07] gonna  keep  your  eye  on  him  just  walk 
 away  i'm  sorry  bro  i  didn't  mean  to  bump 
 into  you  my  bad  boo  he's  gonna  start 
 swearing  say  something  racist  my  bad  bro
[19:13] i'm  sorry  just  start  walking  away  whilst 
 i  like  looking  at  the  guy  that  was  you 
 or  void  and  that  was  you  like  trying  to 
 leave  the  situation  what  if  he  follows
[19:19] you  what  if  he  gets  closer  to  you  that 
 is  when  you  get  loud  and  i  found  that 
 this  is  actually  like  a  little  bit  of  a
[19:24] barrier  that  you  have  to  break  to 
 skyrocket  how  effective  you  are  in  in 
 this  type  of  situation  this  guy's
[19:29] getting  loud  he's  getting  like  you  know 
 like  angry  and  his  blood's  rushing  he's 
 getting  ready  for  the  fight  you're  like
[19:34] really  quiet  and  reserved  now  it's  more 
 than  just  him  shouting  at  us  more  just 
 than  him  swearing  now  he's  walking
[19:40] towards  you  now  he's  becoming  like  a 
 full-on  danger  this  is  when  you  start  to 
 get  loud  and  you  start  you  start  to 
 shout  but  you  shout  almost  like
[19:46] defensive  victim  stuff  which  is  like  yo 
 don't  step  towards  me  stay  away  from  me 
 do  not  step  closer  to  me  i  don't  want
[19:51] any  problems  stay  away  again  cctv 
 potentially  like  club  bouncers 
 potentially  any  kind  of  like  observers
[19:56] anyone  who  jump  in  here  this  and  at  this 
 point  if  he's  still  walking  towards  you
[20:01] he's  going  to  hurt  you  unless  if  you 
 hurt  him  first  if  you  can  run  at  this 
 point  try  and  run  but  honestly  the
[20:06] advice  i  give  you  at  this  point  like 
 you're  not  gonna  be  able  to  remember 
 this  at  this  point  honestly  if  you've 
 been  in  these  situations  before  there's
[20:11] there's  no  more  thoughts  if  there's  ever 
 a  time  that  you  get  into  a  flow  state 
 it's  at  a  point  like  this  that  all
[20:16] thoughts  switch  off  your  legs  are 
 shaking  like  this  and  you're  getting  so
[20:21] ready  you  don't  get  to  think  at  this 
 point  if  you're  a  runner  if  you're 
 someone  who  who  seems  to  tap  into  the
[20:26] flight  mode  okay  fantastic  best  case 
 scenario 
 you  might  not  be  i'm  not  at  this  point
[20:32] personally  for  me  if  you're  anything 
 like  me  i  freeze  like  this  is  like  i 
 start  standing  still  i  can't  even  speak
[20:37] or  anything  i  just  kind  of  like  stare  at 
 the  person  this  is  from  like 
 disassociation  from  my  childhood  trauma 
 like  long  story  short  like  you  probably
[20:43] can  experience  that  so  i  freeze  at  this 
 point  i  freeze  up  until  it  is  time  to 
 fight  and  so  step  four  is  strike  first
[20:49] and  this  now  i'm  going  to  teach  you 
 exactly  how  to  hit  which  i've  never  seen 
 any  other  guide  all  these  guys  like  if
[20:54] you're  if  you're  watching  this  video  you 
 you  want  to  know  this  specific  like  gory 
 detail  of  what  hits  her  throw  right  and
[21:00] all  these  guys  every  time  i  see  them  and 
 they'd  always  just  say  oh  don't  get  into 
 fights  guys  don't  get  into  fights  sir
[21:06] before  you  fight  go  on  google  and  search 
 up  the  laws  and  the  registrations  like 
 what  the  [ __ ]  these  reddit  is  actually
[21:11] saying  this  like  before  you  defend 
 yourself  go  search  up  the  self-defense 
 laws  in  your  area  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro
[21:17] if  i'm  like  this  if  i've  walked  away 
 from  this  guy  and  he's  still  coming 
 towards  me  and  he's  got  into  like 
 literally  this  far  away  bro  this  guy  is
[21:22] going  to  hurt  me  like  this  guy  will  [ __ ] 
 you  up  and  i'm  not  even  talking  about 
 his  friends  who've  already  like  walked
[21:27] to  the  outside  of  you  now  again  if  you 
 can  run  fantastic  but  a  lot  of  times  you 
 can't  and  don't  stand  there  going  on
[21:33] wait  wait  one  second  bro  one  second  let 
 me  just  um  what's  the  government  website 
 let  me  just  double  check  can  i  defend
[21:38] myself  or  what's  the  the  section  3.8  law 
 some  [ __ ]  no  at  this  point  you  are
[21:43] in  danger  and  so  the  exact  hits  that 
 you're  gonna  go  with  most  people  will  do 
 a  very  random  like  stupid  boxing  hit
[21:48] right  most  people  have  never  done  boxing 
 and  so  they'll  do  usually  some  kind  of 
 like  long  range  hook  which  is  one  of  the
[21:54] worst  hits  you  could  throw  in  this  area 
 what  you'd  instead  go  for  is  the  side  of 
 your  elbow  right  about  here  this  bit
[22:00] here  this  is  one  of  the  hardest  parts  of 
 your  body  here  specifically  to  the  side
[22:05] of  the  chin  now  again  most  people  would 
 almost  automatically  go  for  the  nose 
 because  it  just  seems  like  where  you'd
[22:10] go  for  the  side  of  the  chin  will  make 
 that  guy  spin  like  a  beyblade  like  i 
 said  before  the  side  of  the  chit  is  how
[22:16] you  get  knocked  out  in  boxing  one  of  the 
 like  the  most  fundamental  things  is  to 
 keep  your  chin  down  if  you  fight  like
[22:21] this  you're  gonna  get  twatted  you  keep 
 your  chin  down  like  this  most  guys  won't 
 do  this  in  a  street  fight  you  keep  your 
 chin  like  down  like  this  it  protects  it
[22:27] if  someone  gets  into  the  distance  that 
 you  could  elbow  them  which  you've  got  to 
 think  is  like  it's  not  there's  no
[22:32] distance  right  it's  like  i  couldn't  even 
 elbow  the  camera  right  now  you  get  what 
 i  mean  so  if  i  could  elbow  someone  who's
[22:37] coming  towards  me  aggressively  like  they 
 deserve  to  be  elbowed  now  of  course  the 
 disclaimer  of  like  oh  but  check  with  the
[22:43] police  first  like  no  i  don't  care  bro  if 
 someone  is  this  close  where  they  they're 
 this  far  away  from  you  after  you  walking
[22:49] away  from  them  they're  legally  following 
 you  at  this  point  i  don't  care  about  the 
 laws  at  this  point  it's  my  survival
[22:54] instinct  to  neutralize  this  threat 
 exactly  what  you're  going  to  do  once  it 
 comes  to  this  point  i  hope  it  doesn't
[22:59] come  but  if  it  fully  does  that  you 
 someone  is  this  close  to  you  they're 
 about  to  hit  you  bro  usually  when 
 someone's  walking  up  to  you  aggressively
[23:05] there's  usually  a  bit  of  a  gap  like  they 
 won't  walk  up  and  as  soon  as  they've  got 
 range  like  this  much  range  they  won't
[23:10] throw  it  like  this  usually  with  every 
 like  if  you  go  and  search  for  like  some 
 street  fight  video  they'll  come  up  for  a
[23:15] split  second  you  know  do  something  like 
 some  [ __ ]  like  this  stick  their 
 hands  down  and  go  oh  bro  and  then
[23:20] they'll  hit  you  you  have  like  that  split 
 second  to  act  first  if  you  absolutely 
 have  to  so  you're  gonna  slightly  step  in
[23:26] with  your  with  your  front  foot  at  this 
 point  you  should  be  in  like  you  know  the 
 full-on  boxer  stance  which  is  literally 
 just  stick  your  right  if  you're
[23:32] right-handed  your  right  foot  slightly 
 back  your  left  foot  slightly  forward  we 
 won't  go  into  like  too  much  detail  with 
 that  [ __ ]  but  pretty  much  as  soon  as  it
[23:38] comes  to  this  point  take  a  little  step 
 in  right  elbow  down  a  little  bit  and 
 just  swing  hard  as  against  the  chin
[23:44] we're  not  even  trying  to  hit  the  chin 
 okay  we're  not  trying  to  hit  the  chin 
 we're  trying  to  go  through  it  imagine 
 you  are  like  bursting  through  not  even
[23:50] connecting  but  bursting  through  a  door 
 we  don't  want  to  hit  the  chin  we're 
 gonna  like  literally  connect  with  it  if
[23:55] you  can  do  like  a little  visualization 
 like  success  visualization  beforehand 
 through  the  chin  fully  imagine  that  his
[24:01] head  is  gonna  like  twist  like  this  and  i 
 know  this  is  like  gory  detail  that  might 
 be  like  unacceptable  for  youtube  but
[24:09] better  him  than  you  that  is  all  you  do 
 the  one  hit  to  his  chin  that  that  will 
 fully  drop  the  guy  even  if  you're  not
[24:15] very  weak  even  if  the  guy's  way  bigger 
 than  you  so  the  side  of  the  chin  will 
 fully  fully  drop  the  person  to  the  floor
[24:20] it  always  will  after  this  step  five  one 
 of the  most  important  steps  escape  now 
 you've  got  to  play  the  game  of  escaping
[24:25] his  friends  him  when  he  probably  will 
 stand  back  up  depending  on  how  good  your 
 strike  was  the  police  the  bouncers
[24:31] anyone  who's  trying  to  fight  you  because 
 at  this  point  his  friends  will  chase  you 
 he  will  call  someone  who  will  come  with
[24:36] a  knife  or  a  gun  to  come  and  get  you  so 
 hit  first  hit  hard  then  escape  this  is 
 when  you  like  i  found  that  you  can
[24:41] almost  tap  into  that  that  running  mode 
 again  you  can  tap  into  the  flight  mode 
 usually  at  least  for  me  the  few  times
[24:46] i've  been  into  this  situation  i  fully 
 freeze  then  i  go  into  fight  mode  and 
 after  the  fight  mode  after  i've  hit  the 
 guy  hard  once  i  only  ever  hit  people
[24:52] once  after  that  point  bro  and  sprint  all 
 the  way  that's  your  cardio  that's  your
[24:57] height  interval  high  intensity  interval 
 training  back  home  go  get  some  chicken 
 wings  ribs  on  the  menu  do  not  stay
[25:03] around  to  be  the  victor  do  not  shout  and 
 start  celebrating  because  i  see  this  so 
 many  times  in  in  i  went  to  the  club  many
[25:09] many  times  in  my  student  days  there 
 would  be  a  fight  like  like 
 every  week  right  there'd  be  a  fight  like
[25:14] every  week  you  know  everyone's  shouting 
 everyone  like  the  crowds  watching 
 everything  one  guy  wins  and  i'm  like  yo 
 like  yo  he's  one  right  fantastic  right
[25:20] this  dumbass  would  win  the  fight  and  it 
 just  kind  of  starts  shouting  and  you 
 just  stay  there  and  like  you  know  like
[25:25] look  at  the  guys  who  he's  dropped 
 dropping  you  know  do  some  [ __ ]  so 
 what  do you  think  happened  the  bouncers 
 come  up  they've  grabbed  this  guy  they
[25:31] like  put  their  knee  on  this  guy's  neck 
 they  man  handle  him  you  see  this  guy 
 like  you  know  two  big  ass  bouncers  like
[25:36] carrying  his  arms  and  dragging  him  by 
 his  hair  and  stuff  he's  like  going 
 through  all  the  piss  on  the  floor  and 
 looks  like  a  fool  just  take  him  straight
[25:42] outside  and  then  straight  into  the 
 police  car  another  time  they're  fighting 
 not  in  the  club  right  now  but  just 
 outside  the  club  on  the  road  they're
[25:47] fighting  and  everything  one  guy 
 literally  gets  a  solid  hit  on  some  other 
 guy  police  car  whizzes  up  this  guy's
[25:52] like  just  shouting  and  everything  gets 
 arrested  right  away  as  soon  as  you  hit 
 like  as  soon  as  it's  possible  bro  sprint
[25:58] sprint  the  [ __ ]  away  do  not  stay  around 
 to  be  the  victor  do  not  stay  around  to 
 finish  off  the  night  if  it's  a  club
[26:03] whatever  it  is  like  get  the  [ __ ]  out 
 party  whatever  it  is  get  out  because  you 
 could  annihilate  this  guy  let's  say  he's
[26:09] passed  out  for  the  entire  night  it's  not 
 gonna  happen  but  let's  say  he's  passed 
 up  for  the  entire  night  his  friends  will 
 stab  you  like  somewhat  something  worse
[26:15] will  happen  the  police  will  be  called 
 the  bouncers  some  something  will  happen 
 get  out  you've  won  you've  profited  at 
 that  point  that  was  the  exact  thought  i
[26:20] had  when  i  hit  this  guy  who  came  up  and 
 pushed  my  friend  it  was  straight  away  i 
 got  the  thought  okay  we've  profited  like
[26:25] we've  already  won  let's  get  the  like  i 
 don't  need  to  stay  and  fight  his  friends 
 now  like  i've  already  won  if  i  leave 
 right  now  it's  like  i've  left  with  like
[26:31] profit  like  there  was  a  good  return  on 
 investment  for  this  but  if  i  stay  like 
 what  what  like  what  is  this  to  stay  for
[26:36] potentially  me  get  hit  too  i  don't  want 
 that  as  soon  as  you  get  you  connect  with 
 that  hits  you  have  to  follow  the 
 situation  now  of  course  i'm  going  to
[26:41] give  the  disclaimer  i  wanted  to  do  this 
 at  last  because  i  don't  want  to  waste 
 your  time  with  this
[26:46] i'm  not  encouraging  people  to  fight 
 don't  fight  bro  it's  stupid  but  this 
 isn't  about  fighting  even  though  i've
[26:51] titled  it  like  that  this  is  about 
 protecting  yourself  like  you  will  never 
 be  the  person  who  who  is  the  antagonizer
[26:57] you  will  never  be  the  person  who's  the 
 guy  who's  shouting  who's  loud  and  who 
 picks  on  someone  but  it  will  happen  to 
 you  like  multiple  times  through  your
[27:03] life  it  will  happen  that  you'll  have  a 
 time  when  there  is  a  guy  who's  picking 
 on  you  who  is  aggressive  on  you  and  if
[27:08] you  don't  know  some  of  this  knowledge 
 like  that's  the  [ __ ]  that  you  overthink 
 about  for  10  20  for  the  rest  of  your
[27:13] life  that's  the  [ __ ]  that  gives  you 
 anxiety  for  the  rest  of  your  life  i 
 highly  highly  recommend  if  you  want  to 
 take  the  actionable  step  right  now  you
[27:18] do  that  thing  which  i  said  in  in  step 
 zero  you  go  right  now  search  up  the 
 martial  arts  club  and  book  in  the  first
[27:24] session  like  you  don't  even  need  to  book 
 in  generally  you  can  just  go  show  up  to 
 the  first  session  i  can't  even  explain
[27:29] to  you  how  much  that  has  changed  my 
 mindset  like  my  anxiety  has  dropped  by  a 
 significant  honestly  about  80  percent  in
[27:35] just  the  last  couple  of  months  like  it 
 was  already  making  good  progress  and 
 it's  like  training  kickboxing  i'm  not
[27:40] even  good  at  kickboxing  right  i'm 
 literally  i'm  not  even  good  like  i've 
 done  like  two  months  of  training  maybe
[27:45] two  and  a half  months  but  it  gives  you 
 this  almost  nonchalant  feeling  we  you 
 now  know  you  don't  need  to  overthink
[27:50] about  it  you  know  that  you  don't  need  to 
 stress  or  be  anxious  about  it  because  i 
 know  like  what  my  sort  of  capabilities
[27:56] are  i  don't  need  to  plan  the  fight 
 anymore  anxiety  is  kind  of  like  planning 
 something  bad  that  could  happen  so  you
[28:01] know  you  can  be  really  aware  of  it  you 
 can  try  and  save  yourself  from  the  pain 
 it's  been  almost  ticked  off  it's  like 
 yeah  you  don't  need  to  plan  because  you
[28:06] you  could  probably  you  know  not  not 
 great  but  someone  could  stop  the  show 
 you  obviously  but  you'd  be  relative  if
[28:11] you  had  like  an  okay  chance  you'd  be 
 relatively  fine  we  don't  need  to 
 preemptively  think  of  like  some 
 dangerous  situation  anymore  that's  very
[28:17] life-changing  for  me  and  i  wish  that  for 
 you  do  that  would  work  especially  when 
 you  don't  feel  like  it

uILhdYr_UDs,"[00:00] this  isn't  a  drugged-out  ten  minutes  on 
 15  second  long  video  with  a  three 
 minutes  Dollar  Shave  Club  advertisement
[00:06] in  the  middle  this  is  my  practical  guide 
 for  guys  who  want  real  advice  from 
 someone  who's  been  through  this  journey
[00:11] I  started  weightlifting  about  five  years 
 ago  with  the  same  goals  as  you  I'm  gonna
[00:17] try  and  give  you  the  best  real  advice  I 
 can  in  hopes  of  helping  other  guys  who 
 were  at  my  starting  point  because
[00:23] honestly  it's  unreal  how  much  my  life 
 has  changed  due  to  this  grind  I'm  going
[00:28] to  do  some  assuming  here  you're  a  young 
 male  aged  13  to  mid-20s
[00:34] you  chose  this  video  specifically 
 because  it's  a  guide  on  building  an 
 attractive  body  so  I'm  gonna  assume  that
[00:40] you  want  to  attract  the  opposite  sex  and 
 you  believe  building  a  muscular  body 
 helps  with  this  I'll  just  tell  you  the
[00:47] truth  right  now  he  absolutely  does 
 building  an  attractive  physique  means  to
[00:52] resistance  trade  that  is  weight  lifting 
 this  makes  muscles  while  focusing  on  a
[00:57] progressive  overload  so  that  literally 
 just  means  making  progress  as  you  go 
 along  using  heavier  weights  doing  more
[01:03] reps  longer  workouts  the  usual  guides 
 you'll  see  online  will  have  you  lifting
[01:08] heavy  three  times  a  week  focusing  on 
 compound  movements  this  advice  is  given
[01:13] by  guys  on  reddit  if  you  look  like  this 
 take  this  advice  if  you  do  not  want  to
[01:19] look  attractive  here  is  what  I  call  the 
 hierarchy  of  attractive  muscle  groups
[01:24] just  quickly  I  said  this  was  gonna  be  a 
 no-bullshit  guide  so  I'm  gonna  follow 
 that  I'm  not  gonna  go  in-depth  with  the
[01:30] particular  exercises  you  should  be  using 
 to  grow  these  particular  muscles  there's 
 literally  millions  of  videos  out  there
[01:35] that  will  already  tell  you  this  my 
 advice  is  to  find  a  credible  source  of
[01:40] information  such  as  a  scientific 
 research  based  youtuber  and  look  up
[01:45] their  guides  on  the  particular  muscle 
 you're  looking  into 
 so  starting  from  number  one  ABS  the
[01:53] abdominal  muscles  this  is  what 
 symbolizes  the  Greek  gods  the  importance
[01:58] of  ABS  in  terms  of  attractiveness  is 
 huge  every  single  person  you  meet  will 
 know  what  developed  herbs  look  like
[02:04] every  single  person  watching  this  video 
 is  probably  tried  getting  a  six-pack 
 when  they  were  younger  as  well  a  quick
[02:10] tip  here  do  a  lot  more  focus  on  the 
 lower  abs  the  upper  4-pack  is  generally
[02:16] built  quite  well  through  a  normal  weight 
 lifting  program  but  the  lower  selves
[02:21] underdeveloped  and  that's  the  one  that 
 really  fine  Tunes  the  physique  to  make
[02:26] it  look  more  attractive  number  two  to
[02:35] the  neck  i  bet  you  arnt  trailing  your 
 neck  and  you've  probably  never  even 
 heard  of  neck  training  before  just  makes
[02:40] an  insane  difference  in  your  physique 
 just  trust  me 
 thicker  muscular  neck  wish  you  look  a
[02:46] lot  more  masculine  and  less  like  a 
 little  boy  the  neck  is  a  body  part  but 
 it's  pretty  much  always  visible  no
[02:52] matter  what  type  of  clothing  you  wear  so 
 it's  important  to  develop  this  don't  be 
 like  those  bodybuilders  who  will  train
[02:58] for  years  and  never  do  anything  directly 
 for  the  neck  because  getting  a  developed
[03:04] body  which  is  growing  in  size  and  your 
 neck  is  still  the  same  size  makes  you
[03:09] look  really  strange  so  I'll  place  a 
 picture  here  where  you  can  see  a 
 bodybuilder  who  hasn't  trained  his  neck
[03:14] the  guy  is  jacked  but  if  we  just  can  see 
 his  neck  in  his  face  you'll  look  like  a
[03:19] skinny  boy 
 then  I'll  unwrap  his  body  and  you  can 
 see  how  big  he  is  but  if  you  were  just
[03:25] able  to  see  his  face  you  wouldn't  have 
 realized  that  he  put  in  probably  ten 
 years  into  the  gym  just  because  he
[03:31] didn't  train  neck  you  couldn't  even  see 
 that  dedication 
 it's  crazy  number  three  the  delts  so
[03:39] shoulders  specifically  the  lateral  delts 
 lateral  just  means  side  so  this  Latorre
[03:45] just  means  the  side  of  your  shoulder  you 
 trade  this  by  doing  lateral  raises  with 
 light  weight  and  you'll  see  a  difference
[03:51] in  your  physique  within  seconds  when 
 you've  got  pop  it  really  is  that  simple 
 this  muscle  is  insane  it  makes  you  look
[03:57] wider  and  your  waist  slimmer  in 
 comparison  or  the  parts  of  your  shoulder 
 muscle  like  these  traps  the  front  delts
[04:03] and  the  rear  delts  are  really  important 
 as  well  but  I  believe  the  lateral  delts 
 should  be  a  much  bigger  priority  number
[04:10] for  arms  including  forearms  just  like 
 the  neck  this  is  a  body  part  that  is
[04:15] generally  always  visible  so  any  progress 
 you  make  here  will  be  very  obvious  to 
 others  it  makes  it  quite  valuable  to
[04:22] train  forearms  in  particular  add  that 
 fine  chewing  effect  I  talked  about  with 
 the  lower  abs  if  your  forearms  are
[04:28] undeveloped  it  really  does  make  your 
 physique  look  strange 
 I  don't  even  back  and  legs  I  put  these
[04:35] at  the  lowest  hierarchy  don't  get  me 
 wrong  don't  skip  these  days  and  don't 
 not  train  them  I  still  trim  back  and
[04:41] legs  twice  a  week  and  I  hit  them  hard 
 I  make  progress  on  them  however  I  feel 
 like  these  muscles  generally  round  off
[04:47] your  physique  so  it  doesn't  really  look 
 weird  if  they're  undeveloped  but  there 
 certainly  are  the  muscles  that  should  be
[04:53] much  higher  priority  if  you're  focusing 
 on  aesthetics  building  an  attractive 
 body  no  girl  has  ever  said  that  she's
[04:59] attracted  to  you  because  you've  got 
 massive  quads  or  calves  diets  you  can
[05:05] get  into  this  to  optimize  your 
 performance  in  the  gym  but  generally  a 
 lot  of  people  get  off  poor  due  to  the
[05:11] diet  changes  most  guides  will  tell  you 
 it  will  absolutely  benefit  you  to  track
[05:16] your  micronutrients  and  weigh  out  every 
 single  gram  of  food  that  you  eat  but 
 honestly  the  majority  of  people  will
[05:21] never  do  this  it  is  quite  a  lot  of 
 effort  so  here's  my  quick  advice  that  I 
 think  will  be  valuable  in  this  journey
[05:27] you  want  to  be  building  as  much  muscle 
 as  possible  without  putting  on  too  much
[05:32] fats  so  always  try  to  be  lean 
 that  pretty  much  just  means  to  eat
[05:37] slightly  more  than  you  do  now  the 
 equivalent  of  two  slices  of  toast  on  top
[05:42] of  what  you  generally  eat  will  cause  you 
 to  gain  around  half  a  pound  a  week  the
[05:48] majority  of  that  weight  will  be  muscle 
 if  you're  training  hard  and  you're  quite 
 new  to  the  gym  as  well  you  can  still  eat
[05:53] quite  healthy  with  high  protein  and  it's 
 enjoy  snacks  and  meals  out  whenever  you 
 want  I've  made  a  video  talking  about  my
[05:59] awful  diets  where  through  my  five  year 
 transformation  I  don't  food  pretty  much
[06:04] every  day  but  I  still  made  pretty  good 
 progress  you  can't  out  train  a  bad  diet
[06:10] you  cannot  train  a  bad  diet  I  can  so 
 this  is  how  I've  really  enjoy  food  every
[06:16] single  night  it  really  can't  be  done  so 
 don't  think  that  to  build  an  attractive
[06:21] body  you  need  to  just  eat  chicken  and 
 rice  and  broccoli  and  you  can't  ever 
 have  a  burger  put  it  this  way  I  go  to
[06:27] McDonald's  most  days  and  I'm  pretty 
 muscular  this  food  isn't  going  to  make 
 you  fat  eating  too  much  of  any  food
[06:34] including  healthy  food  like  vegetables 
 will  cause  you  to  gain  fat  even  if  you
[06:39] don't  want  to  get  into  the  diet  too  much 
 you  can't  be  bothered  with  tracking  it 
 away  in  your  food  I'd  still  recommend
[06:44] just  getting  some  knowledge  on  this 
 topic  if  you  can  just  go  and  learn  a  few 
 things  about  this  I  really  do  think
[06:50] it'll  stick  with  you  for  life  just  go 
 and  learn  what  calories  are  how  they 
 work  what  a  calorie  maintenance  level
[06:56] means  what  a  calorie  deficit  and  calorie 
 surplus  means  macronutrients  learn  that
[07:03] all  foods  consist  of  protein  fats  and 
 carbs  this  type  of  knowledge  is  opens  up
[07:08] your  mind  you  learn  there's  no  such 
 thing  as  bad  food  and  that  you  can  eat 
 pretty  much  whatever  you  want  as  long  as
[07:14] you  keep  these  are  macro  nutrient  levels 
 generally  fine
[07:19] all  right  you've  heard  the  advice  you 
 have  the  knowledge  what  if  you  just 
 can't  be  bothered  I'm  a  pretty  lazy  guy
[07:26] myself  and  that's  why  I  always  try  to 
 revolve  my  videos  around  real  average 
 people  because  this  advice  it  is  just
[07:33] useless  if  you  can't  be  asked  going  to 
 the  gym  I  made  a  separate  video  on  how 
 to  go  about  this  journey  if  you're  quite
[07:39] a  lazy  person  like  me  exercise  is  like 
 oatmeal  if  you  don't  like  it  just
[07:44] because  you  haven't  customized  it  to 
 your  liking  it's  actually  got  pretty 
 decent  feedback  as  well  so  I'll  put  a
[07:50] direct  link  to  that  video  at  the  top  of 
 this  description  so  you  can  have  to 
 watch  it  on  my  idea  for  this  is  for  you
[07:55] guys  to  save  this  video  in  your  YouTube 
 watch  later  saved  videos  like  videos
[08:01] whatever  so  you  can  just  come  back  to  it 
 multiple  times  in  the  future  to  refresh
[08:06] your  memory  so  in  terms  of  that  I'm  just 
 gonna  fire  off  a  bunch  of  quick  random 
 tips  I  can  think  of  that  would  be
[08:11] valuable  if  you're  watching  this  in  the 
 future  so  just  quick  sleep  is  very 
 important  get  more  than  eight  hours
[08:17] everyone  will  tell  you  to  get  six  to 
 eight  no  get  eight  to  Ted  if  you're 
 working  out  you  need  longer  there's  no
[08:23] such  things  overtraining  it's  under 
 recovery  so  if  you  can  only  sleep  a
[08:28] certain  amount  of  hours  at  nighttime  and 
 you  have  to  wake  up  at  6  or  7  for  work 
 or  for  school  that's  fine  you'll  only
[08:35] get  6  7  hours  but  when  you  come  back 
 there's  nothing  stopping  you  from  just 
 having  a  half  an  hour  20  minute  nap  and
[08:40] doing  that  twice  and  studies  say  that 
 that's  actually  pretty  healthy  to  you  as 
 well  and  in  terms  of  supplements
[08:47] creatine  protein  powder  vitamin  D  zinc 
 there's  some  other  ones  that  you  can
[08:52] take  a  lot  of  them  know  what  just  waste 
 money  any  kind  of  supplement  you're 
 getting  should  be  very  cheap  couple  of
[08:57] pounds  each  vitamin  D  zinc  multivitamins 
 whatever  that  [ __ ]  you're  gonna  buy 
 literally  search  for  it  on  eBay  don't
[09:04] buy  any  of  those  I  can  deliver  to  your 
 door  and  it's  customized  for  men  or 
 whatever  [ __ ]  get  the  multivitamins
[09:09] that  are  like  99  piane  based  exact  same 
 things 
 miss  Mindy's  a  2-pound  on  eBay  for  like
[09:14] a  pack  of  like  a  thousand  zinc  is  like 
 four  pounds  for  a  pack  of  100  something
[09:19] about  creatine  is  like  10  pounds  in  the 
 last  few  six  months  protein  power 
 there's  a  bit  more  expensive  you'll  buy
[09:24] it 
 about  30  50  pounds  and  it  will  last  for 
 like  six  months  anyway  optimize  the
[09:31] perfect  scenario  so  the  video  that  I've 
 linked  at  the  top  of  the  description  I 
 went  into  this  with  better  detail  but
[09:37] these  are  always  a  perfect  particular 
 scenario  that  you'll  have  a  great 
 exercise  session  in  so  the  scenario  can
[09:44] be  changed  by  the  variables  what  that 
 leshiy  just  means  is  that  there's 
 factors  that  go  into  the  exercise
[09:49] session  like  the  music  you  listen  to  the 
 clothes  you  wear  what  time  you  train
[09:54] what  gym  you  train  if  you  train  by 
 itself  any  random  factor  that  you  think 
 that  could  potentially  affect  your
[10:00] session  just  write  it  down  have  a  little 
 thought  of  our  inputs  spend  some  time  on 
 this  what  is  the  perfect  scenario  for
[10:07] you  do  you  want  to  go  to  the  gym  and 
 train  at  night  time  would  you  train 
 better  in  the  morning  but  then  would  you
[10:13] have  to  wake  up  earlier  for  that  so 
 you'll  have  to  cool  to  sleep  earlier  to 
 figure  all  this  out  and  then  you'll  be 
 able  to  find  the  perfect  scenario  the
[10:20] schedule  that  works  best  for  you  cardio 
 doesn't  really  help  with  building  an
[10:25] attractive  body  but  it  does  have  good 
 health  benefits  plus  it  stops  you  being 
 unattractive  if  you  can't  go  up  some
[10:31] stairs  without  wheezing  like  a  smoker 
 I'm  going  to  end  this  video  with  a  bit 
 of  a  motivational  speech  I've  kept
[10:37] calling  all  this  a  journey  that's 
 exactly  what  it  is  this  is  your  journey
[10:42] you're  writing  the  chapters  of  this  book 
 make  sure  when  you  look  back  you'll  feel
[10:47] proud  of  the  effort  you're  putting  in  we 
 all  wish  we  could  be  teleported  back  in 
 time  and  slap  some  sense  into  our
[10:52] younger  selves  and  tell  them  to  work 
 harder 
 make  sure  your  future  self  isn't  looking
[10:57] back  at  you  today  and  thinking  this  make 
 sure  your  future  self  thanks  you  for  the 
 work  you're  putting  in  today  and  as
[11:03] always  buy  my  premium  snatcher

"
rCVAC8Iw3I8,"[00:00] Jeffrey  thinks  he's  a  nice  guy  but  why 
 aren't  girls  interested  in  him 
 he's  so  nice  to  them  he  manipulatively
[00:06] compliments  them  all  the  time  Jeffrey  is 
 a  nice  guy  he's  not  nice  but  he's  a  nice
[00:11] guy  that's  a  term  used  for  weak  men  like 
 Jeffrey  who  think  that  being  nice  to  a 
 girl  will  get  him  into  her  pants  tough
[00:17] luck  Jeffrey  it  takes  more  than  that 
 Adonis
[00:22] Adonis  is  a  nice  guy  but  not  with  those 
 quotes  he  is  a  man  who  is  nice  who  is
[00:27] kind  who  is  generous  he's  the  tribe 
 leader  the  most  successful  one  of  all 
 but  along  with  being  nice  adonis's
[00:34] dominant  masculine  and  attractive  that's 
 why  women  are  interested  in  him  I  took 
 my  brother's  advice  once  with  dating  and
[00:40] texting  a  girl  there  was  a  girl  that  I 
 had  a  crush  on  for  like  months  and 
 months  and  months  and  I've  been  on  a
[00:45] couple  of  dates  with  her  I  never  even 
 had  kissed  there  bro  three  four  five 
 dates  I  took  her  to  like  a  nearby  cafe 
 and  we  got  like  some  frozen  drink  and
[00:51] just  kind  of  talk  and  everything  and  I 
 had  like  a  major  crush  on  it  even  though 
 I  hadn't  even  kissed  her  once  and  then  I
[00:56] didn't  speak  to  her  for  a  while  you  know 
 she  started  sort  of  like  ignoring  my 
 requests  to  like  meet  up  for  dates  and 
 stuff  months  go  by  I'm  still  kind  of
[01:01] thinking  about  her  but  also  gonna  try  to 
 move  on  thinking  about  other  girls  and 
 I'm  invited  to  this  party  at  the
[01:06] University  that  I'm  going  to  and  my 
 brother  gives  me  the  idea  that  I  should 
 invite  her  now  bear  in  mind  that  we
[01:11] hadn't  spoke  for  like  two  three  four 
 months  with  my  brother's  advice  this 
 shitty  ass  advice  he  tells  me  what  to
[01:16] text  her  and  I  text  her  the  most  like 
 Fruity  blue  pill  [ __ ]  like  hey  like  you
[01:21] know  there's  a  party  tonight  and  I  only 
 want  to  go  with  you  so  if  you  really 
 like  to  come  with  me  it'd  be  such  a  good 
 time  and  yeah  so  I  sounded  like  this
[01:27] like  cute  ass  little  paragraph  bro  like 
 oh  you  should  come  at  this  point  and  she 
 literally  replies  this  has  got  to  be  a
[01:34] joke  that  [ __ ]  hurt  but  even  then  me 
 and  my  brother  I  think  okay  what  more 
 can  we  text  her  and  I  text  her  more  like
[01:39] my  [ __ ]  like  you  know  you  you've  always 
 been  in  my  mind  and  I  miss  you  like  we 
 used  to  go  on  dates  and  it  was  so  good 
 you're  so  cute  and  everything  and  you're
[01:44] the  only  girl  I'm  interested  in  bro  and 
 she  literally  says  this  is  definitely
[01:49] one  of  your  friends  texting  this  haha  me 
 and  my  brother  look  at  each  other  with 
 this  sense  of  like  yeah  Mission  failed 
 we'll  get  them  next  time  and  I'm  pretty
[01:55] sure  I  ended  up  texting  I'm  like  yeah  my 
 friend  stole  my  phone  huh 
 so  this  is  what  you  do  to  avoid  a
[02:02] situation  like  that  don't  be  an  [ __ ] 
 but  also  don't  be  a  nice  guy  we  don't
[02:07] want  to  be  a  nice  guy  we  don't  want  to 
 be  like  overly  nice  for  no  reason  but 
 also  we  don't  want  to  go  too  extreme  and
[02:12] be  an  [ __ ]  we  want  to  be  somewhere 
 around  the  middle  and  this  is  where 
 Adonis  is  at  Adonis  is  the  ultimate  meal
[02:17] the  kind  of  man  that  we  aspire  to  be  now 
 he  isn't  a  nice  guy  he  isn't  like  one  of 
 those  guys  who  slyly  tries  to  be  like
[02:23] nice  to  try  and  like  you  know  attract  a 
 girl  he  doesn't  overly  nice  but  he  is  a 
 kind  loving  warm  man  now  at  the  same
[02:29] time  of  course  Adonis  is  not  an  [ __ ] 
 but  he  has  some  traits  of  like 
 disagreeableness  if  he  disagrees  with  a
[02:35] girl  he'll  say  it  he  won't  just  agree 
 with  everything  that  she  says  and  we 
 need  to  adopt  this  because  too  many 
 young  guys  like  yourself  Place  girls  on
[02:41] such  a  high  pedestal  that  you  kind  of 
 act  like  she  can't  do  anything  wrong 
 like  you  view  her  so  highly  that  even  if
[02:46] you  kind  of  know  that  she's  maybe  a  bit 
 of  a  loser  that  you  know  she's  not  on 
 self-improvements  that  she  just  spends 
 her  time  watching  TV  scrolling  on  Tick
[02:52] Tock  and  watching  Netflix  eating  junk 
 food  and  we're  like  oh  well  you  know 
 she's  a  princess  I  know  she's  not  broke 
 now  you  shouldn't  be  insulting  towards
[02:58] her  or  disrespectful  because  you  know 
 she's  a  girl  some  guys  are  like  this 
 they're  literally  like  disrespectful 
 just  to  girls  for  no  reason  but  at  the
[03:04] same  time  you  shouldn't  be  overly  nice 
 to  it  just  because  she's  female  I'm 
 gonna  tell  you  the  truth  that  not  a  lot
[03:09] of  people  say  and  it's  gonna  sound  kind 
 of  sexist  but  honestly  bro  some  women 
 don't  deserve  your  nice  side  and 
 honestly  some  guys  don't  either  you
[03:15] might  be  thinking  but  we'll  wear  Hamza 
 like  I  am  actually  a  nice  guy  though  and 
 you  probably  are  and  that's  a  good  thing 
 it's  good  to  be  a  guy  who's  nice  it's
[03:21] got  to  be  nice  like  nice  it's  like  a 
 good  personality  trait  you  know  so  many 
 guys  say  like  oh  I  don't  want  to  be  a 
 nice  guy  and  I  just  think  that  they
[03:27] probably  don't  know  what  they're 
 actually  saying  because  I  only  hang 
 around  with  nice  people  if  you're  not 
 nice  I  wouldn't  ever  be  friends  with  you
[03:32] we  want  to  be  nice  of  course  we  do  we 
 want  to  be  nice  kind  warm  to  the  people 
 who  are  in  our  tribe  to  our  families  who
[03:37] are  friends  but  being  a  nice  guy  like 
 nice  guy  is  kind  of  like  a  quote  like  a 
 term  by  itself  these  days  it  doesn't
[03:42] just  necessarily  mean  a  guy  who's  nice 
 it  means  like  this  kind  of  guy  who  uses 
 fake  nicety  to  try  and  get  like  attract
[03:48] a  girl  and  that's  not  attractive  it's 
 the  kind  of  guy  who  never  wants  to 
 disagree  with  a  girl  because  he's  just
[03:53] trying  to  be  nice  and  you  know  he's  just 
 overly  like  he's  just  buying  the  things 
 this  is  simply  and  everything  it's  not 
 attractive  but  to  be  a  guy  I'm  man  who
[04:00] does  have  nice  Parts  about  him  well 
 that's  the  best  of  both  worlds  how  do 
 you  stop  being  a  nice  guy  you  kind  of
[04:05] just  need  exposure  to  men  who  are  like 
 good  with  women  and  see  how  they 
 navigate  if  you  watch  a  movie  of  James
[04:11] Bond  you  wouldn't  think  oh  he's  a  nice 
 guy  you  might  think  like  oh  yeah  he's 
 professional  he's  attractive  he's  sexy
[04:16] he's  Charming  but  he's  not  a  nice  guy 
 he's  not  overly  nice  to  these  girls  for 
 no  reason  and  he  actually  calls  them  out
[04:22] on  their  [ __ ]  just  like  he  would 
 call  out  guys  this  is  harder  said  than 
 done  but  you  need  to  see  some  guys 
 navigate  their  relations  with  women  but
[04:29] not  in  like  a  nice  guy  a  modern  dynamic 
 kind  of  way  and  this  is  hard  because  the 
 majority  of  relationships  that  you  see
[04:34] of  the  guys  that  you  see  who  are  dating 
 girls  the  majority  of  guys  are  quite 
 like  nice  guys  like  they  might  be
[04:39] attractive  they  might  get  girls  but  a 
 lot  of  guys  are  quite  like  weak  feminine 
 submissive  docile  you  know  the  the  kind
[04:44] of  guys  who  would  never  even  call  a  girl 
 out  if  she  does  something  wrong  and  have 
 some  more  extremely  controversial  advice
[04:49] but  this  is  what  works  for  me  I  kind  of 
 think  that  a  certain  amount  of  guys  need 
 to  just  transition  from  being  a  nice  guy
[04:56] you  know  overly  nice  to  actually  going 
 through  a  phase  of  being  overly  hostile 
 and  hateful  towards  women  to  eventually
[05:03] get  closer  to  being  like  Adonis  some 
 guys  can  avoid  that  sort  of  hating  women 
 face  and  they  can  just  go  from  being
[05:08] like  a  nice  guy  you  know  who's  overly 
 nice  and  everything  to  just  acting  more 
 like  Adonis  being  like  a  gentleman  who's
[05:13] warm  but  also  respects  himself  some  guys 
 can  escape  this  middle  period  but  some 
 guys  have  to  go  through  a  period  from
[05:18] being  nice  to  then  being  kind  of  like 
 negative  towards  women  and  I  honestly 
 had  to  do  this  this  is  probably  stuff
[05:23] you've  never  heard  of  before  someone 
 openly  admitting  this  but  I  had  to  go 
 through  a  phase  of  almost  like  hating 
 women  and  you're  thinking  kind  of
[05:29] negative  thoughts  again  a  stupid  [ __ ] 
 and  yeah  these  [ __ ]  are  so  stupid  you 
 know  all  this  kind  of  negative  thought 
 which  is  so  toxic  man  but  I  had  to  go
[05:35] through  that  to  get  to  where  I  am  now  I 
 had  to  this  is  what  the  modern  world 
 really  doesn't  want  you  to  experience
[05:41] but  the  thing  is  if  you've  been  sold 
 this  lie  that  you  should  be  this  nice 
 little  good  boy  and  you've  fallen  for 
 this  lie  you  need  to  go  through  some
[05:46] level  of  like  aggression  to  get  pissed 
 off  at  the  world  and  pissed  off  at  women 
 for  like  thinking  that  you've  fallen  for
[05:51] this  lie  and  of  course  don't  do  that  in 
 some  kind  of  like  violent  way  don't  do 
 that  in  a  way  that  will  insult  or 
 disrespect  anyone  but  you  might  find
[05:57] some  progress  in  almost  turning  on  your 
 male  aggression  and  having  a  sense  of 
 hatred  against  the  world  and  sometimes
[06:02] against  women  to  think  like  yeah  like 
 I've  been  sold  this  lie  like  women 
 aren't  even  that  great  anyway  I've  put
[06:07] them  on  such  a  high  pedestal  they're  not 
 even  that  special  they're  just  human 
 beings  and  you  almost  have  like  this 
 energy  of  hatred  that  eventually  leaves
[06:12] you  because  you're  finally  acting  like  a 
 [ __ ]  man  with  anger  and  aggression 
 which  is  normal  for  men  and  then  it's
[06:17] almost  like  you're  left  with  nothing  but 
 like  just  positive  feelings  about  women 
 some  guys  need  to  go  through  that
[06:22] transition  and  I  did  that  being  said 
 that  I  want  to  remind  you  to  put  in  so 
 much  intention  to  make  sure  that  you 
 don't  get  stuck  in  either  of  these
[06:28] sections  don't  get  stuck  just  being  nice 
 for  no  reasons  especially  to  women  who 
 don't  deserve  it  and  don't  get  stuck  in 
 this  sort  of  like  hateful  phase  where
[06:34] you  kind  of  hate  the  world  of  alliancy 
 because  so  many  guys  especially  the  guys 
 that  you  see  on  YouTube  are  stuck  here
[06:39] and  they  are  lesser  men  transition  as 
 fast  as  you  can  over  to  where  Adonis  is 
 where  you  begin  to  just  see  women  for
[06:45] what  they  are  people  you  take  women  off 
 this  pedestal  which  you've  put  them  on 
 and  you  realize  that  you  know  if  a  girl
[06:51] does  something  to  piss  you  off  you'll 
 respond  in  the  exact  same  way  that  you 
 would  have  a  guided  you'd  respond  to  a 
 girl  that  you're  dating  if  you  turned  up
[06:57] late  to  a  date  in  the  same  way  that  you 
 would  if  you're  male  friend  did  you'd 
 show  a  girl  with  a  certain  kind  of
[07:02] characteristics  and  hobbies  and  traits 
 the  same  level  of  interest  that  you 
 would  in  a  guy  and  this  is  a  very
[07:07] interesting  transition  because  you  start 
 to  realize  like  how  much  you've  put 
 women  in  a  pedestal  and  that's  why
[07:12] you've  been  so  nice  because  you  value 
 like  girls  so  highly  and  then  one  day 
 you  kind  of  click  and  you're  like  wait 
 the  girl  I'm  interested  in  is  a  loser  I
[07:18] wouldn't  be  friends  with  a  guy  if  he  was 
 like  that  like  all  she  does  is  just 
 scroll  on  Tick  Tock  that's  [ __ ] 
 that's  repulsive  why  am  I  being  so  nice
[07:24] to  her  why  am  I  like  paying  for  [ __ ] 
 like  she's  not  a  nice  girl  to  be  around 
 she's  not  even  like  polite  or  anything 
 you  need  to  stop  giving  points  of
[07:30] admiration  to  someone  who's  a  low 
 quality  person  and  start  to  respect 
 yourself  enough  to  think  that  you  don't
[07:35] need  to  present  this  like  fake  positive 
 you  know  really  happy  nice  attitude  to
[07:40] people  who  don't  really  deserve  it  most 
 importantly  you  need  permission  for  this 
 because  if  you  add  like  a  strong 
 masculine  father  figure  you  would  have
[07:46] seen  him  and  imitated  the  way  that  he 
 navigated  his  relationship  with  your 
 loving  feminine  mother  but  the  majority
[07:51] of  us  haven't  had  that  kind  of  Parental 
 Dynamic  that  we've  been  able  to  observe 
 so  we've  never  really  been  able  to  learn
[07:56] about  the  correct  sort  of  relationship 
 Dynamic  and  it's  such  a  shame  that  you 
 didn't  get  to  benefit  from  that  because
[08:01] if  you  did  see  like  a  positively  loving 
 strong  masculine  father  figure  you  would 
 have  seen  him  respect  himself  and  not  be
[08:07] overly  nice  to  people  who  didn't  deserve 
 that 
 what  you  see  before  you  is  an  absolutely
[08:13] massive  movement  of  young  men  who  are 
 taking  self-improvement  seriously  we 
 didn't  start  off  in  the  best  place  with
[08:19] the  best  parents  or  the  best  genetics 
 but  we're  doing  the  best  that  we  can 
 with  the  things  that  we  can  improve  in 
 our  lives  and  our  relationships  with
[08:24] women  is  a  big  part  of  that  you  can  join 
 this  movement  of  men  who  are 
 relentlessly  improving  themselves  and

 mwah
"
6AfKseHKmRc,"[00:00] Jeffrey's  not  sure  if  this 
 self-improvement  thing  is  actually  going 
 to  work  for  him  he  wants  to  be  on  nofap
[00:05] but  he  can  only  manage  a  few  days  at  a 
 time  before  he  relapses  again  so  clearly 
 this  isn't  gonna  work  meditation  nah  nah
[00:11] I  don't  think  it'll  work  journaling  no 
 exercise  yeah  like  I  went  to  the  gym  uh
[00:16] two  to  go  scrolling  on  Instagram  yes 
 please  watching  both  videos  on  YouTube 
 sure  but  in  three  times  when  he's  reset
[00:22] his  streak  because  you  know  it's  already 
 at  zero  so  you  may  as  well  go  again  yeah 
 why  not  he's  doing  all  of  the  bad  habits
[00:28] he  doesn't  feel  motivated  to  do  anything 
 and  perhaps  that's  just  because  he's 
 Friday's  dopamine  receptors  bad  at
[00:33] Jeffrey  Adonis 
 Adonis  started  his  self-improvement 
 journey  young  years  of  good  habits
[00:39] developed  Adonis  to  be  the  kind  of  man 
 that  we  would  aspire  to  be  because  just 
 look  at  him  he  looks  amazing  he  feels
[00:45] amazing  his  life  is  amazing  and  it  has 
 all  come  from  self-improvement  in  this 
 video  I'm  not  going  to  tell  you  about  my
[00:51] story  I'm  going  to  tell  you  about  the 
 story  of  Sam  who  was  my  first  video 
 editor  for  this  channel  we  have  five 
 video  editors  now  I  hired  him  in
[00:57] December  2020  and  Sam  was  a  Jeffrey  when 
 I  hired  some  I  promise  you  that  this  is
[01:02] the  truth  and  I  don't  even  say  this  to 
 be  insulting  to  him  he  was  a  total 
 Jeffrey  he  was  a  full-time  live  streamer
[01:09] on  Twitch  which  meant  that  he  was 
 playing  video  games  for  around  12  hours 
 a  day  four  five  six  times  a  week  imagine
[01:15] that  bro  he  was  live  streaming  on  Twitch 
 playing  video  games  for  honestly  like  I
[01:20] checked  sometimes  he  had  like  eight 
 viewers  for  eight  viewers  for  literally 
 about  12  hours  a  day  alright  so  my  dad
[01:26] just  told  me  I'm  adopted  guys  he  was 
 skinny  didn't  even  exercise  at  all 
 didn't  eat  right  or  anything  Sam  was
[01:31] clinically  depressed  he  was  on 
 antidepressants  he  was  just  not  enjoying 
 any  part  of  life  but  by  editing  my
[01:36] self-improvement  videos  and  getting 
 closer  and  closer  to  me  he  naturally 
 just  became  more  like  me  because  you
[01:41] know  the  phrase  you're  the  average  of 
 The  Five  People  You  spend  time  with  well 
 it  really  worked  for  some  by  spending 
 time  with  me  Sam's  life  got  better
[01:47] because  he  got  onto  self-improvement 
 started  weightlifting  and  everything  by 
 me  spending  time  with  Sam  my  life  got  so
[01:52] much  [ __ ]  worse  I'm  come  on  man  the 
 first  part  of  self-improvement  that  we 
 got  someone  to  was  exercising  and  I 
 remember  that  he  didn't  even  have  the
[01:57] confidence  to  go  to  the  gym  like  he  just 
 did  it  was  impossible  for  him  to  go  to 
 the  gym  he  had  like  intense  social
[02:02] anxiety  so  he  couldn't  even  like  step 
 outside  of  his  house  so  he  was  literally 
 doing  like  this  shitty  home  workouts 
 push-ups  with  his  knees  on  the  floor
[02:07] negative  pull-ups  like  when  you  can't 
 even  do  a  pull-up  so  you  have  to  step  on 
 a  chair  first  and  already  cheat  your  way
[02:12] there  and  then  you  just  kind  of  like 
 fall  down  and  that  gives  you  like  a 
 little  bit  of  the  gains  I  had  so  I'm 
 doing  this  kind  of  workout  for  a  couple
[02:17] of  months  and  we  got  closer  and  closer 
 hopping  onto  like  video  calls  and 
 eventually  we  became  quite  good  friends 
 and  he  became  kind  of  like  my  right  hand
[02:22] man  in  this  entire  YouTube  channel  this 
 movements  he's  the  guy  that  I  go  to  to 
 help  me  make  decisions  and  he  really
[02:28] proved  himself  to  me  so  we  spent  more 
 and  more  time  together  eventually  some 
 got  more  and  more  confident  because  he 
 was  on  self-improvement  he  was  working
[02:34] out  a  little  bit  and  he  signed  up  to  gym 
 nearby  which  was  a  huge  step  for  him 
 because  he  literally  wasn't  leaving  his
[02:39] house  before  then  my  boys  first  gym 
 session  is  down  on  the  [ __ ]  stack  I
[02:44] don't  want  to  give  me  a  better  workout 
 the  machines  or  my  anxiety  but  either 
 way  feels  [ __ ]  great  man  I  wanted  to
[02:50] go  to  the  gym  since  I  was  13.
[02:55] I'm  quite  old  enough  to  go  then  and  by 
 the  time  I  was  old  enough  I  was  crippled 
 with  stuff  but  I  did  it
[03:02] I  did  it  like  literally  seriously  like 
 he  was  already  past  the  age  of  school 
 and  everything  he  was  staying  inside  of
[03:07] his  house  every  day  and  so  him  signing 
 up  to  the  gym  and  going  to  the  gym  was 
 like  a  big  thing  I  literally  remember 
 needing  to  like  prep  him  for  this  to
[03:13] teach  him  like  okay  this  is  what  you  do 
 in  the  gym  you  go  there  to  get  onto  this 
 machine  you  do  this  you  make  sure  you 
 wipe  your  sweat  that  I'll  teach  you  them
[03:18] like  the  social  mannerisms  of  like  how 
 to  be  outside  you  have  to  learn  this 
 [ __ ]  bro  he  got  consistent  in  the  gym  he
[03:23] made  some  friends  there  started 
 practicing  his  social  skills  that  he  was 
 learning  from  my  videos  and  I  would  tell 
 him  yeah  just  trying  to  speak  to  someone
[03:29] in  the  gym  you  know  just  like  just  ask 
 them  how  many  sets  they've  got  left  and 
 slowly  and  surely  he  started  getting 
 more  popular  he  made  some  friends  he
[03:34] started  going  out  to  like  clubs  and 
 parties  and  stuff  and  you  know  doing 
 some  like  sort  of  degenerate  habits  but 
 then  he  even  gave  all  that  up  became  so
[03:40] much  more  productive  more  work  focused 
 eating  cleaner  reading  reaching  more 
 levels  of  success  and  then  he  took  a  big
[03:45] step  by  my  side  he  took  his  first  ever 
 plane  flight  at  the  age  of  22  me  and  him 
 flew  out  to  Amsterdam  and  we  threw  out  a
[03:51] bunch  of  our  team  members  and  we  met  up 
 there  to  celebrate  I  booked  out  a 
 penthouse  for  our  team  and  that  was  a
[03:56] big  move  for  him  to  literally  take  a 
 plane  we  have  a  sick  time  there  he's 
 developing  more  and  more  confidence  he's 
 getting  way  more  into  like  weightlifting
[04:02] really  wanting  to  build  physique  and 
 then  we  take  even  a  bigger  trip  to 
 Thailand  all  the  way  across  the  world
[04:07] and  I  remember  that  that  was  such  a  big 
 PR  for  him  that  he  literally  broke  down 
 multiple  times  just  on  the  flight  and
[04:13] everything  I  literally  saw  him  like  just 
 seeming  so  like  empty  and  like  [ __ ]  like 
 you  know  shelled  up  because  we  just  took
[04:18] the  biggest  [ __ ]  flight  of  his  life 
 and  even  of  mine  12  hours  away  but  in 
 Thailand  he  started  getting  more 
 confident  training  Muay  Thai  even
[04:24] attracting  girls  we  met  with  the  guys 
 jack  and  Bill  that  Sam  really  bonded 
 with  we've  come  back  home  from  Thailand
[04:29] and  since  then  about  three  months  ago 
 because  I  was  been  putting  in  the 
 [ __ ]  grind  the  reason  why  I'm  telling 
 you  this  story  is  because  I  want  you  to
[04:34] imagine  this  before  and  after  before  is 
 it  a  man  a  boy  21  years  old  live
[04:40] streaming  video  games  for  12  hours  a  day 
 on  Twitch  to  eight  viewers  intense 
 social  anxiety  not  going  outside  just
[04:46] skinny  as  [ __ ]  depressed  clinically 
 depressed  and  I  forgot  to  mention 
 actually  that  sometime  near  the  start  of 
 this  year  Sam's  clinical  depression  was
[04:52] cured  and  he  no  longer  needed 
 antidepressants  anymore  because  he  was 
 now  on  self-improvement  and  actually
[04:57] living  like  how  you're  supposed  to  live 
 till  the  after  where  he's  in  shape  he's 
 in  fantastic  shape  actually  working  hard
[05:03] he  doesn't  play  video  games  at  all 
 anymore  and  he  actually  quite  is  like 
 against  them  the  same  way  that  I  am
[05:08] because  he's  realized  how  much  of  a  hook 
 they  had  over  him  he's  becoming 
 successful  he's  became  a  man  I  put  him
[05:13] through  the  rite  of  passage  myself  I 
 literally  baptized  him  like  I  took  him 
 to  a  waterfall  in  Thailand  we  did  this 
 incredibly  hard  like  journey  and  I
[05:19] literally  [ __ ]  baptized  Sam 
 underneath  water  and  told  him  that 
 you're  a  man  now  we're  gonna  baptize  him
[05:24] God  Jack  you  baptize  him  baptized 
 [Applause]
[05:30] bananas
[05:37] oh 
 you're  right  you're  about  now  what's  the
[05:42] passage  I  know  it  was  only  like  you  know 
 it  was  just  goofy  [ __ ]  like  you  know  you 
 and  your  friend  next  to  the  waterfall
[05:47] that  you  grab  his  skull  and  put  it  into 
 the  water  and  I  was  just  like  oh  you're 
 a  man  now  but  like  it  was  true  he 
 legally  turned  into  a  man  when  he  was  18
[05:53] years  old  but  he  actually  turned  into  a 
 man  in  the  last  one  year  being  on 
 self-improvement  there  are  so  many  guys
[05:59] who  are  just  shut  indoors  feeling 
 hopeless  feeling  like  they  can't  really 
 get  out  of  the  the  ruts  that  they're  in
[06:04] nothing  really  seems  to  be  enjoyable 
 it's  this  feeling  of  this  Bleak  dark 
 gray  depressive  nihilistic  just
[06:11] emptiness  purposelessness  no  real 
 enjoyment  only  stimulation  and  so  many
[06:16] guys  can  relate  to  that  you  see  the 
 modern  world  has  really  really  [ __ ] 
 over  men  younger  men  particularly  and
[06:22] it's  time  that  you  get  a  reminder 
 perhaps  this  may  be  one  of  the  first 
 times  you've  been  told  this  it's  time
[06:27] that  you  get  reminded  that  you  are  part 
 of  the  warrior  class  do  you  know  in  like 
 Finance  money  [ __ ]  there's  always  like
[06:32] working  class  business  class  upper  class 
 there's  a  class  that  isn't  really  spoke 
 about  and  that  is  the  warrior  class  it
[06:37] is  younger  you  see  younger  men  are  the 
 most  powerful  of  any  generation  young
[06:43] men  are  what  cause  revolutions  and  Wars 
 young  men  are  what  cause  buildings  to  be 
 built  perhaps  it's  sexist  but  maybe  it's
[06:49] just  factual  when  you  drive  on  a  big 
 Motorway  100  of  the  people  who  made  this
[06:54] Motorway  are  men  when  you  see  a  big 
 building  100  of  the  builders  are  men 
 this  is  not  downplaying  women  or  saying
[06:59] that  there  but  I'm  not  talking  about 
 women  we're  just  hyping  up  men  right  now 
 because  it's  time  that  you  got  hyped  up
[07:04] and  you  realized  and  you  actually  heard 
 from  maybe  the  first  time  in  so  long  of 
 the  potential  that  you  have  young  men
[07:09] are  the  strongest  people  of  humanity  the 
 amount  of  potential  that  you  have  to
[07:15] change  your  life  and  it's  so  sad  to  see 
 that  potential  being  wasted  it's  so  sad 
 to  see  that  potential  being  manipulated
[07:21] and  stolen  from  you  by  these  evil 
 companies  that  want  to  just  sap  your 
 attention  into  them  porn  [ __ ]  porn
[07:27] imagine  how  evil  that  [ __ ]  company  of 
 PornHub  is  Facebook  meta  Instagram 
 Snapchat  Tick  Tock  they  know  what
[07:33] they're  doing  they  know  that  they  have 
 [ __ ]  your  life  they  know  that  they 
 have  [ __ ]  your  brother's  life  they 
 have  [ __ ]  your  male  friend  life  only
[07:39] fans  chances  are  if  you're  watching  me 
 intently  right  now  you  want  to  improve 
 you  want  to  experience  a  better  life  you
[07:46] don't  just  want  to  give  up  but  you  just 
 don't  really  know  what  to  do  or  how  to 
 do  it  to  actually  make  real  progress
[07:52] because  you've  been  told  this  [ __ ] 
 before  you've  been  told  to  maybe  take  a 
 break  from  video  games  to  maybe  stop
[07:57] watching  porn  to  maybe  go  to  the  gym  and 
 eat  cleaner  Foods  you've  been  told  that 
 but  for  some  reason  you  just  can't 
 really  seem  to  do  it  you  might  have  a
[08:03] feeling  that  you're  supposed  to  stay 
 stuck  like  this  wrong  go  and  look  at  the 
 comments  of  any  one  of  my  videos  I  urge
[08:10] you  to  do  this  now  you  can  pause  this 
 video  go  and  look  at  the  comments 
 underneath  this  video  go  onto  my  channel 
 on  like  10  different  videos  go  and  look
[08:15] at  the  comments  you  will  see  something 
 very  different  from  any  other  YouTube 
 channel  the  majority  of  comments  are 
 people  literally  saying  Hamza  you've
[08:21] saved  my  life  I  was  gonna  kill  myself 
 your  videos  have  saved  my  life  I'm  13 
 years  old  and  I've  had  a  porn  addiction
[08:26] for  three  years  and  I've  cured  it  now 
 because  I've  been  watching  your  videos 
 hamster  our  generation  of  young  men  have
[08:31] felt  so  hopeless  so  nihilistic  so 
 depressed  so  stuck  like  this  for  so  long
[08:37] till  now  because  we  know  what  cures  all 
 of  these  problems  we  know  what  fixes
[08:42] depression  we  know  what  gets  a  young  man 
 out  of  a  rot  and  actually  being 
 productive  we  know  what  causes  a  young
[08:47] man  to  get  this  Burning  Desire  inside  of 
 him  where  he  thinks  [ __ ]  I  want  to  take 
 some  responsibility  for  my  life  make
[08:52] some  money  help  my  family  and  actually 
 experience  like  a  good  life  it's 
 self-improvements  improving  yourself  in
[08:58] as  many  ways  as  possible  especially  your 
 mental  health  it  took  some  less  than  six
[09:03] months  to  cure  his  depression  that  he 
 thought  he  was  going  to  have  for  life 
 why  was  he  depressed  they  don't  want  me 
 to  tell  you  about  this  bro  I  might  get
[09:08] canceled  for  this  [ __ ]  because  I'm 
 telling  you  like  oh  maybe  depression's 
 not  like  I'm  not  being  under  10  saying
[09:13] depression  it's  not  real  I  think  it  is 
 real  but  I  think  people  think  that  it's 
 something  that  they're  just  supposed  to 
 be  stuck  with  and  they  don't  realize
[09:18] like  this  is  so  condescending  but  you'll 
 only  kind  of  believe  this  when  you've 
 experienced  it  yourself  the  reason  why 
 you're  depressed  is  just  because  you
[09:23] don't  live  like  a  normal  healthy  human 
 being  how  could  you  not  be  depressed 
 when  you  wake  up  and  just  stare  at  your
[09:28] phone  how  could  you  not  be  depressed 
 when  you  masturbate  five  times  a  day 
 three  times  a  day  every  single  day  for 
 years  you're  convinced  in  your  brain  and
[09:34] your  body  and  your  soul  that  you're 
 getting  laid  that  you're  experiencing 
 love  and  intimacy  and  every  single  day
[09:39] you  keep  waking  up  alone  how  could  you 
 not  be  depressed  how  could  you  not  be 
 depressed  when  you  go  onto  Instagram  and 
 you  see  people  who  are  better  than  you
[09:44] how  could  you  not  be  depressed  when  you 
 see  a  bleak  future  ahead  with  a  career 
 that  isn't  part  of  your  purpose  how
[09:49] could  you  not  be  depressed  when  you're 
 like  20  years  old  and  at  this  point 
 every  man  in  your  bloodline  has  had
[09:54] children  apart  from  you  how  could  you 
 not  be  depressed  when  70  80  90  of  men
[10:00] have  literally  no  love  no  intimacy  no 
 affection  in  their  lives  how  could  you 
 not  be  depressed  when  the  last  time  you
[10:05] climbed  a  tree  was  10  years  ago  how 
 could  you  not  be  depressed  when  you 
 don't  jump  over  a  puddle  when  you  don't
[10:10] jump  in  the  puddle  like  you  used  to  as  a 
 child  when  the  things  that  we  do  for  fun 
 these  days  are  literally  just  staring
[10:15] into  our  [ __ ]  phones  whereas  we  used 
 to  go  out  as  children  and  play  for 
 football  and  run  on  our  bikes  and  push
[10:20] each  other  into  mud  and  we  don't  do  that 
 [ __ ]  though  because  you  know  it's 
 inappropriate  for  an  adult  to  be  acting 
 that  way  I  don't  mean  to  be
[10:25] condescending  bro  but  honestly  you  want 
 to  cure  your  depression  in  20  minutes  go 
 outside  and  climb  a  tree  and  go  as  high
[10:30] as  you  possibly  can  and  I  guarantee  you 
 will  have  the  biggest  smile  on  your  face 
 and  you  know  why  you  don't  hear  advice 
 like  this  because  no  one  gets  the  profit
[10:36] from  it  no  YouTube  company  no  influence 
 against  a  profit  from  you  meditating  and 
 improving  your  mental  health  and  going
[10:41] outside  and  actually  acting  like  you're 
 supposed  to  being  amongst  nature  is  it 
 any  surprise  where  the  majority  of  us
[10:47] feel  so  bad  because  of  the  way  that  we 
 live  you  know  so  many  young  men  out 
 there  are  feeling  so  hopeless  you're
[10:52] part  of  the  lucky  ones  you  know  why 
 because  you're  watching  this  video  and 
 in  the  next  30  seconds  I'm  gonna  instill 
 more  hope  into  you  than  you've  ever  had
[10:57] before  remember  that  we've  done  all 
 these  bad  habits  for  years  and  years  and 
 years  and  years  self-improvement  with
[11:02] counteract  that  within  two  months  Max 
 within  two  weeks  you  will  see  a 
 significant  Improvement  to  your  life
[11:07] self-improvement  is  all  about  delaying 
 grassification  doing  the  hard  thing  now 
 so  that  our  life  is  better  in  the  future
[11:13] exercising  now  so  that  we're  more  fit  in 
 the  future  eating  clean  now  even  though 
 that  meal  doesn't  taste  as  nice  because
[11:18] it's  healthy  because  it's  not  as 
 pleasurable  but  your  life  gets  better  in 
 the  future  you  keep  doing  all  of  these 
 good  habits  that  make  your  future  life
[11:24] better  and  eventually  it  is  the  future 
 eventually  you  become  your  future  self 
 and  all  you  can  do  is  stand  there  with  a
[11:29] 10  out  of  10  physique  with  your 
 girlfriend  that  you  love  by  your  side 
 and  you  just  have  this  [ __ ]  sense  of 
 self-love  thinking  my  younger
[11:35] self-sacrificed  for  me  I  sit  before  you 
 today  as  I  guy  who's  built  his  dream 
 physique  my  dream  life  digital  Nomad
[11:42] successful  all  these  like  good  things  I 
 could  say  about  myself  I've  achieved  my 
 dream  life  of  course  there's  more  to  go 
 the  reason  why  I've  achieved  this  not
[11:48] because  I've  done  anything  I  didn't  do 
 anything  my  younger  self-sacrificed  for 
 me  how  could  I  not  be  so  excited  how
[11:55] could  I  not  have  so  much  self-love  if  my 
 younger  self-sacrifice  and  delayed 
 gratification  for  me  but  on  the  other
[12:01] hand  how  could  you  not  feel  like  total 
 [ __ ]  how  could  you  not  be  depressed
[12:06] because  your  younger  self  took  from  you 
 he  sacrificed  you  for  his  pleasure  your
[12:11] younger  self  ate  that  junk  food  knowing 
 that  you  would  have  extra  body  fat  your 
 younger  self  masturbated  knowing  that
[12:17] you  would  feel  more  shame  your  younger 
 self  played  thousands  of  hours  of  video 
 games  knowing  that  you  would  have  less
[12:22] success  in  your  life  lower  grades  how 
 could  you  not  be  depressed  how  could  you 
 not  be  nihilistic  how  could  you  not  have
[12:28] this  sense  of  self-hatred  when  your 
 younger  self  took  from  you  will  your 
 future  self  the  man  that  you'll  become  a
[12:34] year  from  now  two  years  from  now  be 
 thinking  the  same  thing  about  you  think 
 about  this  think  of  about  your  2023  2024
[12:40] you  know  the  year  2024  two  years  from 
 now  think  about  that  version  of  yourself 
 is  he  thinking  about  you  and  thinking
[12:45] that  you're  an  [ __ ]  is  he  thinking 
 about  you  and  thinking  [ __ ]  you  stop  it 
 please  because  you  know  exactly  what  it
[12:51] is  that  you  need  to  do  and  if  you  don't 
 do  the  right  things  your  future  self  is 
 gonna  hate  you  your  future  self  is  going
[12:57] to  think  about  you  today  just  like  you 
 do  with  your  younger  self  and  you  wish 
 your  younger  self  just  studied  a  little 
 bit  harder  and  stopped  eating  that  junk
[13:02] food  and  stop  taking  those  drugs  if  your 
 future  self  is  going  to  think  the  same 
 thing  about  you  bro  time  to  change  time
[13:07] to  get  fed  up  time  to  get  like  annoyed 
 pissed  off  aggressive  angry  at  Living 
 this  way  you  should  have  fear  that  your
[13:13] future  self  is  gonna  feel  this  way  about 
 you  you  should  do  everything  you  can 
 whatever  pops  into  your  mind  any  ideas
[13:19] that  you  get  to  set  up  your  future  self 
 to  have  a  better  life  what  could  you  do 
 what  sacrifices  could  you  make  today
[13:25] that  your  future  self  is  gonna  look  back 
 at  you  and  think  thank  you  I  can't 
 believe  you  did  that  for  me  I  went
[13:30] through  a  lot  bro  I  struggled  a  lot  I 
 had  really  bad  mental  health  for  most  of
[13:35] my  life  especially  17  18  19  years  old  I 
 went  through  some  traumatic  [ __ ]  I  had 
 experienced  child  abuse  from  my  parents
[13:41] I  got  attacked  by  a  racist  who  tried  to 
 stab  me  I  went  through  some  like  bad 
 [ __ ]  bro  I  was  addicted  to  weed  people
[13:47] say  you  can't  be  addicted  to  weed  bro  I 
 was  I  was  eating  junk  food  Benji  and 
 everything  I  hated  my  life  and  I
[13:52] remember  this  moment  like  the  one  thing 
 I  was  doing  productive  was  just  going  to 
 the  gym  but  even  I  stopped  that  I 
 remember  this  moment  just  looking  at
[13:58] myself  in  the  mirror  and  just  thinking 
 like  what  the  [ __ ]  the  one  thing  I  had 
 going  for  me  was  my  physique  and  I've
[14:03] started  to  ruin  it  because  I'm  just 
 eating  junk  food  and  I  started  to  get 
 this  feeling  of  like  hatred  towards 
 myself  over  you  know  the  actions  that
[14:09] I'd  taken  over  the  last  three  six  nine 
 months  and  something  just  clicked  I  just 
 got  interested  in  this  concept  of
[14:14] thinking  wait  I  hate  my  younger  self 
 right  now  because  he  sacrificed  me  but 
 what  if  I  sacrifice  myself  for  my  future
[14:21] self  my  younger  self  sacrificed  me 
 because  he  wanted  to  eat  that  junk  food 
 what  if  I  eat  healthy  and  sacrifice
[14:27] pleasure  today  for  my  future  self  so 
 that  he  can  have  a  six-pack  and  that's 
 exactly  what  I  did  that's  exactly  what
[14:32] Sam  did  that's  exactly  what  you  would  go 
 on  to  do  you  have  inside  of  you  Warrior 
 blood  for  you  to  be  alive  today  bro  you
[14:38] your  ancestors  were  badass  that  means 
 that  you  have  the  genetic  capability  to 
 be  badass  to  achieve  success  to  work
[14:44] hard  to  dominate  your  future  self  is 
 just  waiting  for  you  today  to  tap  into 
 that  and  it's  not  going  to  be  easy
[14:49] you're  not  just  suddenly  going  to  get 
 consistent  in  going  to  the  gym  or 
 meditating  eating  clean  you  know  you're 
 just  not  just  suddenly  going  to  start
[14:54] doing  it  every  single  day  you  could  try 
 to  go  into  the  gym  right  now  maybe 
 you'll  go  for  two  days  and  then  you'll 
 take  like  three  days  off  you  could  try
[14:59] getting  on  nofap  right  now  maybe  you'll 
 do  it  for  two  days  and  you'll  say  like  a 
 week  off  that's  normal  but  if  you  stay
[15:04] on  this  path  and  you  keep  sacrificing 
 for  your  future  self  you're  gonna  get 
 closer  and  closer  to  that  ideal  place
[15:09] which  is  just  extreme  consistency  of  all 
 the  good  habits  you  want  your  future
[15:14] self  to  be  proud  of  you  so  just  ask 
 yourself  this  when  you  go  about  your  day 
 just  ask  yourself  what  can  I  do  that
[15:19] would  make  my  future  self  grateful  for 
 me  and  also  if  you've  got  the  gut  the 
 balls  to  do  this  also  go  about  your  day
[15:25] saying  if  I  do  this  thing  that  I  feel 
 like  doing  that  I  have  this  craving  for 
 like  video  games  porn  drugs  junk  food
[15:31] how  will  my  future  self  feel  about  me  if 
 he's  gonna  feel  shame  guilt  let  down  I'm 
 not  gonna  do  that  to  him  it's  time  for

UFAI8lAYh5I,"[00:00] Jeffrey  looks  back  at  his  pudgy  unshaven 
 feminine  face  in  his  greasy  mirror  is
[00:05] that  really  me  he's  barely  able  to 
 believe  how  he  looks  if  only  Jeffrey 
 followed  the  advice  in  this  video  he
[00:10] would  be  able  to  instantly  improve  his 
 attractiveness  but  instead  of  paying 
 attention  to  this  video  Jeffrey  goes
[00:16] straight  to  the  comments  and  he  looks  at 
 the  suggested  videos  Jeffrey  Focus  you 
 need  this  Adonis
[00:22] Adonis  looks  in  the  mirror  aside  Jeffrey 
 he  Grooms  his  masculine  face  with  a 
 chiseled  jawline  he  looks  like  a
[00:28] different  species  of  animal  next  to 
 Jeffrey  but  he  didn't  always  look  like 
 this  there  was  once  a  time  when  younger
[00:33] dies  wasn't  even  attractive  at  all  he 
 used  to  cope  and  say  that  he  didn't  care 
 about  how  he  looked  but  as  time  went  on
[00:38] and  Adonis  got  older  and  more  mature  he 
 realized  that  it  was  okay  to  take  pride 
 in  his  appearance  he  wanted  to  look
[00:45] professional  have  you  started  watching 
 these  kinds  of  videos  just  because  you 
 want  to  look  better  mainly  because  you
[00:50] just  want  to  track  girls  most  guys  won't 
 ever  have  the  confidence  to  admit  this  I 
 may  be  one  of  the  first  people  who  look 
 at  you  and  hold  their  hands  up  and  say
[00:56] yes  when  I  was  17  18  bro  I  was  horny  as 
 and  I  wasn't  getting  any  matches  on 
 Tinder  so  guess  what  I  did  I  went  on  my
[01:02] own  journey  to  improve  my  looks  because 
 it  became  apparent  to  me  that  how  you 
 look  is  greatly  going  to  determine  how
[01:07] many  girls  are  into  you  and  today  I'm 
 going  to  give  you  three  hacks  that  you 
 can  use  instantly  like  this  isn't  some 
 long-term  thing  like  oh  yeah
[01:13] these  are  things  that  you  could 
 literally  do  before  school  or  work  or 
 going  out  to  a  social  event  today  and
[01:19] I'm  gonna  make  a  promise  to  you  if  you 
 do  all  three  of  these  especially  the 
 last  one  you  will  go  up  at  least  one
[01:25] point  out  of  ten  that  means  that  if 
 you're  currently  a  5  out  of  10  you'll  go 
 to  a  six  out  of  ten  and  you  might  be
[01:30] thinking  well  you  know  that  okay  that's 
 kind  of  nice  that's  not  so  huge  is  it 
 but  you  must  understand  that  a  lot  of 
 guys  don't  actually  know  this  but  guys
[01:35] who  have  experienced  a  good  dating  life 
 know  this  getting  girls  is  always 
 exponential  based  on  your  improvements
[01:41] so  going  from  a  five  to  a  sexual  thing 
 like  oh  yeah  maybe  I'll  get  like  10  more 
 no  no every  point  that  you  go  up  from 
 one  to  ten  well  ten  times  the  amount  of
[01:48] attraction  that  you  get  from  girls  so  of 
 course  you  know  a  one  out  of  ten  guy 
 gets  no  attraction  from  girls  and  so 
 when  he  becomes  a  two  out  of  ten  ten
[01:53] times  zero  is  still  kind  of  zero  but 
 then  there  becomes  a  point  where  you 
 know  you're  somewhat  of  an  average  guy
[01:58] between  four  or  five  or  six  out  of  ten 
 and  I  know  the  rating  scale  is  kind  of 
 like  autistic  at  all  or  out  of  time  but
[02:03] like  it's  a  good  way  for  us  to 
 understand  what  we're  talking  about  if 
 you're  like  let's  say  an  average  guy 
 you're  a  five  out  of  ten  maybe  there's 
 one  girl  who  shows  you  like  a  pretty
[02:09] good  level  of  Interest  per  year  isn't 
 there  maybe  yeah  well  if  you  become  a 
 six  out  of  ten  suddenly  for  that  year
[02:14] that  you  are  a  six  there  will  be  10 
 girls  who  show  you  an  interest  the 
 world's  men  honestly  about  90  of  men
[02:20] would  be  happy  with  that  90  of  men  would 
 be  totally  happily  and  fulfilled  wait  10 
 girls  I'm  not  saying  you  know  the  10
[02:25] girls  date  you  will  marry  you  or  sleep 
 with  you  or  anything  but  at  least  they 
 actually  actively  like  texting  you  back 
 and  meeting  you  for  a  date  which  a  lot
[02:30] of  guys  would  be  happy  for  but  imagine 
 if  you  go  then  from  a  six  to  a  seven  and 
 the  ten  times  Rule  still  applies  you
[02:36] have  10  girls  who  are  showing  you 
 interest  really  replying  back  really 
 engaging  with  you  really  going  on  dates 
 with  you  when  you  were  six  it's  up  to  a
[02:42] hundred  when  you're  a  seven  it's  up  to  a 
 thousand  when  you're  in  it  it's  up  to  10 
 like  literally  I  know  this  seems  silly
[02:47] and  a  lot  of  guys  wouldn't  believe  this 
 because  a  lot  of  guys  overly  rate 
 themselves  you  might  be  thinking  yeah 
 but  I'm  already  a  seven  and  I  don't  get
[02:52] like  a  thousand  girls  into 
 you're  probably  not  seven  bro  I  used  to
[02:57] think  when  I  was  what  would  I  rate 
 myself  when  I  was  in  second  year  of  uni 
 so  this  was  like  my  [ __ ]  boy  days 
 probably  like  a  6.5  if  you  include  a  six
[03:04] pack  in  stuff  yeah  probably  about  6.5  I 
 think  most  people  maybe  would  agree  that 
 you  know  somewhere  around  the  six  to
[03:09] seven  range  when  I  look  like  that  right 
 I  was  six  foot  one  and  the  thing  is  the 
 amount  of  attraction  that  I  got  then 
 when  I  looked  like  that  there  was  a
[03:15] point  where  I  couldn't  even  believe  it 
 but  rewind  a  year  and  you  know  I  had 
 slightly  less  muscle  from  maybe  slightly
[03:20] higher  body  fat  maybe  you  know  like 
 worse  clothes  and  everything  so  my  first 
 year  of  uni  and  it  was  like  night  and
[03:25] day  and  then  rewind  another  year  and  it 
 was  just  such  a  total  difference  you 
 must  understand  that  this  is  all
[03:30] exponential  we're  gonna  go  over  the 
 three  ways  to  instantly  improve  your 
 looks  make  sure  you  don't  skip  around 
 you  will  probably  benefit  from  all  three
[03:36] the  first  way  is  to  improve  your  hair 
 and  yeah  it  sounds  kind  of  funny  coming 
 from  a  guy  who  doesn't  really  have  much 
 right  now  but  I've  just  trimmed  it  all
[03:41] off  there  was  a  time  when  I  was  honestly 
 all  the  way  through  High  School  15  16 
 17.  and  I  had  no  clue  at  all  how  some
[03:48] guys  had  really  attractive  like  good 
 looking  hair  and  why  mine  didn't  look  so 
 good  like  all  of  my  hair  in  like  high 
 school  it  was  just  like  not  styled  I
[03:54] didn't  understand  you  know  what  how  this 
 even  works  like  how  to  even  have 
 attractive  hair  no  one  you  don't  get  a
[03:59] class  in  it  in  school  maybe  you've  never 
 sat  down  to  like  you  know  type  how  to 
 have  attractive  hair  like  I  needed  a 
 beginner's  tutorial  so  I'm  gonna  give
[04:04] this  to  you  right  now  if  you  have  very 
 short  hair  like  mine  obviously  this 
 there's  obviously  not  much  you  can  do 
 right  now  I'm  growing  mine  a  little  bit
[04:09] longer  but  if  you've  got  a  bit  more  like 
 length  the  way  to  make  your  hair 
 attractive  if  there's  just  one  thing 
 well  this  too  right  just  in  case  it's
[04:15] your  bottom  20  percenter  make  sure  your 
 hair  is  like  clean  and  stuff  make  sure 
 it  doesn't  have  like  [ __ ]  doo-doo  in
[04:20] it  or  something  some  guys  need  to  hear 
 this  honestly  like  probably  not  you 
 because  you're  already  on 
 self-improvement  but  some  guys  are  gross 
 and  so  that's  the  first  key  is  just  okay
[04:25] have  a  shower  but  then  after  that  most 
 guys  probably  60  70  of  guys  could  get  an
[04:30] instant  booster  attractiveness  with  one 
 quick  tip  it  costs  like  maybe  five 
 dollars  and  it  lasts  literally  for
[04:35] months  go  to  a  store  and  buy  any  kind  of 
 hair  product  you  need  to  find  the  one 
 that  fits  for  you  but  what  a  hair
[04:40] product  does  whether  it's  called  like 
 gel  or  wax  or  like  Pomade  or  some  [ __ ] 
 you  know  you  just  go  to  like  the  men's
[04:45] hair  section  in  a  shop  you'll  be  able  to 
 find  it  right  when  you  do  what  it  does 
 you  put  it  onto  your  fingers  you  mix  it 
 around  and  then  it's  got  like  this  kind
[04:50] of  like  hearty  texture  that  when  you  put 
 it  into  your  hair  you  can  now  control 
 how  your  hair  stays  a  lot  of  guys  didn't
[04:56] know  this  and  I  personally  didn't  know 
 this  so  I  used  to  go  to  school  I'm  not 
 even  joking  right  I've  never  told  this 
 story  before  but  before  school  or
[05:01] college  you  know  I  look  at  myself  in  the 
 mirror  and  I  wanted  to  style  my  hair  and 
 I  didn't  realize  that  you  use  a  product 
 for  this  my  hair  like  normally  didn't
[05:06] look  so  good  so  what  I  would  do  is  I'd 
 wet  my  hands  with  water  style  my  hair 
 and  it  looked  kind  of  nice  and  then  go
[05:12] to  school  expecting  it  to  stay  like  that 
 you  know  I'd  be  in  class  and  stuff 
 whatever  then  I  go  to  the  toilet  and  be 
 like  my  hair  looks  like  [ __ ]  because
[05:18] it's  not  styled  I've  only  put  water  in 
 it  and  obviously  it  dries  out  like  but 
 every  time  I'd  go  to  the  toilet  wet  my 
 hands  and  that  would  probably  last
[05:24] literally  like  five  minutes  barely  and 
 then  it  just  goes  back  you  need  to  use 
 some  kind  of  product  the  one  that  I  use
[05:29] is  v05  Clay  something  like  that  it 
 doesn't  even  matter  which  one  I  use  if  I 
 was  you  and  you  might  be  annoyed  because
[05:34] this  is  gonna  cost  you  maybe  like  20  but 
 if  I  was  you  I  would  go  to  the  men's 
 hair  section  and  I  would  buy  like  four
[05:39] different  ones  it's  a  gel  there's  a  wax 
 there's  this  one  there's  this  one  four 
 completely  different  ones  go  home  try 
 one  on  see  how  it  feels  see  how  it  looks
[05:45] take  a  shower  clean  it  all  off  try 
 another  one  you  do  this  once  and  you 
 spend  20  and  you  spend  like  half  an  hour 
 just  to  seeing  which  one  you  literally
[05:50] know  which  products  you  use  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  like  I  did  this  once  five 
 years  ago  and  I  literally  all  is  buy  the
[05:55] same  one  no  matter  which  country  I'm  in 
 I'll  always  go  and  find  the  same  product 
 and  it  literally  works  amazingly  for  me
[06:00] so  I  never  have  like  this  decision 
 fatigue  of  thinking  like  which  one 
 should  I  go  which  one  should  I  below 
 this  one  this  is  this  gel  is  too  white
[06:06] you  know  I  never  have  that  anymore  by 
 styling  your  hair  trust  me  when  I  say 
 like  this  alone  could  probably  even  get
[06:11] you  one  point  out  of  ten  but  if  you're 
 like  younger  me  you  might  be  listening 
 to  this  right  now  in  cringing  I  think 
 like  wait  this  is  all  gay  why  would  I
[06:17] style  my  hair  that's  gay  I  used  to  think 
 that  right  I  used  to  think  I  know  it's 
 gay  it's  for  girls  and  stuff  why  would  I 
 do  that  I  then  realized  I  put  two  and
[06:22] twos  together  then  I  thought  okay  how  am 
 I  seeing  improving  my  hair  as  gay  as  a 
 bad  thing  when  that  would  improve  my
[06:27] attractiveness  and  that  would  get  me 
 more  girls  once  I  connected  the  dots  and 
 I  was like  oh  yeah  like  then  it  can't  be
[06:32] gay  it  can't  be  bad  because  I  want  to 
 get  [ __ ]  bro  I'm  horny  as  [ __ ]  bro  so 
 I  was like  okay  come  on  that  was  what 
 convinced  me  because  before  this  I  had
[06:38] kind  of  that  sort  of  you  know  masculine 
 locker  room  kind  of  thing  of  like  oh 
 yeah  that  you  know  why  would  you  style 
 your  hair  it  doesn't  make  any  sense  but
[06:43] this  is  how  I  was  able  to  convert  into 
 this  idea  and  since  then  it's  like  I 
 can't  imagine  not  putting  less  stuff
[06:48] into  my  obviously  again  my  hair's  really 
 short  right  now  but  I  can't  imagine  like 
 not  putting  stuff  into  my  hair  and  not 
 styling  it  it's  like  you  instantly  just
[06:54] look  better  you  look  way  room  if  you've 
 got  slightly  longer  hair  than  mine  if 
 you're  not  putting  something  in  it  in
[06:59] the  morning  I  promise  you  it's  not  going 
 to  look  good  most  guys  if  you  just  wake 
 up  and  maybe  if  you  just  take  a  shower 
 or  something  some  guys  don't  even  take  a
[07:04] shower  and  you  just  step  out  the  door 
 your  hair  isn't  as  attractive  as  it 
 could  be  and  you  don't  even  realize  just 
 how  much  this  actually  improves  your
[07:10] attractiveness  and  if  we  want  to  test 
 this  go  and  look  at  every  single 
 celebrity  every  male  influencer  every
[07:15] YouTuber  every  guy  who's  in  the  public 
 light  style  hair  every  single  one  of 
 them  even  the  guys  who  have  messy  hair
[07:20] have  meticulously  styled  it  like  that 
 you  will  never  see  a  guy  who's  in  the 
 public  light  who's  you  know  quite  famous
[07:26] or  something  who's  going  out  with  like 
 bed  hair  unless  the  only  times  you  do 
 see  that  sometimes  and  when  is  it  when 
 like  their  life  has  been  [ __ ]  and
[07:32] they've  got  a  DUI  for  like  running  over 
 a  family  or  some  [ __ ]  either  going  to 
 court  and  you  see  like  a  bad  picture  of 
 a  celebrity  and  [ __ ]  that's  what  your
[07:37] hair  looks  like bro  you  walk  into  school 
 or  into  work  looking  like  these 
 celebrities  like  mug  shot  after  like
[07:42] they  have  to  go  to  court  and  [ __ ]  man 
 and  in  terms  of  actually  getting  the 
 product  and  style  in  your  hair  I  watched 
 a  bunch  of  like  random  Youtube  tutorials
[07:48] and  none  of  them  even  helped  me  they 
 were  all  just  over  complicated  the 
 process  I  wanted  like  the  brain  dead 
 easy  way  so  this  is  literally  what  you
[07:54] do  right  you  go  to  the  shopping  other 
 thing  right  either  it's  gel  wax  it 
 doesn't  matter  buy  it  put  it  onto  this 
 mix  it  a  little  bit  like  this  and
[07:59] literally  just  style  your  hair  how  you 
 normally  would  like  want  to  make  it  look 
 good  usually  for  most  guys  if  you've  got
[08:05] like  short  to  medium  hair  you  literally 
 just  style  it  and  push  it  into  One 
 Direction  like  this  or  you  put  it  onto 
 your  things
[08:10] like  this  like  push  down  like  the  little 
 sides  a  bit  you  know  there's  a  bit 
 sticking  up  there  as  you  push  that  down
[08:15] when  you  have  this  stuff  in  your  hands 
 you  can  literally  like  decide  you  know 
 which  part  of  your  hair  is  where  so  it's 
 like  nice  and  boom  it's  looking  good  the
[08:20] second  way  to  instantly  improve  your 
 looks  is  with  what  you  wear  now  most 
 guys  aren't  On  My  Level  so  I  wear  a
[08:25] bathroom  everywhere  even  when  I'm  going 
 to  the  gym  even  when  I'm  in  business 
 meetings  and  so  obviously  you  can't 
 really  compete  with  this  level  of  attire
[08:31] but  if  you  did  want  to  wear  a  bathrobe 
 then  obviously  you  become  a  tense  true 
 you  know  my  fashion  sense  was  bad
[08:36] because  it  was  aligned  with  my  views  on 
 hair  which  was  like  wait  why  would  I  buy 
 new  clothes  that's  gay  and  it's
[08:41] expensive  so  I  used  to  think  these 
 things  when  I  was  15  16.  and  truthfully 
 I  was  deeply  insecure  because  I  would
[08:48] say  these  things  like  I  would  say  these 
 in  my  mind  or  you  know  I  would  just 
 never  go  shopping  I  had  these  beliefs 
 right  and  yet  in  my  mind  honestly  I'd  be
[08:54] admiring  like  the  attractive  guy  who 
 looked  good  who  had  good  hair  who  had 
 good  fashion  he  was  wearing  good  clean
[08:59] clothes  and  I'd  be  sat  there  with  like 
 the  creased  shirt  that  was  in  the  bottom 
 of  my  wardrobe  you're  like  the  pile  in
[09:04] your  [ __ ]  wardrobe  like  there's  a  few 
 things  hung  up  and  then  there's  just  the 
 pile  and  like  I  pick  out  a  shirt  there 
 that  usually  looks  good  it's  creased  but
[09:09] I  don't  even  realize  and  you're  just  not 
 presenting  your  best  self  to  the  world 
 do  you  think  the  men  you  look  up  to  are
[09:14] not  thinking  about  what  they  were  you 
 think  Tristan  Tate  or  Andrew  Tate  are 
 waking  up  going  to  the  Wardrobe  seeing  a
[09:19] big  pile  on  the  floor  and  rooting 
 through  it  for  like  a  little  shitty  like 
 crease  crunchy  shirt  obviously  not
[09:24] you've  got  to  care  about  how  you  dress 
 and  a  lot  of  guys  just  don't  because  we 
 just  don't  know  what  the  [ __ ]  to  do 
 honestly  because  no  one's  actually  told
[09:29] you  you  know  your  mum  bought  you  some 
 shitty  clothes  that  you  didn't  even  look 
 good  in  that  you're  like  hudgy  little 
 fat  titties  man  titties  and  like  your
[09:35] lower  belly  fat  was  sticking  out  of  your 
 skinny  arms  and  stuff  and  so  you've 
 never  been  able  to  really  like  what  to
[09:40] buy  so  this  is  what  you  do  hopefully 
 you've  already  been  going  to  the  gym  for 
 a  little  bit  and  you've  been  building 
 some  muscle  and  reducing  your  body  fat
[09:46] the  best  way  to  look  good  in  clothes  is 
 actually  to  look  good  naked  first  so 
 what  you  need  to  do  for  the  long  term
[09:51] right  I'm  just  going  to  briefly  say  is 
 build  an  aesthetic  body  you  need  to  do 
 the  kind  of  workouts  that  literally 
 build  your  body  to  look  good  I've  linked
[09:57] seven  free  workouts  in  the  description 
 of  this  video  next  you  need  to  go 
 shopping  for  clothes  that  look  good  and 
 I'm  just  going  to  tell  you  the  truth  I
[10:02] mostly  just  wear  gym  clothes  everywhere 
 you  want  to  find  your  style  so  some  guys 
 really  like  dressing  professionally  you
[10:07] see  like  the  Tates  and  you  know  these 
 professional  men  they  literally  seem  to 
 wear  a  suit  like  everyone  what  like 
 they're  in  the  gym  wearing  a  suit  and
[10:12] [ __ ]  there's  other  guys  who  wear  like 
 smart  casual  my  friend  Sam  wears  colored 
 shirts  with  like  smarter  jeans  and 
 everything  here's  the  thing  about
[10:17] improving  how  you  dress  you  don't  have 
 to  change  the  kind  of  things  that  you 
 wear  you  just  have  to  wear  the  better  of
[10:23] the  same  thing  so  for  example  if  you  are 
 someone  who  totally  relates  and  totally 
 desires  to  dress  smart  and  you  want  to
[10:28] wear  shirts  and  tucked  in  pants  and 
 stuff  then  find  a  way  to  get  closer  and 
 closer  to  your  ideal  like  fashion  sense
[10:33] to  take  a  picture  of  the  best  guy  that 
 you  see  so  you  go  Google  Tristan  Tate 
 suits  and  you  start  to  take  inspiration
[10:38] from  like  the  things  that  he's  got  there 
 and  the  best  thing  that  you  can  do  is 
 try  and  buy  the  exact  same  kind  of  set
[10:43] or  color  or  style  but  you  see  that's  if 
 you  actually  like  that  style  already 
 because  here's  the  issue  of  the  guy  like
[10:48] me  and  maybe  like  you  when  I  was  growing 
 up  and  I  really  wanted  to  improve  how  I 
 dress  and  I  would  search  online  all  of 
 these  guys  with  skinny  necks  who  don't
[10:54] even  go  to  the  gym  we're  giving  this 
 advice  of  like  oh  yeah  just  go  to  this 
 shop  and  just  buy  like  seven  pairs  of 
 chinos  and  buy  like  this  checkered  shirt
[10:59] and  tuck  it  in  and  stuff  and  what  was 
 happening  was  that  most  people  were 
 giving  advice  for  their  fashion  sense
[11:04] and  not  for  yours  so  by  taking  a  random 
 person's  advice  online  they'll  end  up 
 looking  and  feeling  weird  because  you're
[11:10] not  supposed  to  be  the  kind  of  guy  who 
 wears  those  kinds  of  clothing  so  for  me 
 personally  the  thing  is  I  might  look
[11:15] good  in  a  suit  but  I  don't  want  to  wear 
 one  I  might  look  good  wearing  smart 
 clothes  tucked  in  Chino
[11:21] I  might  look  good  like  that  but  guess 
 what  I  don't  want  to  wear  one  bro  I 
 don't  like  it  this  other  guys  would 
 really  like  that  they  should  do  that  but
[11:27] for  me  I  like  wearing  gym  clothes  so 
 first  of  all  step  one  of  improving  well 
 Step  Zero  is  first  go  to  the  gym  at
[11:32] least  don't  be  fat  try  and  reduce  your 
 body  fat  that's  like  the  long-standing 
 step  one  is  to  choose  and  to  figure  out
[11:37] what  kind  of  clothes  you  actually  like 
 because  if  you  like  and  feel  good 
 wearing  the  smart  kind  of  clothes  then
[11:42] maybe  you  want  to  do  that  if  you  like 
 and  feeling  good  wearing  more  of  the 
 comfy  casual  clothes  you  still  want  to 
 do  that  that's  still  step  one  right  but
[11:47] then  step  two  is  once  you've  defined 
 which  kind  of  clothing  you  like  we  need 
 to  find  the  best  kind  of  clothing  in
[11:52] that  category  because  for  my  life  I've 
 always  wanted  like  a  comfy  or  casual 
 clothes  and  yeah  I  was  always  wearing
[11:57] like  the  [ __ ]  version  of  these  I  was 
 always  wearing  like  these  [ __ ]  random 
 brands  that  you  buy  for  like  five  pounds 
 and  as  there  it  just  doesn't  look  good
[12:02] or  anything  it's  not  like  tapered  down 
 correctly  I  was  buying  like  these 
 weirdly  like  thin  no  style  whatsoever
[12:08] like  jogger  pants  which  just  left  like  a 
 [ __ ]  ugly  ass  dick  print  and  moving 
 everything  so  then  what  I  did  to  improve
[12:14] my  fashion  sets  I  knew  okay  I  like 
 wearing  gym  clothes  you  go  to  the  best 
 gym  clothing  store  that  there  are  around
[12:19] or  you  know  if  you  really  like  wearing 
 small  clothes  and  you  go  to  those 
 clothes  and  you  go  try  on  a  bunch  of 
 things  and  the  best  advice  I  can  give
[12:24] you  that  really  improve  my  look  is  that 
 you  want  to  find  sets  that  go  together 
 assets  means  like  pants  and  shirt  right
[12:30] it's  always  better  to  wear  the  same  ones 
 so  you  get  a  set  which  is  like  black 
 night  shorts  and  black  night  shirt  it's 
 together  you  buy  that  and  you  look  so
[12:36] much  better  than  buying  like  a  random 
 one  and  a  random  one  and  a  random  one 
 and  a  random  one  so  this  is  exactly  what
[12:41] I  would  do  if  I  was  starting  again  and 
 I'm  actually  going  to  do  this  soon  save 
 up  a  little  bit  of  budget  right 
 obviously  it's  dependent  for  me  the 
 budget  might  be  a  few  hundred  pounds  for
[12:47] you  it  might  be  25  pounds  right  go  to 
 the  store  that  you  can  afford  that  has 
 the  kind  of  style  of  clothes  that  you 
 like  try  on  a  bunch  of  things  and  the
[12:53] best  thing  you  can  do  pick  out  the 
 pre-made  set  of  the  outfit  and  buy  like 
 five  of  them  seven  of  them  not  the  same
[12:58] one  if  you  want  but  like  so  for  example 
 I  buy  this  you  know  Black  Knights  shorts 
 sure  then  I  buy  another  one  this  is  like
[13:03] a  gray  under  armor  hoodie  and  pants  for 
 example  and  you  buy  them  and  then  when 
 I'm  going  to  the  gym  or  I'm  doing 
 anything  else  I'd  always  just  wear  the
[13:09] same  set  over  and  over  again  and  you 
 look  so  much  better  and  the  same  with 
 for  example  a  suit  or  some  smart
[13:14] clothing  you  could  do  some  mix  and 
 matching  if  you  want  but  the  best  look 
 really  comes  is  when  you  get  the  suit 
 together  you  get  the  pants  that  goes
[13:19] with  the  Blazer  that  goes  with  the  shirt 
 and  then  you  you  wear  that  look  whenever 
 it's  applicable  for  the  environment  that
[13:24] you  go  in  it  because  for  the  longest 
 time  in  my  own  personal  like  fashion 
 journey  I  literally  just  got  the  clothes
[13:29] like  you  know  my  Mumbo  I  bought  some 
 random  clothes  here  some  random  t-shirt 
 here  some  random  pants  here  and  I  wore
[13:34] individual  clothing  that  I  thought  was 
 nice  so  for  example  I  wore  the  same 
 jeans  that  I  always  wear  then  I  wore  a
[13:39] shirt  that  I  liked  and  then  the  next  day 
 I  wore  some  shorts  that  I  like  and  then 
 I  wore  a  shirt  with  it  which  I  liked  and 
 it  was  always  mixed  and  matched  and  it
[13:45] always  just  didn't  really  look  like  it 
 went  together  up  until  I  discovered  this 
 concept  of  like  buying  a  set  and  wearing
[13:50] that  and  it's  like  since  then  since  my 
 like  college  Years  and  University  years 
 since  I've  started  doing  this  and  I  just
[13:56] wear  like  the  same  kind  of  like  double 
 clothing  you  know  pant  shirt  that's  been 
 made  to  go  together  I  think  I  look  a  lot
[14:01] better  so  you  can  Implement  that  bro 
 pause  the  check  this  is  you  right  now 
 bro 
 posture  check  and  that  is  actually  the
[14:07] third  way  to  instantly  improve  your 
 looks  fix  your  posture  this  I  can  just 
 go  over  very  very  quickly  because  so
[14:12] many  guys  have  made  videos  on  this  I've 
 made  a  bunch  of  videos  my  body  language 
 and  posture  if  you  have  the  posture  of  a
[14:17] beta  male  of  a  weak  man  of  a  slouched 
 man  people  are  gonna  treat  you  like  that 
 to  instantly  improve  your  attractiveness
[14:22] literally  just  straighten  it  up  and  this 
 is  the  rule  that  I  followed  for  so  long 
 that  I'm  just  going  to  leave  you  with
[14:27] your  posture  and  your  body  language 
 should  be  so  straight  and  confident  that 
 you  actually  get  some  like  negative
[14:32] thoughts  about  it  thinking  that  you're 
 doing  too  much  that  shows  that  you've 
 actually  improved  it  enough  because  our
[14:37] postures  you  know  our  modern  posture 
 even  if  you're  not  someone  who's  got 
 like  extreme  like  forwardness  or 
 anything  oh  modern  posture  is  so  [ __ ]
[14:42] that  once  you  have  good  posture  it 
 actually  feels  a  little  bit  normal  but 
 that  is  actually  a  good  level  to  be  on
[14:48] even  if  you  might  think  oh  that  [ __ ] 
 from  school  or  from  your  workplace  who 
 bullies  you  who's  not  even  a  friend  who 
 you  know  he  might  make  fun  of  you  like
[14:53] your  sit-ups  right  it's  like  who  gives  a 
 [ __ ]  he's  gonna  make  fun  of  you  anyway 
 right  so  at  that  point  it's  like  just  by 
 sitting  up  straight  and  by  you  know
[14:59] walking  straight  with  your  chest  out  and 
 you  walk  in  with  your  chest  first  with 
 your  chin  a  little  bit  higher  your 
 shoulders  back  you  want  it  to  feel  a
[15:04] little  bit  a  little  bit  force  a  little 
 bit  too  far  and  that  is  the  correct
[15:09] level  to  hold  click  and  watch  this  video 
 right  now  do  the  hard  work  especially 
 when  you  don't  feel  like  it  mwah

qCQ5aGkvSIY,"[00:00] for  the  first  time  in  a  month  Jeffrey 
 has  finally  left  his  dark  disgusting 
 damp  room  he's  been  motivated  by
[00:06] watching  Andrew  take  shorts  and  now  he's 
 gonna  finally  go  on  a  run  yay  Jeffrey 
 let's  do  it  he  leaves  this  house  and
[00:12] starts  waddling  away  this  is  the  most 
 exercise  that  young  Jeffrey  has  had  in  a 
 very  long  time  we're  so  proud  of  you
[00:17] Jeff  why  have  you  stopped  did  you  say 
 you  were  gonna  go  on  a  run  what's  he 
 doing  he  looks  like  he's  contemplating
[00:22] like  he's  thinking  don't  turn  around 
 Jeffrey  you're  literally  just  a  minute 
 away  I  guess  a  minute's  still  progress
[00:27] and  you  know  if  you  run  a  minute  back 
 home  then  that's  two  minutes  today  maybe 
 you  can  increase  bro  no  no  Jeffrey  what
[00:33] the  Jeffrey  went  out  for  a  run  he  ran 
 for  less  than  a  minute  we  thought  he  was 
 gonna  run  back  home  so  at  least  it  was
[00:38] gonna  be  something  but  he  just  hopped  on 
 an  electric  scooter  instead  Jeffrey 
 Adonis
[00:44] Adonis  is  climbing  Mount  Everest  and 
 he's  determined  to  reach  the  top  as  the 
 Earth  ends  and  he  struggles  to  catch  his
[00:50] breath  Adonis  pushes  on  his  muscles 
 begin  to  ache  and  his  body  screams  for 
 him  to  quit  but  Adonis  is  mentally  tough
[00:56] and  he  refuses  to  give  up  I  must  reach 
 the  top  Adonis  pushes  himself  harder
[01:01] than  he  has  ever  done  before  and 
 eventually 
 he  reaches  the  summit  he  sits  down  on  a
[01:06] rock  to  rest  and  take  in  his 
 surroundings  and  meditate  even  with  this 
 lack  of  oxygen  it  seems  like  the  whole
[01:12] world  is  laid  before  him  he  is  filled 
 with  gratitude  for  the  beauty  of  Nature
[01:17] and  the  mental  toughness  he  possesses 
 that  allowed  him  to  complete  his  journey 
 you  know  I've  seen  some  comments  of  guys
[01:23] who  don't  really  watch  our  videos  maybe 
 they've  just  clicked  on  a  random  one  and 
 I've  seen  them  genuinely  disbelieve  some
[01:29] of  the  stories  I  told  you  about  my 
 younger  days  where  you  know  like  I  play 
 a  lot  of  video  games  and  I  was  addicted
[01:34] to  porn  and  everything  I  was  addicted  to 
 weed  and  junk  food  and  stuff  and  I 
 always  saw  these  comments  and  they're 
 always  right  something  like  oh  yeah
[01:39] right  I  doubt  his  life  was  that  bad  and 
 everything  and  I  just  thought  bro  like 
 you  must  have  had  a  pretty  good  life 
 because  the  guys  who  can  relate  to  my
[01:44] life  know  that  the  stories  that  I've 
 told  you  they  could  not  be  faked  the 
 amount  of  detail  that  I've  went  in  to
[01:49] tell  you  the  real  experiences  I've  had 
 of  the  days  that  you  know  I'd  wake  up 
 and  jack  off  three  times  to  the  point
[01:54] that  my  PV  wasn't  even  hard  anymore  for 
 the  final  nut  or  the  times  that  I'd  be 
 smoking  weed  as  soon  as  I'd  wake  up
[01:59] through  the  day  at  night  time  and  I  was 
 just  high  all  the  time  and  I  was  eating 
 just  horrible  junk  food  people  who  have
[02:05] been  in  those  situations  I've  heard  so 
 many  times  from  the  guys  who  are 
 actually  a  part  of  our  culture  like  well
[02:10] I've  never  actually  heard  someone  like 
 describe  in  that  much  detail  like  that's 
 exactly  what  I  was  going  through  so  when
[02:15] I  tell  you  what  I  was  like  a  good  few 
 years  ago  you  must  believe  that  I  was  a
[02:20] total  I  was  a  coward  I  was  weak  and  I'm 
 certainly  not  Adonis  right  now  not  even 
 close  but  I  think  I've  made  some  pretty
[02:25] good  progress  I  went  from  being  that 
 stereotypical  skinny  neck  video  gamer
[02:30] who  just  ate  horrible  food  who 
 eventually  through  puberty  developed 
 breasts  like  gynecomastia  like  man  boobs
[02:36] because  my  testosterone  was  so  low  my 
 estrogen  would  have  been  so  high  because 
 I  was  genuinely  like  even  hormonally  to
[02:42] the  greatest  period  of  discipline  that  I 
 had  when  I  was  in  monk  mode  in  2020 
 because  you  know  I  had  been  stacking  up
[02:47] the  dopamine  the  instant  gratification 
 for  years  and  years  and  years  I  was 
 taking  drugs  smoking  weed  partying
[02:53] hooking  up  with  girls  I  know  those  some 
 of  those  things  can  be  a  lot  of  fun  but 
 certainly  when  you  overdo  pleasurable
[02:58] things  to  the  point  that  they  even 
 stopped  becoming  pleasurable  and  they 
 become  more  like  crutches  like  things
[03:03] you  need  and  so  that  have  been  doing 
 once  it  becomes  very  problematic  and  so 
 you  know  stacking  all  these  up  for  years
[03:08] at  a  time  just  more  pleasure  more 
 pleasure  more  pleasure  more  pleasure 
 leads  to  pain  and  then  I  had  the
[03:14] greatest  bouts  of  depression  anxiety 
 feeling  horrible  nihilistic  slightly 
 suicidal  I  was  weak  and  quite  frankly  no
[03:21] one  has  ever  said  this  to  you  before  I 
 was  weak  and  I  deserved  to  feel  trash  I
[03:27] was  weak  and  I  deserved  to  feel 
 depressed  I  was  weak  and  I  deserved  to
[03:32] feel  suicidal  no  one  has  ever  spoke  like 
 this  before  because  it's  so  anti-pc  it's
[03:38] so  offensive  but  I  was  doing  the  actions 
 that  would  lead  to  depression  I  was 
 doing  the  actions  that  would  lead  to
[03:44] feeling  horrible  and  so  I  deserve  the 
 consequences  of  my  actions  you  know  I
[03:49] said  this  once  on  the  community  posts  of 
 this  channel  I  said  if  there's  someone 
 out  there  who  doesn't  contribute  to
[03:54] their  tribe  who  just  wastes  away  and 
 just  indulges  in  stimulation  they 
 deserve  to  feel  depressed  and  the  amount
[03:59] of  guys  who  like  we're  trying  to  be  like 
 cool  and  soft  like  no  one  deserves  to 
 feel  depressed  Hamza  that's  really
[04:04] offensive  of  yeah  yeah  you  do  I  did  100 
 I  did  when  you  do  the  actions  that  would
[04:10] lead  a  person  to  feel  nihilistic  gray 
 dull  anxious  scared  weak  well  then  you
[04:16] deserve  the  consequences  of  your  actions 
 We  Are  Men  we  are  not  boys  we  are  men 
 that  means  that  whatever  we  do  we  take
[04:21] full  responsibility  for  if  you  feel  a 
 certain  way  it's  because  you  deserve  to 
 feel  that  way  because  you  did  the
[04:26] actions  to  feel  that  way  if  you've  got 
 Paul  grades  in  school  okay  you  deserve 
 it  if  you  feel  really  bad  dare  I  even
[04:32] say  if  you  feel  suicidal  you  deserve  it 
 because  you  have  done  the  actions  to  get 
 you  there  now  this  hurts  there's  a  lot
[04:37] of  guys  thinking  that  I'm  absolutely 
 crazy  right  now  but  you  know  what  any 
 guy  who's  actually  not  so  entirely  weak
[04:43] that  he  can  just  listen  to  this  message 
 there's  a  lot  of  guys  watching  this  my 
 boys  who  know  that  this  kind  of  message
[04:48] is  what's  needed  right  now  this  is 
 actually  in  a  weird  way  the  message  that 
 will  save  more  lives  because  telling
[04:54] people  like  oh  it's  okay  you  feel 
 depressed  oh  I'm  so  sorry  there's  the 
 suicide  hotline  number  that  doesn't  work
[05:01] because  if  it  did  and  everyone  speaks 
 like  that  we  wouldn't  keep  seeing  the 
 right  of  more  people's  poor  mental
[05:06] health  would  we  we  need  a  little  bit  of 
 tough  love  we  need  a  little  bit  of 
 accountability  of  ownership  of 
 responsibility  for  young  men  why  does  a
[05:13] young  man  feel  so  bad  these  days  because 
 he  is  weak  and  he  must  become  tougher
[05:18] because  for  a  very  long  time  after  I 
 indulged  in  all  that  pleasure  and  I 
 chose  to  have  depression  and  Suicidal
[05:24] Thoughts  because  it  was  a  choice  if 
 you're  doing  the  actions  that  leads  to 
 that  then  it  is  a  choice  of  choosing  to 
 feel  depressed  you're  choosing  to  feel
[05:29] suicide  I  was  choosing  to  feel  those 
 things  I  didn't  want  to  feel  those 
 things  you  know  they  were  really  scary 
 it's  a  bad  feeling  but  I  was  doing  the
[05:34] actions  that  would  lead  to  that  I  felt 
 depressed  I  hated  my  life  I  hated  being 
 broke  and  I'd  keep  smoking  weed  and  so  I
[05:40] chose  to  be  like  that  I  chose  to  feel 
 mentally  dull  I  chose  to  not  speak  to  my 
 family  for  an  entire  year  so  I  deserve
[05:46] to  feel  like  that  I  deserve  to  being 
 close  to  end  it  all  because  I  did  those
[05:51] actions  this  sounds  absolutely  crazy  to 
 some  people  but  if  you  can  grasp  this 
 knowledge  you  will  literally  be  equipped
[05:56] with  the  mindset  that  will  actually  save 
 you  from  these  dark  things  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  you  want  to  know  how  to
[06:01] become  mentally  tougher  you  want  to  know 
 how  to  stop  being  weak  and  I'm  not 
 talking  about  you  know  physically  oh  I 
 just  want  to  get  bench  pressed  to  100
[06:07] kilograms  that  stuff's  nice  that's 
 really  nice  but  your  mental  strength  is 
 a  hundred  times  more  valuable  than  your
[06:12] physical  strength  you  want  to  know  how 
 to  get  that  you  take  full  accountability 
 it  becomes  common  sense  when  we  talk
[06:17] about  it  like  this  you  know  if  an  action 
 something  you're  about  to  do  is  Gonna 
 Make  You  weaker  you  know  if  this  thing
[06:23] that  you're  about  to  do  is  gonna  make 
 you  feel  bad  24  hours  from  now  you  know 
 this  you're  not  stupid  you  know  if  you
[06:28] eat  that  junk  food  right  now  that's 
 sugar  you're  gonna  feel  pretty  nice  and 
 oh  yeah  yeah  oh  pleasure  oh  there's  a
[06:34] bit  of  a  taste  on  my  lips  yes  you  know 
 that  you're  gonna  feel  like  that  for  20 
 seconds  and  then  you've  ate  all  of  it
[06:39] you've  ate  all  the  sugar  and  you  also 
 knew  that  you  were  going  to  feel  worse 
 for  hours  afterwards  now  this  small  one
[06:45] little  thing  that  you've  had  isn't  that 
 bad  but  in  the  grand  scale  of  things 
 this  is  how  people  get  fat  this  is  how
[06:50] people  get  extremely  overweight  this  is 
 how  you've  become  too  high  body  fat  to 
 even  appreciate  the  beauty  that  should
[06:56] have  been  your  physique  you  understand 
 that  by  wasting  time  today  on  your  phone 
 or  your  computer  it's  gonna  feel  kind  of
[07:01] pleasurable  oh  yeah  let's  just  go  scroll 
 on  tiktok  or  let's  go  some  pointless 
 YouTube  videos  you  knew  that  I  would
[07:07] feel  kind  of  nice  but  you  also  knew  that 
 you  would  feel  worse  tomorrow  when 
 you're  a  little  bit  behind  on  the  work 
 that  you  said  you  were  gonna  do  again
[07:13] you  are  not  stupid  you  are  not  unaware 
 you  are  not  ignorance  men  these  days 
 need  to  be  slapped  in  the  face  and
[07:18] reminded  is  one  very  important  quote  you 
 deserve  the  consequences  of  your  actions
[07:23] if  you  are  committing  to  the  actions 
 that  would  make  you  feel  bad  good  I  want 
 you  to  feel  bad  if  you  are  doing  the
[07:29] actions  that  will  make  you  feel 
 depressed  and  suicidal  good  I  want  you
[07:34] to  feel  depressed  and  suicidal  because 
 that's  what  you  deserve  likewise  if  you 
 are  doing  the  actions  that  will  make  you
[07:40] feel  good  that's  what  you  deserve  if  you 
 are  doing  the  actions  that  will  make  you 
 feel  connected  in  your  tribe  with  the
[07:45] people  around  you  with  your  family  your 
 friends  thank  good  that's  what  you're 
 gonna  get  this  video  is  going  to  trigger
[07:50] a  lot  of  soft  people  and  they  got  to 
 keep  going  through  their  lives  one 
 antidepressant  pill  at  a  time  wondering
[07:56] why  their  PB  doesn't  even  work  anymore 
 why  they  don't  have  that  same  gust  that 
 they  used  to  when  they  were  a  little  boy
[08:01] the  male  feminists  are  going  to  be 
 watching  this  with  skinny  necks  thinking 
 yeah  this  guy  is  misogynist  like  we've
[08:06] not  even  talked  about  women  in  this 
 video  and  they'll  still  be  watching 
 everything  and  yeah  he's  a  misogynist  a 
 lot  of  people  will  be  watching  the  soft 
 people  and  they  won't  understand  this
[08:12] message  but  you  may  there  is  a  key  to 
 becoming  mentally  tougher  and  is  to 
 literally  just  know  that  you  have  to 
 take  full  responsibility  for  the  things
[08:18] that  you  do  in  life  and  whatever 
 decisions  you  make  know  that  you  deserve 
 the  consequences  of  those  actions  this
[08:24] is  why  once  a  guy  actually  has  a  good 
 head  on  his  shoulders  and  he  actually 
 gets  onto  self-improvement  and  he
[08:29] follows  the  words  of  Adonis  that  he 
 looks  around  as  you  may  have  done  and 
 you  see  your  friends  and  they're
[08:34] voluntarily  choosing  to  do  the  actions 
 that  make  them  feel  bad  and  they  just 
 won't  stop  and  they  kind  of  think  that
[08:40] you're  the  crazy  one  if  you  look  around 
 and  see  this  in  the  world  do  you  not 
 think  it's  weird  that  literally  everyone
[08:45] is  doing  a  thing  that  they're  getting  to 
 point  a  and  they're  like  what  huh  but
[08:50] why  am  I  at  Point  a  but  I  want  to  be  at 
 point  B  I  know  ah  yes  I'll  keep  doing
[08:56] the  actions  that  will  keep  getting  me 
 further  and  further  and  further  in  point 
 a  let's  see  if  that  gets  me  to  point  B
[09:01] that's  literally  what  people  are  doing 
 people  are  like  going  on  to  Google  Maps 
 saying  they  want  to  go  to  a  city 
 Manchester  but  then  moving  the  location
[09:08] over  all  the  way  okay  uh  Edinburgh  yeah 
 I  want  to  go  to  Manchester  so  Edinburgh
[09:13] okay  let's  go  they're  driving  for  hours 
 and  hours  wait  I'm  getting  further  away 
 from  Manchester  what's  happening  but 
 it's  okay  driving  and  driving  and
[09:19] driving  wait  why  why  am  I  here  huh  well 
 I  mean  I'm  already  in  Scotland  so  let's
[09:24] just  keep  going  north  does  this  blow 
 anyone  else's  mind  bro  because  for  me 
 personally  when  I  see  young  men  and  even
[09:29] women  of  today  literally  just  quite 
 frankly  like  this  is  stupidity  is  it  not 
 I  see  the  stupidity  in  most  people
[09:35] wondering  why  their  lives  are  so  bad 
 wondering  why  they're  broke  but  they 
 keep  doing  the  actions  that  cause  them
[09:40] to  be  broke  in  the  first  place  and  they 
 won't  change  anything  honey  you've  been 
 trying  to  like  quit  buying  Starbucks 
 coffees  for  months  for  years  and  you're
[09:47] still  broke  it  didn't  change  anything 
 the  guy  who's  been  trying  to  quit  weed 
 for  ages  and  keeps  going  back  because  he 
 keeps  trying  in  the  exact  same  way  all
[09:53] the  men  around  the  world  who  feel  so 
 glum  and  so  negative  and  life  so  hard 
 and  I'm  so  lonely  and  they  keep  doing
[09:59] the  actions  that  have  led  them  here 
 instead  of  drastically  changing  their 
 lives  when  you  look  at  it  this  way  don't
[10:04] you  see  the  foolishness  of  the  world 
 don't  you  see  the  weak  people  because 
 mental  strength  mental  toughness  it's
[10:09] just  about  choosing  to  do  the  thing  that 
 will  actually  get  you  to  where  you 
 really  want  to  go  even  if  that  thing
[10:15] feels  a  little  bit  uncomfortable  and 
 painful  today  you  want  that  body  don't 
 you  you  want  to  look  into  the  mirror  and 
 see  your  physique  and  actually  feel
[10:21] proud  and  confident  for  how  you  look  you 
 want  your  shirts  to  fit  against  your 
 arms  you  want  your  shirt  to  be  a  little
[10:26] bit  loose  against  your  stomach  so  why 
 not  just  go  and  do  the  actions  that  will 
 cause  that  well  the  reason  why  most
[10:31] people  don't  is  because  you  can't  click 
 your  fingers  and  make  it  happen  it's 
 because  you  have  to  experience  some  kind 
 of  pain  and  discomfort  first  and  so  many
[10:37] people  are  so  avoidant  of  pain  and 
 discomfort  without  realizing  the  pain 
 and  discomfort  leads  to  happiness  and  so
[10:42] the  modern  Neanderthal  that  you  see 
 around  you  today  which  is  probably  80  of 
 people  are  like  literally  modernly
[10:48] undefaulted  just  brain  dead  they'll 
 choose  to  sacrifice  their  dreams  they'll 
 choose  to  sacrifice  their  health  their
[10:54] family  their  relationships  their  work 
 their  livelihood  for  a  bit  of  pleasure 
 today  they  want  that  body  but  they  won't
[11:00] go  to  the  gym  today  they'll  just  keep 
 scrolling  on  Tick  Tock  they  want  that 
 money  that  wealth  won't  go  and  do
[11:05] something  that  actually  has  the 
 possibility  to  get  them  that  much  money 
 and  instead  they'll  just  keep  trudging 
 along  in  the  education  system  like  oh
[11:11] yeah  maybe  I'll  make  25k  a  year  it  takes 
 a  mentally  strong  person  to  be  able  to 
 delay  gratification  to  see  what  you  want
[11:18] months  from  now  years  from  now  see  the 
 choices  that  will  get  you  there  and 
 commit  to  those  choices  even  though
[11:23] those  choices  are  harder  and  more 
 uncomfortable  than  something  else  you 
 could  do  today  that's  it  that's
[11:28] literally  as  simple  as  it  gets  you  want 
 to  know  a  bulletproof  way  to  build  the 
 body  of  your  dreams  sacrifice  sacrifice
[11:33] today  for  tomorrow  how  about  for  your 
 parents  who  are  in  debt  you  want  to  know 
 a  bulletproof  way  for  them  to  get  rid  of
[11:39] their  debts  sacrifice  today  for  tomorrow 
 how  about  your  studies  a  bulletproof  way 
 to  improve  your  grades  sacrifice  the  day
[11:45] for  tomorrow  why  are  you  trying  to  cash 
 out  today  why  are  you  trying  to  feel  so 
 much  pleasure  today  oh  but  I  you  know
[11:50] it's  7  PM  one  hour  isn't  that  bad  your 
 competition's  not  doing  that  one  hour 
 Bro  you've  got  a  lot  to  think  about  if
[11:56] this  videos  annoyed  you  the  issue  is 
 with  videos  like  this  the  guys  who  truly 
 need  to  hear  this  message  got  offended
[12:01] and  clicked  off  in  the  first  few  minutes 
 in  a  day  so  chances  are  if  you've 
 watched  all  of  this  as  much  as  this 
 maybe  has  triggered  you  a  little  bit  you
[12:08] probably  deeply  agree  with  the  message 
 because  you  just  know  that  it's  the 
 truth  and  you  know  that  you  slipped  up  a 
 little  bit  there's  areas  in  your  life
[12:13] right  now  that  you  haven't  been 
 sacrificing  for  there's  areas  in  your 
 life  that  you  have  been  weak  instead  of 
 tough  and  being  able  to  admit  that  it's
[12:19] kind  of  like  a  superpower  in  this  modern 
 day  because  so  many  people  don't  have 
 the  strength  the  humility  the 
 accountabilities  you  just  hold  their
[12:24] hands  up  and  say  you  know  what  I've 
 slacked  I  will  tell  you  and  I  won't  just 
 tell  you  I'll  tell  all  100
[12:30] 000  guys  who  are  watching  this  video 
 yeah  bro  last  few  months  I  slacked  on  my 
 physique  I  slacked  on  my  diet  I  slacked
[12:36] on  my  training  I  said  that  work  was  the 
 priority  in  that  you  know  I  was  only 
 going  to  train  once  or  twice  a  week  and 
 then  I  got  kind  of  fat  last  like  one
[12:41] maybe  two  to  three  weeks  I've  really 
 been  bringing  it  back  I'm  getting  back 
 into  it  but  bro  I  really  fell  off  my 
 physique  I  really  fell  off  my  training
[12:47] for  a  good  amount  of  time  a  couple  of 
 months  and  I  felt  horrible  I  slacked  I 
 stopped  putting  the  work  and  I  stopped 
 sacrificing  for  my  physique  and  guess
[12:53] what  I  felt  bad  and  I  deserved  to  feel 
 bad  do  you  understand  me  saying  that  I 
 deserved  to  feel  bad  I  deserved  to  feel
[13:00] bad  because  I  did  the  actions  that  would 
 lead  to  that  so  I  deserved  it  building 
 my  physique  training  in  the  gym  makes  me
[13:06] feel  good  I  stopped  doing  it  I  started 
 to  feel  bad  good  that's  exactly  what  I 
 deserved  if  you  can  talk  to  yourself
[13:11] like  this  bro  you  will  be  miles  above 
 everyone  else  who's  just  holding  like 
 covering  their  eyes  up  a  little  bit  and
[13:16] they  don't  want  to  be  accountable  they 
 just  want  to  stay  in  their  safe  space 
 and  get  the  participation  trophy  it'll
[13:21] be  wise  for  you  to  have  a  little  pep 
 talk  with  yourself  after  this  if  you're 
 a  Jeffrey  you'll  click  onto  the  next 
 video  even  if  it's  one  of  mine  and  you
[13:26] know  that  gets  me  more  YouTube  AdSense 
 and  you've  watched  more  of  my  videos 
 fantastic  but  you  would  be  wise  to  pause 
 this  video  and  to  just  sit  there  and
[13:32] utter  silence  for  the  first  time  in  a 
 while  just  sit  there  and  just  like  stare 
 at your  wall  for  a  bit  don't  look  at
[13:37] your  phone  don't  look  at  your  computer 
 oh  let  me  write  on  my  notion  document  no 
 no  just  sit  there  for  a  few  minutes  and
[13:42] just  stare  at  a  wall  and  have  a  mental 
 pep  talk  with  yourself  pick  out  those 
 times  that  you  slept  and  you  know  where
[13:47] they  are  and  don't  be  easy  on  yourself 
 don't  be  soft  on  yourself  one  of  the 
 greatest  things  that  you  can  do  as  a
[13:53] young  man  is  to  be  hard  on  yourself  I 
 want  you  right  now  to  pause  the  video 
 look  at  your  wall  and  literally  pick
[13:58] apart  those  small  things  that  you  did 
 that  were  not  of  your  total  potential  I 
 will  do  it  live  I  will  do  it  out  loud
[14:05] I  ate  this  dessert  just  over  a  week  ago 
 some  like  baklava  some  like  Turkish 
 thing  and  it  was  full  of  sugar  honestly
[14:11] I  didn't  even  enjoy  it  that  much  I  just 
 kept  on  eating  it  I  knew  it  was  bad  for 
 me  but  I  went  with  this  cup  of  like  oh 
 well  you  know  it's  only  once  in  a  while
[14:17] there's  no  problem  but  I  didn't  even  get 
 that  much  pleasure  from  it  all  I  did  was 
 just  gain  more  fat  and  then  felt  bad 
 after  that  when  I  mentioned  before  a
[14:22] couple  of  weeks  that  still  annoys  me  for 
 a  solid  two  months  I  slacked  on  my 
 training  and  my  fitness  and  my  diets
[14:28] just  a  couple  of  months  ago  bro  I  was 
 ordering  like  junk  food  very  often  a 
 couple  times  a  week  I  was  eating  burgers
[14:33] and  stuff  and  I  know  that  that  can  be 
 okay  as  a  treat  but  when  that  became  a 
 part  of  my  normal  diet  and  I  just  gained
[14:38] so  much  weight  randomly  and  I  felt  bad 
 and  I  looked  at  myself  in  the  mirror 
 shirtless  and  I  literally  felt  bad  I'm
[14:43] realizing  now  that  I  should  have  felt 
 bad  and  I've  slacked  I've  slacked  in  my 
 work  I  say  this  is  the  most  important
[14:48] thing  for  me  and  it  is  and  why  have  I 
 slapped  recording  these  videos  and  my 
 editors  have  had  to  wait  an  extra  day  or
[14:53] two  days  or  sometimes  three  days  or  even 
 longer  because  I've  just  slacked  and 
 it's  like  oh  guys  so  sorry  no  videos
[14:58] today  that  I've  recorded  because  I'm 
 just  a  little  bit  tired  and  you  know  I 
 had  a  big  meal  before  and  I'm  really 
 tired  now  like  that's  embarrassing
[15:03] there's  people  relying  on  me  for  their 
 wages  and  I've  been  slow  with  my  work 
 and  as  much  as  I've  said  so  many  times
[15:08] that  this  is  quite  a  mentally  and 
 physically  demanding  job  I've  shown  that 
 I  can  do  it  I've  shown  that  I  can  record
[15:13] all  seven  videos  even  in  one  sitting  and 
 so  to  have  my  editors  wait  for  multiple
[15:18] days  it's  unacceptable  in  this  modern 
 day  you  are  told  to  not  talk  like  this 
 to  yourself  you  are  told  to  be  so  soft
[15:24] to  yourself  and  look  around  look  at  the 
 consequences  of  that  kind  of  message 
 everyone  these  days  is  so  weak  you  have
[15:29] been  weak  for  far  too  long  if  you 
 literally  just  think  about  your  life 
 like  periods  of  your  life  year  by  year
[15:34] by  year  you  have  been  weak  for  most  of 
 them  because  you've  listened  to  the 
 exact  same  advice  that  everyone  else  has
[15:39] be  nice  to  yourself  go  easy  on  yourself 
 it's  okay  just  compare  yourself  to 
 yesterday  one  percent  better  every  day
[15:44] but  that  guy  who's  competing  with  you 
 and  you  don't  even  realize  he's 
 competing  but  that  guy  who's  gonna  flirt
[15:49] with  your  future  wife  he's  not  going 
 easy  on  himself  I  will  say  this  again 
 bro  I  want  you  to  imagine  in  the  future
[15:54] you  got  a  wife  you  got  kids  and  yeah 
 everything's  so  happy  and  your  wife's 
 you  know  at  work  there  are  gonna  be  some
[15:59] guys  who  hit  on  on  the  and  one  of  those 
 guys  he  didn't  take  days  off  when  you
[16:04] did  one  of  those  guys  who  will  flirt 
 with  your  future  wife  or  your  girlfriend 
 or  the  mother  of  your  children  he's  not
[16:09] being  easy  on  himself  right  now  he's  on 
 the  floor  doing  ab  exercises  doing 
 crunches  whilst  he's  listening  to  this
[16:14] video  are  you  or  are  you  sat  there  with 
 like  fat  rolls  just  like  poor  posture
[16:19] thinking  oh  yeah  well  you  know  I've 
 already  worked  out  today  I  already  went 
 to  the  gym  today  so  I  don't  need  to  do 
 anything  more  I  arrest  this  key  he's  not
[16:25] resting  bro  and  when  he  approaches  your 
 future  wife  and  he's  lean  and  he's  10 
 body  fat  and  his  shirt  just  presses
[16:30] against  his  abs  and  her  eyes  just 
 quickly  look  down  and  a  little  bit  of
[16:35] lust  begins  to  form  in  her  and  she's  not 
 a  bad  person  for  this  how  could  she  not 
 be  turned  on  by  a  guy  who  is  just  so
[16:41] much  better  than  you  and  that's  gonna 
 [ __ ]  hurt  sometimes  I  forget  to  think 
 like  this  because  you  know  it's  toxic
[16:46] and  there  might  be  some  male  feminists 
 reacting  to  this  it's  so  toxic  yeah  it 
 is  it  is  toxic  but  male  life  is  supposed
[16:51] to  be  toxic  male  life  is  supposed  to  be 
 a  competition  it's  supposed  to  be  a  war 
 so  all  these  soft  people  telling  you
[16:56] like  oh  no  dude  just  take  some  time  off 
 dude  it's  all  that  deep  dude  just  play 
 some  video  games  they  weren't  even  in
[17:02] the  competition  of  men  anyway  but  that 
 guy  who  is  truly  your  company  position  I 
 promise  you  right  here  right  now  whilst
[17:07] you're  watching  this  video  I  promise  you 
 he  is  literally  on  the  floor  doing 
 crunches  get  to  work  do  the  hard  work
[17:13] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it

 reason 
 so  if  you  want  to  maximize  your 
 improvement  from  this  video  watch  it  all
[02:14] in  order  you'll  understand  why  soon 
 chapter  one 
 taking  action  taking  action  must  be
[02:20] addressed  first  you're  going  to  learn 
 how  to  proactively  take  action  so  that
[02:25] the  other  things  you  learn  in  this  video 
 you  can  actually  do  taking  action  is  a
[02:30] skill  like  a  skill  in  a  video  game  you 
 have  to  level  up  this  skill  but  real 
 life  is  like  hard  mode  and  when  you
[02:36] don't  level  up  your  skills  in  real  life 
 you  actually  lose  levels  so  that  means 
 you  currently  have  a  low  level  in  the
[02:42] taking  action  skill  you're  a  noob  so 
 what  does  a  noob  do  to  level  up  his
[02:47] skill  does  he  come  and  train  with  the 
 big  boys  and  slays  and  beasts  no 
 the  noob  starts  on  level  one  chickens  in
[02:54] other  words  start  by  taking  action  with 
 stuff  that's  easy  now  these  things  are
[02:59] going  to  seem  like  they're  below  you 
 like  you're  better  than  doing  them  you 
 don't  need  to  waste  your  time  doing  such
[03:05] easy  things  you  don't  need  to  kill  level 
 one  chickens  that's  your  ego  your  big 
 fat  ego  is  stopping  you  from  taking
[03:11] action  because  you  think  you're  better 
 than  you  actually  are  you've  fallen  off 
 the  wagon  for  so  long  that  you  need  to
[03:16] now  recalibrate  and  drop  the  bar  so  much 
 lower  so  that  you  can  get  back  into
[03:21] grinding  and  get  back  into  taking  action 
 so  start  small  start  easy  this  is  why
[03:27] all  of  those  motivational  videos  you 
 watch  say  start  with  making  your  bed
[03:33] start  with  making  your  bed 
 seriously 
 pause  this  video  and  go  and  make  your
[03:38] bed  and  go  and  make  it  look  10  nicer  if 
 you  want  some  improvements  from  this 
 video  and  you  want  this  video  to  start
[03:44] changing  your  life  pause  the  video  and 
 go  make  your  bed 
 this  is  how  you  start  getting  xp  in  the
[03:50] taking  action  skill  go  and  do  this 
 literally  right  now  with  starting  easy 
 so  that  you  get  used  to  pausing  this
[03:56] video  and  doing  something  that  i 
 recommend  well  done  you  probably  weren't 
 planning  to  make  your  bed  just  then  this
[04:02] is  actually  a  very  important  concept 
 doing  the  work  when  you  don't  feel  like
[04:07] it  this  is  what  i  have  stated  is  the 
 most  important  sentence  i  have  ever 
 wrote  down  in  my  entire  life  do  the  hard
[04:14] work  even  if  you  don't  feel  like  it  that 
 is  the  secret  to  taking  action  it's
[04:19] acting  without  motivation  not  waiting 
 for  the  right  emotions  the  right 
 feelings  to  do  the  action  and  just  doing
[04:26] it  anyway  we're  so  used  to  waiting  until 
 we  are  motivated  to  do  something  but  did
[04:31] you  know  that  you  can  actually  do 
 something  without  feeling  like  doing  it
[04:36] taking  action  is  easy  when  you  feel  like 
 it  but  we  don't  feel  like  it  most  of  the
[04:42] time  so  we  need  to  practice  the  skill 
 that  better  enables  us  to  take  action 
 when  we  don't  feel  like  it  because
[04:49] that's  when  we're  failing  it's  when  we 
 don't  feel  like  it's  when  we  say  oh  you 
 know  what  our  emotions  aren't  lining  up
[04:55] with  our  good  values  and  i'm  gonna 
 listen  to  my  emotions  instead  of  being  a 
 logical  masculine  person  so  we  do  things
[05:01] that  we  feel  like  doing  and  most  of  the 
 time  we  feel  like  sitting  there  just
[05:06] scrolling  on  your  phone  looking  at 
 instagram  models  gain  xp  in  your  taking 
 action  skill  by  doing  the  hard  work  even
[05:12] when  you  don't  feel  like  it  a  fantastic 
 way  to  do  this  is  doing  any  form  of 
 exercise  first  thing  in  the  morning  i'm
[05:19] talking  literally  two  seconds  after 
 waking  up  after  your  eyes  open  you  burst 
 out  of  bed  you  explode  out  of  bed
[05:25] straight  into  some  push-ups  we're  not 
 trying  to  build  muscle  here  you're  not 
 going  to  get  gains  this  is  about
[05:30] training  you're  taking  action  skill  your 
 mind  is  going  to  tell  you  wait  i  don't 
 want  to  do  that  push-up  thing  today  it's
[05:36] kind  of  cold  outside  and  i'd  rather  stay 
 underneath  the  covers 
 get  exp  and  you're  taking  action  skill
[05:41] by  not  listening  to  your  mind  not 
 listening  to  your  emotions  explode  out 
 of  bed
[05:46] do  a  couple  push-ups  you've  just  got  10 
 taking  action  xp  so  this  is  motivating
[05:52] if  you  can  understand  this  concept 
 you'll  realize  that  anytime  you  feel 
 somewhat  weak  you  feel  like  not  doing
[05:58] the  hard  work  that  will  get  you  to  your 
 goals 
 that  moment  actually  becomes  an
[06:03] opportunity 
 these  are  just  opportunities  for  you  to 
 get  xp  in  the  taking  action  skill  when
[06:09] you  don't  feel  like  doing  the  hard  work 
 so  look  forward  to  not  feeling  like
[06:14] doing  the  hard  work  because  that  is 
 actually  a  good  thing  because  now 
 you're  going  to  try  and  override  that  so
[06:20] you  aren't  going  to  let  your  emotions 
 dictate  your  actions 
 therefore  we  need  a  new  determinator  of
[06:28] actions 
 chapter  2 
 100  responsibility  you  are  responsible
[06:34] for  100  of  the  things  that  happen  in 
 your  life  internalize  this  belief  and
[06:39] you  will  become  successful  masculine 
 happy  fit  strong  and  social 
 say  it  with  me
[06:44] i  am  responsible  for  100  of  the  things 
 that  happen  in  my  life  if  it's  in  your
[06:49] life  it's  your  responsibility 
 that  obviously  means  things  like  going 
 to  the  gym  keeping  fit  is  your
[06:55] responsibility  but  let's  use  some  weird 
 examples  let's  say  someone  spills  their
[07:00] drink  on  you  by  accident  it's  their 
 fault  it's  their  responsibility  right  no 
 it's  their  fault  but  in  the  end  it's
[07:07] always  your  responsibility  on  how  you 
 react  to  things  that  happen  in  life  keep 
 all  of  the  responsibility  on  yourself
[07:13] and  then  you  have  to  personally  overcome 
 every  single  situation  that  arises
[07:18] instead  of  letting  someone  else  take 
 charge  you  may  wonder  why  you  would  even 
 want  to  do  this  letting  someone  else
[07:24] take  charge  is  easier  and  it's  less  work 
 especially  if  it's  their  fault  and  it's
[07:29] for  unimportant  things  like  someone  just 
 spilled  their  drink  on  you  that's  the 
 wrong  mentality  to  have  this  is  all
[07:35] practice  like  training  it's  all  about 
 gaining  xp  in  our  responsibility  skill
[07:41] the  higher  our  responsibility  skill 
 level  the  easier  it  is  for  us  to  change 
 our  lives  your  responsibility  skill  is
[07:48] at  a  low  level  right  now  because  you 
 haven't  been  given  an  opportunity  by 
 society  parents  or  teachers  to  actually
[07:54] be  responsible  for  important  parts  of 
 your  life  when  something  arises  in  your 
 life  whatever  situation  or  problem  that
[08:01] comes  up  remember  that  you  are  100 
 responsible  for  it 
 so  don't  let  anyone  else  claim  the  xp  to
[08:07] level  up  their  responsibility  skill 
 figure  it  out  and  try  to  fix  it  to  claim
[08:12] the  xp  yourself  that  doesn't  mean  not  to 
 accept  help  because  accepting  help  and
[08:17] learning  how  to  fix  something  is  still 
 taking  responsibility  to  overcome  that
[08:22] situation  so  your  phone  stops  working 
 making  it  your  responsibility  would  mean
[08:27] that  you  take  the  time  to  research  it 
 try  to  fix  it  yourself  or  you  take  it  to
[08:33] the  phone  shop  that  can  repair  it  for 
 you  taking  responsibility  for  100  of  the
[08:38] things  that  happen  in  your  life  is 
 uncomfortable  there's  just  more  work  for 
 us  to  do  but  it's  exactly  this  act  of
[08:44] dealing  with  random  problems  that 
 creates  you  into  a  man  that's  actually 
 good  at  problem  solving  this  mentality
[08:50] will  create  you  into  an  independent 
 confident  person  who's  actually  done 
 things  who  feels  competent  in  himself
[08:57] you  must  feel  responsible  for  everything 
 so  that  you  can  be  responsible  for  the
[09:02] things  that  matter  the  opposite  of  that 
 is  feeling  like  you  aren't  responsible 
 for  anything  like  everything  that
[09:07] happens  to  you  is  someone  else's  fault 
 so  someone  else  should  fix  it  someone 
 else  made  you  stressed  and  that  caused
[09:13] you  to  stress  it  so  the  real  reason  why 
 you're  overweight  is  because  of  someone 
 else  and  so  they  should  fix  this  problem
[09:18] for  you  if  this  is  your  mentality  then 
 you  probably  won't  lose  that  weight 
 because  you've  stripped  the
[09:23] responsibility  from  yourself  and  put  it 
 onto  someone  else  but  there's  certain 
 things  in  life  that  other  people  cannot
[09:29] do  for  us  if  you  do  not  remain 
 responsible  for  your  life  you  won't  be 
 able  to  change  for  the  better  take
[09:35] responsibility  over  everything  that 
 happens  and  it's  like  you  give  yourself 
 permission  to  change  so  the  actionable
[09:41] step  for  this  chapter 
 is  to  just  keep  this  in  mind 
 just  try  to  remember  this  phrase  100
[09:48] responsibility  anytime  some  random 
 happens  remember  that  i  am  responsible
[09:53] for  100  of  the  things  that  happen  in  my 
 life  if  it's  in  your  life  if  you've  seen
[09:58] it  you've  heard  it 
 try  and  fix  it  yourself  but  what  if  you 
 can't  cope
[10:03] what  if  life  seems  too  hard  to  bother 
 with  being  responsible  for  100  of  the
[10:08] things  that  happen  what  if  you're  too 
 stressed  anxious  what  if  you've  got 
 negative  thoughts
[10:13] just  battles  going  on  in  your  mind 
 we're  going  to  move  on  to  the  most
[10:18] important  chapter  chapter  3 
 mental  health  this  chapter  is  where 
 we're  going  to  begin  to  take  practical
[10:24] steps  so  i'll  have  you  pause  the  video 
 multiple  times  and  go  and  do  an 
 actionable  step  if  you  want  this  video
[10:31] to  help  you  improve  your  life  make  sure 
 you  do  these  steps  even  if  you  don't 
 feel  like  it  good  mental  health  will
[10:37] make  everything  line  up 
 let's  imagine  a  scenario  let's  say  you
[10:43] had  the  most  perfect  mental  health  you 
 were  happy  almost  all  day  every  day  you
[10:49] were  grateful  for  all  of  the 
 relationships  you  had  you  felt  so  proud 
 of  all  of  the  achievements  that  you've
[10:55] gotten  in  this  perfect  mental  health 
 scenario  do  you  think  you  would  have  an 
 issue  with  nofap  would  you  be  jacking
[11:01] off  three  times  a  day 
 probably  not  would  you  be  scrolling  on
[11:06] your  phone  and  just  over  indulging  on 
 instant  gratification 
 again  it's  unlikely  in  this  perfect
[11:12] mental  health  scenario  do  you  think  you 
 would  struggle  to  go  to  the  gym 
 nah
[11:17] it  would  be  pretty  easy  and  i  bet  you'd 
 actually  feel  quite  excited  to  go  and 
 exercise  flip  the  script
[11:23] what  if  you  have  poor  mental  health  what 
 if  you  have  symptoms  of  major  depression
[11:28] would  it  be  easy  to  go  to  the  gym  nah 
 i  think  it  might  literally  be  impossible
[11:33] you  can  see  that  mental  health  really 
 changes  everything  in  your  life
[11:38] what  is  life  if  not  for  what  we  process 
 in  here  good  mental  health  will  make  you
[11:43] feel  like  a  child  again  like  everything 
 is  just  enjoyable  not  having  negative
[11:48] thoughts  and  being  able  to  enjoy  the 
 random  things  in  life  is  actually  a 
 privilege  that  not  many  guys  are
[11:54] experiencing  the  good  thing  is  that  we 
 can  improve  our  mental  health  with 
 practical  techniques  and  the  even  better
[12:00] thing  for  you 
 is  that  you  are  watching  a  video  made  by 
 a  guy  who  has  been  so  focused  on  this
[12:07] goal  of  improving  mental  health  for  many 
 months  now  i  have  put  in  some  serious 
 intention  in  learning  and  trying  so  many
[12:13] different  techniques  and  i've  even  put 
 them  on  to  other  people  i'm  going  to 
 tell  you  exactly  what  to  do  and  i've
[12:19] concluded  that  there  are  four  steps  to 
 improving  your  mental  health  number  one
[12:24] watch  the  science  of  well-being  course 
 by  yale  professor  laurie  santos  you  can
[12:30] watch  it  for  free  on  course  era 
 seriously  go  to  the  description  right 
 now  it's  link  one  enroll  for  free  maybe
[12:37] even  watch  the  first  lecture  this  is  a 
 life-changing  course  if  you  make  this
[12:42] your  main  focus  and  go  through  at  least 
 one  lecture  a  day  you  will  be  so  glad
[12:47] you  did  i  could  teach  you  so  much  about 
 mental  health  but  laurie  santos  does  it 
 so  much  better  than  i  ever  could  she
[12:53] goes  through  so  much  scientific 
 literature  to  show  you  the  quantified
[12:58] data  to  improve  your  mental  health  and 
 you  would  never  believe  what  the 
 research  actually  says  because  our
[13:03] entire  lives  we've  been  focused  on 
 getting  good  grades  good  job  more  money 
 a  better  house  but  in  terms  of
[13:09] well-being  there  are  other  things  that 
 are  significantly  more  vital  if  there's 
 just  one  thing  you  do  from  my  video  make
[13:15] it  this  go  and  enroll  into  this  class 
 again  it's  completely  free  and  just  go
[13:20] through  this  lecture  with  intents  go 
 through  it  with  focus  get  obsessed  with 
 this  course  get  addicted  to  it  anytime
[13:27] she  tells  you  to  do  some  kind  of 
 practical  technique  or  whatever  just  do 
 it  all  it  will  change  your  mental  health
[13:33] it  did  for  me  i  was  classified  as  having 
 major  depression  20  plus  points  on  the
[13:38] self-assessment  scales  and  it  went  down 
 by  literally  10  times  i  scored  just  one
[13:44] or  two  points  now 
 my  anxiety  was  so  bad  it  was  literally 
 like  life-changing  when  i  took  this
[13:50] course 
 it's  just  you  need  the  knowledge  you 
 need  the  data  and  this  course  will  teach
[13:55] you  exactly  the  the  steps  to  improve 
 your  mental  health  so  the  next  two  steps
[14:00] to  improve  your  mental  health  branch  off 
 pretty  much  the  two  most  important 
 practices  that  you  learn  about  in  the
[14:06] science  of  well-being  course  and  that  is 
 mindfulness  and  gratitude  these  are
[14:11] practices  that  you  can  spend  literally  a 
 few  days  on  that  will  make  everything  in
[14:16] here  so  much  better  your  thoughts  will 
 just  feel  nicer  to  you  your  mind  won't
[14:22] be  all  bumbled  up  and  negative 
 mindfulness  helps  with  nofap  and  all 
 other  addictions  gratitude  is  the  secret
[14:29] to  happiness  so  how  do  you  increase 
 mindfulness 
 the  most  common  way  is  meditating  you've
[14:36] probably  heard  a  lot  about  meditation 
 already  and  you  probably  aren't 
 consistently  meditating  i  understand  i
[14:42] was  in  the  same  place  and  that's  because 
 you  don't  really  understand  this  concept 
 of  mindfulness  i  explain  it  in  a  very
[14:48] different  way  than  anyone  you've  ever 
 heard  before  i  made  a  skillshare  class
[14:53] and  so  far  people  have  said  that  it  it 
 has  been  quite  helpful  that  i  gave  a 
 framework  a  logical  step-by-step  process
[15:01] of  improving  your  mindfulness 
 and  what  i'll  do  is  i'll  put  a  free  link 
 so  you  don't  even  need  to  put  card
[15:06] details  in  it'll  be  link  number  two  to 
 watch  this  skillshare  class  to  improve 
 your  mindfulness mindfulness
[15:12] is  a  whole  grind  by  itself  but  it  is 
 extremely  important  especially  in  this
[15:17] digital  age 
 we  all  suffer  from  mind  wandering  that's
[15:22] where  your  thoughts  and  your  focus  drift 
 away  from  what  you're  currently  doing  so 
 you  find  yourself  being  sometimes  you
[15:28] have  to  like  reread  something  that  you 
 just  read  you're  trying  to  read  a  book 
 and  you  can  only  read  like  one  sentence
[15:33] and  you  start  thinking  about  from 
 high  school  or  this  instagram  post 
 that's  mind  wondering  it's  caused  by
[15:40] excessive  internet  usage  i  think 
 specifically  social  media  because  when
[15:45] you're  just  scrolling  on  your  phone 
 every  0.2  seconds  you're  seeing  another
[15:50] post  another  piece  of  data  something 
 that  just  spikes  something  inside  of  you 
 and  our  brain  isn't  supposed  to  process
[15:56] new  information  that  quickly  this  is  my 
 belief  and  so  what  happens  is  now  our 
 thoughts  are  quite  similar  to  these
[16:02] instagram  posts  where  they're  just 
 random  every  few  seconds  you  just  think 
 about  some  random  that  isn't
[16:07] about  the  task  at  hand  and  this  is 
 killing  your  productivity  mindfulness 
 will  reduce  this  and  help  you  get  in
[16:13] what's  called  flow  flow  is  like  a 
 deepened  state  of  focus  it's  what
[16:18] athletes  call  being  in  the  zone  you  want 
 to  be  experiencing  flow  every  single  day
[16:23] for  the  rest  of  your  life  if  possible 
 and  mindfulness  will  help  you  get  that 
 if  you  want  to  improve  your  mindfulness
[16:29] go  to  link  to  right  now  just  enroll  into 
 the  class  you  don't  have  to  watch  it  yet 
 but  you  can  maybe  watch  it's  only  like
[16:35] 20  minutes  so  you  can  watch  some  of  it 
 if  you  want  otherwise  just  meditate  make 
 it  a  daily  habit  try  and  do  a  bit  of
[16:41] research  onto  mindfulness  every  day  and 
 you'll  find  that  over  time  over  a  few 
 months  or  so  you'll  just  get  more  and
[16:46] more  knowledge  of  this  area  how  do  you 
 improve  gratitude 
 there's  a  bunch  of  different  methods  but
[16:52] i  think  gratitude  journaling  is  the  best 
 you  literally  just  get  a  piece  of  paper 
 or  your  phone  and  just  write  a  couple
[16:58] bullet  points  of  things  that  you  are 
 grateful  for  let's  do  this  right  now 
 this  is  the  actionable  step  so  make  sure
[17:03] you  do  this  right  now  i  did  this  kind  of 
 video  just  recently  as  well  so  if  you 
 did  it  then  that's  good  do  it  again
[17:09] right  now  get  a  piece  of  paper  get  a 
 notepad  get  your  phone  on  the  notes
[17:14] right  i  am  grateful  for  and  just  write 
 one  thing  i'm  grateful  for  this  water 
 bottle
[17:19] there's  mine  you  can  see  how  quick  this 
 was  and  when  you  really  focus  on 
 gratitude  journaling  you'll  find  that
[17:25] it  will  literally  always  make  you  smile 
 because  you're  recalling  you're  savoring
[17:30] memories  that  actually  are  pleasant  we 
 spend  so  much  of  our  time  thinking  about 
 what  we  don't  have
[17:36] even  in  the  self-improvement  community 
 all  we  do  is  just  think  about  achieving 
 more  getting  more  practicing  gratitude
[17:42] is  just  a  bit  of  time  where  you  sit 
 there  and  you  express  appreciation  for
[17:47] what  you  have  right  now 
 that's  powerful  that  is  what  makes
[17:52] people  happy  if  you  watch  the  science  of 
 well-being  course  and  you  see  the 
 research  on  gratitude  it's  it's
[17:57] mind-blowing  it's  like  a  mental  health 
 hack  and  it  literally  takes  a  few
[18:02] minutes  a  day  finally  the  fourth  step  to 
 improving  mental  health  is  to  reduce
[18:07] social  media  including  reddit  this  stuff 
 is  not  good  for  us  you  can't  argue
[18:12] against  this  points  all  of  the  data  all 
 of  the  research  shows  that  social  media
[18:17] is  just  toxic  for  your  mental  health 
 even  if  you're  one  of  those  guys  who  are 
 like  oh  you  know  but  i  barely  use  it  i  i
[18:22] only  scroll  for  like  four  hours  a  day 
 that's  that  is  what's  more  realistic 
 like  everyone  says  they  don't  use  it  but
[18:29] if  you  actually  tracked  your  time  it 
 would  be  at  least  double  or  triple  what 
 you  actually  think  it  is
[18:34] this  is  a  difficult  step  to  quit  social 
 media  like  many  people  have  struggled 
 here  i  did  too  the  only  way  i've  been
[18:40] able  to  reduce  my  social  media  usage  is 
 through  a  long  term  dopamine  detox
[18:46] another  thing  i've  made  a  skillshare 
 class  about  it's  pretty  much  changing  up 
 your  lifestyle  so  that  you  prioritize
[18:51] delayed  gratification  instead  of  instant 
 gratification  so  you  reduce  social  media
[18:56] netflix  video  games  and  instead  add  in  a 
 bunch  of  delayed  gratification
[19:01] activities  like  exercise  meditation  and 
 hard  work  for  any  kind  of  business  so
[19:06] this  is  again  another  life-changing 
 practice  i  have  made  a  skillshare  class 
 on  if  you  want  to  learn  more  about  it
[19:11] it'll  be  link  3  and  you  can  just  watch 
 exactly  why  and  how  i  have  done  this
[19:16] dopamine  detox  which  has  resulted  in  me 
 not  using  social  media  and  honestly  if
[19:21] you've  watched  this  far  a  dopamine  detox 
 is  probably  exactly  what  you  need
[19:26] you  should  consider  it  every  young  guy 
 could  benefit  from  this  so  you  can  see 
 that  there's  a  lot  of  knowledge  here  the
[19:32] science  of  well-being  course  my  video 
 classes  on  skillshare  this  is  what  you
[19:37] should  be  using  the  internet  for  watch 
 these  things  and  you'll  actually  feel 
 productive  with  tactics  and  practices
[19:43] that  will  actually  give  you  some  kind  of 
 improvement  in  life  don't  just  keep 
 mindlessly  watching  youtube  video  after
[19:49] youtube  video  that  includes  my  videos 
 this  is  how  you  know  i'm  being  like  real 
 and  honest  and  that  i  actually  want  you
[19:55] to  improve  areas  of  your  life 
 it  would  benefit  me  if  you  kept  on 
 watching  all  of  my  videos  and  you  watch
[20:01] all  of  them  in  a  row  and  you  binge  watch 
 my  content  but  if  you're  doing  that 
 you're  doing  it  wrong  and  you're
[20:07] disappointing  me 
 if  you 
 these  videos  are  for  young  men  like  18
[20:12] 20  year  old  me  to  improve  their  lives 
 it's  not  for  you  to  binge  watch  it's  for 
 you  to  watch  one  of  my  videos  and
[20:17] whatever  the  topic  is  to  go  and  practice 
 that  so  if  you're  planning  to  binge 
 watch  all  of  the  lectures  on  the  science
[20:22] of  well-being  course 
 take  a  second  and  just  think  that  is  not
[20:27] the  right  way  you  don't  binge  watch  this 
 stuff  you  you  do  one  lesson  two  lessons 
 and  then  you  go  and  practice  what  you
[20:32] just  learned  you  recall  you  write  you 
 make  notes 
 don't  binge  watch  content  it's  never
[20:38] worked  for  you  it  never  will  because  it 
 isn't  a  method  of  actually  learning 
 these  four  steps  will  transform  your
[20:45] mental  health  and  it  will  probably  take 
 you  around  25  minutes  a  day  you  could  do
[20:50] more  you  could  meditate  more  you  could 
 watch  more  lectures  of  the  science 
 well-being  course  you  could  do  more
[20:55] points  of  the  gratitude  journaling 
 that's  nice  but  just  do  the  bare  minimum
[21:00] just  show  up  and  you  will  make  major 
 progress  that's  the  thing  with  mental 
 health  is  that  you  don't  really  have  the
[21:06] capacity  to  do  more  when  i  first  started 
 with  this  stuff  i  literally  couldn't 
 stay  focused  on  the  science  of
[21:12] well-being  course  for  about  half  of  the 
 lecture  like  i  needed  to  stop  take  a
[21:17] break  and  smoke  up  and
[21:22] that's  the  tricky  thing  with  mental 
 health  but  if  you  brave  through  it  if 
 you  just  go  back  just  specifically  go  to
[21:28] the  science  of  well-being  course  because 
 that  is  what  changed  it  all  for  me 
 that's  how  i  found  mindfulness  and
[21:34] gratitude  i  had  been  meditating 
 previously  but  that's  how  i  really  saw 
 the  research  that  mindfulness  and
[21:40] gratitude  are  literally  the  mental 
 health  tactics  that  you  should  be  doing 
 every  single  day  for  the  rest  of  your
[21:46] life  it's  just  a  shame  that  no  one  has 
 drilled  this  into  us  yet  because
[21:51] we  it  would  have  been  really  nice  to 
 benefit  from  this  for  the  last  few  years 
 but  all  you  can  do  is  start  today  if
[21:58] you're  a  young  man  and  you  think  you're 
 anything  like  me 
 this  this  stuff  will  change  your  life
[22:03] honestly  the  science  of  well-being 
 course  gratitude  mindfulness  quizzing 
 social  media
[22:10] i  can't  explain  how  different  my  mental 
 health  how 
 positive  and  how  much  self-love  and  how
[22:15] much  humor  and  laughter  i  have 
 now  that  i've  committed  to  all  these
[22:20] practices  and  how  different  this  is  just 
 compared  to  a  few  months  ago
[22:25] commit  to  these  practices  and
[22:30] it's  like  you'll  have  two  lives  so 
 therefore  with  increased  mental  health
[22:35] you'll  feel  more  competent  to  do  things 
 so  that's  why  we've  covered  mental 
 health  first
[22:40] so  now  let's  move  on  to  my  favorite 
 chapter  and  what  started  my
[22:45] self-improvement  journey  chapter  four 
 physical  health  and  building  an 
 aesthetic  physique  it  is  a  shame  for  a
[22:52] man  to  grow  old  without  seeing  the 
 beauty  and  strength  of  which  his  body  is 
 capable  you  put  in  the  work
[22:58] the  literal  blood  sweat  and  tears  and 
 you  are  rewarded  with  a  sense  of  pride
[23:03] that  very  few  men  feel  you  will  smile 
 every  single  time  you  see  yourself  every
[23:08] time  you're  reminded  how  much  progress 
 you've  made  exercising  specifically
[23:13] building  muscle  through  resistance 
 training  gives  you  and  the  entire  world
[23:18] a  physical  indicator  of  the  efforts  you 
 have  put  in  everyone  can  see  this  and
[23:23] everyone  whether  or  not  they  have  the 
 confidence  to  admit  it  respects  that
[23:28] effort  there's  two  parts  to  this  chapter 
 one  focuses  on  improving  our  physical 
 health  and  the  other  focuses  on  building
[23:34] an  aesthetic  physique  through  resistance 
 training  physical  health
[23:39] young  guys  frankly  don't  care  about 
 their  physical  health  i  know  because 
 i've  been  in  the  same  position  we're  so
[23:45] focused  on  making  money 
 getting  girls  playing  video  games  that
[23:50] we  overlook  our  health  health  should  be 
 a  priority  above  everything  else
[23:55] because  if  you  don't  have  your  health 
 you  don't  have  anything  else  so  how  can
[24:00] we  maximize  our  physical  health  like 
 anything  it  requires  intention  that
[24:06] means  it  requires 
 time 
 and  effort 
 so  the  most  practical  way  for  you  to
[24:12] optimize  your  physical  health  for  the 
 rest  of  your  life 
 is  to  carve  out  some sometime
[24:18] maybe  every  day  maybe  in  the  allotted 
 week  to  literally  sit  there  and  think 
 about  how  to  optimize  your  physical
[24:24] health  this  is  why  i've  got  a  health 
 block  in  my  daily  timetable  i  sit  there
[24:29] and  i  think  what  kind  of  symptoms  have  i 
 been  experiencing  spend  some  time  and 
 effort  thinking  about  what
[24:35] health  things  you  could  improve  on 
 because  we've  all  got  some  kind  of 
 symptoms  of  ill  health  that  we've  just
[24:41] been  putting  off  and  if  you  just  set 
 aside  the  time  and  energy  to  sit  there
[24:46] think  about  what  random  experiences 
 you've  been  feeling  do  you  have  an  upset 
 stomach  quite  often  is  your  shoulder
[24:53] joint  just  really  painful  do  your  knees 
 keep  clicking  do  you  have  a  blocked  nose
[24:58] 24  7. 
 think  about  it  research  it  try  and  fix 
 it  yourself  if  not  book  a  doctor's
[25:04] appointment  this  is  a  foolproof  way  of 
 making  sure  that  your  health  is
[25:09] optimized  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 literally  carve  out  some  time  out  of 
 your  schedule  to  sit  and  think  about
[25:16] what  is  your  ill  health  symptoms 
 we  live  in  such  a  distracted  world  that
[25:21] we  just  live  with  these  type  of  symptoms 
 instead  of  actually  doing  something 
 about  it  because  it's  easier  to  just
[25:27] scroll  on  instagram  and  then  keep 
 forgetting  about  making  that  doctor's 
 appointment  for  something  one  of  the 
 best  ways  to  improve  your  physical
[25:33] health  is  to  eat  for  nutrition  not  taste 
 tasty  food  and  snacks  should  be  like
[25:38] treats  we  should  enjoy  maybe  a  handful 
 every  day  but  we  should  not  fill  up  on
[25:44] this  junk  food  this  is  very  difficult 
 because  you  only  see  the  negatives  of  a 
 diet  when  you  get  older  and  then  the
[25:50] older  version  of  you  will  look  back  at 
 you  today  wishing  that  you  eat  for 
 nutrition  instead  of  taste  so  i  like  to
[25:56] think  of  it  as  investing  for  future 
 hamza  so  that  i  can  look  back  and  feel 
 grateful  for  my  dietary  choices  today
[26:03] and  before  you  know  it  because  i've 
 committed  enough  time  to  this  practice  i 
 am  future  hamza  looking  back  at  younger
[26:10] me  who  has  been  eating  for  nutrition  for 
 the  past  few  months  and  now  i'm  in  the 
 best  shape  of  my  life  it's  delayed
[26:16] gratification  it  makes  your  life  better 
 tomorrow  it  makes  the  older  version  of 
 you  grateful  improve  your  physical
[26:22] health  by  exercising  now  resistance 
 training  will  improve  your  health  but
[26:28] slightly 
 it's  cardio  aerobic  exercise  that  will 
 make  a  big  difference  to  your  health
[26:34] it's  like  training  your  heart  and  in  the 
 most  simple  way  move  more
[26:39] walk  more  run  more  skip  more  go  swimming 
 hike  play  sports  it  doesn't  matter  just
[26:45] do  some  kind  of  aerobic  exercise  a  few 
 days  a  week  there's  a  reason  why  you 
 haven't  just  recently  been  doing  cardio
[26:52] two  to  three  days  a  week  that's  because 
 you  don't  enjoy  cardio  because  if  you 
 enjoyed  it  you  probably  would  be  doing
[26:58] it  so  in  a  practical  sense  you  need  to 
 spend  time  and  effort  just  sat  there 
 thinking  and  planning  and  researching
[27:04] types  of  cardio  that  you  may  enjoy  it's 
 different  for  everyone  so  you  have  to
[27:09] put  in  some  intention  to  find  out  what 
 form  of  cardio  you  enjoy  for  me  it's 
 running  and  cycling  and  recently  i've
[27:15] been  getting  into  skipping  do  not  be 
 like  one  of  those  internet  bodybuilders 
 who  think  that  skipping  cardio  is  funny
[27:21] the  older  you  will  not  find  it  funny 
 find  a  form  of  cardio  that  you  enjoy  and
[27:26] the  older  version  of  you  and  you  today 
 will  benefit  so  now  i'm  going  to  ask  you
[27:31] to  pause  the  video  in  a  second  you're 
 gonna  pause  the  video  for  about  one 
 minute  you're  just  gonna  sit  and  let
[27:36] yourself  think 
 this  is  a  valuable  practice  just  sit  and
[27:41] let  your  mind  think  and  just  think  what 
 form  of  cardio  did  i  used  to  enjoy
[27:46] there'll  be  some  kind  where  you  can 
 actually  remember  yourself  just  smiling 
 and  laughing  through  it  but  you'll  only
[27:51] be  able  to  do  this  practice 
 if  you  do  it  distraction  free  so  sit  for
[27:57] literally  one  minute  just  don't  grab 
 your  phone  don't  switch  tabs  don't  do 
 anything  else  pause  the  video  right  now
[28:02] and  just  think  what  form  of  cardio  did  i 
 seem  to  enjoy  okay  i've  just  done  my 
 minute  for  me  it  was  boxing
[28:09] so  i'm  gonna  start  doing  boxing  again 
 building  an  aesthetic  physique  through 
 resistance  training
[28:14] it's  said  that  we  make  our  first 
 impressions  of  each  other  in  just  seven 
 seconds  in  just  seven  seconds  do  they
[28:21] know  your  story  do  they  know  your  good 
 intentions  no 
 in  just  seven  seconds  they  have  seen
[28:27] what  you  look  like  and  what  your  body 
 language  is  like  maybe  you've  said  two
[28:32] words  physical  attractiveness  is 
 becoming  ever  more  important  i  think 
 it's  like  your  lens  in  the  world  the  way
[28:38] you  see  the  world  if  you're  attractive 
 you  see  the  world  very  very  differently
[28:43] than  if  you're  unattractive  this  hurts 
 we  should  be  judged  on  our  core  values
[28:49] but  that  just  isn't  how  life  is 
 and  so  you  either  play  the  game  or  you
[28:54] automatically  lose 
 so  let's  win  the  game  so  in  this  part 
 we're  going  to  go  over  building  an
[29:00] aesthetic  physique  that  will  improve 
 your  physical  attractiveness  and 
 it  will  improve  your  facial
[29:05] attractiveness  as  well  which  i  know  some 
 guys  say  you  can't  change  your  face 
 that's  bs  they  haven't  put  in  enough
[29:11] work  you  improve  your  body  you  increase 
 muscle  you  lower  fat  and  i  guarantee  you
[29:16] that  your  face  will  look  different  too  i 
 hope  you  agree  that  physical 
 attractiveness  is  important  and  it
[29:21] deserves  to  be  improved  it  also  serves 
 as  a  great  feedback  loop  to  increase
[29:26] confidence  the  more  attractive  you  are 
 the  better  the  world  treats  you  the 
 better  the  world  treats  you  the  happier
[29:32] and  more  confident  you  are  you  get 
 opportunities  and  experiences  that  you 
 would  have  never  imagined  were  possible
[29:38] before  and  improving  your  physical 
 attractiveness  is  not  even  difficult  it 
 just  takes  consistency  forget  everything
[29:45] about  trying  to  find  the  most  perfect 
 training  routine  or  what  your  diet  split 
 or  anything  should  look  like  if  you
[29:51] aren't  currently  going  to  the  gym  and 
 lifting  weights  for  three  months  just 
 show  up  and  do  a  bunch  of  different
[29:56] exercises  find  some  random  routine 
 online  and  stick  to  it  four  times  a  week
[30:01] that's  your  goal  just  this  action  of 
 going  to  the  gym  four  times  a  week  is 
 going  to  massively  improve  your  physical
[30:07] attractiveness  and  confidence  over  time 
 and  that's  the  important  word  it's  over
[30:12] time  it  takes  consistency  not  intensity 
 don't  believe  those  videos  where  they
[30:18] say  oh  make  sure  you  go  all  out  make 
 sure  i  i  work  as  hard  as  i  can  in  the 
 gym  no  no  the  gym  weightlifting
[30:24] specifically  is  not  about  pushing  as 
 hard  as  you  can  it's  about  calculated 
 performance  in  other  words  for  complete
[30:30] beginners  don't  push  as  hard  as  you  can 
 you  want  to  be  leaving  the  gym  thinking 
 you  could  have  done  more  that's  a
[30:36] fantastic  mentality  because  then  you're 
 excited  for  the  next  workout  if  you  keep
[30:41] leaving  the  gym  just  completely  depleted 
 then 
 you're  likely  just  going  to  quit  because
[30:47] it's  too  hard  and  as  soon  as  the  the 
 circumstances  of  your  life  change  and  it
[30:52] starts  raining  outside  and  you  wake  up 
 late  and  you  didn't  really  sleep  well 
 and  you've  got  like  a  blocked  nose  and
[30:57] you  just  feel  tired  you're  too  tired  to 
 go  to  the  gym  because  you  just  pushed  so 
 hard  and  then  you'll  quit  and  then
[31:03] you'll  spend  a  couple  more  months 
 messing  around  until  you  get  back  into 
 the  gym  don't  do  that  do  four  easy
[31:09] workouts  a  week  for  three  months  and 
 then  consider  upping  the  intensity  but 
 let  me  give  you  more  information
[31:15] specifically  building  an  aesthetic  body 
 i  actually  made  a  complete  guide  of  this 
 it  was  a  while  ago  but  it  still  holds
[31:21] true  there's  a  few  certain  muscles  you 
 should  focus  on  if  you  want  to  improve 
 your  physical  attractiveness  these  are
[31:27] the  ones  that  will  give  you  the  most 
 bang  for  your  buck  and  they  are  neck 
 upper  chest
[31:33] lateral  delts 
 and  lats  it's  quite  a  weird  set  of 
 muscles  which  are  kind  of  hit  in  a
[31:39] normal  routine  but  if  you  just  add  in  a 
 couple  extra  sets  of  these  muscles
[31:44] you'll  find  that  your  physique  becomes 
 so  much  more  attractive  because  these 
 muscles  focus  on  the  v  taper  which  is
[31:50] incredibly  attractive  on  a  man  the  v 
 taper  on  a  man  is  like  the  hourglass
[31:55] shape  on  a  woman  and  you  get  the  v  taper 
 by  training  these  muscles  but  the  most
[32:00] important  thing  you  should  learn  about 
 in  this  chapter  is  building  an  exercise 
 mentality  a  thought  process  that  leads
[32:06] to  a  lifetime  of  exercise  because  once 
 you  start  you  start  making  progress  you
[32:11] start  making  muscle  you  never  want  to 
 quit  you  never  want  to  lose  that  muscle 
 this  exercise  mentality  is  priceless  so
[32:18] how  do  you  build  one 
 it's  built  up  over  time  and  so  the 
 biggest  most  important  factor  is
[32:25] consistency  and  consistency  is  such  a 
 thrown  around  word  so  exactly  what  does 
 that  mean  how  do  you  get  consistent
[32:32] you  get  consistent  with  two  things 
 firstly  you  have  to  want  to  go  to  the 
 gym  you  have  to  create  the  routine  and
[32:39] the  whole  schedule  the  whole  block  of 
 exercise  to  be  something  that  you 
 actively  look  forward  to  so  that  means
[32:45] choosing  the  music  that  you  actually 
 want  to  listen  to  in  the  gym  customizing 
 it  making  a  playlist  getting  the  gym
[32:51] workout  clothes  that  you're  excited  to 
 wear  going  to  the  actual  gym  or  doing 
 the  specific  workout  that  you  actually
[32:57] seem  to  enjoy  and  you're  excited  the 
 night  before  to  go  and  hit  that  workout 
 and  two  it's  doing  all  of  this
[33:04] for  years  it's  knowing  that  this  is  a 
 grind  that  is  worthwhile  till  the  day 
 you  die  you  want  to  exercise  find  the
[33:11] exercise  that  you  genuinely  enjoy  that 
 you  look  forward  to  which  also  yields
[33:16] the  results  that  you  want 
 so  if  you  want  an  aesthetic  body  then 
 resistance  training  specifically  weight
[33:22] lifting 
 is  the  way  forward  and  if  you  can  learn 
 to  enjoy  weightlifting  you  can  learn  to
[33:27] like  look  forward  to  the  next  workout 
 thinking  that  you  might  be  able  to  lift 
 some  more  weight  then  good  on  you  you've
[33:32] cheated  the  system 
 keep  it  up  don't  quit  and  you  will  build
[33:37] that  dream  body  of  yours  with  enough 
 time  find  humor  and  a  massive  interest
[33:43] in  this  form  of  exercise  merge  it  with 
 your  personality  become  addicted  with  it 
 obsess  with  it  do  research  optimize  your
[33:50] training  find  a  form  of  cardio  that  you 
 actually  enjoy  and  do  it  two  to  three 
 times  a  week  get  into  the  gym  and  lift
[33:56] some  weights  four  days  a  week  it  seems 
 easy  and  simple  enough  but  you  will 
 struggle  to  maintain  this  why
[34:03] because  you  are  addicted  to  things  that 
 are  ruining  your  productivity  chapter  5
[34:08] addictions  and  productivity  you  are 
 addicted  to  the  internet  i  don't  think  i
[34:13] need  to  know  who's  watching  this  if 
 you're  a  young  man  you  are  addicted  to 
 the  internet  you're  probably  spending
[34:18] most  of  your  day  just  mindlessly 
 scrolling  on  your  phone  watching 
 self-improvement  youtube  videos  or  just
[34:24] playing  video  games  the  young  men  who 
 are  leveling  up  in  real  life 
 are  not  leveling  up  in  video  games  think
[34:31] about  why  every  young  guy's 
 transformation  starts  with  oh  i  used  to 
 spend  all  day  on  video  games  but  then  i
[34:37] quit  and  then  everything  in  my  life 
 improved  there's  a  reason  why  this  act 
 of  quitting  video  games  or  netflix  or
[34:42] whatever 
 results  in  major  progress  to  make 
 improvements  in  your  life  requires  time
[34:48] and  effort  both  of  which  video  games 
 drain  i  know  playing  games  seems  easy
[34:54] and  comfortable  but  they  often  leave  you 
 feeling  fatigued  unable  to  think 
 straight
[34:59] feeling  weak  physically  after  a  long 
 gaming  session  it's  like  video  games  sap
[35:05] your  testosterone  your  masculine  energy 
 video  games  are  carefully  designed  to  be
[35:10] addictive  they've  made  them  to  reflect 
 real  life  achievements  working  hard 
 getting  xp  to  level  up  your  skills
[35:16] making  money  climbing  the  ranks  to  a 
 higher  level  when  you're  getting  these 
 virtual  achievements  real  life
[35:22] achievements  seem  less  important  because 
 you're  already  getting  that  dopamine 
 spike  that  reward  system  is  already
[35:28] getting  fired  up  because  you  feel  like 
 you've  accomplished  something  when  you 
 level  up  in  a  video  game  and  that  is
[35:34] taking  your  drive  away  to  level  up  in 
 real  life  let's  think  how  and  why  some 
 guys  like  me  have  quit  video  games
[35:41] whereas  others  have  wanted  to  quit  but 
 just  feel  unable  to  essentially  how  do
[35:46] you  overcome  an  addiction  correctly  the 
 first  thing  that  comes  to  mind  is  making 
 sure  that  you  replace  the  addiction  with
[35:53] something  else  for  me  i  replaced  video 
 games  with  weightlifting  this  seems  to 
 be  the  case  with  so  many  guys  you'd  find
[35:59] speaking  about  this  online  they  quit 
 video  games  because  they  found  something 
 else  to  do  in  that  time  something  that
[36:06] actually  benefits  their  lives  and  you'll 
 always  find  them  say  that  then  they  just 
 got  addicted  to  this  new  thing  this  new
[36:11] delayed  gratification  activity  and  it 
 makes  sense  maybe  there's  just  some
[36:16] people  amongst  us  who  have  an  addictive 
 personality  and  so  if  you're  going  to  be 
 addicted  to  something  why  not  make  sure
[36:22] that  something  is  something  that  really 
 improves  your  life  over  the  long  run 
 instead  of  just  gives  instant
[36:27] gratification  the  general  concept  i've 
 been  teaching  on  my  channel  is  reducing
[36:32] instant  gratification  and  increasing 
 delayed  gratification  netflix  video
[36:37] games  porn  junk  food  weed  they're  all 
 instant  gratification  they  feel  easy  fun
[36:43] and  comfortable  right  now  but  they  lead 
 to  long-term  detriments  your  life  gets 
 worse  every  day  that  you  consume  these
[36:49] substances  playing  an  hour  of  video 
 games  isn't  a  problem  but  there  is  no
[36:54] one  who  is  playing  an  hour  of  video 
 games  imagine  playing  six  hours  of  video 
 games  every  day  for  a  month  is  it  likely
[37:00] that  at  the  end  of  the  month  you  would 
 have  felt  fantastic  and  you  would  have 
 felt  like  you  had  better  mental  health
[37:05] and  more  pride  because  of  this  month 
 probably  not  delayed  gratification  on 
 the  other  hand  is  activities  that  make
[37:10] your  life  better  in  the  long  run  imagine 
 a  month  of  exercising  for  the  first  time
[37:15] in  a  while 
 at  the  end  of  this  month  would  you  feel 
 proud  yes
[37:20] at  the  end  of  this  month  do  you  think 
 you'd  have  better  mental  health  yes 
 reducing  instant  gratification  and
[37:25] increasing  delayed  gratification  is  an 
 investment  to  your  future  mental  health 
 and  success  the  thing  is  you  have
[37:31] probably  wanted  to  commit  to  delayed 
 gratification  you've  wanted  to  exercise 
 consistently  but  you've  just  felt  unable
[37:38] to  stick  to  that  that's  because  we 
 struggle  to  commit  to  delayed 
 gratification  when  our  minds  are  in  a
[37:43] haze  due  to  instant  gratification  it's 
 hard  to  go  to  the  gym  after  a  long
[37:48] gaming  session  it's  hard  to  stay  on  your 
 diet  when  you've  got  the  munchies  it's 
 like  instant  gratification  makes  you
[37:54] forget  the  delayed  gratification  goals 
 you  have  what  we  need  is  structure  we
[37:59] should  consider  structuring  our  day  in  a 
 way  that  prioritizes  our  goal  but  still
[38:04] has  the  instant  gratification  activities 
 that  we  find  the  most  fun  i  tried  so
[38:09] many  productivity  tactics  and  i'm 
 telling  you  this  one  is  the  most  optimum 
 one  for  guys  like  us
[38:14] make  your  own  timetable  remember  the 
 timetables  we  used  to  have  in  school
[38:19] it  was  also  organized  you  just  knew  what 
 lesson  was  next 
 this  is  what  we're  trying  to  recreate
[38:24] because  timetables  work  and  they  work 
 better  than  any  productivity  tactic
[38:29] including  things  like  the  pomodoro 
 technique  and  so  many  others  i've  made 
 separate  videos  explaining  this
[38:34] timetable  and  how  it  has  skyrocketed  my 
 productivity  i'll  have  the  card  up  so
[38:39] you  can  watch  and  hear  me  explain  why 
 give  this  a  try  and  it  might  help  your 
 life  as  much  as  it  has  helped  mine
[38:45] here's  my  timetable  just  copy  how  i've 
 structured  it  and  then  just  change  the 
 timings  be  sure  to  include  the  delayed
[38:51] gratification  activities  that  will  get 
 you  to  your  goals  like  exercise  and 
 university  work  and  also  one  or  two
[38:57] blocks  for  instant  gratification  just 
 relaxing  unwinding  time  make  this
[39:02] timetable  right  now  this  is  your  call  to 
 action  don't  watch  anymore  pause  the 
 video  and  just  imitate  this  timetable
[39:08] great  so  now  we  all  have  a  timetable 
 wrote  up  get  addicted  to  it  read  this
[39:14] timetable  a  thousand  times  read  it  10  20 
 30  times  a  day  just  know  exactly  what  is
[39:20] at  what  time  then  start  to  follow  the 
 timetable  as  best  as  you  can  it's 
 inevitable  that  you'll  get  away  from  the
[39:26] time  you'll  mess  up  a  little  bit 
 something  will  take  a  little  longer  than 
 expected  you'll  forget  about  it  doesn't
[39:31] matter  if  you  just  try  to  stick  to  it  as 
 best  as  you  can  you'll  find  that  you'll 
 be  doing  so  much  more  than  normal  which
[39:37] is  progress  over  time  change  up  the 
 timetable  and  optimize  it  the  mentality
[39:42] i  want  you  to  have  is  to  think  that  this 
 timetable  is  your  ideal  day  a  day  you 
 could  imagine  sticking  to  forever  so  it
[39:49] has  the  necessary  work  for  you  to  get  to 
 your  goals  of  success  but  it  also  has 
 enough  time  to  unwind  and  relax  so  that
[39:56] it  doesn't  feel  like  a  challenge  it  just 
 feels  like  a  day  which  has  a  little  bit 
 more  work  than  what  you  currently  have
[40:02] now  specifically  onto  addictive  drugs 
 having  a  physical  addiction  to  any  drug
[40:07] is  probably  twice  as  harmful  as  you 
 actually  think  it  is  if  you're  satya  and
[40:12] straight  away  the  thought  of  the  drug 
 that  you're  addicted  to  popped  up 
 and  then  you  convince  yourself  that
[40:17] you're  not  actually  addicted  to  this 
 drug  you're  probably  addicted  to  it  so 
 how  do  you  cure  any  addiction
[40:23] mindfulness  mindfulness  is  the  most 
 effective  addiction  therapy  ever  known
[40:28] to  man  i  don't  know  why  more  people 
 don't  talk  about  this  it's  three  times 
 as  effective  as  a  gold  standard  stopping
[40:34] smoking  program  or  in  fact  i  do  know  why 
 people  don't  talk  about  this  it's
[40:39] because  the  companies  and  therapists  and 
 businesses  that  profits  from  people  with
[40:44] addictions  don't  get  a  profit  from 
 mindfulness  but  you  improving  your 
 mindfulness  doesn't  cost  you  anything  so
[40:51] no  one  gets  to  make  money  so  make  this 
 your  goal  if  you  have  any  addiction  if 
 you  spend  two  out  of  the  last  seven  days
[40:58] taking  any  kind  of  substance 
 meditate  for  just  a  couple  minutes  a  day 
 and  try  to  learn  something  new  about
[41:03] mindfulness  it's  fascinating  the  more 
 and  more  you  research  mindfulness  the 
 more  and  more  your  jaw  will  drop  and
[41:09] you'll  be  wondering  why  no  one  else  is 
 talking  about  this  magical  cure  to 
 literally  everything  bad  in  life  i  might
[41:15] seem  crazy  i  might  seem  like  one  of 
 those  spiritual  people  who  are 
 suggesting  meditation  all  the  time
[41:22] get  into  it  and  you  will  understand  why 
 i'm  saying  this  the  increased  levels  of 
 mindfulness  that  you  gain  from
[41:28] consistently  meditating  will  make  you  so 
 much  more  aware  of  your  addiction  and 
 the  negative  aspects  that  arise  from  it
[41:35] i  know  it  seems  like  i've  simplified 
 this  so  much  that  mindfulness  and 
 meditation  is  the  cure  to  everything  but
[41:40] just 
 if  you  can  trust  me  if  you  don't  even 
 trust  me  but  you're  just  interested  if 
 you  just  commit  to  a  meditation  practice
[41:47] do  it  for  three  months  every  single  day 
 you  will  realize  why  the  previous 
 chapters  have  so  far  focused  on  getting
[41:53] you  to  improve  your  life  becoming  the 
 best  version  of  yourself  now  it's  time
[41:58] to  start  meeting  new  people  so  that 
 these  people  meet  the  best  version  of 
 you  chapter  six
[42:04] social  skills  and  relationships 
 the  reason  why  this  chapter  is  last  is
[42:09] because  you  will  make  the  best 
 friendships  and  relationships  when 
 you've  already  committed  to  the  previous
[42:14] chapters  you  want  to  meet  new  people 
 when  you've  already  improved  your  mental 
 and  physical  health  when  you  aren't
[42:20] addicted  to  stuff  so  it's  like  we're 
 making  you  into  the  best  version  of 
 yourself
[42:25] so  you  meet  people  who  now  align  with 
 your  current  goals  and  values  to  make
[42:30] quality  relationships  with  friends 
 family  or  romantically  you  should
[42:35] consider  leveling  up  your  social  skills 
 it's  right  there  in  the  name  social 
 skills  it's  something  you  can  level  up
[42:41] you  can  learn  practice  and  improve  your 
 social  skills  and  it  is  a  very
[42:46] worthwhile  grind  it's  something  you 
 should  put  effort  into  so  straight  away 
 i'm  going  to  recommend  the  cheat  code  to
[42:53] improving  your  social  skills 
 this  book 
 if  you  do  nothing  else  just  read  this
[42:58] book  or  watch  a  youtube  summary  of  it 
 you  can  read  it  on  kindle  you  can  buy
[43:03] the  paperback  copy  that  i've  got  here 
 there's  an  amazon  link  in  the 
 description  to  buy  your  own  paper  copy
[43:08] it's  like  five  pounds  personally  i 
 prefer  to  read  paperbacks  and  i  use  it 
 as  a  time  just  away  from  the  screens
[43:14] specifically  this  chapter  on  six  ways  to 
 make  people  like  you  these  are  the  six
[43:19] principles  that  seem  so  obvious  when  you 
 read  them  you  won't  even  think  that 
 you've  learned  anything  new  but  when  you
[43:26] actually  read  the  chapter  and  you  read 
 the  examples  that  he  gives  this  is  what 
 will  transform  your  social  life  this  is
[43:31] what  will  make  you  into  one  of  those 
 people  who  seems  to  have  friends 
 everywhere  he  goes  i'm  sure  you've  met
[43:36] someone  like  that  a  guy  who  just  seems 
 to  make  friends  anywhere  he  goes  he's
[43:41] such  a  charming  confident  guy  i  bet  he's 
 internalizing  these  principles  whether
[43:46] or  not  he's  read  the  book  maybe  he's 
 just  one  of  the  people  who  just 
 naturally  knew  this  stuff  this  should  be
[43:51] like  a  superpower  because  any  of  the 
 people  you  meet  through  using  the  six 
 principles  from  this  book  could  be  a
[43:58] future  best  friend  girlfriend  or 
 business  partner  seriously  this  is  the 
 action  step  right  now  pause  the  video
[44:04] and  either  go  buy  this  book  or  go  watch 
 a  youtube  summary  or  go  read  it  online
[44:09] in  some  kind  of  pdf  format  come  back  to 
 this  video  of  mine  when  you're  done  if 
 you  took  that  action  step  and  have
[44:14] either  ordered  your  own  copy  or  have 
 just  watched  the  summary  online  that's
[44:19] brilliant  you  will  be  grateful  that  you 
 did  be  sure  to  attempt  the  principles  in 
 real  life  just  testing  the  theory  me  and
[44:25] one  of  my  best  friends  have  said  that 
 this  is  a  book  that  we're  going  to  read 
 every  single  year  for  the  rest  of  our
[44:30] lives  i  suggest  you  do  the  same  thing 
 now  i  can  add  something  from  my  own
[44:35] personal  experience  to  improve  your 
 social  skills 
 practice  approaching  initiate
[44:41] conversation  with  strangers  it's  this 
 exact  phrase  that  has  leveled  up  my 
 social  skills  and  given  me  the
[44:47] opportunity  to  meet  new  people  this 
 phrase  practice  approaching  and  initiate
[44:52] conversation  with  strangers  refers  to 
 walking  up  to  someone  you  don't  know  and 
 starting  a  conversation  with  them  i  made
[44:58] a  whole  video  on  this  so  you  can  watch 
 it  clicking  the  card  right  now  but  in 
 general  see  approaching  people  as
[45:04] practice  you  shouldn't  just  approach 
 people  who  you  think  you  may  become 
 friends  with  or  girls  that  you're
[45:09] attracted  to  because  then  when  the 
 opportunity  does  arise  when  you  meet 
 these  kinds  of  people  you  probably
[45:14] haven't  practiced  this  skill  well  enough 
 you  see  a  cute  girl  and  you  don't  have 
 the  confidence  or  the  ability  to  go  and
[45:20] speak  to  her  what  you  want  is  to  already 
 be  practicing  this  approach  so  that  when
[45:25] there  is  someone  who  you  really  want  to 
 approach  you're  already  used  to  it  it 
 will  feel  like  just  another  approach
[45:31] when  you  see  an  attractive  woman  or  a 
 guy  who  could  potentially  be  a  new 
 friend  this  is  old  man  vibe  speaking  to
[45:37] everyone  and  feeling  confident  in  doing 
 so  be  interested  in  everyone  know  that
[45:42] each  and  every  person  you  see  has 
 something  to  be  admired  something  that 
 you  could  learn  from  this  is  what  makes
[45:48] you  into  a  social  butterfly  you  might 
 think  what  do  you  even  get  out  of 
 talking  to  people  you  aren't  even
[45:53] attracted  to 
 here's  what  dale  carnegie  has  to  say 
 level  up  your  social  skills  and  you  will
[45:58] live  a  much  happier  life  we  have  the 
 data  in  the  research  that  shows  that
[46:03] loneliness  is  a  killer  in  the 
 self-improvement  community  especially 
 with  men  we  have  this  idea  that  the  lone
[46:09] wolf  is  the  cool  one  the  lone  ranger  i'm 
 gonna  go  it  alone  because  other  people 
 don't  matter
[46:15] the  lone  wolf  dies  alone  think  back  to 
 the  times  that  you  felt  the  most  happy
[46:20] i'm  willing  to  bet  that  that  moment  was 
 when  you  had  a  lively  social  circle
[46:25] you  had  close  family  members  close 
 friends  think  back  to  the  time  that  you 
 were  the  most  depressed
[46:30] it  was  probably  after  a  period  of 
 loneliness  or  after  a  breakup  so  what
[46:35] about  romantic  relationships  getting  a 
 girlfriend  this  is  quite  a  important
[46:40] topic  for  young  men  something  that  a  lot 
 of  us  have  struggled  with  we  have  an
[46:45] innate  desire  to  be  loved  we  want  to  be 
 loved  it  shouldn't  be  this  hard  but
[46:51] modern  society  has  made  it  this  way 
 social  media  and  online  dating  is 
 fiercely  competitive  you're  going
[46:58] against  every  guy  in  a  30  40  50  mile 
 radius  this  is  why  i  suggest  to
[47:03] drastically  lower  your  social  media  use 
 and  if  you  want  a  girlfriend  to  start
[47:08] approaching  in  person  that  is  the  most 
 natural  the  most  respectable  way  to  meet
[47:13] someone  and  it's  the  way  that  makes  you 
 stick  out  because  it  is  terrifying  it  is 
 scary  it's  challenging  and  people
[47:19] respect  that  people  admire  that 
 confidence  there  will  be  someone  who
[47:24] laughs  at  you  there  will  be  someone  who 
 thinks  is  weird  and  funny  and  whatever 
 but  i'm  willing  to  bet  the  type  of  woman
[47:29] you  want  to  meet  you  actually  want  her 
 to  be  more  receptive  to  an  in-person
[47:34] friendly  approach  compared  to  meeting 
 someone  on  tinder  or  on  an  instagram  dm
[47:39] on  the  topic  of  romantic  relationships 
 comes  a  bunch  of  different  online 
 communities  that  we  as  young  men  have
[47:45] invested  into 
 specifically  in-cell 
 involuntary  celibates  and  black  pill  are
[47:53] the  ones  that  i 
 very  very  much  disagree  with  these  are 
 essentially  like
[47:58] the  loser  mentality  oh  it  doesn't  work 
 for  us  so  we're  going  to  give  up  and  the
[48:03] rest  of  the  world  is  wrong  we  are  kind 
 of  right  i  can  understand  why  a  young
[48:09] man  watching  this  could  be  subscribed  to 
 this  in-cell  or  black  pill  or  whatever
[48:14] words  they  use  why  not  just  make  your 
 life  as  best  as  possible  if  there  are 
 people  with  the  same  insecurities  as  you
[48:20] still  achieving  the  things  that  you  want 
 then  it's  all  a  mentality  it's  all  about
[48:25] how  much  work  you've  put  in 
 i  found  that  there's  no  hard-working
[48:30] person  in  these  type  of  groups  they're 
 just  defeatists 
 oh  like  i'm  not  getting  everything
[48:35] handed  to  me  so  there's  no  chance 
 which  is  bs  we  know  that  if  you  work
[48:40] hard  you  can  literally  achieve  anything 
 in  this  world  capitalism  has  made  it
[48:45] that  way  whether  or  not  you  agree  with 
 it  you  can  become  a  millionaire  you  can 
 become
[48:50] at  least  an  8  out  of  10  in  physical 
 attractiveness  if  we're  going  to  use 
 this  numbers  you  can  maybe  your
[48:56] face  is  ugly 
 but  you  can  still  go  and  achieve  a  10 
 out  of  10  model  body  and  i'm  sure  that
[49:02] if  you  had  that  type  of  body  you  would 
 be  more  physically  attractive  than  you 
 currently  are  so  what's  with  this 
 defeatist  mentality  and  so  really  if  you
[49:09] find  yourself  struggling  to  get  romance 
 in  your  life  which  so  many  young  guys 
 are  consider  investing  into  the  previous
[49:16] five  chapters 
 they  will  make  your  life  so  much  better 
 they  will  make  you  more  attractive  more
[49:21] confident  really  to  get  a  girl 
 one  of  the  biggest  things  you  need  is 
 high  self-esteem
[49:27] and  if  you  struggle  with  women  it's 
 because  you  have  low  self-esteem  and 
 that's  because  you  haven't  done  much  in
[49:33] life  yet  and  you  want  the  reward  without 
 putting  in  the  work
[49:38] you  build  your  self-esteem  by  doing 
 things  by  having  self-love  for  the 
 delayed  classification  activities  commit
[49:43] to  the  previous  five  chapters  and  i'm 
 sure  you  will  find  it  significantly 
 easier  and  more  natural  to  get  more
[49:51] romantic  relationships  in  your  life  and 
 i  want  to  remind  you
[49:56] social  skills  are  a  skill  i  want  to  keep 
 drilling  in  this  idea  of  this  video  game 
 skill  that  we  can  level  this  up  we  can
[50:03] get  xp  in  the  skills  that  i've  mentioned 
 in  this  video  through  just  doing  the 
 actions  doing  the  grind  and  you  get  xp
[50:10] in  your  social  skills  by  practicing  by 
 reading  material  like  this  maybe  there's
[50:15] other  stuff  online  but  this  is  the  one  i 
 personally  recommend  reading  it  trying
[50:20] it  making  notes  and  then  going  outside 
 and  actually  testing  it  you  just  have  to 
 put  in  the  work  first  you  can't  be  a
[50:26] level  one  and  then  be  angry  that  you're 
 not  a  level  10  in  a  game  without 
 actually  doing  the  actions  that  makes
[50:32] you  into  a  level  10.  that's  just  weird 
 you  can't  expect  a  higher  level  without
[50:37] getting  the  xp 
 and  too  many  young  guys  seem  to  struggle 
 with  this  concept  so  that's  why  i've
[50:42] been  trying  to  drill  it  into  this  video 
 that  real  life  is  very  similar  to  these 
 games  that  you  have  to  put  in  the  work
[50:47] you  have  to  get  the  xp  and  then  your 
 level  goes  up  don't  expect  your  level  to 
 go  up  without  actually  getting  the  xp
[50:53] chapter  seven 
 purpose 
 this  may  be  one  of  the  most  important
[50:58] things  in  your  life 
 i  am  very  grateful 
 to  have  realized
[51:03] identified  and  defined  my  purpose 
 recently
[51:08] my  purpose  is  to  help  young  men  improve 
 their  physical  and  mental  health  when
[51:13] you  can  define  your  purpose  so 
 straightforward  like  that
[51:18] it's  it  changes  your  life 
 it  gives  you  a  reason  to  wake  up  it 
 gives  you  a  reason  to  go  to  bed  to  rest
[51:25] i've  only  just  recently  gotten  into  this 
 idea  of  defining  my  purpose  and 
 there's  been  a  very  big  difference  in  my
[51:31] life  due  to  this  so  i  want  you  guys  to 
 be  able  to  experience  the  same  thing  the
[51:36] best  advice  that  i  could  give  you  right 
 now 
 is  to  cut  out  the  distractions  if  you
[51:41] don't  know  what  your  purpose  is  and  you 
 haven't  been  able  to  think  of  one 
 i  am  sure  that  that  is  because  you  are
[51:48] spending  all  of  your  time  distracted 
 to  be  able  to  think  about  these  this  is 
 a  big  philosophical  topic  to  be  able  to
[51:55] think  and  actually  have  this  defined 
 purpose  you  must  allow  yourself  to  think
[52:00] distraction  free  how  many  hours  are  you 
 spending  sitting  there  thinking  about 
 this
[52:06] zero  because  what  you're  actually  doing 
 is  thinking  about  this  while  scrolling 
 on  instagram  whilst  on  reddit  whilst
[52:11] watching  self-improvement  videos  if  you 
 want  to  be  able  to  define  your  purpose
[52:16] here's  the  action  step  take  some  time 
 minutes  hours  days  weeks
[52:21] with  not  even  a  screen  in  front  of  you 
 no  distractions  in  front  of  you  and 
 think  about  this
[52:27] that  is  the  first  big  step  you  cannot 
 have  a  defined  purpose  if  you  are
[52:32] distracted  you  can't  think  these  type  of 
 in-depth 
 thoughts 
 if  you  are  scrolling  on  instagram  what
[52:38] you  need  to  do  practically  is  take  away 
 every  screen  sit  there  with  nothing  in 
 front  of  you  apart  from  a  piece  of  paper
[52:44] and  a  pen 
 that  is  how  you  will  come  to  find  your 
 purpose  there  are  also  some  cues  that  i
[52:49] can  tell  you  that  will  help  here  are 
 seven  questions  to  ask  yourself  i  found 
 these  questions  from  a  course  on  purpose
[52:56] it's  on  the  website  coursera  so  i  will 
 link  that  below  and  if  you  go  through 
 this  course  i  am  pretty  sure  that  you
[53:01] will  have  a  defined  purpose  very  soon 
 but  one  of  the  first  exercises  he
[53:06] instructs  you  to  do  is  to  go  through 
 these  seven  questions
[53:11] for  example  the  first  question  what 
 matters  most  here's  my  answer  what
[53:16] matters  most 
 happiness  coupled  with  longevity  safety
[53:21] health 
 in  other  words  mental  and  physical 
 health  happiness  is  a  byproduct  of  good
[53:27] mental  health 
 i  think  fulfillment  relationships  are 
 very  important  but  these  come  after  good
[53:33] physical  and  mental  health  so  what 
 matters  most  is  physical  and  mental 
 health  that  makes  me  feel  amazing
[53:40] i'm  teaching  as  important  knowledge  as 
 they  can  be 
 you  can  see  how  in  the  first  question  i
[53:45] have  already  solidified  my  idea  that 
 this  what  i'm  doing  right  now  when  i'm
[53:50] talking  to  you  this  is  my  purpose  that 
 in  my  opinion  there's  nothing  more 
 important  than  physical  and  mental
[53:55] health  if  you  don't  have  health  you 
 don't  have  anything  else  and  if  this  is
[54:00] what  i'm  teaching  to  people  hopefully 
 you  can  see  some  kind  of  like  link  here 
 of  why  i  feel  so  happy  and  fulfilled  in
[54:06] the  last  few  months  since  i  have  found 
 this  purpose  this  outlet  for  me  to  help
[54:11] people  improve  their  physical  and  mental 
 health  find  your  purpose  and  your  life 
 will  just  seem  so  much  more  fulfilling
[54:18] and 
 if  you  can  create  or  find  a  purpose  that 
 is  bigger  than  yourself  which  i  would
[54:23] recommend  that  your  purpose  should  be 
 something  bigger  than  you  because  then 
 it  just  grounds  you  more  it  makes  you
[54:29] needed 
 it  makes  you  appreciate  it  it  links  you 
 socially  and  romantically  with  other
[54:35] people 
 it  makes  other  people  grateful  for  you 
 which  is  a  fantastic  feeling
[54:41] and 
 and  in  this  day  and  age 
 this  is  kind  of  related  to  purpose
[54:46] because 
 our  modern  society  isn't  so  great  in  the 
 sense  that  we  are  so
[54:53] focused  on  money  and  needing  to  work 
 shitty  jobs  and  that  essentially 
 distracts  you  away  from  your  purpose  and
[54:59] that  is  why  i  would  say  99  of 
 i  was  going  to  say  young  people  but  i 
 think  99  of  people  do  not  have  a  clear
[55:05] purpose  because  they  spend  all  their 
 time  in  work  which  is  obviously  not
[55:10] their  purpose  the  internet  has  equalized 
 a  lot  of  stuff
[55:15] no  matter  what  your  purpose  is 
 it's  very  likely  that
[55:20] you  will  be  able  to  make  a  living  from 
 your  purpose 
 if  you  just  have  some  kind  of
[55:25] entrepreneurial  mindset 
 it  all  starts  with  giving  away  free 
 value  if  your  purpose  is  something  to  do
[55:31] with  helping  people  say  your  purpose  is 
 similar  to  mine  wanting  to  be  some  kind 
 of  coach  some  kind  of  mentor  to  help
[55:37] people  online  you  have  to  start  by 
 giving  free  value 
 you  have  to  start  it's  consistency  over
[55:43] intensity  your  first  platform  that  you 
 make  videos  on  or  content  on  it's  going
[55:48] to  be 
 subpar 
 if  you  are  unwilling  to  accept  that  you 
 will  never  start  if  you  want  if  you  want
[55:55] your  first  workout  ever  in  the  gym  to  be 
 as  good  as  mine  are  six  years  in  you
[56:00] will  never  start  you  have  to  start  with 
 a  beginner's  routine  a  beginner's 
 workout  and  then  you  also  have  to  start
[56:06] with  like  a  beginner's  production 
 quality  low  level  youtube  video  content
[56:11] if  you're  scared  of  that  you  will  not 
 start 
 start  with  giving  free  value  let  me  just
[56:17] repeat 
 if  you  do  not  know  your  purpose  it  is 
 worth  finding  it  and  it's  not  difficult
[56:24] to  find  it 
 it  just  requires  intention  it  requires 
 time  and  effort  time  and  effort  away
[56:30] from  these  screens 
 so  with  that  i  will  close  off  this 
 youtube  video  and  the  last  actionable
[56:35] step  is  for  you  to  just  spend  a  few 
 minutes  with  nothing  else  in  front  of 
 you  turn  the  screen  off  on  your  phone
[56:41] turn  the  screen  off  on  your  computer  and 
 just  think 
 what  do  i  want  for  the  rest  of  my  life
[56:48] what  is  the  end  goal 
 if  i  was  given  more  money  than  i  ever 
 needed
[56:53] what  would  i  be  doing 
 for  me  i  wanted  to  be  traveling  and  then
[57:00] i  think  a  lot  of  us  would  still  be 
 wanting  some  kind  of  project  to  work  on 
 it's  just  something  to  grow  something
[57:06] more  fun  and  for  me  that  was  always 
 going  to  be  a  youtube  channel  i  wanted 
 to  travel  and  just  speak  my  mind  to  the
[57:11] camera 
 and  now  i've  found  such  a  purpose  that 
 actually  helps  other  people
[57:17] if  i  won  10  million  pounds  if  i  never 
 needed  money  again 
 my  life  would  not  change
[57:26] that's  how  you  know  you  found  the  right 
 purpose 
 oh 
 that  was  a  good  sentence
[57:33] all  right  so  before  i  leave  i'm  gonna  do 
 some  plugs  for  my  own  extra  stuff  that  i
[57:38] offer 
 so  if  you've  watched  this  far 
 i'm  grateful
[57:43] i  really  hope  that  you've  been  taking 
 the  actionable  steps  so  far 
 if  you've  watched  this  far  i  think  you
[57:48] would  have  if  there's  anyone  who  has 
 watched  this  far  and  you  have  not  taken 
 the  actionable  steps
[57:54] i  would  recommend  doing  them  if  you 
 watch  this  far  then  this  is  definitely  a 
 topic  that  you're  interested  in  you  want
[57:59] to  improve  your  life  maybe  you've  just 
 not  been 
 so  successful  with  it  so  far
[58:06] this  video  i've  made  is  kind  of  like  a 
 blanket  statement  to  help  young  men 
 everywhere  but  obviously  we're  not
[58:12] really  diving  deep  into  your  exact 
 situation  there's  certain
[58:17] environmental  factors  and  thought 
 processes  that  you  are  having  that  i 
 can't  identify  without  being  able  to
[58:22] speak  to  you  directly  so  far  i'm  seeing 
 quite  a  lot  of  trends  the  same  pattern
[58:27] of  behavior  i've  been  offering  my 
 personal  development  coaching  and  one  of 
 the  things  i've  noticed  to  be  a  huge
[58:33] positive  impact  on  the  guys  that  i've 
 been  helping  is  a  morning  workout  it 
 seems  to  be  the  case  that  when  we  as  men
[58:40] wake  up  early  and  go  and  exercise  we 
 conquer  our  minds  we  conquer  our  bodies 
 even  if  we  don't  want  to  go  even  if  it's
[58:46] raining  outside  it's  still  dark  outside 
 in  the  morning  when  we  accomplish  this
[58:51] it  seems  to  be  the  case  that  the  rest  of 
 the  day  goes  by  so  well
[58:57] it  also  seems  to  be  the  case 
 unfortunately  that  the  opposite  of  that 
 is  true  that  when  we  start  our  mornings
[59:02] off  wrong  when  we  wake  up  late  so  far 
 all  three  clients  i've  had  have  stated
[59:07] this  the  day  that  they  woke  up  a little 
 bit  late  they'll  miss  that  morning 
 workout  the  rest  of  the  day  was  a 
 write-off  the  rest  of  the  day  wasn't  as
[59:14] effective  as  they  wanted  to  be  and  they 
 were  left  feeling  negative  i'm  seeing 
 very  similar  patterns  of  behavior  that  i
[59:20] think  you  may  be  feeling 
 this 
 great  performance  for  one  two  three  days
[59:27] in  a  row  max  the  fourth  day  or  close 
 enough  is  the  day  that  it  just  comes 
 crashing  down  they  do  the  exact  opposite
[59:33] of  what  they've  been  working  for 
 the  nofap  streak  breaks  the  binge  eating
[59:39] disorder  comes  out 
 hours  spent  on  instagram  video  games  the 
 help  that  i've  been  giving  to  the  guys
[59:45] that  i've  been  coaching  seems  to  be 
 very  great  all  of  them  have  said  that
[59:50] it's  helped  a  lot  having  me  as  their 
 coach  going  on  to  one-to-one  video  calls 
 with  me  if  you  want  me  to  be  your
[59:56] personal  development  coach  going  on  to 
 one-to-one  video  calls  then  the  fiver 
 link  is  also  below  it's  very  interesting
[60:01] what  i've  noticed  with  my  clients  they 
 are  all  probably  like  you  young  men  in 
 their  twenties
[60:07] trying  to  get  their  together 
 they  seem  to  be  going  through  the  same 
 struggles  and  the  same
[60:12] accomplishments  and  that  morning  workout 
 seems  to  be  the  key  to  setting  them  up
[60:17] for  a  great  day  physically  and  mentally
[60:22] that  gave  me  the  inspiration  to  make  an 
 email  newsletter  something  i  didn't  ever 
 think  i  would  be  doing  but  i  made  an
[60:27] email  newsletter  just  called  rise  and 
 shine  powerful  morning  motivation  i
[60:33] don't  know  exactly  what  it's  going  to  be 
 if  you  do  want  an  email  from  me  in  the 
 morning  it  won't  be  like  every  morning
[60:38] it  might  be  like  a  couple  in  the  week 
 where  i'll  be  just  saying  something 
 that's  on  my  mind  when  i  go  to  the  gym
[60:45] something  that  will  make  you  feel 
 masculine  and  like  you're  ready  to 
 accomplish  the  day  then  the  email
[60:50] newsletter  link  will  be  below  boys
[60:55] the  grind  is  worth  it 
 if  the  only  time  you  feel
[61:01] satisfied 
 is  when  you're  over  indulging  on  instant 
 gratification  like  netflix  video  games
[61:07] junk  food  porn 
 and  as  soon  as  you  stop  doing  those 
 things  you  just  feel
[61:13] not  good  to  be  you 
 i  completely  understand  that
[61:19] it's  through  these  previous  chapters 
 that  i've  just  mentioned  through  these 
 actionable  steps  this  behavior  this
[61:24] mindset  that  i've  been  trying  to  drill 
 into  you  in  this  video 
 that  this  all  changes
[61:30] that  even  without  instant  gratification 
 with  nothing  else  around  me  i  am  happy
[61:36] and  i  am  not  special  i  am  not  inherently 
 better  or  harder  working  than  anyone
[61:41] else  if  anything  i  am  lazy  i  am  such  a 
 lazy  guy  i  almost  failed  in  school  and
[61:47] in  uni  i  pretty  much  did  fail  in 
 university  but  that's  a  completely 
 separate  thing  i  am  not  any  more  harder
[61:53] working  than  you  and  so  i  hope  to  set  a 
 good  example  for  you  guys  to  show  you 
 that  this
[61:58] doesn't  require  you  to  be  special 
 the  biggest  thing  that  you  could 
 probably  learn  from  all  of  this  video
[62:04] and  everything  i  teach  is  just 
 consistency 
 it's  just  finding  the  right  type  of
[62:10] behavior  so  going  to  the  gym  practicing 
 mindfulness  and  gratitude  and  just 
 trying  to  do  it  as  often  as  you  can
[62:17] not  as  intense  as  you  can  as  often  as 
 you  can 
 aim  for  every  day  aim  for  every  single
[62:23] day  and  you  will  still  miss 
 two  three  four  days  a  week
[62:28] but  it's  those  three  days  that  you  did 
 do  it  that  will  turn  into  four  and  then 
 that  will  turn  into  five  and  maybe  five
[62:34] years  later 
 i'm  six  years  into  weightlifting  and 
 only  recently  have  i  been  training  six
[62:39] days  a  week  without  missing  a  single 
 extra  day  don't  expect  these  results  to 
 come  quick  and  don't  expect  your
[62:44] behavior  to  be  perfect  just  try  to  be  as 
 consistent  as  you  can  with  everything 
 that  i've  taught  here
[62:50] try  to  make  it  a  daily  thing  and  you'll 
 be  you'll  be  finding  that  you  miss  half 
 of  the  days  but  that's  okay  because
[62:56] you're  a  beginner  the  beginner  is  not 
 supposed  to  have  great  performance 
 the  whole  point  is  consistency  one  of
[63:02] the  biggest  things  that  people  don't 
 mention  is  that  the  overlying  theme  of 
 consistency  is  don't  quit
[63:09] that's  the  one  thing  that  those 
 motivational  youtube  videos  and  you  know 
 those  i'm  a  hard  guy  and  oh  you  gotta
[63:15] want  it  as  much  as  you  want  to  breathe 
 type  of  videos  that's  the  one  thing  that 
 they  get  right
[63:20] do  not  quit  and  you  will  hit  that  goal 
 do  not  quit  and  you  will  become 
 successful  do  not  quit  and  you  will
[63:26] build  that  10  out  of  10  physique 
 probably  the  most  important  thing  that
[63:31] i've  learned  in  the  last  six  years  of  my 
 self-improvement 
 do  not  quit
[63:37] trust  the  process 
 the  j-curve  of  results  where  the  results 
 just  pop  up
[63:42] the  j-curve  will  approach  you  sooner 
 than  you  think 
 and  as  soon  as  you  start  seeing  the
[63:47] results  the  motivation  just  flies  in 
 but  you  just  cannot  quit  and  so
[63:54] how  you  don't  quit  is  by  actually  making 
 all  of  this  enjoyable  it's  by  having  a 
 massive  interest  in  all  of  this  stuff
[64:00] that's  why  i  kept  on  saying  get  addicted 
 to  it  get  obsessed  with  this  get 
 addicted  to  improving  your  mental  health
[64:05] make  it  like  such  an  important  goal 
 important  thought  process  for  yourself 
 make  it  your  phone  wallpaper  tell  people
[64:11] about  it  you  get  addicted  to  this  stuff 
 you're  less  likely  to  quit 
 if  you  just  don't  quit  and  you  do  the
[64:17] bare  minimum  you  just  show  up 
 you  will  make 
 fantastic  progress
[64:25] and  when  you  make  progress  in  the  things 
 that  i've  been  teaching  today 
 that's  what  makes  life  worth  living  if
[64:31] you  think  you  benefited  a  lot  from  this 
 video 
 save  it  to  your  watch  later  like  it  find
[64:37] a  way  that  you  can  save  this  so  that 
 maybe  you'll  remember  to  come  back  here
[64:42] in  a  week  or  one  month  or  five  months  or 
 two  years  time 
 it's  always  good  to  just  recap  on
[64:48] information  that  you've  learned  you  can 
 help  my  youtube  success  by  doing  the 
 usual  liking  and  commenting  i  hate
[64:53] saying  this  stuff  but  youtube  is  this

[00:28] root  cause  of  memory  loss  and  dementia 
 and  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  aging 
 genetics  or  plaques  instead  Dr  Sam
[00:36] Walters  discovered  that  memory  loss  is 
 in  fact  caused  by  the  consumption  of 
 five  neurotoxic  chemicals  used
[00:42] extensively  within  the  American  food 
 industry  these  neurotoxic  chemicals 
 create  a  brain  rot  that  alters  your

WH4zdjf9Pdw,"[00:00] perhaps  you  know  a  guy  just  like  Jeffrey 
 or  maybe  you'll  like  him  yourself  you
[00:05] see  Jeffries  are  all  around  the  world 
 and  they  do  everything  wrong  they  keep 
 indulging  in  all  of  the  habits  that  are
[00:11] mentally  destroying  them  just  for  a 
 little  bit  of  pleasure  after  hours  and
[00:16] hours  and  hours  of  sitting  on  his  crusty 
 computer  chair  finally  Jeffrey  gets  up 
 okay  good  he's  gonna  do  something
[00:21] productive  now  no  Jeffrey  oh  he  just 
 laid  down  on  his  bed  and  went  on  his
[00:26] phone 
 honest
[00:31] only  a  select  few  men  on  the  entire 
 planet  are  like  Adonis  disciplined  with
[00:36] a  student  mindset  present  and  grateful 
 and  a  leader  how  do  you  think  he  got 
 this  way  do  you  think  that  Adonis
[00:41] indulged  in  the  same  habits  that  Jeffrey 
 did  of  course  not  now  Adonis  has  made 
 some  mistakes  but  he  overcame  them  once
[00:48] he  knew  that  a  habit  wasn't  good  for  him 
 he  vowed  to  stop  and  that  is  how  he 
 became  so  great  do  you  have  bad  habits
[00:55] in  this  video  we're  gonna  break  down  the 
 worst  ones  that  you  could  have  and  I 
 want  you  to  do  something  I  want  you  to 
 count  how  many  of  the  five  that  we're
[01:00] going  to  discuss  today  that  you 
 currently  are  over  indulging  in  the 
 first  and  worst  habit  by  far  is  porn  now
[01:06] I  don't  want  to  make  this  another  basic 
 self-improvement  video  where  we  just 
 talk  about  poem  but  holy  [ __ ]  it  is 
 literally  the  worst  thing  that  you  can
[01:11] be  doing  as  a  young  man  watching  porn 
 and  masturbating  literally  means  that 
 you're  castrating  yourself  if  you've
[01:16] ever  seen  what  happens  when  a  family 
 buys  a  pet  like  a  cat  or  a  dog  and  that 
 Catholic  really  adventurous  isn't  it  if
[01:22] it's  a  male  it's  like  really  adventurous 
 really  like  Territorial  and  then  what 
 does  that  family  do  once  they  have  this 
 pet  they're  new  to  it  they  castrated  it
[01:29] in  simple  terms  they  chop  off  it  balls 
 it  stops  this  testosterone  production 
 and  suddenly  The  Adventurous  feisty
[01:35] territorial  cat  becomes  docile  weak  lazy 
 lethargic  and  that  is  what  we're  doing
[01:40] to  ourselves  when  we  over  indulge  in 
 things  like  porn  now  you  already  know 
 about  almost  all  of  the  negatives  of
[01:45] porn  so  I  don't  want  to  just  repeat  them 
 but  there  is  a  huge  negative  that  most 
 YouTubers  never  actually  speak  about
[01:50] because  it's  going  to  get  kind  of  like 
 vulgar  and  it's  the  issue  that  watching 
 porn  destroys  your  understanding  and
[01:56] capability  to  actually  sleep  with  a  girl 
 properly  Pawn  gave  me  small  dick  anxiety
[02:01] like  I  started  watching  you  when  I  was 
 13  14  years  old  and  I  hadn't  hit  puberty 
 yet  so  my  dick  it  wasn't  big  you  know
[02:07] did  you  like  essentially  still  a  child 
 at  this  point  you  know  I  hadn't  hit 
 puberty  I  remember  watching  it  with 
 these  big  [ __ ]  like  logs  that  these
[02:13] porn  stars  had  and  I  honestly  yeah  this 
 is  funny  he  like  homes  like  this  was  a 
 while  ago  right  this  was  over  10  years
[02:18] ago  but  honestly  this  isn't  a  funny 
 thing  because  this  [ __ ]  me  this 
 literally  [ __ ]  me  up  mentally  like
[02:23] this  was  one  of  the  worst  problems  that 
 I  had  as  a  teenager  I  was  totally 
 convinced  that  I  had  a  small  dick
[02:28] because  of  what  I  saw  on  these  videos  oh 
 [ __ ]  remember  neurotically  like  Googling 
 this  [ __ ]  like  what's  the  average  penis
[02:33] size  that  goes  well  how  big  should  my 
 penis  be  over  a  small  penis  what  to  do  I 
 remember  one  of  my  friends  got  a 
 girlfriend  and  I  literally  asked  him  oh
[02:39] if  she  wanted  to  like  have  sex  with  you 
 like  suck  your  dick  or  would  you  let  her 
 anyway  like  yeah  of  course  and  I 
 literally  had  this  perception  that  like
[02:44] oh  if  I  got  a  girlfriend  right  now  I 
 would  tell  her  like  no  like  I  don't  want 
 to  have  sex  or  anything  because  I  was  so 
 insecure  about  my  PP  size  and  the  second
[02:50] problem  that  I  had  relating  to  this  was 
 that  watching  so  much  porn  gave  my  mind 
 a  kind  of  false  understanding  of  how  you
[02:57] proceed  you  know  you  escalate  to  sex  so 
 on  point  you  always  watches  the  same 
 routine  the  guy  and  a  girl  start  kissing
[03:02] and  they  start  undressing  then  they  do 
 some  foreplay  then  they  you  know  have 
 like  actual  sex  like  this  fake  like 
 staged  performance  and  so  I  followed  the
[03:09] same  kind  of  routine  when  I  actually 
 like  you  know  became  like  sexually 
 active  and  honestly  I  like  I  didn't  have 
 a  good  time  this  was  the  only  way  that  I
[03:15] knew  right  so  that  you  know  you're  like 
 you  you  do  this  whole  step-by-step 
 routine  like  this  pattern  of  like  okay 
 do  this  like  you  know  pull  up  the
[03:20] trousers  like  the  essentially  I  just 
 became  robotic  when  I  when  it  came  to 
 actually  making  love  for  the  first  time
[03:25] and  I  didn't  actually  have  a  good  time 
 honestly  I  started  having  sex  at  age  19 
 and  I  didn't  enjoy  it  for  almost  a  year
[03:31] streets  because  of  the  [ __ ]  up 
 perception  of  sex  and  like  making  love 
 that  I  saw  and  watching  porn  and  the
[03:36] reason  why  this  perception's  so  messed 
 up you  know  of  like  you  know  you're 
 watching  hundreds  of  episodes  of  like 
 fake  taxi  or  some  [ __ ]  the  reason  why
[03:41] this  perception  is  like  so  messed  up  and 
 you  see  this  kind  of  like  build  up  and 
 this  you  know  this  routine  that  you  keep
[03:46] seeing  okay  you're  supposed  to  go  down 
 on  them  and  then  she's  like  shoot  off 
 and  then  you're  supposed  to  take  her 
 clothes  off  and  you  know  like  your 
 step-by-step  procedure  of  this  routine
[03:51] right  the  reason  why  this  [ __ ]  me  up 
 so  much  is  because  I  was  then  not  even 
 present  when  it  came  to  being  intimate
[03:56] with  a  girl  I  was  so  utterly  in  my  mind 
 overthinking  about  what  the  next  step 
 was  that  I  wasn't  even  having  a  good
[04:02] time  and  guess  what  happens  when  you're 
 not  present  when  you're  about  to  have 
 sex  with  a  girl  my  dick  didn't  get  hard 
 I  suffered  immensely  from  this  for  my
[04:08] first  year  of  being  sexually  active  and 
 I  was  like  I'm  not  gonna  lie  like  I  was 
 a  bit  of  a  [ __ ]  boy  I  was  like  on  Tinder
[04:13] all  the  time  I  was  going  to  clubs  and 
 stuff  right  more  than  10  girls  that  I 
 had  brought  back  to  my  place  I'd  done
[04:18] all  the  hard  work  I  brought  them  here 
 more  than  10  girls  where  I  would 
 literally  pull  my  pants  out  soft  dick
[04:23] unable  to  perform  there's  gonna  be  some 
 heartless  [ __ ]  watching  this 
 like  oh  yeah  that's  kind  of  funny  bro 
 you  don't  realize  how  much  that  [ __ ]
[04:28] your  mind  up  as  a  man  how  much  that 
 mentally  destroys  you  and  why  do  you 
 think  it  happened  it  was  because  I  was
[04:33] watching  porn  for  like  10  years  straight 
 before  this  this  is  why  I've  made  a 
 private  video  going  into  detail  of  like
[04:39] the  mistakes  that  I  made  when  I  first 
 started  like  sleeping  with  girls  I've 
 made  a  private  on  YouTube  because  it's
[04:44] too  like  vulgar  to  speak  in  detail 
 there's  a  link  to  it  in  the  description 
 three  bedroom  mistakes  that  you're 
 making  so  you  can  go  click  on  that  the
[04:50] second  dangerous  habit  that  will  destroy 
 you  is  being  too  emotional  as  a  man  I 
 say  this  in  a  lot  of  videos  but  you  must
[04:56] understand  that  you  know  this  this  new 
 narrative  that  you  keep  hearing  that  men 
 should  open  up  and  be  emotional  and  be
[05:02] in  touch  with  their  feminine  side  it's 
 pure  evil  there's  like  false  message 
 that  you  keep  hearing  that  you  should
[05:08] open  up  your  feminine  side  that  you 
 should  be  emotional  it's  a  trap  it  is  a 
 trap  I'm  not  trying  to  be  toxically
[05:13] masculine  and  tell  you  like  yeah  bottle 
 up  your  feelings  and  eventually  kill 
 yourself  of  course  not  you  know  these 
 people  they  say  that  to  me  like  oh  yeah
[05:18] well  how  the  [ __ ]  am  I  like  the  scene  is 
 the  bad  guy  when  I  tell  guys  like  yeah 
 like  control  your  emotions  research
[05:24] stoicism  emotional  stability  it's  the 
 best  asset  that  you  can  have  I  literally 
 I'm  live  streaming  right  now  I  literally
[05:29] just  told  all  the  boys  what  happened 
 when  our  business  I  suffered  like  this 
 huge  like  problem  we  lost  half  of  our
[05:34] income  instantly  because  of  a  different 
 company  called  skillshare  that  called  us 
 like  toxically  masculine  they  canceled
[05:39] us  25  000  pounds  a  month  they  took  that 
 away  from  us  and  they  wanted  me  to  be 
 emotional  they  wanted  me  to  beg  and
[05:45] plead  like  please  can  I  just  have  the 
 money  please  with  stoicism  with 
 emotional  control  and  navigating  that 
 situation  and  we  prospered  from  that
[05:51] moment  they  don't  want  you  to  be  like 
 this  I  don't  understand  why  I  don't 
 understand  why  your  own  country  and  your
[05:56] own  people  want  you  to  be  weak  emotional 
 men  are  weak  now  this  does  not  mean  you
[06:01] should  bottle  up  your  feelings  that 
 eventually  the  point  that  you  can't  hold 
 anymore  there  is  one  person  that  you  can
[06:06] be  emotional  to  and  that  is  your  chosen 
 brother  I  don't  necessarily  mean  your 
 blood  brother  like  you  know  who  was  born
[06:12] from  your  parents  I  mean  another  man 
 that  you  have  chosen  to  grow  with  who 
 you  utterly  trust  there's  a  metric  like
[06:18] a  question  to  ask  yourself  I  got  from 
 the  YouTuber  and  entrepreneur  Alexa 
 Mosey  to  ask  yourself  if  this  is  a  real
[06:23] friend  it's  a  weird  example  but  and 
 hopefully  it  doesn't  sound  like 
 offensive  but  this  is  what  this 
 entrepreneur  said  if  you  were  Jewish  and
[06:29] this  was  back  in  the  Holocaust  what  did 
 this  guy  that  you  consider  your  friend 
 your  brother  would  he  hide  you  from  the
[06:34] Nazis  knowing  that  he  would  also  be 
 killed  if  he  like  was  found  out  that's 
 the  metric  that  my  best  friend  My
[06:39] Brother  Sam  has  like  asked  himself  about 
 me  like  if  he  was  Jewish  and  the  Nazis 
 were  coming  to  try  and  find  it  would  I
[06:44] hide  him  yes  that's  the  kind  of  metric 
 that  you'll  know  that  oh  [ __ ]  it  this  is 
 like  a  guy  that  I  can  trust  that's  the
[06:49] guy  that  you  can  be  emotional  to  that's 
 the  guy  that  you  can  cry  in  front  of 
 that's  the  guy  that  you  could  open  up 
 with  the  evil  propaganda  that's  being
[06:55] spread  to  young  men  these  days  and 
 telling  you  to  open  up  to  your 
 girlfriends  people  don't  realize  how
[07:00] [ __ ]  evil  that  is  bro  and  I  seem  like 
 a  bad  guy  for  saying  this  I  seem  really 
 toxically  masculine  for  telling  you  not 
 to  open  up  bro  if  you  open  up  to  your
[07:06] girlfriend  her  sexual  attraction  to  you 
 is  going  to  be  lost  because  if  she  is  a 
 feminine  woman  and  we  can't  blame  her
[07:11] for  this  but  if  she  is  feminine  she 
 cannot  be  attracted  to  a  masculine  man 
 who  has  just  suddenly  lost  friend  and
[07:16] become  feminine  if  she's  a  feminine 
 woman  right  if  she's  really  masculine 
 and  she's  very  dominant  to  herself  then 
 she  expects  you  to  be  weak  and  feminine
[07:22] okay  fine  but  if  she's  a  feminine  woman 
 and  you're  a  masculine  man  by  you  losing 
 Friend  by  you  getting  emotional  you  have 
 shown  that  you're  a  weak  feminine  women
[07:28] are  only  attracted  to  men  who  are  like 
 stoic  cold  rocks  even  though  they  don't 
 want  to  admit  this  a  lot  of  women  will
[07:33] tell  you  oh  I'm  not  attracted  to  this  I 
 love  it  when  my  partner  opens  up  that 
 woman's  probably  a  lot  more  masculine 
 and  we  might  not  be  attracted  to  a  girl
[07:38] like  that  there  is  an  agenda  here  you 
 know  the  people  I'm  talking  about  those 
 kinds  of  people  the  skinny  neck  kind  of
[07:43] like  low  testosterone  kind  of  people 
 right  men  and  women  they're  against 
 people  like  us  and  especially  like  me
[07:48] you  know  who's  got  like  this  platform  or 
 for  telling  you  to  not  be  emotional 
 because  they  will  say  that  me  telling 
 you  to  be  stoic  is  toxic  masculinity  and
[07:54] it's  patriarchal  and  it  leads  to 
 suicides  that's  what  they  say  right  but 
 they  don't  realize  that  the  rise  of  this
[08:00] message  of  telling  men  to  open  up 
 perfectly  correlates  with  the  rise  of 
 male  suicides  less  men  killed  themselves
[08:06] when  we  were  masculine  less  men  kill 
 themselves  before  we  were  told  this 
 message  of  opening  up  and  being  feminine
[08:11] you  know  why  so  many  [ __ ]  guys  are 
 killing  themselves  because  they're 
 falling  for  this  this  trap  this  [ __ ]
[08:16] trick  they're  being  convinced  to  not  be 
 masculine  to  be  feminine  and  be  in  touch 
 with  your  emotions  it's  okay  to  be  weak
[08:21] it's  okay  to  be  like  to  cry  and  [ __ ] 
 they're  following  that  advice  and  then 
 realizing  oh  [ __ ]  women  don't  like  me
[08:26] anymore  oh  [ __ ]  I'm  lonely  as  [ __ ]  oh 
 [ __ ]  I'm  broke  as  [ __ ]  I'm  not  making 
 any  money  now  because  I'm  emotional  mind
[08:31] an  emotional  man  don't  make  much  money 
 the  rise  of  this  message  being  spread  to 
 men  perfectly  correlates  with  the  rise
[08:37] of  suicides  people  don't  realize  how 
 [ __ ]  manipulative  and  evil  this  is 
 that  I  am  seen  as  the  bad  guy  for
[08:42] telling  you  to  be  stoic  when  men  were 
 more  stoic  and  more  masculine  back  in 
 the  1900s  suicide  was  less  common  I  want
[08:48] you  to  just  picture  that  male  suicide  is 
 at  an  all-time  high  and  so  is  this 
 message  of  men  being  weak  men  should  be
[08:53] feminine  men  should  be  emotional  they 
 perfectly  correlate  together  and  these 
 evil  people  will  blame  us  and  say  it's
[08:59] the  patriarchy  these  people  are  killing 
 men  you  know  these  like  hip  socialist 
 type  of  like  diversity  type  of  people
[09:05] right  they're  leading  to  men  kill 
 themselves  and  they  will  say  that  the 
 problem  is  us  because  we  want  to
[09:10] research  stoicism  now  I've  just  spent 
 the  last  few  minutes  ranting  and  raving 
 about  how  the  system  and  you  know  most
[09:15] people  are  against  men  like  us  who  want 
 to  become  all  masculine  and  strong  and 
 it's  so  [ __ ]  weird  but  why  look  what
[09:20] I've  just  done  I  was  just  about  to  say 
 it's  so  weird  like  why  are  they  against 
 us  you  know  we  just  want  to  be  muscular 
 so  do  you  know  what  this  third  habit
[09:25] that  we're  going  to  discuss  is  being  a 
 victim  and  complaining  it's  so  easy  for 
 us  right  now  to  think  yeah  the  world
[09:30] against  us  and  like  yes  so  life's  so 
 hard  guys  did  you  want  an  easy  life  bro 
 of  course  you  didn't  because  I  mean  the
[09:36] opportunity  for  an  easy  life  is  right 
 here  isn't  it  go  uh  scroll  on  Tick  Tock 
 bro  if  you're  watching  this  video  you 
 don't  want  an  easy  life  following  on
[09:41] from  that  you  must  understand  that  you 
 can't  have  this  identity  of  a  victim 
 when  some  [ __ ]  happens  to  us  like  What's
[09:46] Happening  Here  I  told  you  about  that 
 story  of  like  the  company  skillshare 
 destroying  like  oh  half  of  our  income
[09:51] and  it's  a  whole  story  like  there's  a 
 community  post  on  our  channel  that  you 
 can  go  and  see  if  you  want  we  could  have
[09:56] been  the  victim  here  we  could  have  seen 
 ourselves  as  like  oh  you  know  poor  us 
 like  woe  is  me  that  wouldn't  have  helped
[10:01] us  this  thing  is  not  only  does  it  help 
 you  but  quite  frankly  yeah  you  could  say 
 this  is  toxically  masculine  but  quite 
 frankly  about  men  who  have  this  victim
[10:07] mentality  they're  [ __ ]  they're  not 
 helpful  at  all  I  sound  [ __ ]  horrible 
 because  this  is  so  against  the  modern 
 day  but  like  bro  men  who  have  this
[10:13] victim  feminine  weak  emotional  mentality 
 there's  no  good  to  having  them  around  as
[10:18] a  man  like  your  only  value  comes  in  your 
 strength  that's  it  that's  it  as  a  woman 
 you  know  like  we  don't  expect  most  women 
 to  be  strong  if  the  women  want  to  be
[10:24] masculine  and  disciplined  and  you  know 
 climb  up  the  career  hierarchy  okay  fine 
 nice  a  weak  woman  isn't  seen  as  a  bad
[10:29] thing  is  it  if  a  woman  is  weak 
 physically  and  you  know  straight  like 
 men  even  mentally  you  know  she  gets 
 emotional  like  we  still  love  her  for  it
[10:34] if  anything  that's  actually  kind  of 
 attractive  like  some  guys  might  not  be 
 because  some  a  lot  of  guys  are  quite 
 feminine  so  they  don't  want  a  feminine
[10:39] woman  but  if  you're  a  masculine  man  and 
 you  have  this  idea  of  like  an  emotional 
 woman  who  always  cries  it's  like  that's 
 why  I  wanted  in  my  life  because  she's 
 emotional  like  that's  that's  the  point  I
[10:45] have  a  [ __ ]  Stone  Cold  like  I 
 have  some  emotions  obviously  but  like  I 
 like  that  my  girl's  emotional  all  the
[10:50] time  I  like  that  every  like  three  days 
 she  feels  sad  like  because  it  just  gives 
 us  some  [ __ ]  to  do  bro  like  so  you  know
[10:55] a  woman  who's  emotional  who's  weak  and 
 who's  a  victim  okay  fine  as  masculine 
 men  will  look  after  her  a  woman  who's
[11:00] strong  sweet  okay  you'll  help  us  carry 
 the  weight  a  man  who's  strong  okay 
 fantastic  that's  the  best  thing  that  we 
 need  for  a  strong  Society  fine  but  a
[11:05] weak  man  a  man  who  sees  himself  as  the 
 victim  a  man  who  has  this  victim 
 mentality  what  good  is  he  honestly  you
[11:11] must  understand  this  as  a  manual  value 
 comes  from  your  strength  and  in  the 
 modern  day  again  another  thing  that's
[11:16] going  to  get  me  canceled  maybe  like  in 
 the  modern  day  bro  there's  so  many  like 
 groups  of  people  who  love  to  act  like
[11:21] they're  oppressed  people  of  of  my  race 
 and  like  this  might  get  me  hated  but  bro 
 you're  not  oppressed  anymore  I  don't
[11:26] know  how  much  I  can  talk  because 
 obviously  like  this  is  like  risk  of 
 getting  canceled  but  essentially  you 
 know  the  minority  kind  of  people  not
[11:31] just  like  the  skin  color  but  just  you 
 know  the  people  who  who  act  like  they're 
 oppressed  the  people  who  act  like 
 everything's  against  them  that  you  know
[11:37] like  oh  everyone's  like  racist 
 everyone's  sexist  everyone  wants  this 
 everyone's  this  everyone's  this  not 
 really  no  one  really  gives  a  [ __ ]  about
[11:42] you  and  I  don't  even  say  that  as  an 
 insult  no  one  really  thinks  about  you 
 everyone's  thinking  about themselves  if 
 you  think  you're  oppressed  by  someone
[11:47] bro  you're  not  this  is  why  I've  got 
 respect  for  men  like  Kanye  he's  actually 
 saying  to  black  people  to  rise  up  and
[11:52] ditch  this  victim  mentality  and  this 
 isn't  me  saying  it  like  you  know  I'm  not 
 part  of  this  race  okay  fine  but  it's 
 nice  seeing  a  man  who's  just  like  yeah
[11:57] take  ownership  like  your  life's  better 
 than  you  actually  realize  and  like  this 
 is  his  words  I'm  not  gonna  [ __ ]  say 
 it  because  oh  yeah  I'm  just  being  racist
[12:03] like  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  we  live  in 
 physically  the  best  time  possible  the 
 only  thing  that's  actually  negative
[12:08] right  now  is  just  our  own  mental  health 
 and  guess  why  your  mental  health  is  [ __ ] 
 it's  because  of  your  own  thoughts  and
[12:13] beliefs  about  what's  happening  to  you 
 you  know  there's  studies  to  prove  that 
 what  you  believe  deeply  changes  what
[12:19] actually  happens  to  you  if  there's  two 
 men  who  are  deeply  stressed  right  now 
 hugely  stressed  but  one  of  them  likes
[12:24] the  stress  like  he  has  this  belief  like 
 yeah  like  stress  stress  is  good  like  it 
 really  helps  me  like  you  know  I  really 
 do  good  work  when  I'm  stressed  and  the
[12:29] other  one's  like  oh  I'm  stress  so 
 stresses  stress  leads  to  early  death  and 
 stress  leads  to  bad  Health  you  do
[12:35] realize  the  effect  of  stress  will 
 actually  change  depending  on  what  these 
 men  believe  about  that  the  effect  of  any
[12:40] kind  of  Oppression  or  problem  that 
 you're  going  through  is  only  based  on 
 your  own  beliefs  about  the  thing  and  no
[12:46] one  will  believe  this  you  choose  if  you 
 want  to  experience  suffering  most  men 
 are  too  emotional  to  have  this  like 
 victim  mindset  where  they  think  that
[12:52] this  is  like  a  toxic  or  some  [ __ ]  you 
 choose  how  you  feel  about  anything  as  a 
 man  that's  one  of  our  greatest  treasures 
 it's  our  greatest  strength  we  can  choose
[12:58] to  feel  angry  if  you're  constantly  over 
 stimulating  yourself  you  don't  have  this 
 superpower  but  when  you  spend  a  week 
 away  from  technology  you  can  choose  what
[13:04] you  want  to  feel  I  can  literally  just 
 turn  on  my  anger  right  now  and  I  can 
 turn  it  off  I  can  choose  what  I  want  to
[13:09] feel  so  why  choose  to  be  a  victim  why 
 choose  to  like  pretend  like  your  power's 
 been  Stripped  Away  from  you  it's  our
[13:14] greatest  superpower  it's  just  choosing 
 your  own  feelings  you  need  to  like 
 there's  some  prerequisites  to  this  you 
 have  to  meditate  for  a  couple  of  weeks
[13:19] okay  fine  it's  like  one  hour  of  time 
 over  a  couple  of  weeks  you  have  to  take 
 a  step  back  from  anything  that's  [ __ ]
[13:24] up  your  attention  span  like  Tick  Tock 
 and  still  getting  fine  but  after  that 
 like  our  superpowers  literally  being 
 able  to  not  be  a  victim  a  man  with  a
[13:30] core  like  masculine  energy  could  be 
 imprisoned  and  like  shut  away  in  solid 
 food  and  still  be  having  like  an  okay
[13:35] time  because  he  didn't  see  himself  as 
 the  victim  in  the  stories  of  this 
 there's  this  one  man  I  don't  know  his
[13:40] name  he  was  a  black  boxer  in  the  1900s 
 in  prison  for  something  that  he  didn't 
 do  he  went  into  the  the  prison  cell
[13:45] whatever  like  get  arrested  essentially 
 like  with  a  [ __ ]  five  thousand  dollar 
 watch  and  everything  I  literally  said  to 
 them  like  you  can  put  me  in  prison  but
[13:50] you  can't  change  what's  in  my  mind  and 
 he  became  the  most  successful  of  his 
 life  while  still  in  prison  he  chose  not
[13:56] to  be  a  victim  about  it  and  nowadays 
 everyone's  oppressed  everyone's  um 
 triggered  the  fourth  dangerous  habit
[14:01] that  will  mentally  destroy  you  literally 
 is  negative  thinking  and  this  is 
 something  that  so  many  young  men
[14:06] struggle  from  because  your  mind  can 
 sometimes  be  your  worst  enemy  especially
[14:11] when  you  aren't  living  the  kind  of  life 
 that  you  know  that  you  should  you  can 
 have  such  deep  dark  negative  thoughts
[14:17] and  this  can  even  go  into  like  this 
 weird  complex  level  where  if  you've 
 started  to  research  more  about
[14:22] meditation  and  everything  and  also  you 
 know  you've  learned  about  positive 
 thinking  negative  thinking  you  start  to 
 have  negative  thoughts  about  your
[14:27] negative  thoughts  and  it  creates  like 
 this  very  [ __ ]  cycle  where  you  just 
 can't  constantly  just  like  being  a  bully
[14:32] in  your  own  mind  and  so  this  is  a  habit 
 because  it  happens  like  just  throughout 
 the  day  and  often  it  happens  when  you
[14:37] know  you  think  about  your  lack  of 
 success  your  lack  of  your  attraction 
 from  girls  or  something  like  that  you 
 think  about  something  negative  and  your
[14:42] mind  just  starts  breaking  you  and  so 
 many  guys  who  experience  this  don't 
 actually  realize  that  you  can  control
[14:47] your  thoughts  a  lot  easier  than  it  seems 
 fighting  your  thoughts  is  a  horrible 
 idea  honestly  I'm  going  to  tell  you  some
[14:52] minor  I've  had  the  thoughts  like  oh 
 maybe  I  should  just  kill  myself  I've  had 
 that  thought  before  not  recently  but
[14:57] like  a  while  ago  a  couple  of  years  ago  I 
 used  to  have  that  thought  quite  often 
 and  I  did  the  wrong  thing  and  I  would 
 fight  that  thought  and  I'd  be  like  well
[15:03] why  did  I  just  say  that  so  [ __ ]  oh  no  I 
 don't  wanna  I  start  fighting  it  and  it 
 just  created  chaos  in  my  own  mind  and  I
[15:08] just  wanted  to  [ __ ]  shut  it  off  and 
 that's  why  I  number  myself  with  weed 
 porn  video  games  and  junk  food  and  you
[15:13] know  I  just  wanted  to  over  indulge  and 
 [ __ ]  to  not  think  about  that  what  I 
 should  have  done  at  the  time  was  more  so
[15:18] just  observe  the  thought  and  realize 
 that  my  thought  wasn't  me  that  me
[15:23] thinking  this  weird  thought  of  like 
 considering  suicide  it  wasn't  me  talking
[15:28] and  just  see  it  more  as  like  a  cloud 
 that  passing  through  the  sky  you  know 
 the  thought's  going  to  appear  and  go
[15:33] away  just  like  a  cloud  is  and  when  you 
 meditate  you  start  to  understand  that 
 like  thoughts  are  not  a  reflection  of
[15:38] who  you  are  there's  simply  like  some 
 just  random  [ __ ]  that  just  like  happens 
 in  your  mind  and  the  skill  of  meditation
[15:44] is  observing  the  thought  and  realizing 
 that  the  thought  is  an  entity  by  itself 
 it's  not  you  you're  the  person  who
[15:50] watches  the  clouds  you're  the  person  who 
 hears  the  thought  you're  not  the  thought 
 the  person  who  hears  the  thoughts  and  so
[15:55] next  time  when  you  get  like  this  kind  of 
 negative  thought  barrage  or  like  this 
 bully  thoughts  in  your  mind  which  just
[16:01] make  you  feel  [ __ ]  about  yourself  don't 
 fight  them  don't  argue  against  those 
 thoughts  don't  try  and  convince  them 
 that  they're  untrue  observe  them  like  a
[16:07] cloud  appearing  and  going  away  and  just 
 think  to  yourself  that  yep  in  this 
 period  of  your  life  a  lot  of  clouds  are
[16:12] going  to  be  shaped  like  this  and  that's 
 okay  because  it  happens  but  if  you  keep 
 staying  on  yourself  improvements  and 
 eventually  you  build  up  so  many  things
[16:17] that  you're  proud  of  you're  gonna 
 realize  that  all  of  the  clouds  that 
 start  to  appear  naturally  in  your  own 
 brain  starts  to  become  so  much  more
[16:23] positive  when  you've  built  so  much  more 
 like  muscle  and  you've  lost  fat  and  you 
 actually  look  physically  good  like  you 
 know  you  look  like  you're  an  athlete  you
[16:29] look  in  shape  you've  been  going  to  the 
 gym  you  can  can't  help  but  like  just  get 
 like  an  awesome  like  almost  a  cringe 
 positive  thought  in  your  mind  like  yeah
[16:34] like  I'm  I'm  a  beast  you  know  it's  kind 
 of  cringe  but  like  it's  a  lot  nicer  to 
 hear  than  yeah  you  should  kill  yourself 
 and  then  you  work  really  really  hard  you
[16:40] study  really  hard  and  you  get  like  an 
 awesome  grade  that  your  parents  are 
 proud  of  and  you're  proud  of  too  well  in 
 your  mind  you're  saying  like  yes  yes
[16:45] amazing  yes  yeah  I'm  so  [ __ ]  sick  yes 
 you  can  control  your  thoughts  with  your 
 actions  and  too  many  guys  just  feel  like
[16:52] the  negative  thoughts  and  they  just  kind 
 of  don't  do  anything  about  it  and  then 
 the  negative  thoughts  just  keep  coming 
 your  thoughts  honestly  are  often  a
[16:58] little  bit  of  a  reflection  of  where  you 
 are  in  life  if  you're  doing  really  [ __ ] 
 right  now  chances  are  your  thoughts  are
[17:03] gonna  be  negative  if  you're  doing 
 awesome  right  now  chances  are  your 
 thoughts  are  going  to  be  positive  and  as 
 long  as  you  know  how  to  control  them  and 
 observe  them  then  it  won't  hurt  you  the
[17:09] same  way  that  it  does  for  everyone  else 
 and  the  fifth  bad  habit  that  will  really 
 mess  you  up  mentally  is  indecisiveness
[17:14] indecisiveness  is  when  you've  got  a 
 decision  to  make  like  should  you  move 
 should  you  break  up  with  this  girl
[17:19] should  you  do  this  should  you  do  that 
 and  you  often  just  keep  playing  around 
 the  options  in  your  mind  without  ever
[17:24] actually  coming  to  a  good  decision  and 
 taking  action  which  means  that  your  mind 
 gets  stuck  in  this  weird  Loop  like  this 
 negative  cycle  which  is  so  many
[17:30] demanding  like  you  probably  know  this  a 
 phrase  called  decision  fatigue  and 
 that's  when  you  know  you've  got  to  make
[17:35] decisions  and  your  mind  just  gets  that 
 kind  of  weakened  by  doing  that  but  when 
 you're  indecisive  you're  getting
[17:40] decision  fatigue  like  around  the  clock 
 and  it's  literally  fatiguing  so  I've  had 
 this  before  previously  I  remember  there
[17:45] was  a  girl  that  I  was  dating  that  I  was 
 indecisive  about  wanting  to  break  up 
 with  it  like  I  wanted  to  but  I  didn't
[17:50] want  to  go  through  the  breakup  feeling 
 and  everything  and  I  carry  that 
 relationship  on  for  years  imagine  years
[17:55] of  indecisiveness  years  of  decision 
 fatigue  where  almost  every  single  day  in
[18:01] your  mind  you're  thinking  should  I  break 
 up  with  her  or  not  worst  period  of  my 
 life  indecisiveness  is  it's  like  a  weird
[18:06] habit  isn't  it  because  you  know  you  were 
 probably  expecting  me  to  just  say  like 
 oh  video  games  and  you  know  like  normal 
 worldly  things  but  this  is  the  one  that
[18:12] I  think  is  quite  unique  and  it's 
 something  that  I've  experienced  myself 
 but  I'm  not  very  good  at  making 
 decisions  generally  like  you  know  I  want
[18:18] to  be  better  with  that  and  so  often  like 
 it's  really  nice  that  I've  got  a  friend 
 who  helps  me  with  this  but 
 indecisiveness  will  kill  your  momentum
[18:24] messes  you  up  mentally  give  you  decision 
 fatigue  and  everything  it's  not  a  good 
 thing  man  so  how  do  you  solve  it  well
[18:29] the  best  strategy  to  make  it  is  to  write 
 it  all  down  and  it's  so  much  better  I
[18:34] know  this  is  going  to  seem  weirdly 
 practical  but  I  promise  you  it's  so  much 
 better  to  write  it  on  paper  with  the  pen 
 than  it  is  to  write  it  on  a  PC  just
[18:40] write  it  on  a  paper  and  writing  all  of 
 the  decisions  and  the  facts  and 
 everything  that's  related  to  the 
 decision  just  makes  it  so  much  clearer
[18:46] and  suddenly  it's  like  you've  made  the 
 problem  so  specific  that  now  you  can 
 actually  choose  the  best  decision  to  go
[18:52] for  usually  when  it's  all  in  your  mind 
 your  brain  and  your  thoughts  is  all 
 muddled  up  that  you  can't  even  make  a 
 good  decision  you  settle  on  one  but  then
[18:58] you  bounce  back  because  your  brain 
 changes  and  you  know  your  feelings 
 dictate  your  decision  making  which  isn't
[19:03] a  good  thing  we  don't  want  to  be  like 
 that  at  all  when  you  write  it  all  out  to 
 paper  and  you  write  down  the  cold  hard 
 logical  analytical  facts  of  the
[19:09] situation  Suddenly  It's  like  you  have  so 
 much  more  ammunition  to  help  you  make 
 this  decision  scroll  down  to  the

r8U3bujUq4Y,"[00:00] for  this  skill  of  share  class  we'll  be 
 going  over  the  principles  outlined  in 
 this  fantastic  book  How  to  Win  Friends
[00:06] and  Influence  People  by  Dale  Carnegie 
 whether  you've  read  the  book  already  or 
 you've  yet  to  learn  the  fundamental
[00:12] social  skills  this  skillshare  class  is 
 packed  full  of  value  and  actionable 
 steps  that'll  have  you  making  friends
[00:18] faster  and  easier  than  ever  you'll 
 improve  your  coaching  and  mentoring 
 skills  whilst  becoming  a  better
[00:24] Entertainer  and  more  empathetic  listener 
 there's  something  for  everyone  in  this 
 class  we'll  be  going  over  the  30
[00:30] principles  of  social  success  before  we 
 start  Dale  Carnegie  himself  said  that
[00:35] there  is  one  magic  requirement  to  get 
 the  most  out  of  this  book  that  is  a  deep
[00:40] driving  desire  to  learn  with  a  vigorous 
 determination  to  improve  your  social
[00:45] skills  He  suggests  to  constantly  remind 
 yourself  of  how  important  these 
 principles  are  and  how  much  you  would
[00:51] like  a  richer  social  life  so  here's  a 
 quick  exercise  imagine  meeting  a  new
[00:56] person  imagine  this  person  in  your  head 
 what  they  would  look  like  what  they 
 would  sound  like  now  imagine  that  you
[01:01] had  put  in  some  work  and  effort  to 
 increase  your  social  skills  so  that  you 
 could  better  manage  a  conversation  with
[01:07] this  new  person  that  you're  meeting 
 you're  having  a  conversation  with  this 
 person  that  makes  them  feel  appreciated
[01:12] and  important  this  makes  that  person 
 feel  grateful  for  you  they  would  be  so
[01:17] glad  they  met  you  because  you  have  taken 
 the  time  to  invest  to  level  up  your 
 social  skills  your  conversation  with
[01:23] this  person  would  genuinely  make  them 
 feel  good  about  themselves  that's 
 amazing  we're  spreading  positivity  here
[01:30] by  learning  the  principles  from  this 
 book  so  well  done  for  taking  the  first 
 step  in  improving  your  social  skills
[01:35] let's  start  right  away  with  the  first 
 chapter  fundamental  techniques  in 
 handling  people  principle  one  never
[01:42] criticize  condemn  or  complain  Carnegie 
 says  that  the  best  way  to  get  the  most
[01:47] out  of  this  book  is  to  reach  each 
 chapter  rapidly  at  first  and  then  go
[01:52] back  and  reread  each  chapter  thoroughly 
 so  taking  that  advice  into  account 
 there's  different  ways  that  you  can
[01:57] watch  this  class  to  most  benefit  your  so 
 social  skills  you  could  binge  watch  all
[02:02] of  the  lectures  for  the  next  hour  or  so 
 just  to  get  an  understanding  of  what 
 we're  talking  about  here  and  then  slowly
[02:08] over  the  next  month  or  so  you  could 
 watch  one  or  two  lectures  a  day  and  then 
 you  completely  Focus  your  intention  on
[02:14] actively  trying  those  principles  that 
 you  just  learned  Carnegie  says  to  stop 
 frequently  and  to  ask  yourself  how  you
[02:20] could  realistically  use  this  principle 
 that  you're  currently  learning  in  your 
 real  life  social  interactions  so  as
[02:26] you're  watching  this  class  consider  just 
 pausing  the  video  and  taking  a  minute  or
[02:31] two  to  genuinely  think  about  the  people 
 the  times  the  environments  that  you 
 could  use  these  principles  I  hope  this
[02:37] skillshare  class  will  be  a  source  of 
 information  and  value  that  you  can  just 
 keep  re-watching  to  just  further
[02:42] solidify  these  principles  into  your  mind 
 and  with  that  said  let's  begin  with
[02:47] principle  one 
 principle  one  of  the  fundamental 
 techniques  in  handling  people  is  to
[02:53] never  criticize  condemn  or  complain 
 Carnegie  says  any  fool  can  criticize
[02:58] condemn  and  complain  and  most  fools  do 
 but  it  takes  character  and  self-control
[03:04] to  be  understanding  and  forgiving  he 
 mentions  Abraham  Lincoln's  saying  judge
[03:09] not  that  ye  be  not  judged  Lincoln  had  a 
 whole  lot  of  reasons  to  judge  other
[03:14] people  yet  he  never  did  he  said  don't 
 criticize  them  they  are  just  what  we
[03:19] would  be  under  similar  circumstances  and 
 that  makes  sense  if  all  of  the 
 circumstances  like  the  lifelong  history
[03:25] the  thought  processes  and  the 
 environmental  factors  were  all  the  same 
 you  must  have  acted  in  the  same  way  as
[03:31] them  so  we  can't  criticize  someone  for 
 doing  something  we  would  do  if  we  were
[03:36] in  the  exact  100  same  situation  as  them 
 this  principle  may  actually  be  quite
[03:41] difficult  to  implement  because  it's 
 actually  much  easier  to  be  negative  to 
 someone  who  has  messed  up  it's  harder
[03:47] but  therefore  better  for  us  to  hold  our 
 judgments  back  and  try  our  best  to 
 understand  why  they  do  what  they  do
[03:53] following  this  principle  will  turn  you 
 into  a  more  kind  person  is  the  challenge
[03:58] of  being  kind  not  exactly  at  this  moment 
 when  our  natural  instinct  linked  is  to
[04:03] criticize  so  keep  this  new  mentality  of 
 not  criticizing  condemning  or 
 complaining  about  someone  and  you'll
[04:09] find  that  you  become  a  more  kind 
 empathetic  person 
 principle  two  of  the  fundamental
[04:15] techniques  in  handling  people  is  to  give 
 honest  and  sincere  appreciation  Carnegie
[04:20] says  we  nourish  the  bodies  of  our 
 children  and  friends  and  employees  but
[04:25] how  seldom  do  we  nourish  their 
 self-esteem  we  neglect  to  give  them  kind 
 words  of  appreciation  that  would  sing  in
[04:30] their  memories  for  years  like  the  music 
 of  the  morning  Stars  he  mentions  Charles
[04:35] Schwab  president  of  the  United  States 
 Steel  company  in  1921  who  said  I  have
[04:41] yet  to  find  the  person  who  did  not  do 
 better  work  and  put  forth  greater  effort 
 under  a  spirit  of  approval  than  he  would
[04:48] ever  do  under  a  spirit  of  criticism 
 humans  learn  through  positive 
 reinforcement  we  know  that  to  be  true
[04:55] through  countless  psychological  studies 
 if  you  want  someone  to  be  happy  behaving
[05:00] in  a  certain  way  encourage  that  behavior 
 through  honest  appreciation  tell  them
[05:05] and  show  them  that  you  are  grateful  for 
 what  they  are  doing  this  is  going  to 
 make  me  sound  like  a  bad  person  but  I
[05:11] never  used  to  say  thank  you  to  my  mum 
 after  she  would  make  me  eat  breakfast  I 
 recently  started  saying  thanks  and
[05:16] complimented  her  on  how  well  she  cooks 
 fried  eggs  and  she  just  seems  to  enjoy
[05:21] it  more  and  it  certainly  made  her  smile 
 all  of  our  Associates  be  that  workers  in
[05:27] shops  factories  or  families  and  friends 
 are  human  beings  and  they  all  have  a
[05:32] hunger  for  appreciation  Carnegie 
 suggests  to  leave  a  friendly  trail  of
[05:37] little  Sparks  of  gratitude  on  your  daily 
 trips  so  try  that  next  time  you're  in  a 
 shop  and  you  see  a  staff  member  working
[05:42] hard  give  them  appreciation  next  time 
 you  get  a  lovely  meal  or  fantastic 
 service  in  a  restaurant  tell  them  thank
[05:49] them  for  it  you'll  be  spreading 
 positivity  around  your  community  and  I 
 bet  that  person  will  smile  about  it  the
[05:55] third  and  final  principle  of  the 
 fundamental  techniques  in  handling 
 people  is  to  arouse  in  the  other  person
[06:00] an  ego  wants  Carnegie  says  tomorrow  you 
 may  want  to  persuade  someone  to  do
[06:05] something  before  you  speak  pause  and  ask 
 yourself  how  can  I  make  this  person  want
[06:11] to  do  it  he  mentions  a  quote  from  Henry 
 Ford  and  some  of  the  best  relationship 
 advice  he's  ever  heard
[06:17] if  there  is  any  one  secret  of  success  it 
 lies  in  the  ability  to  get  the  other 
 person's  point  of  view  and  see  things
[06:23] from  that  person's  angle  as  well  as  from 
 your  own  instead  of  discussion  or  threat
[06:28] when  a  young  child  was  protesting  about 
 going  to  kindergarten  a  member  of  Dale 
 Carnegie's  course  tried  something
[06:34] different  he  and  his  wife  started  finger 
 painting  and  having  lots  of  fun  whilst 
 telling  his  child  about  all  of  the
[06:40] things  he  would  get  to  enjoy  in 
 kindergarten  this  principle  is  all  about 
 motivating  the  other  person  put  yourself
[06:47] in  their  shoes  and  think  about  their 
 desires  what  do  they  want  arousing  and
[06:52] ego  wants  is  very  important  in  business 
 this  is  why  companies  do  Target  Market
[06:57] Research  to  see  what  the  customer  wants 
 it's  never  about  what  your  company  wants
[07:02] it's  about  fulfilling  the  needs  and  the 
 wants  of  the  customer  this  principle  is
[07:07] very  similar  to  law  13  of  the  48  Laws  of 
 Power  when  asking  for  help  appeal  to
[07:13] people's  self-interest  never  to  their 
 Mercy  or  gratitude  emphasis  size  what
[07:18] they  will  get  out  of  it  so  you  can 
 practically  implement  this  principle  by 
 being  mindful  of  the  needs  and  the  wants
[07:24] of  the  person  in  front  of  you  and 
 talking  about  that  let  me  give  you  an 
 example  I  always  wanted  a  gym  partner
[07:31] someone  to  come  to  the  gym  with  me  and 
 spot  me  whilst  I  was  lifting  weights 
 what  I  would  tell  guys  that  I  wanted  a
[07:37] gym  partner  do  you  think  they  ever  threw 
 themselves  at  the  opportunity  no  but
[07:42] then  when  I  started  mentioning  what  they 
 would  get  out  of  coming  to  the  gym  with 
 me  and  that  was  increased  muscle 
 strength  and  confidence  all  whilst
[07:48] trading  safely  with  someone  who  has  a 
 lot  of  experience  I  started  speaking 
 about  the  benefits  they  would  experience
[07:54] instead  of  just  what  I  wanted  and  now  I 
 almost  always  have  a  guide  to  go  to  the 
 gym  with  the  fourth  principle  starts  the
[08:00] new  chapter  six  ways  to  make  people  like 
 you  and  that  is  by  becoming  genuinely
[08:05] interested  in  other  people  Carnegie  says 
 you  can  make  more  friends  in  two  months
[08:10] by  becoming  genuinely  interested  in 
 other  people  than  you  can  in  two  years 
 by  trying  to  get  other  people  interested
[08:16] in  you  you  he  mentioned  psychologist 
 Alfred  Adler  it  is  the  individual  who  is
[08:21] not  interested  in  his  fellow  men  who  has 
 the  greatest  difficulties  in  life  and 
 provides  the  greatest  injury  to  others
[08:27] it  is  from  such  individuals  that  all 
 human  failures  spring  I've  been  using
[08:32] this  principle  with  a  thought  that  I 
 keep  in  mind  everyone  has  an  interesting 
 story  a  mistake  that  they've  made  that  I
[08:39] could  learn  from  they  have  success  that 
 I  may  be  able  to  replicate  only  by 
 becoming  interested  in  other  people  can
[08:45] you  find  these  things  out  implementing 
 this  principle  will  make  your 
 conversations  deeper  a  Rowan  poet
[08:51] publilius  Cyrus  said  that  we  are 
 interested  in  others  when  they  are
[08:56] interested  in  us  your  strengthen  quality 
 friendships  this  way  by  overcoming  the
[09:01] basic  conversations  that  we  usually 
 limit  ourselves  to  practical  way  that 
 you  can  implement  this  principle  is
[09:06] simply  by  asking  the  other  person  more 
 questions  see  where  the  conversation 
 ends  up  and  you'll  probably  find
[09:12] something  that  really  interests  you  the 
 other  person  will  feel  fantastic  of  the 
 attention  you're  giving  them  and  maybe
[09:18] you'll  learn  a  thing  or  two  the  second 
 principle  of  making  people  like  you  is 
 to  smile
[09:24] Carnegie  says  that  happiness  doesn't 
 depend  on  outward  conditions  it  depends
[09:29] on  inner  conditions  it  isn't  what  you 
 have  or  who  you  are  or  where  you  are  or
[09:34] what  you  are  doing  that  makes  you  happy 
 or  unhappy  it  is  what  you  think  about  it
[09:39] he  mentions  telephone  customer  service 
 training  where  members  of  staff  are 
 instructed  to  smile  as  they  talk  on  the
[09:45] phone  because  your  smile  comes  out 
 through  your  voice  when  you  talk  what  if
[09:50] you  don't  feel  like  smiling  Carnegie 
 mentions  a  quote  from  psychologist 
 William  James  thus  The  Sovereign
[09:57] voluntary  path  to  cheerfulness  if  our 
 cheerfulness  be  lost  is  to  sit  up
[10:02] cheerfully  and  to  act  and  speak  as  if 
 cheerfulness  we're  already  there  fake  it
[10:08] till  you  make  it  we  know  that  fake  it 
 till  you  make  it  actually  works  because 
 it  starts  a  positive  feedback  loop  you
[10:15] fake  the  cheerfulness  and  smile  suddenly 
 everyone  is  smiling  back  at  you  and  the
[10:20] pleasantness  of  the  situation  actually 
 causes  your  smile  to  become  real  force
[10:25] yourself  to  smile  and  then  think  about 
 how  stupid  it  is  to  actually  fake  a 
 smile  and  then  you'll  be  finding
[10:30] yourself  smiling  naturally  remember  to 
 force  this  smile  anytime  you  see  your
[10:35] phone  ring  if  you  force  a  smile  and 
 answer  the  phone  the  other  person  will 
 just  think  that  you  are  very  very  happy
[10:42] to  speak  to  them  your  energy  will  become 
 so  much  more  pleasant  and  then  the  other 
 person  will  likely  feel  the  same  way
[10:47] implementing  this  principle  and  smiling 
 more  will  undoubtedly  make  other  people
[10:52] smile  back  at  you  it  will  make  you  feel 
 a  lot  more  connected  in  your  community 
 and  in  fact  I  personally  think  this
[10:59] principle  has  changed  my  life  the  most 
 the  images  you're  seeing  on  screen  right 
 now  are  a  few  paragraphs  from  my  own
[11:05] personal  Journal  of  the  importance  of 
 smiling  fake  it  till  you  make  it  and
[11:10] start  that  positive  feedback  loop  the 
 third  principle  of  making  people  like 
 you  is  to  remember  that  a  person's  name
[11:16] is  to  that  person  the  sweetest  sound  in 
 any  language  Carnegie  says  that  the
[11:22] average  person  is  more  interested  in  his 
 or  her  own  name  than  in  all  the  other 
 names  on  Earth  put  together  remember
[11:29] that  name  and  call  it  easily  and  you 
 have  paid  a  subtle  and  very  effective
[11:34] compliments  he  mentions  Andrew  Carnegie 
 who  learned  the  astounding  importance
[11:39] people  place  on  their  own  names  at  just 
 the  age  of  10.  he  had  a  whole  nest  of
[11:44] little  rabbits  and  nothing  to  feed  them 
 so  he  convinced  his  neighborhood  friends
[11:49] to  go  out  and  pick  some  dandelion  some 
 food  for  the  rabbits  and  in  return  he
[11:54] would  name  the  little  rabbits  after 
 those  kids  using  people's  names  in  the 
 middle  of  a  conversation  does  feel  a
[12:00] little  bit  awkward  when  you  first  start 
 but  you'll  find  that  people  do  seem  way
[12:05] more  receptive  to  you  when  you  do  use 
 their  name  anytime  I  get  someone's  phone 
 number  I  always  thought  the  first
[12:11] message  or  voice  notes  with  their  name 
 Caitlyn  it's  Hamza  we  met  earlier
[12:16] implementing  this  principle  will  make 
 the  people  you  speak  to  feel  more 
 connected  and  more  important  to  you
[12:22] remembering  their  name  is  almost  like 
 crazy 
 between  two  people  and  now  you're 
 probably  thinking  okay  well  how  do  I
[12:28] actually  begin  to  remember  people's 
 names  effectively  and  I  don't  think
[12:33] there's  any  secret  tactic  it  just  takes 
 a  little  more  intention  Carnegie  says
[12:38] that  most  people  don't  remember  names 
 for  the  simple  reason  that  they  don't 
 take  the  time  and  energy  necessary  to
[12:43] concentrate  and  repeat  and  fix  names  in 
 their  minds  so  it's  likely  that  you'll
[12:48] improve  the  ability  to  remember 
 someone's  name  if  you  just  care  about  it
[12:53] more  and  you  put  more  intention  into 
 remembering  their  name  remain  mindful  of 
 the  significance  that  we  place  on  our
[12:59] names  and  carry  this  thought  around  with 
 you  so  the  fourth  principle  of  making
[13:04] people  like  you  is  to  be  a  good  listener 
 and  to  encourage  others  to  talk  about 
 themselves  Carnegie  says  if  you  aspire
[13:10] to  be  a  good  conversationalist  be  an 
 attentive  listener  to  be  interesting  be
[13:16] interested  ask  questions  that  the  other 
 person  will  enjoy  answering  encourage
[13:21] them  to  talk  about  themselves  and  their 
 accomplishments  he  mentions  Edward  Bach
[13:26] a  Dutch  immigrant  boy  living  in  poverty 
 he  had  nothing  to  his  name  but  he  began 
 corresponding  with  really  famous  people
[13:33] how  did  you  do  that  by  encouraging  them 
 to  talk  about  themselves  he  wrote
[13:38] letters  to  people  like  Mrs  Abraham 
 Lincoln  asking  them  about  details  of 
 their  childhood  by  just  being  a  good
[13:44] listener  a  poor  boy  with  seemingly  no 
 future  became  a  welcome  guest  in
[13:50] distinguished  people's  homes  here's  the 
 deal  we  love  talking  about  ourselves 
 much  more  than  we  like  to  listen  but  if
[13:57] you  become  the  person  who  enjoys 
 listening  and  gets  people  talking  about 
 themselves  they'll  love  of  talking  to
[14:03] you  you  can  implement  this  principle  and 
 you  will  immediately  notice  how  your 
 conversations  change  people  will  open  up
[14:09] about  private  parts  of  their  life  and 
 then  they'll  probably  tell  you  that 
 they've  never  really  spoken  about  these
[14:14] things  before  if  you  implement  this 
 principle  you're  actually  doing  a 
 fantastic  service  sometimes  we  need  to
[14:21] talk  to  someone  who's  a  great  listener 
 someone  who  doesn't  just  want  to  talk 
 back  and  you  can  become  that  person  for
[14:27] your  friends  or  family  making  them 
 grateful  for  you  there  is  a  downside  to 
 this  the  people  that  you  speak  to  may
[14:34] not  be  great  listeners  to  what  you  have 
 to  say  it  might  feel  unbalanced  like 
 they're  doing  all  the  talking  and  you're
[14:40] doing  all  the  listening  when  is  it  your 
 turn  to  do  the  talking  I've  certainly 
 noticed  this  myself  I  think  that's
[14:46] because  the  average  person  has  more  of  a 
 need  to  talk  and  get  things  out  of  their 
 mind  than  their  need  to  listen  really
[14:52] the  more  people  who  read  this  book  The 
 more  great  listeners  that  we  will 
 encounter  that's  why  I  think  this  book
[14:58] should  be  recommended  to  everyone  and 
 that  is  why  I  made  this  skillshare  class 
 the  world  would  generally  be  a  better
[15:05] place  if  more  people  tried  to  implement 
 these  principles  so  consider  sharing 
 this  book  with  someone  maybe  send  them  a
[15:11] free  PDF  or  even  order  the  book  for  them 
 on  Amazon  or  send  them  a  link  to  this
[15:16] skillshare  class  if  they  internalize  it 
 then  that's  your  benefit  you've  now  got 
 someone  who  has  become  a  great  listener
[15:22] to  what  you  have  to  say  the  fifth 
 principle  of  making  people  like  you  is
[15:27] to  talk  in  terms  of  the  other  person's 
 interests  Carnegie  mentions  how  guests
[15:32] of  Theodore  Roosevelt  were  always 
 astonished  at  his  wide  range  of 
 knowledge  particularly  in  the  things
[15:37] that  they  were  interested  in  Roosevelt 
 admitted  his  Secrets  he  would  stay  up
[15:42] late  and  read  up  on  the  subjects  that  he 
 knew  his  guests  were  interested  in  in 
 Carnegie's  words  for  Roosevelt  new  as
[15:48] all  leaders  know  that  the  Royal  Road  to 
 a  person's  heart  is  to  talk  about  the
[15:53] things  that  he  or  she  Treasures  most  I 
 have  some  advice  on  implementing  this 
 principle  and  this  is  my  exact  method  on
[15:59] how  I  perform  outstandingly  in  job  and 
 use  before  the  interview  or  even  the
[16:04] initial  phone  call  I  always  do  extra 
 research  on  the  company  and  the
[16:09] recruiter  you  can  always  find  what 
 they're  interested  in  online  and  when 
 you  mention  it  in  the  interview  they're
[16:14] impressed  they  appreciate  the  fact  that 
 you  took  the  time  to  research  them  and 
 get  a  bit  more  knowledge  on  what  they
[16:20] are  interested  in  implementing  this 
 principle  is  a  Surefire  way  of  never
[16:25] running  out  of  things  to  talk  about  if 
 you  focus  on  their  interests  and  use  the 
 previous  principle  of  being  a  good
[16:31] listener  and  encouraging  them  to  talk 
 about  themselves  you  won't  have  to  talk 
 much  at  all  and  you'll  learn  a  lot  of
[16:37] new  knowledge  and  information  about 
 hobbies  and  activities  that  you  may  not 
 have  known  you  never  know  where  these
[16:43] kinds  of  conversations  could  lead  to  for 
 example  speaking  in  terms  of  the  other 
 person's  interests  has  gotten  me  invited
[16:49] to  parties  barbecues  an  interesting 
 workout  sessions  you'll  find  that  it's 
 quite  common  for  people  to  briefly
[16:55] mention  something  that  they're  really 
 interested  in  in  the  middle  of  a 
 conversation  and  when  you  pick  up  on
[17:00] that  and  you  ask  them  a  question  about 
 that  interest 
 their  eyes  light  up  like  they've  wanted
[17:05] to  talk  about  this  stuff  for  a  while  but 
 no  one  has  asked  them  no  one  has  spoke 
 in  terms  of  their  interests  they  don't
[17:11] get  to  speak  about  what  they  are  most 
 interested  in  very  often  so  pay  them 
 that  favor  and  sometimes  they  even
[17:16] invite  you  to  join  them  with  that 
 interest  the  sixth  and  final  principle
[17:21] of  making  people  like  you  is  to  make  the 
 other  person  feel  important  and  to  do  so
[17:26] sincerely  Carnegie  says  probably  the 
 most  important  rule  of  all  is  to  do  onto
[17:32] others  as  you  would  have  others  do  unto 
 you  you  want  recognition  of  your  true 
 worth  you  crave  sincere  appreciation  so
[17:40] give  that  to  others  Carnegie  mentions  a 
 restaurant  owner  in  France  who  used  this
[17:45] principle  of  making  the  other  person 
 feel  important  a  key  employee  had  sent 
 in  her  resonation  but  the  restaurant
[17:51] owner  was  able  to  make  her  withdraw  it 
 simply  by  making  her  feel  important  he 
 told  her  that  she  meant  a  great  deal  to
[17:57] the  success  of  the  restaurant  and  he 
 said  this  in  front  of  the  entire  staff 
 you'll  find  that  if  you  just  switch  up
[18:02] your  thing  thinking  everyone  is  in  some 
 way  a  cog  a  vital  piece  to  the  bigger
[18:07] picture  bin  man  janitor's  receptionists 
 all  play  an  important  role  but  I  really
[18:12] appreciated  but  now  that  you're  keeping 
 this  principle  in  mind  you  can  be  the 
 person  that  makes  them  feel  important
[18:17] just  think  about  what  they're 
 contributing  to  and  thank  them  for  it 
 implementing  this  principle  is  a
[18:22] straightforward  way  of  making  people 
 appreciated  for  their  efforts  if  you 
 yourself  want  appreciation  and  a  feeling
[18:29] of  importance  in  this  world  do  unto 
 others  as  you  would  have  others  do  unto 
 you  the  first  principle  of  the  new
[18:35] chapter  when  people  to  your  way  of 
 thinking  is  to  know  that  the  only  way  to 
 win  an  argument  is  to  avoid  it
[18:41] completely 
 Carnegie  says  you  can't  win  an  argument 
 you  can't  because  if  you  lose  it  you
[18:48] lose  it  if  you  win  it  you  lose  it  why 
 well  suppose  you  triumph  over  the  other
[18:54] man  and  shoot  his  argument  full  of  holes 
 and  prove  that  he  is  non-compass  mentis
[18:59] then  why  you  will  feel  fine  but  what 
 about  him  you  have  made  him  feel
[19:04] inferior  you  have  hurt  his  pride  he  will 
 resent  your  Triumph  and  a  man  convinced
[19:10] against  his  will  is  of  the  same  opinion 
 still  he  mentions  a  member  of  his  course
[19:15] who  gave  a  great  speech  regarding  his 
 transformation  in  avoiding  arguments  the
[19:20] more  I  argued  against  it  the  more  my 
 Prospect  argued  in  favor  of  it  and  the
[19:25] more  he  argued  the  more  he  sold  himself 
 on  my  competitors  product  as  I  look  back
[19:30] now  I  wonder  how  I  was  ever  able  to  sell 
 anything  I  lost  years  of  my  life  in
[19:35] scrapping  and  arguing  I  keep  my  mouth 
 shut  now  it  pays  arguing  is  addictive  it
[19:42] makes  us  feel  important  when  we  fight 
 for  our  beliefs  and  we  regurgitate  the 
 facts  that  we've  learned  but  everyone
[19:47] feels  like  this  so  you  really  have  to 
 think  what  the  point  of  an  argument  is 
 if  the  point  of  your  argument  is  to  win
[19:53] that  person  to  your  way  of  thinking  then 
 arguing  is  not  the  right  way  the  course 
 member  of  the  example  that  I  just  gave
[19:59] said  it  perfectly  when  you  argue  with 
 someone  and  they  argue  their  point  in 
 retaliation  they're  just  further
[20:04] solidifying  their  current  belief 
 Carnegie  has  watched  the  effects  of 
 thousands  of  arguments  and  he  said  nine
[20:10] times  out  of  ten  an  argument  ends  with 
 each  of  the  contestants  more  firmly 
 convinced  than  ever  that  he  is
[20:16] absolutely  right  so  bear  this  in  mind  as 
 you  go  about  your  day  there's  certainly 
 better  ways  to  win  people  to  your  way  of
[20:22] thinking  which  we  will  discuss  in  the 
 next  few  principles  avoid  arguments  as
[20:27] they  are  a  lose-lose  situation  the 
 second  principle  of  winning  people  to 
 your  way  of  thinking  is  to  show  respect
[20:33] for  the  other  person's  opinions  never 
 say  you  are  wrong  Carnegie  says  if  you
[20:40] can  be  sure  of  being  right  only  55  of 
 the  time  you  can  go  down  to  Wall  Street 
 and  make  a  million  dollars  a  day  if  you
[20:47] can't  be  sure  of  being  right  even  55  of 
 the  time  why  should  you  tell  other 
 people  they  are  wrong  he  mentions  the
[20:54] art  of  subtly  proving  yourself  right  in 
 a  way  that  no  one  will  feel  like  you're 
 doing  it  over  300  years  ago  galio  said
[21:01] you  cannot  teach  a  man  anything  you  can 
 only  help  him  find  it  within  himself
[21:06] Carnegie  even  gives  you  the  exact 
 sentence  you  can  use  if  someone  makes  a 
 statement  that  you  know  is  wrong  I
[21:12] thought  otherwise  but  I  may  be  wrong  I 
 frequently  am  and  if  I'm  wrong  I  want  to
[21:17] be  put  right  let's  examine  the  facts 
 this  principle  works  I  make  YouTube
[21:22] videos  and  sometimes  someone  will  come 
 in  with  something  that  I  know  is  wrong  a
[21:27] few  times  that  I've  indulged  in  calling 
 them  out  and  telling  them  that  they  are 
 wrong  an  argument  has  started  we  now
[21:32] know  that  you  can't  win  an  argument  do 
 you  think  after  arguing  with  these 
 commenters  they  suddenly  subscribed  to
[21:38] my  channel  and  smash  that  like  button  no 
 it  offends  people  when  you  outwardly  say 
 that  they're  wrong  instead  of  subtly
[21:44] telling  them  the  truth  all  of  the  people 
 I  argued  with  on  YouTube  and  said 
 directly  that  they  were  wrong  probably
[21:50] smashed  the  dislike  button  implementing 
 this  principle  of  never  saying  you're 
 wrong  to  someone  will  stop  so  many
[21:57] arguments  from  ever  taking  place  and 
 obviously  we  just  learned  that  you  can 
 never  win  an  argument  so  these  two
[22:02] principles  that  we've  just  learned  will 
 stop  us  going  down  that  rabbit  hole  of 
 negative  conversations  with  people  we
[22:09] will  avoid  arguments  and  hostile 
 disagreements  if  we  implemented  these 
 principles  the  third  principle  of
[22:15] winning  people  to  your  way  of  thinking 
 is  to  admit  when  you  are  wrong  quickly 
 and  empathetically  Carnegie  says  say
[22:22] about  yourself  all  of  the  things  you 
 know  the  other  person  is  thinking  or 
 wants  to  say  or  intends  to  say  and  say
[22:28] them  before  that  person  has  a  chance  to 
 say  them  the  chances  are  a  hundred  to 
 one  that  are  generous  forgiving  attitude
[22:34] will  be  taken  and  your  mistakes  will  be 
 minimized  Carnegie  used  this  principle 
 himself  elf  after  being  caught  with  his
[22:40] dog  loose  without  a  muzzle  or  a  leash  by 
 a  policeman  for  the  second  time  he
[22:45] didn't  wait  until  the  policeman  started 
 talking  and  instead  he  beat  him  to  it 
 and  started  admitting  his  wrongs 
 empathetically  and  apologized  Carnegie
[22:52] admitted  that  he  had  no  excuses  as  he 
 had  been  previously  warned  not  to  have 
 his  dog  running  loose  the  policeman
[22:57] responded  in  a  softer  Manner  and  allowed 
 Carnegie  to  go  without  any  further 
 punishment  that  policeman  Being  Human
[23:03] wanted  a  feeling  of  importance  so  when  I 
 began  to  condemn  myself  the  only  way  he
[23:08] could  nourish  his  self-esteem  was  to 
 take  the  magnanimous  attitude  of  showing
[23:13] Mercy  my  pronunciation  of  some  of  these 
 older  English  words  are  not  too  great
[23:18] I'm  admitting  my  wrongs  quickly  and 
 empathetically  it  feels  quite  awkward  to
[23:23] start  admitting  your  wrongs  but  once  you 
 get  into  the  flow  of  it  it  becomes  quite 
 addictive  that's  because  implementing
[23:29] this  principle  will  make  you  grow  as  a 
 person  people  find  this  trait  of 
 self-reflection  so  attractive  and  they
[23:36] respect  it  because  it  reeks  of  comfort 
 evidence  many  many  people  can't  admit
[23:41] when  they're  wrong  because  they've  got 
 big  Egos  and  so  when  you  take  that 
 uncomfortable  step  people  appreciate  it
[23:47] and  then  they  help  you  feel  better  like 
 what  you  did  wasn't  really  that  bad 
 other  people  will  minimize  your
[23:52] wrongdoings  if  you  admit  them  first  the 
 fourth  principle  of  winning  people  to
[23:57] your  way  of  thinking  is  to  begin  in  a 
 friendly  way  Carnegie  says  the  friendly 
 approach  and  appreciation  can  make
[24:03] people  change  their  minds  more  readily 
 than  all  the  Bluster  and  storming  in  the 
 world  he  mentions  a  course  member  of  his
[24:09] who  successfully  got  his  apartment's 
 rent  reduced  by  beginning  in  a  friendly 
 way  instead  of  complaining  about  the
[24:15] price  of  rents  like  the  other  tenants 
 who  had  requested  a  rent  reduction  this 
 one  tried  something  different  he  greeted
[24:21] the  landlord  in  a  friendly  Manner  and 
 started  talking  about  all  of  the  things 
 that  he  really  liked  about  the  apartment
[24:26] he  complemented  the  landlord  on  the  way 
 he  ran  the  buildings  and  then  said  that 
 he  would  love  to  stay  he  just  couldn't
[24:31] afford  the  rents  here  without  the  course 
 member  even  directly  asking  for  it  the 
 landlord  offered  to  reduce  his  rent
[24:37] that's  a  fantastic  stick  story  and  is  so 
 replicable  to  many  of  us  today  next  time
[24:42] you  have  a  reason  to  complain  consider 
 beginning  with  a  compliment  this 
 requires  more  restraint  but  as  we're
[24:47] learning  that's  usually  a  good  thing  an 
 example  is  if  you  receive  a  meal  in  a
[24:52] restaurant  that  isn't  satisfactory  you 
 could  get  loud  and  you  could  get  hostile 
 but  even  if  they  replace  your  meal
[24:57] you've  just  ruined  your  own  mood  you've 
 lowered  the  positivity  of  the  people 
 around  you  and  there's  always  a  chance
[25:02] that  the  waiter  or  the  cook  will  spit  in 
 your  free  meal  on  the  other  hand  you 
 could  start  by  giving  the  waiter  a
[25:07] compliments  on  their  service  and  then 
 just  say  that  the  meal  wasn't 
 satisfactory  I  had  a  friend  who  was  a
[25:12] waiter  for  years  and  he  said  that  this 
 was  the  exact  way  to  go  about  it  and 
 they  will  undoubtedly  replace  your  meal
[25:18] free  of  charge  the  waiter  is  much  more 
 likely  to  go  back  to  the  kitchen  and 
 make  it  clear  to  the  Cook  that  you  were
[25:23] very  nice  and  that  you  deserve  the  best 
 meal  that  they  can  possibly  make  for  you 
 all  this  and  you  get  to  feel  like  you're
[25:29] in  a  friendlier  mood  implementing  this 
 principle  will  make  the  conversation 
 with  the  other  person  feel  like  you  are
[25:34] teammates  trying  to  solve  the  problem 
 rather  than  putting  the  other  person  on 
 the  offense  and  making  it  a  you  verse
[25:40] them  situation  the  fifth  principle  of 
 winning  people  to  your  way  of  thinking 
 is  to  get  the  other  person  saying  yes
[25:46] immediately  Carnegie  says  the  more  yeses 
 we  can  at  the  very  outset  induce  the
[25:51] more  likely  we  are  to  succeed  in 
 capturing  the  attention  for  our  ultimate 
 proposal  he  mentions  Socrates  a  Greek
[25:57] philosopher  whose  technique  was  based  on 
 getting  a  yes  yes  response  Socrates 
 would  ask  questions  that  he  knew  his
[26:03] opponents  would  have  to  agree  to  winning 
 one  admission  after  the  other  leading  to 
 his  opponents  finding  themselves  at  a
[26:09] conclusion  that  supported  him  getting 
 the  other  person  to  say  yes  yes 
 immediately  is  a  technique  used  in
[26:14] copywriting  which  is  writing  sales  text 
 that  you  may  see  in  online  shopping  it's
[26:19] also  how  I  convinced  some  guys  to  start 
 going  to  the  gym  at  first  I  would 
 wrongly  make  it  all  about  me  and  tell
[26:24] them  why  I  went  to  the  gym  I'd  ask  them 
 why  they  didn't  go  to  the  gym  themselves 
 this  never  worked  to  convince  them
[26:29] instead  using  this  principle  of  getting 
 them  to  say  yes  yes  has  been  much  more
[26:34] effective  I'd  ask  them  do  you  want  to  be 
 more  confident  they  would  of  course  say 
 yes  I  think  everyone  wants  to  be  more
[26:40] confident  then  I'd  say  something  like 
 imagine  right  now  you  had  more  muscle 
 more  strength  and  you  had  accomplished
[26:45] some  fitness  goals  that  you  would  set 
 yourself  do  you  think  you'd  be  more 
 confident  after  that  yes  we  want  them  to
[26:51] agree  with  us  because  it  just  means  that 
 we're  on  the  same  side  and  when  you're 
 on  the  same  side  it's  much  easier  to
[26:57] influence  a  behavior  change  into  someone 
 human  behavior  Professor  Harry 
 Overstreet  said  a  no  response  is  a  most
[27:04] difficult  handicap  to  overcome  when  you 
 have  said  no  all  your  pride  of 
 Personality  demands  that  you  remain
[27:10] consistent  with  yourself  you  may  later 
 feel  that  the  no  was  ill-advised 
 nevertheless  this  is  your  precious  Pride
[27:16] to  consider  once  having  said  a  thing  you 
 feel  you  must  stick  to  it  implementing
[27:21] this  principle  will  make  you  better  at 
 sales  either  selling  a  product  an  idea 
 or  a  belief  if  you  sell  things  online
[27:27] you  do  e-commerce  Facebook  ads  email 
 marketing  all  of  those  things  benefit
[27:32] from  getting  the  other  person  to  say  yes 
 yes  immediately  the  sixth  principle  in
[27:37] winning  people  to  your  way  of  thinking 
 is  to  let  the  other  person  do  a  great 
 deal  of  the  talking  Carnegie  says  most
[27:43] people  trying  to  win  others  to  their  way 
 of  thinking  do  too  much  talking 
 themselves  let  the  other  people  talk
[27:49] themselves  out  he  mentions  a  mother's 
 deteriorating  relationship  with  her
[27:54] teenage  daughter  who  kept  on  misbehaving 
 the  mother  lectured  threatened  and 
 punished  but  it  never  helped  so  one  day
[28:01] she  asked  her  daughter  why  why  was  she 
 behaving  like  this  and  in  the  mother's
[28:06] words  I  had  never  listened  to  her  I  was 
 always  telling  her  to  do  this  or  that 
 when  she  wanted  to  tell  me  her  thoughts
[28:12] feelings  ideas  I  interrupted  with  more 
 orders  I  began  to  realize  that  she
[28:17] needed  me  not  as  a  bossy  mother  but  as  a 
 confidant  from  that  time  on  I  let  her  do 
 all  the  Talking  she  wanted  our
[28:24] relationship  has  improved  immeasurably 
 the  fourth  law  of  the  48  Laws  of  Power 
 supports  this  idea  to  let  the  other
[28:30] person  do  a  great  deal  of  the  talking 
 always  say  less  than  necessary  the  more
[28:35] you  say  the  more  common  you  appear 
 powerful  people  impress  and  intimidate
[28:40] by  saying  less  it's  easier  and  it's  more 
 comfortable  to  keep  talking  to  fill  in
[28:45] the  gaps  of  Silence  but  that's  not  a 
 good  thing  confident  people  who  are  sure 
 of  themselves  and  their  beliefs  are  not
[28:50] afraid  of  the  silence  in  a  conversation 
 keep  this  in  mind  if  you  find  yourself 
 over  talking  along  with  letting  the
[28:56] other  person  do  a  great  deal  of  talking 
 comes  the  necessity  of  restraints  in
[29:01] interrupting  them  if  you  disagree  with 
 them  you  may  be  tempted  to  interrupt  but 
 don't  it  is  dangerous  they  won't  pay
[29:08] attention  to  you  while  they  still  have  a 
 lot  of  ideas  of  their  own  crying  for 
 expression  implementing  this  principle
[29:14] will  make  you  seem  so  much  more 
 confident  especially  if  you're  someone 
 who  usually  over  talks  confident  people
[29:20] say  less  and  so  when  you  emulate  this  it 
 seems  like  your  beliefs  are  stronger
[29:25] than  the  person  who  just  keeps  talking 
 trying  to  convince  you  of  something  else 
 the  seventh  principle  of  winning  people
[29:31] to  your  way  of  thinking  is  to  let  the 
 other  person  feel  like  the  idea  is  his 
 or  hers  Carnegie  says  isn't  it  bad
[29:38] judgment  try  to  Ram  your  opinions  down 
 the  throats  of  other  people  isn't  it 
 wiser  to  make  suggestions  and  let  the
[29:44] other  person  think  out  the  conclusion  he 
 mentions  Edward  M  house  who  was  a
[29:49] confidential  advisor  for  President 
 Woodrow  Wilson  after  I  got  to  know  the 
 president  I  learned  the  best  way  to
[29:55] convert  him  to  an  idea  was  to  plant  it 
 in  his  mind  casually  but  so  as  to 
 interest  him  in  it  so  as  to  get  him
[30:01] thinking  about  it  on  his  own  account  I 
 was  amazed  to  hear  him  Trot  out  my 
 suggestion  as  his  own  people  don't  like
[30:07] to  be  told  what  to  do  there's  an 
 infuriating  moment  that  I'm  sure  we've 
 all  experienced  how  do  you  feel  when
[30:13] you're  about  to  do  the  dishes  or  any 
 other  chore  and  then  someone  tells  you 
 to  do  that  thing  that  you  were  just
[30:18] about  to  do  it  takes  your  free  will  out 
 of  the  picture  when  someone  has  ordered 
 you  to  do  or  believe  something  and  we
[30:25] really  dislike  that  to  change  someone's 
 way  of  thinking  you  have  to  do  so  subtly
[30:30] without  making  it  obvious  what  your 
 intentions  are  they  can  only  truly 
 believe  this  new  way  of  thinking  if  they
[30:35] reach  that  point  themselves  as  galio  in 
 previous  principal  said  you  cannot  teach
[30:40] a  man  anything  you  can  only  help  him 
 find  it  within  himself 
 the  eighth  principle  of  winning  people
[30:46] to  your  way  of  thinking  is  to  try 
 honestly  to  see  things  from  their  point 
 of  view  in  Carnegie's  own  words  an
[30:53] increased  tendency  to  think  always  in 
 terms  of  the  other  person's  point  of 
 view  and  see  things  from  that  person's
[30:58] angle  as  well  as  your  own  if  you  only 
 get  one  thing  from  this  book  it  may
[31:03] easily  prove  to  be  one  of  the  Stepping 
 Stones  of  your  career  he  mentions 
 Kenneth  M  good  stating  the  benefits  of
[31:09] implementing  this  principle  of  seeing 
 things  from  the  other  person's  point  of 
 view  you  will  have  grasped  the  only
[31:14] solid  foundation  for  interpersonal 
 relationships  namely  that  success  in
[31:19] dealing  with  people  depends  on  a 
 sympathetic  grasp  of  the  other  person's 
 Viewpoint  this  is  where  the  phrase  step
[31:25] into  their  shoes  comes  from  you  gather  a 
 fantastic  understanding  of  the 
 motivations  a  person  has  if  you  just
[31:31] take  the  time  to  think  about  how  they 
 feel  and  how  they  think  it's  a  shame 
 that  we  often  don't  take  the  time  to  do
[31:37] this  because  it's  that  small  amount  of 
 effort  that  could  change  how  our 
 conversations  go  if  you  could  perfectly
[31:42] see  things  from  someone  else's  point  of 
 view  you  could  get  them  to  do  anything
[31:47] you'd  be  able  to  say  the  right  words  and 
 convey  the  right  atmosphere  to  convince
[31:52] them  of  your  way  of  thinking  so  just 
 take  the  time  to  really  think  about  who 
 this  person  is  and  what  their  Viewpoint
[31:58] is  what  are  they  for  and  what  are  they 
 against 
 the  ninth  principle  of  winning  people  to
[32:03] your  way  of  thinking  is  to  be 
 sympathetic  to  the  other  person's  ideas 
 and  desires  Carnegie  says  that
[32:09] three-fourths  of  people  are  hungering 
 for  attention  and  sympathy  if  you  give 
 it  to  them  they  will  love  you  he
[32:16] mentions  a  very  interesting  point 
 passenger  Al  Capone  with  the  exact  same 
 body  mind  and  temperament  with  the  exact
[32:23] same  environments  and  childhood  you 
 would  then  act  exactly  how  he  did  if  we
[32:29] use  the  previous  principle  of  seeing 
 things  from  their  point  of  view  and
[32:34] putting  ourselves  in  their  shoes  it 
 becomes  easier  to  be  sympathetic  with 
 someone  and  Carnegie  even  gives  us  the
[32:40] magic  phrase  that  will  eliminate  all  ill 
 feeling  and  help  us  act  sympathetic  to 
 someone  I  don't  blame  you  one  iota  for
[32:47] feeling  as  you  do  if  I  were  you  I  would 
 undoubtedly  feel  just  as  you  do 
 understand  that  everyone  has  a  reason
[32:53] for  what  they  do  Free  Will  is  not  as 
 easy  to  understand  of  a  concept  as  you
[32:59] may  think  it  is  we  think  we've  got  free 
 will  you  think  that  you  get  to  decide 
 your  actions  do  you  think  that  you  get
[33:05] to  decide  your  thoughts  but  is  that  true 
 do  you  actually  get  to  decide  what  you
[33:10] think  next  if  you're  watching  this 
 you've  probably  got  some  kind  of 
 privilege  and  decent  upbringing  to  not
[33:16] have  the  impulse  to  go  and  hurt  someone 
 but  what  if  you  did  what  if  that  was
[33:22] your  thought  is  your  thoughts  not  then 
 determined  because  you  cannot  think  what 
 your  next  thought  is  going  to  be  up
[33:28] until  it  happens  you  can't  exactly 
 control  your  Cravings  but  your  cravings
[33:33] and  your  thoughts  are  definitely 
 influenced  by  the  type  of  life  and 
 experiences  that  you've  had  so  if  you
[33:38] had  the  same  life  and  the  same 
 experiences  as  someone  else  it's  very 
 likely  that  you  probably  would  act  in
[33:43] the  exact  same  way  as  they  did  so  in 
 that  sense 
 show  sympathy  to  yourself  and  to  other
[33:49] humans  and  so  if  you  want  to  win  people 
 to  your  way  of  thinking  consider 
 implementing  this  principle  and  the
[33:55] previous  one  to  form  a  greater 
 understanding  of  how  and  what  a  person 
 feels  shows  sympathy  to  that  and  they
[34:01] will  listen  to  you  attentively  the  tenth 
 principle  of  winning  people  to  your  way 
 of  thinking  is  to  appeal  to  their  nobler
[34:07] motives  Carnegie  says  the  person  will 
 think  of  the  real  reason  you  don't  need
[34:12] to  emphasize  that  but  all  of  us  being 
 idealists  at  heart  like  to  think  of 
 motives  that  sound  good  so  in  order  to
[34:19] change  people  appeal  to  the  nobler 
 motives  he  mentions  how  Lord  northcliffe
[34:24] was  able  to  convince  editors  of  a 
 newspaper  company  to  stop  publishing  a 
 picture  of  him  that  he  didn't  like  he
[34:30] appealed  to  the  respect  and  love  that 
 all  of  us  have  for  motherhood  he  wrote 
 please  do  not  publish  that  picture  of  me
[34:36] anymore  my  mother  doesn't  like  it 
 everyone  has  a  potential  Noble  motive 
 that  you  could  speak  about  when  trying
[34:43] to  influence  someone's  Behavior  or 
 thought  change  for  example  example  I've 
 been  able  to  convince  young  men  to  take
[34:49] the  time  and  effort  to  improve  their 
 mental  health  through  practices  like 
 mindfulness  and  gratitude  and  exercise
[34:55] however  some  guys  didn't  really  feel 
 motivated  to  help  themselves  so  my  go-to
[35:00] response  to  that  was  a  form  of  appealing 
 to  their  Noble  motives  without  me  even
[35:05] realizing  that  I  was  doing  this  I  would 
 say  after  you  learn  these  practices  and 
 you  actually  take  the  time  to  get  used
[35:12] to  them  you  can  teach  them  to  other 
 friends  and  family  that  you  know  may 
 have  some  mental  health  problems  too
[35:17] most  people's  Noble  motives  are  selfless 
 it's  something  that  helps  other  people
[35:22] that  they  love  their  friends  family  or 
 people  in  their  Community  implement  this 
 principle  appeal  to  that  selfless  desire
[35:29] and  they  will  probably  embrace  the 
 responsibility  of  change 
 the  11th  principle  of  winning  people  to
[35:34] your  way  of  thinking  is  to  dramatize 
 your  ideas  Carnegie  says  this  is  the  day
[35:39] of  dramatization  merely  stating  a  truth 
 isn't  enough  the  truth  has  to  be  made
[35:44] Vivid  interesting  and  dramatic  you  have 
 to  use  Showmanship  the  movies  do  it
[35:50] television  does  it  and  you  will  have  to 
 do  it  if  you  want  attention  he  mentions 
 how  souzas  set  up  a  romantic  atmosphere
[35:57] and  may  even  get  down  on  one  need  to 
 propose  you  could  say  the  words  of  love 
 but  adding  the  dramatization  adds  extra
[36:04] effect  it  creates  a  moment  that  they 
 will  better  remember  the  possibilities 
 of  this  principle  are  endless  so  I  would
[36:10] highly  recommend  for  you  to  just  take  a 
 few  minutes  after  this  particular 
 principle  to  think  and  creatively  come
[36:17] up  with  a  few  ways  that  you  could 
 dramatize  the  idea  that  you're  trying  to 
 convey  to  others  it'll  create  a  more
[36:22] memorable  experience  and  therefore  it'll 
 probably  be  more  influential  for  example 
 a  couple  weeks  ago  I  met  up  an  old
[36:28] friend  and  we  were  just  walking  around 
 our  city  he  said  that  he  wanted  to  be  in 
 a  relationship  ship  and  that  he  had
[36:34] slightly  been  struggling  because  he 
 would  message  girls  on  Instagram  or 
 Tinder  and  he  didn't  have  much  success
[36:39] with  it  I  told  him  the  best  way  in  my 
 opinion  is  to  actually  approach  girls  in
[36:44] person  instead  of  just  being  another  guy 
 in  her  DMS  on  Instagram  whilst  I  was
[36:49] telling  him  this  I  stopped  mid-senses 
 and  walked  up  to  a  girl  just  approached 
 her  and  asked  for  her  number  she  said  no
[36:55] but  it  seemed  to  influence  him  a  lot 
 more  than  if  I  just  told  him  to  do  so  he
[37:00] witnessed  in  his  own  eyes  that  just 
 walking  up  and  speaking  to  someone  isn't 
 as  scary  as  it  seems  I  dramatized  my
[37:07] idea  and  I  want  him  to  my  way  of 
 thinking  implementing  this  principle 
 does  take  a  little  more  confidence  but
[37:12] it  leads  to  Greater  rewards  it  increases 
 the  potential  to  change  their  minds  when 
 they  see  and  remember  something  dramatic
[37:19] the  12th  and  final  principle  of  winning 
 people  to  your  way  of  thinking  is  to 
 throw  down  a  challenge  Carnegie  says
[37:25] this  is  what  every  successful  person 
 loves  the  game  the  chance  for
[37:30] self-expression  the  chance  to  prove  his 
 or  her  birth  to  excel  to  win  he  mentions
[37:36] Charles  Schwab  who  created  an  atmosphere 
 of  challenging  competition  by  drawing  a 
 big  figure  six  on  the  floor  with  chalk
[37:43] to  indicate  a  Mill's  day  shift 
 production  the  night  shift  came  in
[37:48] worked  hard  and  changed  the  six  to  a 
 seven  then  the  day  shift  came  in  thought
[37:53] they  got  one  up  by  the  night  shift  and 
 then  worked  really  really  hard  changed 
 the  seven  to  a  10.  this  Mill  in
[37:59] particular  started  turning  out  more  work 
 than  any  other  Mill  in  the  entire  plan 
 Charles  Schwab  himself  said  the  way  to
[38:05] get  things  done  is  to  stimulate 
 competition  I  do  not  mean  an  assorted
[38:10] money  getting  way  but  in  the  desire  to 
 excel  Challenge  and  competition  truly
[38:15] works  and  a  great  practical  thing  about 
 this  is  that  you  can  compete  with 
 yourself  or  you  could  get  your  clients
[38:22] or  customers  or  staff  to  compete  with 
 themselves  for  example  as  a  weightlifter
[38:27] I  started  tracking  my  lifts  tracking 
 your  lift  just  means  taking  the  time  to
[38:32] either  use  an  app  or  a  notebook  where 
 you  just  write  down  how  much  weight  you 
 lifted  in  a  particular  exercise  how  many
[38:37] reps  how  many  sets  it  seems  quite  simple 
 but  this  is  an  act  of  creating  a 
 competition  a  challenge  through  yourself
[38:43] through  your  former  self  so  every  week  I 
 see  the  number  and  I'm  essentially
[38:49] competing  with  last  week  me  I  tried  to 
 beat  my  previous  high  score  and  it's
[38:54] actually  way  more  exciting  this  way  and 
 so  you  can  convince  your  clients  or 
 staff  to  compete  with  their  former
[39:00] selves  that's  the  mentality  I've  been 
 using  with  my  coaching  clients  I 
 constantly  ask  them  to  remember  what
[39:05] normal  behavior  was  for  their  previous 
 younger  selves  just  a  few  months  ago  so
[39:10] they  remember  that  a  few  months  ago  they 
 weren't  even  exercising  at  all  and  then 
 we  compare  that  to  now  where  they're
[39:15] exercising  three  times  a  week  I  remind 
 them  of  the  version  of  them  from  last 
 week  saying  that  he  hit  three  sessions
[39:21] and  I  say  can  you  beat  your  previous 
 version  can  you  beat  you  from  last  week 
 and  hit  four  sessions  this  week  this  is
[39:27] one  of  the  most  influential  men 
 totalities  I've  been  Drilling  in 
 challenge  seems  to  ignite  a  fire  inside
[39:34] of  us  that  actually  gets  us  just  moving 
 and  taking  action  I  think  this  might  be 
 due  to  Evolution  when  you  create  a
[39:41] challenger  competition  it's  like  your 
 fight-or-flight  mode  kicks  in  and  wants 
 to  fight  for  the  resources  that  are
[39:48] available  with  the  reward  of  hard  work 
 because  now 
 someone  else  could  win  the  reward  of
[39:54] hard  work  and  we  don't  want  that  we  want 
 as  much  resources  and  rewards  as 
 possible  this  principle  is  actually  the
[40:00] basis  of  setting  goals  you  set  a  goal 
 that's  somewhat  of  a  challenge  and  you 
 just  keep  reminding  yourself  the  goal  is
[40:06] four  workout  sessions  this  week  the  goal 
 is  to  ride  a  thousand  words  in  my  book
[40:11] we  set  these  goals  we  constantly  remind 
 ourselves  because  that  is  our  challenge
[40:16] the  22nd  principle  that  we're  covering 
 which  is  now  the  first  principle  of  the
[40:21] new  chapter  of  being  a  leader  is  to 
 begin  with  praise  and  honest 
 appreciation  Colony  says  that  beginning
[40:27] with  praise  it's  like  the  dentist  who 
 begins  his  work  with  novocaine  the
[40:32] patient  still  gets  a  drilling  but  the 
 novocaine  is  a  pain  killing  he  mentions 
 a  branch  manager  who  was  a  member  of  his
[40:39] course  who  had  successfully  encouraged  a 
 new  trainee  to  increase  their
[40:44] performance  in  an  area  of  the  job  that 
 they  struggled  with  the  trainee 
 struggled  with  balancing  the  cash  draw
[40:49] starting  the  conversation  with  praise 
 and  this  appreciation  created  a  positive
[40:54] friendly  atmosphere  and  then  the  manager 
 suggested  the  improvements  that  the 
 trainee  could  make  in  the  manager's
[41:00] words  once  she  realized  I  had  confidence 
 in  her  she  easily  follows  my  suggestions
[41:05] and  soon  mastered  this  function  we  have 
 had  no  problems  with  her  since  then  we
[41:10] want  the  best  in  the  people  that  we  want 
 to  lead  so  it's  normal  to  focus  on  the
[41:15] things  that  they  can  improve  on  but 
 always  bear  in  mind  that  the  other 
 people  would  probably  improve  better  if
[41:20] we  started  on  a  positive  note  first  but 
 do  not  implement  this  principle  of
[41:25] starting  with  praise  and  honest 
 appreciation  until  you  also  implement 
 the  next  principle  too  the  second
[41:31] principle  of  being  a  leader  is  to  call 
 attention  to  people's  mistakes 
 indirectly  Carnegie  says  that  many
[41:37] people  begin  their  criticism  with  a 
 sincere  praise  followed  by  the  word  but
[41:42] and  ending  with  a  critical  statement 
 we're  really  proud  of  you  but  if  you  had
[41:47] worked  a  little  harder  your  grades  would 
 have  been  even  better  when  someone  hears 
 the  word  but  after  a  praise  they  might
[41:53] then  question  the  sincerity  of  the 
 original  praise  he  mentions  Charles 
 Schwab  who  instead  of  calling  a  mistake
[41:59] of  his  employees  directly  used  a  softer 
 approach  his  employees  were  smoking  just
[42:05] under  a  no  smoking  sign  he  could  have 
 went  up  he  could  have  been  rude  and 
 angry  and  told  them  can  you  not  see  the
[42:10] sign  his  employees  would  have  listened 
 to  that  they  would  have  followed  his 
 orders  but  they  may  have  slightly
[42:15] resented  him  and  there's  certainly  a 
 better  way  to  get  adherents  from  people 
 instead  of  calling  attention  to  their
[42:21] mistakes  directly  as  we're  using  his 
 examples  a  lot  you  can  begin  to  realize 
 that  this  Charles  Schwab  guy  is  one  of  a
[42:28] kind  he  walked  over  and  handed  each  of 
 the  employees  a  cigar  and  he  said  I'd
[42:33] appreciate  it  boys  if  you  could  smoke 
 these  outside  subtle  but  effective  they 
 knew  what  he  meant  they  knew  they  had
[42:39] broken  a  rule  but  the  rule  didn't  even 
 come  up  but  how  could  you  not  respect
[42:44] someone  who  calls  attention  to  your 
 mistakes  like  that  I  think  we  could  all 
 learn  a  lot  from  his  examples  in  this
[42:49] book  again  I  want  to  make  it  clear  that 
 the  easier  routes  would  have  been  to 
 call  attention  to  their  mistakes
[42:54] directly  so  far  what  we've  learned  a  lot 
 through  these  23  principles  is  that  the 
 direct  easy  approach  is  often  not  the
[43:02] great  one  to  take  just  taking  the  time 
 to  think  about  a  softer  approach  seems
[43:07] to  lead  to  Greater  adherence  with 
 everything  that  we  want  Carnegie  says 
 that  you  can  easily  overcome  calling
[43:13] attention  to  people's  mistakes  directly 
 by  replacing  the  word  but 
 to  and  we're  really  proud  of  you  and  if
[43:20] you  continue  putting  in  great  effort 
 we'll  see  your  grades  improve  as  well 
 I've  been  using  this  principle  a  lot
[43:25] lately  and  I  think  it's  a  fantastic 
 fundamental  principle  to  keep  in  mind  if 
 you're  someone  who  wants  to  see  changes
[43:32] in  people  as  I've  mentioned  I've  been 
 helping  young  men  improve  their  physical 
 and  mental  health  and  one  of  the  times 
 I've  used  this  principle  is  when  a
[43:38] client  of  mine  did  three  workout 
 sessions  when  his  goal  was  four 
 previously  I  would  have  said  well  done
[43:43] on  hitting  three  workouts  but  your  goal 
 was  four  so  we're  gonna  make  sure  we 
 smash  it  next  week  it's  not  bad  it's
[43:48] still  praising  him  but  it's  not  as 
 effective  as  it  could  be  now  I  say 
 something  like  well  done  on  hitting
[43:54] three  workouts  this  week  and  next  week 
 we're  going  to  use  the  same  tactics 
 we're  going  to  get  increased  effort  from
[43:59] you  and  we're  going  to  hit  four  workouts 
 do  you  think  you  can  do  that  it's  a 
 subtle  difference  but  it  seems  to  have
[44:04] quite  a  big  effect  here's  something  that 
 I  realized  that  I  think  if  you're  some 
 kind  of  leader  or  influencer  or  someone
[44:10] who  just  wants  to  see  change  in  someone 
 you  may  be  able  to  take  away  I've  been 
 thinking  about  keeping  the  idea  of  a
[44:16] praise  as  pure  by  not  contaminating  a 
 Praise  by  straight  away  then  telling
[44:22] them  something  that  they  did  wrong 
 praise  them  for  what  they  did  right  and 
 let  that  just  be  a  moment  in  itself  and
[44:28] then  later  on  after  a  few  minutes  then 
 have  the  section  about  what  they  can 
 improve  on  implementing  this  principle
[44:34] will  have  the  people  you're  trying  to 
 lead  Crave  Your  Praises  more  everyone 
 loves  getting  praised  but  we  often  just
[44:40] ruin  it  by  calling  attention  to  their 
 mistakes  directly  after  the  praise  don't
[44:45] do  that  and  your  compliments  will 
 certainly  leave  a  positive  mark  on 
 someone  the  third  principle  of  being  a
[44:50] leader  is  to  talk  about  your  own 
 mistakes  before  criticizing  the  other 
 person  Carnegie  says  admitting  one's  own
[44:56] mistakes  even  when  one  hasn't  corrected 
 them  can  help  convince  somebody  to 
 change  his  behavior  he  mentions  the
[45:02] father  who  found  out  his  teenage  son  had 
 started  smoking  he  could  have  made 
 threats  or  warned  his  son  but  he  took  a
[45:08] different  approach  he  told  his  son  about 
 the  mistake  he  made  starting  smoking 
 himself  the  father  had  been  smoking  for
[45:14] many  years  and  he  felt  like  his 
 addiction  was  impossible  to  stop  up  he 
 had  an  irritating  cough  he  told  all  this
[45:20] to  his  son  admitting  his  own  mistake 
 instead  of  criticizing  his  son's 
 Behavior  his  son  stopped  smoking  himself
[45:26] this  is  very  similar  to  the  previous 
 principle  of  calling  attention  to 
 people's  mistakes  indirectly  but  this
[45:32] time  we're  just  highlighting  what 
 they're  doing  wrong  by  telling  them  an 
 example  about  ourselves  if  you're  trying
[45:38] to  change  someone  start  by  telling  them 
 what  you  did  wrong  in  that  situation  and 
 how  that  experience  was  for  you  tell
[45:44] them  how  you  regretted  your  actions  and 
 you  just  wish  you  had  someone  telling 
 you  something  like  this  there's  a  whole
[45:50] lot  of  mistakes  I  made  when  I  first  got 
 into  fitness  and  exercising  I  found  that 
 when  I  bring  up  my  mistake  and  tell  them
[45:56] oh  I  would  I  lost  months  of  progress 
 because  I  did  this  thing  they're  way 
 more  likely  to  listen  to  my  idea  and
[46:03] take  my  advice  than  if  I  just  tell  them 
 wait  don't  do  that  because  the  other 
 person's  more  likely  to  listen  to  your
[46:09] plead  because  admitting  your  own  failure 
 is  very  admirable  we  always  strive  to 
 learn  from  other  people's  mistakes  to
[46:15] avoid  what  negative  experiences  they  had 
 the  fourth  principle  of  being  a  leader 
 is  to  ask  questions  instead  of  giving
[46:21] direct  orders  Carnegie  says  asking 
 questions  not  only  makes  an  order  more 
 palatable  it  often  stimulates  the
[46:28] creativity  of  the  person  whom  you  ask  he 
 mentions  Ian  McDonald  a  manager  of  a
[46:33] manufacturing  plant  he  received  a  very 
 large  order  which  would  be  impossible  to 
 complete  now  he  could  have  gave  orders
[46:39] he  could  have  increased  the  time  of  his 
 employees  work  but  he  didn't  instead  he
[46:44] just  asked  his  staff  questions  is  there 
 anything  we  can  do  to  handle  this  order 
 is  there  any  way  we  can  adjust  our  hours
[46:49] or  personal  assignments  to  complete  this 
 order  the  employees  themselves  came  up
[46:54] with  the  ideas  and  insisted  that  the 
 manager  take  the  order  asking  questions 
 instead  of  giving  direct  orders  put  the
[47:00] employees  in  a  we  can  do  it  attitude 
 they  accepted  the  order  and  got  it 
 delivered  on  time  if  you  give  someone  a
[47:07] direct  order  it's  actually  quite  risky 
 either  one  they'll  accept  the  order 
 they'll  do  the  task  but  then  they'll
[47:13] have  some  kind  of  resentment  for  you 
 because  you've  almost  forced  them  to  do 
 something  oh  2  they  will  refuse  and  your
[47:19] leadership  has  now  been  challenged  a  lot 
 of  this  book  has  told  us  that  people 
 don't  like  to  be  told  what  to  do  and  the
[47:25] direct  approach  is  often  not  the  best 
 and  so  we  know  that  taking  a  softer 
 touch  is  usually  better  Carnegie  even
[47:31] says  people  are  more  likely  to  accept  an 
 order  if  they've  had  a  part  in  the 
 decision  that  caused  the  order  to  be
[47:37] issued  for  example  let's  say  you're  a 
 mother  with  a  child  who's  misbehaving 
 and  he  doesn't  want  to  put  his  shoes  on
[47:43] to  go  outside  the  mother  could  get 
 really  angry  put  your  shoes  on  right  now 
 we  have  to  go  we're  getting  late
[47:48] does  that  really  work  with  kids 
 or  the  mother  could  ask  the  question 
 instead  of  focusing  on  the  direct  order
[47:54] she  could  ask  the  question  which  pair  of 
 your  trainers  do  you  want  to  wear  which 
 pair  of  shoes  do  you  want  to  wear  today
[48:00] the  child  is  going  to  answer  which  pair 
 of  trainers  he  wants  to  wear  and  now  he 
 feels  like  he  had  a  choice  in  the
[48:05] decision  he  had  A  Creative  Touch  almost 
 and  that  probably  means  he's  more  likely
[48:11] to  follow  what  originally  was  in  direct 
 order  involve  the  people  you're  trying 
 to  lead  in  the  decision  at  the  very
[48:17] least  just  ask  them  something  like  do 
 you  think  we  can  do  it  implementing  this 
 principle  will  change  it  from  a  you
[48:23] verse  them  situation  to  a  you  plus  them 
 versus  the  situation  the  fifth  principle
[48:29] of  being  a  leader  is  to  let  the  other 
 person  save  face  Carnegie  says  even  if 
 we  are  right  and  the  other  person  is
[48:35] definitely  wrong  we  only  destroy  ego  by 
 causing  someone  to  lose  face  he  mentions
[48:40] two  completely  different  leaders  one  was 
 a  vice  president  who  just  lost  his 
 temper  and  started  arguing  and  shouting
[48:47] and  berating  his  supervisor  that 
 supervisor  designed  and  started  working
[48:52] at  a  competitors  company  and  apparently 
 did  a  fine  job  there  the  other  leader 
 was  a  marketing  specialist  boss  when  one
[48:58] of  his  employees  had  made  quite 
 significant  errors  this  boss  thanked  her
[49:03] for  her  efforts  he  said  he  had 
 confidence  that  the  employee  could 
 repeat  the  survey  that  they  were  doing
[49:08] and  that  he  had  faith  in  that  employee 
 that  employee  left  that  meeting  with 
 their  head  up  in  the  air  determined  to
[49:14] not  let  that  boss  down  again  hurting  a 
 man  in  his  dignity  is  a  crime  and  it's  a
[49:19] crime  that  just  does  not  pay  off  if  we 
 want  to  be  effective  leaders  be  careful 
 if  you  find  yourself  in  a  position  of
[49:25] power  you  may  actually  feel  slightly 
 excited  to  not  let  the  other  person  save
[49:30] face  to  highlight  their  faults  publicly 
 or  to  humiliate  them  for  their  mistakes 
 but  none  of  this  will  improve  your
[49:36] leadership  skills  and  it  won't  make 
 people  more  likely  to  respect  you  and 
 follow  your  command  if  it's  adherence
[49:41] that  you're  trying  to  get  from  your 
 staff  or  the  people  that  you're  trying 
 to  change  take  the  software  approach  and
[49:46] let  someone  save  face  the  sixth 
 principle  of  being  a  great  leader  is 
 phrase  the  slightest  Improvement  and  to
[49:52] praise  every  Improvement  be  hearty  in 
 your  approbation  and  lavish  in  your
[49:57] praise  Carnegie  says  I  can  look  back  at 
 my  own  life  and  see  where  a  few  words  of 
 Praise  have  sharply  changed  my  entire
[50:03] future  he  mentions  very  well-known 
 psychologist  BF  Skinner  Skinner  showed
[50:08] that  minimizing  criticism  and  increasing 
 praise  resulted  in  more  positive
[50:13] behavior  we  know  that  operant 
 conditioning  works  on  humans  praising 
 someone  acts  as  a  form  of  positive
[50:19] reinforcement  that  strengthens  a 
 behavior  which  means  that  they're  just 
 more  likely  to  repeat  that  same  behavior
[50:25] so  if  an  employee  or  client  of  yours  put 
 in  some  great  effort  praise  that  effort
[50:30] and  they'll  be  more  likely  to  continue 
 putting  in  the  same  effort  because  we 
 crave  appreciation  I  think  this  is  one
[50:37] of  the  most  powerful  principles  you  can 
 effectively  make  someone  act  out  a 
 certain  Behavior  with  their  soul
[50:42] principle  use  it  wisely  and  remember  to 
 never  give  out  any  hostile  criticism  or
[50:47] punishment  we  strengthen  behaviors  that 
 are  praised  and  appreciate  and  we  just 
 weaken  behaviors  which  are  ignored  I've
[50:54] been  using  this  principle  a  lot  recently 
 when  my  clients  perform  the  vital 
 behaviors  that  get  them  to  their  goals
[51:00] an  extra  tip  I  can  give  you  is  to  make 
 your  praise  as  specific  and  as  special 
 as  possible  for  example  when  I  Want  To
[51:06] Praise  my  clients  for  completing  the 
 week's  gym  goal  of  four  sessions  a  week
[51:11] I  could  just  send  them  a  few  words  on 
 the  text  and  say  Well  done  but  I  make  it 
 a  little  bit  more  special  by  always
[51:16] sending  a  voice  note  when  they've  done 
 great  behavior  that  way  they  get  to  hear
[51:21] my  voice  it  feels  more  personal  and  the 
 praise  is  more  special  I  highly 
 recommend  doing  a  little  bit  more
[51:27] research  on  operant  conditioning  because 
 if  you  want  to  see  it  Behavior  change  in 
 someone  you  should  learn  about  positive
[51:33] reinforcement  it's  a  very  powerful  tool 
 probably  the  only  tool  of  influencing  a
[51:38] behavior  change  in  someone  in  a  nice  way 
 the  seventh  principle  of  being  a  leader
[51:43] is  to  give  the  other  person  a  fine 
 reputation  to  live  up  to  Carnegie  says
[51:48] if  you  want  to  improve  a  person  in  a 
 certain  respect  act  as  though  that 
 particular  trait  were  already  one  of  his
[51:54] or  her  outstanding  characteristics  he 
 mentions  how  a  primary  school  teacher 
 was  able  to  change  the  behavior  of  one
[52:00] of  the  most  mischievous  students  in  the 
 school  she  complimented  him  on  his 
 traits  as  a  natural  leader  and  said  that
[52:06] she  was  going  to  depend  on  him  on  making 
 that  class  the  best  fourth  grade  class 
 in  the  entire  school  she  gave  the
[52:12] student  a  fine  reputation  to  live  up  to 
 and  of  course  he  lived  up  to  her  this 
 principle  is  like  highlighting  the  best
[52:18] version  of  somebody  making  it  clear  of 
 their  potential  what  they  could  do  and
[52:23] setting  that  as  their  challenge  so  we're 
 bringing  in  the  21st  principle  of 
 throwing  down  a  challenge  as  well
[52:28] there's  two  ways  that  you  can  use  this 
 principle  to  improve  your  leadership 
 skills  one  by  making  them  aware  of  their
[52:34] potential  reputation  describing  it 
 realistically  as  something  that  they 
 could  strive  for  or  two  setting  yourself
[52:40] as  a  fantastic  example  that  then  is 
 their  reputation  to  live  up  to  for
[52:45] example  I'm  teaching  young  men  how  to 
 start  exercising  I  know  that  I  can  teach 
 these  things  because  I've  got  years  of
[52:50] experience  but  my  influence  as  a  leader 
 has  increased  tenfold  over  the  last  few 
 months  because  I've  gotten  myself  into
[52:56] the  best  shape  of  my  life  it  sets  a 
 fantastic  reputation  for  other  people  to 
 strive  for  this  gives  you  more
[53:02] credibility  as  a  leader  to  influence 
 change  if  it's  a  skill  or  a  practice
[53:07] that  you've  already  mastered  the  eighth 
 principle  of  being  a  leader  is  to  use 
 encouragement  and  make  the  fault  seem
[53:13] easy  to  correct  Carnegie  says  and  this 
 is  probably  my  favorite  paragraph  in  the 
 entire  book
[53:18] tell  your  child  your  spouse  or  your 
 employee  that  he  or  she  is  stupid  or
[53:23] dumb  at  a  certain  thing  has  no  gift  for 
 it  and  is  doing  it  all  wrong  and  you 
 have  destroyed  almost  every  incentive  to
[53:29] try  to  improve  but  use  the  opposite 
 technique  be  liberal  with  your
[53:34] encouragement  make  the  thing  seem  easy 
 to  do  let  the  other  person  know  that  you
[53:39] have  faith  in  his  ability  to  do  it  and 
 that  he  has  an  undeveloped  Flair  for  it 
 and  then  he  will  practice  until  the  dawn
[53:45] comes  in  the  window  in  order  to  excel  he 
 mentions  a  course  instructor  of  his  who
[53:50] used  encouragement  and  making  faults 
 seem  easy  to  correct  which  changed  the 
 trajectory  of  his  son's  life  his  son  had
[53:56] a  rough  life  he  was  in  a  car  accident 
 when  he  was  young  and  he  had  a  massive 
 scar  over  his  forehead  he  was  behind  by
[54:02] two  years  in  school  he  was  in  the 
 special  classes  for  the  slow  Learners 
 and  he  struggled  particularly  with  mats
[54:09] so  his  father  started  teaching  him  maths 
 and  made  a  big  deal  every  single  time 
 his  son  got  an  answer  right  they  would
[54:15] celebrate  when  his  son  had  shown 
 improvements  they  showed  him  that 
 learning  fun  and  it  could  be  easier  than
[54:20] it  was  at  school  and  soon  enough  that 
 teenager  started  bringing  home 
 significantly  improved  grades  and  went
[54:27] on  to  even  improve  in  other  classes  his 
 reading  improved  rapidly  he  started 
 using  his  natural  talents  in  drawing  and
[54:33] he  actually  got  put  onto  the  honor  roll 
 multiple  years  in  a  row  this  principle 
 is  all  about  drilling  in  a  growth
[54:38] mindset  into  the  people  we're  trying  to 
 influence  we're  making  it  so  clear  that
[54:43] they  have  the  realistic  potential  to 
 improve  and  all  it  requires  is  effort 
 but  not  that  much  effort  we're  not
[54:50] making  the  behavior  seem  like  a  big  deal 
 until  they  have  done  it  and  then  we  act 
 like  it's  a  big  deal  and  then  we
[54:56] celebrate  implementing  this  principle 
 genuinely  gives  you  the  power  as  a 
 leader  to  change  someone's  life  the
[55:03] growth  mindset  empowers  someone  into 
 positive  beliefs  that  really  make  them 
 feel  that  they  can  achieve  anything  with
[55:09] enough  effort  any  leader  any  influencer 
 any  personal  trainer  or  manager  should
[55:14] use  this  principle  all  the  time  the 
 ninth  and  final  principle  of  being  a 
 leader  is  to  make  the  other  person  happy
[55:20] about  doing  the  things  that  you  suggest 
 Carnegie  mentions  a  course  member  of  his
[55:25] who  improved  his  employees  performance 
 by  giving  them  a  new  responsibility  and 
 job  title  they  were  now  the  supervisor
[55:32] of  price  tag  posting  and  they  were  asked 
 to  keep  all  the  shelves  properly  tagged 
 giving  the  other  person  a  sense  of
[55:38] importance  like  we  learned  in  the  ninth 
 principle  makes  them  feel  happier  or
[55:43] more  excited  for  what  we  want  them  to  do 
 this  principle  is  kind  of  like  bribing 
 someone  imagine  bribing  the  police  you
[55:49] make  that  police  officer  do  what  you 
 want  which  is  potentially  getting  away 
 with  minor  crime  by  giving  him  money
[55:55] which  makes  him  happy  if  you  want 
 increased  performance  from  the  people 
 you're  trying  to  lead  make  them  happy  to
[56:00] do  so  think  to  yourself  what's  in  it  for 
 them  right  now  this  is  actually  a  very 
 interesting  point  most  of  the  behaviors
[56:07] that  we  want  to  influence  onto  other 
 people  are  forms  of  delayed 
 classification  like  working  hard  or
[56:12] going  to  the  gym  these  activities  do  pay 
 off  in  the  long  run  but  right  now  they
[56:17] are  uncomfortable  the  beginners  don't 
 really  feel  happy  to  be  there  in  that
[56:22] moment  so  to  make  them  happy  to  do  what 
 we  want  them  to  do  we  may  have  to  offer 
 some  kind  of  instant  gratification
[56:28] incentive  so  if  you're  a  personal 
 trainer  who's  very  close  to  your  clients 
 you  could  offer  to  pick  them  up  and
[56:34] drive  them  to  the  gym  with  you  this 
 makes  it  way  more  convenient  for  them  to 
 do  today's  session  if  you're  a  teacher
[56:39] reward  great  Behavior  with  some  kind  of 
 tree  like  letting  the  students  leave  the 
 room  one  or  two  minutes  early  so  that
[56:45] they  can  get  ahead  of  the  lunch  or  the 
 break  line  think  and  be  creative  of  ways 
 to  make  the  other  person  happy  right  in
[56:51] this  moment  for  them  to  carry  out  the 
 vital  behaviors  that  you  want  them  to 
 I'm  grateful  that  you  reached  this  far  I
[56:57] want  to  say  again  that  this  book  has 
 positively  impacted  my  life  and  if  you 
 reach  this  far  I'm  guessing  it's  done
[57:02] the  same  thing  for  you  social  skills  are 
 ever  more  important  and  having  the 
 ability  to  manage  people  to  become  a
[57:08] leader  to  influence  a  behavior  change  in

 Adonis 
 Adonis  is  at  work  serving  more  customers
[00:21] in  his  business  and  his  phone  vibrates 
 it's  Anastasia  but  Adonis  doesn't  even 
 hear  it  his  phone  isn't  even  on  him  once
[00:28] he's  completed  two  90-minute  deep  work 
 sessions  he  goes  to  the  gym  first  and 
 then  he  sees  the  text  from  Anastasia  he
[00:35] smiles  what  a  great  woman  ask  yourself 
 this  question  and  really  be  honest  are 
 you  ready  for  a  relationship  if  you  are
[00:41] then  now  is  the  time  to  really  think 
 about  the  character  and  the  traits  of 
 the  girl  that  you  want  to  date  but  you
[00:47] should  also  just  take  some  time  to  think 
 of  the  negative  things  that  you  don't 
 want  in  a  relationship  so  he  has  nine
[00:52] red  flags  that  I  can  think  of  that  you 
 might  just  want  to  consider  number  one 
 if  she  doesn't  believe  in  your  work  a
[00:58] masculine  man  experiences  Freedom 
 through  his  work  and  when  you  get  those 
 things  and  you  especially  become  more
[01:03] masculine  it  becomes  so  important  to 
 have  a  feminine  Woman  by  your  side  who 
 believes  in  your  work  if  you  are  with  a
[01:09] girl  right  now  who  doesn't  really  care 
 about  the  thing  that  you  do  your  work 
 your  studies  that  big  goal  that  you  have
[01:14] you  might  not  be  that  compatible  you 
 want  her  to  be  your  number  one  biggest 
 fan  and  you  want  her  to  be  your
[01:20] cheerleader  if  she  doesn't  really  care 
 or  take  much  of  an  interest  in  your  work 
 you  might  just  want  to  evaluate  some
[01:25] things  the  second  red  flag  that  I  am 
 sure  literally  100  of  guys  and  even 
 girls  would  agree  on  is  your  partner
[01:31] being  addicted  to  social  media  now  we 
 know  the  dangers  of  social  media  we  know
[01:36] that  it  literally  just  [ __ ]  up  a 
 person's  mental  health  but  it  will  also 
 create  a  huge  negative  impact  on  your
[01:42] relationship  because  when  she  is  on 
 social  media  when  she's  Snapchatting 
 some  random  people  and  some  of  them  are
[01:47] guys  when  she's  following  50  100  200 
 attractive  guys  on  Instagram  and  she's 
 seen  all  these  like  fitness  models  she
[01:53] can't  help  but  compare  you  to  them  and 
 100  We  should  strive  for  competition  we 
 should  you  know  keep  working  on
[01:58] ourselves  but  social  media  starts  to 
 create  like  this  unfair  comparison  you
[02:03] know  that  Grass  Is  Always  Greener  you 
 don't  want  a  girl  who's  just  constantly 
 looking  at  guys  who  are  more  attractive
[02:08] than  you  more  successful  than  you  guys 
 that  she  can't  really  even  get  anyway 
 but  her  brain  just  can't  help  looking  at
[02:14] you  and  just  comparing  you  to  like  the 
 the  tick  tock  boy  that  she's  following 
 or  the  guy  that  like  she  says  it's  just
[02:19] a  friend  on  Snapchat  I  think  social 
 media  breeds  just  the  worst  kind  of  like 
 person  and  at  least  for  me  you  may  want
[02:26] to  implement  this  or  maybe  not  this  is 
 an  iron  rule  for  me  that  the  girl  that  I 
 date  has  no  social  media  presence  she
[02:32] can  have  a  very  limited  private  account 
 on  Instagram  or  on  Facebook  or  you  know
[02:37] WhatsApp  is  fine  obviously  but  she  is 
 not  having  like  some  kind  of  public 
 Instagram  page  where  random  people  can
[02:42] follow  her  and  see  her  pictures  she's 
 not  having  like  a  [ __ ]  Snapchat  or 
 especially  not  you  can  say  this  is  crazy 
 or  whatever  but  she's  not  having  Tick
[02:48] Tock  downloaded  on  a  phone  that  is  like 
 an  absolute  like  if  my  girl  downloaded 
 tiktok  and  refused  to  like  delete  it  if
[02:53] you  know  I  I  sold  it  like  wait  that's 
 weird  you  can't  like  you  shouldn't  have 
 that  and  she  refused  I  would  break  up
[02:58] with  her  on  the  spot  that's  how  serious 
 I  am  about  social  media  and  I  know  a  lot 
 of  people  think  I'm  crazy  but  once
[03:03] you've  done  a  little  bit  more  research 
 into  these  social  media  apps  and  how 
 they  [ __ ]  up  a  person's  mental  health
[03:08] they  just  [ __ ]  the  entire  person's  mind 
 as  you  become  more  of  like  a  prominent 
 successful  man  you  start  to  have  like  a
[03:14] zero  tolerance  for  anything  that  starts 
 to  like  strip  your  data  away  from  you 
 maybe  you're  not  at  that  point  just  yet
[03:19] but  like  hopefully  you  can  kind  of  you 
 know  learn  from  me  in  this  sense  just 
 know  that  as  you  become  more  successful 
 you  become  very  very  exclusive  with  the
[03:26] apps  that  you  download  because  you  don't 
 want  your  data  being  stolen  I  have  a 
 friend  who's  younger  than  me  and  is 
 worth  literally  more  than  10  million
[03:32] dollars  and  I  have  to  give  props  to  Iman 
 because  he's  teaching  this  kind  of  like 
 knowledge  on  how  to  become  more
[03:37] masculine  how  to  make  more  money  for 
 free  and  I'm  even  gonna  join  him  in  an 
 event  like  the  first  time  I'm  doing  like
[03:42] a  guest  speaking  collaboration  it's  the 
 top  Link  in  the  description  you'll  learn 
 how  to  become  more  free  become  more
[03:47] masculine  and  to  make  more  money  and  I 
 think  a  huge  element  of  why 
 relationships  and  dating  seem  so  [ __ ]
[03:52] in  this  modern  day  is  mostly  because  of 
 social  media  and  so  if  you're  dating  a 
 girl  and  to  her  it's  like  crazy  that
[03:57] you'd  even  suggest  that  deletes  it  she's 
 almost  voluntarily  harming  your 
 relationship  just  for  the  dopamine  that
[04:03] she  can  get  from  this  now  she's  not  a 
 bad  person  for  this  honestly  she's  not  a 
 bad  person  she's  just  an  addict  and  I
[04:08] know  that  sounds  like  an  insult  but  it 
 is  the  case  she  is  literally  just  an 
 addict  who  doesn't  realize  how  bad  that
[04:13] thing  is  for  the  relationship  just  the 
 same  as  an  alcoholic  who  can't  stop 
 drinking  it's  the  exact  same  effect  and
[04:19] I'm  spending  so  long  on  this  second  red 
 flag  just  because  this  is  I  think  is  the
[04:24] single  worst  one  that  you  could  have  in 
 a  girl  that  you're  dating  I  I  think  that 
 this  is  something  that  is  worth  you
[04:29] putting  your  foot  down  and  actually 
 having  like  a  just  a  golden  rule  that 
 you  follow  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 that  you  will  not  date  any  girl  who's
[04:35] addicted  to  social  media  perhaps  you  can 
 have  an  account  perhaps  that's  fine  but 
 she  cannot  be  a  girl  who's  on  it  for
[04:40] more  than  an  hour  a  day  red  flag  number 
 three  she's  not  grateful  now  gratitude 
 is  an  amazing  life-changing  skill  that
[04:47] we  can  all  level  up  we  can  express  more 
 gratitude  we  can  take  time  to  for 
 example  journal  the  things  that  we're
[04:52] grateful  for  or  we  can  write  letters  of 
 gratitude  and  that's  an  amazing  thing  to 
 have  in  a  relationship  you  want  your
[04:58] girl  to  feel  grateful  for  you  for  her 
 family  for  everything  around  her  for  the 
 smallest  things  for  you  know  the
[05:04] waitress  or  the  waiter  that  comes  and 
 serves  you  guys  in  a  restaurant  you 
 don't  want  her  to  be  ungrateful  now  she
[05:09] doesn't  have  to  be  extremely  you  know 
 like  weirdly  randomly  grateful  fine  but 
 you  don't  want  her  to  be  an  ungrateful 
 person  you  don't  want  her  to  be  entitled
[05:15] because  when  someone  is  entitled  man  or 
 woman  it  does  start  to  just  destroy 
 elements  of  the  relationship  Dale
[05:21] Carnegie  is  one  of  the  most  important 
 self-improvements  writers  like  self-help 
 writers  and  he  said  before  that  like
[05:26] praise  and  encouragement  are  just 
 vitally  needed  in  relationships  praise
[05:31] is  kind  of  like  oxygen  for  plants  he 
 gave  an  analogy  like  that  which
[05:36] essentially  insinuated  like  praise  is 
 absolutely  essential  for  cultivating
[05:41] good  relationships  and  so  you  want  the 
 girl  that  you're  dating  to  be  able  to 
 feel  grateful  for  the  things  that  you  do
[05:46] with  her  and  for  her  red  flag  number 
 four  I'm  gonna  get  a  little  bit  more 
 controversial  with  these  ones  now
[05:51] because  I  could  create  like  a  very 
 politically  correct  video  and  it 
 probably  it  would  get  more  views  and 
 more  people  would  like  me  if  I  just  told
[05:57] you  like  you  know  the  basic  advice  but 
 I'm  going  to  start  to  get  into  the  real 
 controversial  stuff  which  a  lot  of 
 people  won't  actually  speak  to  you  about
[06:03] but  I'm  going  to  speak  to  you  as  if 
 you're  just  my  little  bro  and  I'm  going 
 to  tell  you  like  if  you  told  me  that  you 
 like  this  girl  and  that  you're  starting
[06:08] to  date  her  seriously  and  you  showed  me 
 a  picture  of  her  for  example  I  will  tell 
 you  the  truth  it  is  a  red  flag  when  a
[06:14] girl  has  colorful  hair  and  lots  and  lots 
 of  piercings  this  is  controversial  as 
 [ __ ]  because  seems  like  wait  why  is  that
[06:19] a  red  flag  generally  a  woman  dying  her 
 hair  to  these  like  abnormal  hair  colors 
 like  red  or  blue  or  pink  and  also  having
[06:26] like  a  bunch  of  piercings  that  kind  of 
 action  correlates  a  lot  with  her  being 
 more  promiscuous  that  should  be  a  red
[06:32] flag  in  itself  to  be  honest  I'm  not 
 gonna  lie  to  it  is  a  woman  who's 
 promiscuous  a  woman  who  has  slept  around 
 it  and  sort  of  like  dated  a  lot  of  guys
[06:38] that  is  the  single  greatest  red  flag  for 
 the  overwhelming  majority  of  men  who 
 have  the  confidence  to  admit  it  to
[06:44] themselves  but  we're  not  really  allowed 
 to  speak  about  this  now  women  are 
 allowed  to  say  this  about  us  women  are 
 allowed  to  say  like  oh  if  he's  a  [ __ ]
[06:50] boy  you  know  if  he  [ __ ]  lots  of  girls 
 I'm  not  interested  fair  enough  and 
 they're  you  know  fair  enough  if  you're 
 not  attracted  to  a  kind  of  like  I'm
[06:55] saying  this  to  a  woman  if  she's  not 
 attracted  to  the  guy  who's  sleeping 
 around  yeah  fair  enough  okay  you're 
 empowered  to  have  that  decision  then  we
[07:00] should  also  be  empowered  to  know  that 
 the  majority  of  guys  can't  really  take  a
[07:06] girl  seriously  when  she  has  had  a 
 promiscuous  past  which  sucks  because 
 it's  in  her  past  maybe  she's  changed  but
[07:11] if  she  slept  around  with  a  bunch  of  guys 
 if  she's  like  been  [ __ ]  by  like  some 
 guys  that  you  know  or  if  she's  got  like
[07:17] a  bit  of  a  reputation  about  her  if  she's 
 done  some  like  very  degenerate  thing 
 like  [ __ ]  two  different  guys  in  the
[07:23] same  day  it  was  you  know  just  something 
 like  that  which  like  gives  you  a  gut 
 punching  feeling  if  like  I  know  this
[07:28] video  is  getting  all  muddled  up  but  like 
 you  can  see  this  is  the  point  which  we 
 really  need  to  talk  about  most  of  the
[07:33] biggest  worst  red  flags  in  women  really 
 do  come  down  to  her  sexual  history  and
[07:39] like  the  actions  that  she's  been  which 
 relate  to  that  so  red  flag  number  four 
 was  like  piercings  and  tattoos  but  we'll
[07:44] just  move  on  to  Red  Flag  number  five 
 which  is  promiscuity  sexual  history 
 sexual  past  and  like  just  specifically
[07:50] like  we're  not  we're  not  shaming  them  we 
 are  not  shaming  them  we're  not  saying 
 that  they're  bad  people  we're  just
[07:55] saying  that  at  least  you  know  for  me  and 
 potentially  for  you  because  we  seem  to 
 be  kind  of  similar  it's  just  not
[08:00] something  that  we  can  find  acceptable  in 
 a  relationship  it's  just  not  something 
 that  makes  us  feel  good  it  is  something
[08:06] that  makes  us  feel  bad  some  people  might 
 say  that  we're  insecure  for  this  we're 
 insecure  or  we've  got  like  small  dick
[08:11] energy  on  they'll  try  and  shame  us  for 
 having  this  opinion  but  it  is  kind  of 
 like  a  universal  feeling  for  just  men  to
[08:17] feel  a  little  bit  like  just 
 reports  disgusted  whenever  you  hear  like
[08:22] your  girl's  sexual  history  now  I'm  not 
 talking  about  some  random  girl  that  you 
 know  you  just  want  to  [ __ ]  as  well  I'm 
 not  talking  about  that  I'm  talking  about
[08:27] a  girl  that  you  really  want  to  fall  in 
 love  with  and  have  children  with  and  you 
 know  you  want  to  take  Serious  it  [ __ ]
[08:32] hurts  bro  because  when  I  was  19  and  I 
 got  into  my  first  ever  serious 
 relationship  for  girl  I  lost  my
[08:37] virginity  to  she  was  four  years  older 
 than  me  she  was  23.  so  I'm  19.  she's  23. 
 I'm  literally  doing  the  sexual  stuff  for
[08:43] the  first  time  ever  and  she  wasn't  she'd 
 had  from  what  I  remember  two  boyfriends 
 before  me  and  also  she  said  two  hookups
[08:49] as  well  so  two  boyfriends  two  hookups 
 she  had  a  body  count  of  four  at  23  which 
 isn't  bad  at  all  honestly  that's 
 actually  like  on  the  low  end  four  guys
[08:55] that  she  had  slept  with  at  age  23  and 
 you  know  what  was  very  interesting  which 
 I  think  will  explain  to  us  that  this  is
[09:00] not  insecurity  I  never  once  felt 
 negative  about  the  two  boyfriends  that 
 she  had  had  before  me  and  obviously  she
[09:06] would  have  like  slept  with  them  I  never 
 really  thought  about  those  guys  honestly 
 it  never  like  played  on  my  mind  but  I'm
[09:12] gonna  tell  you  the  truth  which  might  you 
 know  make  someone  laugh  at  me  knowing 
 that  my  first  ever  girlfriend  who  I  lost
[09:17] my  virginity  to  who  you  know  was  my 
 every  when  I  was  19  years  old  knowing 
 that  she  had  had  two  hookups  before  me
[09:22] two  guys  that  shadow  one  night  stand 
 with  two  guys  that  had  [ __ ]  her 
 without  even  like  knowing  her  much  that
[09:27] broke  my  [ __ ]  heart  that  really  gave 
 me  like  a  gut  punch  feeling  that 
 whenever  I  would  think  about  it  and  I
[09:32] would  think  about  it  often  I  would  be  in 
 pain  and  when  I  did  hear  about  this  like 
 I  could  never  like  look  at  her  the  same
[09:39] way  and  I  don't  think  it's  insecurity 
 because  I  didn't  feel  that  way  about  her 
 previous  boyfriends  that's  the  thing 
 it's  like  if  a  girl  has  gotten  into  like
[09:45] a  very  serious  loving  relationship  and 
 then  it  doesn't  work  out  and  obviously 
 she  had  sex  with  a  guy  it's  like  if  for
[09:50] some  reason  that  doesn't  like  hurt  us 
 anywhere  near  as  much  as  just  like 
 visualizing  your  girl  like  getting
[09:55] dressed  up  with  her  friends  shaving  and 
 then  going  out  to  like  get  [ __ ]  by 
 some  random  guy  that  she  didn't  even
[10:01] like  like  and  uh  to  then  just  like  do 
 the  [ __ ]  what  you  know  the  like  the  sort 
 of  Walk  of  Shame  home  I'm  not  saying
[10:07] that  you  know  she's  be  shameful  but  like 
 that  hurts  us  a  lot  more  than  we  think 
 that  she  just  replied  to  some  random 
 guys  DMS  and  he  [ __ ]  her  the  same
[10:13] night  that  hurts  us  a  lot  more  than 
 thinking  that  she  just  had  a  boyfriend 
 before  us  then  red  flag  number  six  and
[10:18] this  is  a  very  personal  one  for  me  but  I 
 think  again  a  lot  of  guys  could  relate 
 and  it's  very  similar  to  what  we've  just 
 discussed  and  this  is  also  one  that  a
[10:24] lot  of  girls  hate  me  for  and  this  red 
 flag  is  that  she  has  promiscuous  friends 
 so  I've  spoke  about  this  before  and  I've
[10:30] received  quite  a  lot  of  like  hate 
 comments  saying  like  oh  how  can  you 
 judge  her  on  you  know  some  other  people 
 how  is  like  the  people  that  is  in  her
[10:35] life  that's  not  her  fault  but  like  it  is 
 you  know  me  and  you  we  hold  ourselves 
 accountable  and  we  say  to  each  other  we
[10:40] are  the  average  of  the  five  people  that 
 we  spend  time  with  we  say  that  phrase  to 
 ourselves  don't  we  go  the  average  of  the
[10:45] people  that  you  spend  time  with  and  so 
 if  I  can  criticize  you  like  the  young 
 man  watching  this  if  I  can  criticize  you
[10:50] for  being  friends  with  some  loser  who's 
 kind  of  dragging  you  down  and  you  know 
 we  should  of  course  try  to  bring  our
[10:56] friends  up  but  let's  say  this  guy  is 
 like  totally  fine  with  being  a  Jeffrey 
 he's  unambitious  he  doesn't  even  care 
 he's  like  being  mean  to  you  and
[11:01] everything  he's  like  roasting  you  if  you 
 keep  being  friends  with  him  the  thing  is 
 like  I  am  somewhat  allowed  to  like  view
[11:07] you  a  bit  negative  for  that  because  I'm 
 thinking  okay  his  friends  you  know  your 
 friend  is  a  Jeffrey  but  then  if  you're
[11:12] still  really  good  friends  with  him  then 
 you're  probably  a  bit  of  a  Jeffrey  too 
 you  have  to  be  right  well  your  girl  can 
 seem  like  a  really  good  girl  to  you  but
[11:19] if  you  can  see  the  behaviors  of  her 
 friends  and  her  friends  are  really 
 [ __ ]  and  they're  on  like  Tinder  and 
 they're  going  out  and  hooking  up  with  a
[11:25] bunch  of  guys  the  thing  is  that  your 
 girl  to  be  friends  with  that  kind  of 
 person  has  to  have  some  things  in
[11:30] similarity  she  has  to  be  somewhat 
 similar  to  that  and  you  best  believe 
 that  her  promiscuous  friends  are  gonna
[11:36] encourage  her  to  be  more  promiscuous 
 it's  just  how  it  works  and  so  we  are 
 very  like  judged  on  this  and  I  really
[11:41] don't  want  to  come  across  as  some  guy 
 who  like  hates  women  or  anything  but 
 like  this  is  something  that  is  very  like
[11:46] core  to  me  because  I  am  very  like 
 authentic  with  the  way  that  I  feel
[11:51] around  women  and  I  used  to  hide  that  a 
 long  time  ago  with  that  same  girl  that  I 
 dated  like  it  broke  my  heart  and  it  gave
[11:56] me  this  this  gut  pain  like  this  [ __ ] 
 pain  this  lump  in  my  throat  when  I'd
[12:01] heard  these  details  about  the  first  girl 
 that  I  dated  at  age  19  but  I  kept  it  to 
 myself  because  I  didn't  want  to  come
[12:06] across  as  like  you  know  insecure  or  you 
 know  hurts  I  wanted  to  like  be  really 
 stoic  I  was  never  able  to  express  these
[12:11] emotions  and  like  my  friends  didn't 
 understand  or  anything  I've  got  to  this 
 level  of  development  and  like  confidence
[12:16] and  you  know  Independence  in  myself  now 
 where  like  if  I  feel  a  level  of  like 
 repulsed  to  a  girl  because  I  do  not  hear
[12:22] something  of  a  past  or  I  see  that  her 
 friends  are  like  quite  low  quality 
 people  who  you  know  taking  drugs  or
[12:28] something  then  like  I  hold  that  true 
 does  that  make  sense  like  I  stay 
 authentic  to  this  feeling  I  don't  push 
 it  down  because  some  other  people  tell
[12:34] me  that  I'm  being  like  sexist  about  it 
 because  if  that's  how  I  feel  then  that 
 is  clearly  a  part  of  my  values  and  we
[12:39] should  always  stick  to  our  values  and  so 
 the  sixth  red  flag  is  such  a 
 controversial  one  because  you  must  know
[12:45] that  if  she  has  friends  who  sleep  around 
 or  do  some  kind  of  activity  that  you 
 really  don't  like  like  it  is  going  to  be
[12:51] influencing  your  girl  now  chances  are  if 
 your  girl  like  really  falls  in  love  with
[12:56] you  she  will  be  more  influenced  by  you 
 than  she  would  be  by  her  female  friends 
 but  it's  still  just  a  massive  extra  risk
[13:03] to  add  to  your  relationship  and  so  the 
 next  red  flag  red  flag  number  seven  is 
 very  similar  to  the  these  yes  again  and
[13:08] this  red  flag  is  that  she  drinks  does 
 drugs  or  that  she's  in  a  very  degenerate
[13:13] environment  and  the  reason  for  this  is 
 twofold  right  one  this  is  just  you  know 
 bad  habits  it's  like  drinking  taking
[13:18] drugs  staying  up  late  partying  and  stuff 
 those  are  like  somewhat  bad  habits  and 
 you  know  they  can  be  fine  in  moderation
[13:23] but  generally  we  do  see  them  as  like  bad 
 and  some  gratification  dopamine 
 activities  but  again  it's  controversial
[13:30] as  [ __ ]  but  these  things  drinking  taking 
 drugs  partying  and  going  to  nights  out 
 and  stuff  those  things  generally  do  lead
[13:35] to  the  earlier  issues  of  promiscuously 
 if  a  woman  is  going  on  a  bunch  of  nights
[13:40] out  into  you  know  the  club  are  we  bad 
 people  for  saying  like  we'd  probably 
 trust  her  less  the  thing  is  you  know
[13:45] it's  nice  to  be  able  to  feel  like  you 
 can  trust  your  partner  fine  but  the 
 thing  is  I  think  and  this  is 
 controversial  as  [ __ ]  but  I  think  you
[13:50] kind  of  have  to  be  a  little  bit  of  a 
 broken  man  to  trust  a  woman  who  is  doing 
 these  things  like  you  know  she's  going
[13:56] out  partying  and  clubbing  I  think  you 
 have  to  be  a  little  bit  broken  as  a  man 
 to  trust  your  woman  when  she's  going  out 
 as  into  these  environments  because  bro
[14:02] those  environments  the  drinking 
 environment  the  drug  environment  parties 
 nightclubs  those  invite  environments  are
[14:08] where  people  [ __ ]  those  environments  are 
 where  people  cheat  to  think  that  you're 
 like  you're  the  girl  who's  your
[14:13] everything  the  girl  you're  in  love  with 
 is  getting  into  those  environments  or 
 she  wants  to she  wants  to  go  partying
[14:18] and  enjoy  herself  there's  reasons  for 
 that  now  it  can  be  a  fun  environment  to 
 go  and  you  know  just  let  loose  and  just
[14:24] go  wild  and  you  know  enjoy  yourself  and 
 drink  and  stuff  but  generally  that 
 environment  is  quite  fun  because  of  the
[14:30] inclination  that  someone  of  the  opposite 
 sex  is  there  does  that  make  sense  it's 
 like  before  a  party  or  a  nightclub  both
[14:36] the  guy  and  the  girl  spend  quite  a  lot 
 of  time  getting  ready  and  like  and  it's 
 a  very  horny  Primal  environment  and  this
[14:42] is  where  like  the  cheating  happens  this 
 is  where  like  the  [ __ ]  happens  for  a 
 lot  of  people  this  is  where  people  [ __ ]
[14:47] and  to  think  that  like  you'd  be  okay 
 with  your  girl  to  go  in  this  environment 
 because  you're  also  confident  I  don't
[14:52] think  it's  confidence  I  just  think  it's 
 it's  like  stupidity  or  ignorance  I 
 personally  would  never  accept  that  if  a
[14:58] girl  who  I  was  dating  wanted  to  go  on  a 
 night  out  or  a  party  or  something  it's 
 like  straight  away  like  I  wouldn't  even 
 like  say  that  she  couldn't  go  if  she  was
[15:04] serious  about  wanting  to  go  it's  like  it 
 would  just  show  that  we're  not 
 compatible  because  I  don't  do  that  stuff 
 anymore  now  I  have  done  and  so  if  she's
[15:10] done  those  things  previously  it's  kind 
 of  like  you  know  I  still  don't  like  it 
 but  fair  enough  I  I  did  them  previously
[15:15] but  if  she  wants  to  do  them  now  if  she 
 wants  to  go  to  some  like  [ __ ]  party 
 or  something  I  said  bro  that's  that's 
 not  me  and  so  clearly  we're  not
[15:21] compatible  I  I  would  end  with  a  girl 
 right  there  right  then  and  I  have  done 
 this  previously  two  years  ago  or  one  and
[15:26] a  half  years  ago  I  dated  a  girl  who 
 still  wanted  to  go  on  to  like  girls 
 nights  out  and  go  drinking  with  their
[15:31] friends  and  I  ended  up  right  there  and 
 it  was  painful  as  [ __ ]  and  I  was  called 
 controlling  I  was  called  a  groomer  I  was
[15:37] called  manipulative  I  was  gaslit  the 
 [ __ ]  from  this  girl  her  family  from  like 
 people  in  the  comments  when  I  spoke
[15:42] about  it  on  YouTube  but  I  look  back  to 
 that  moment  one  and  a  half years  ago 
 when  I  broke  up  a  relationship  just
[15:47] because  she  wanted  to  go  out  drinking 
 with  her  friends  and  I  bro  I  know  I  did 
 the  right  thing  red  flag  number  eight
[15:52] she  has  a  bad  relationship  with  her 
 parents  and  especially  her  father  now  a
[15:57] girl  can  quite  often  fall  out  with  her 
 mom  and  you  know  get  like  angry  at  each 
 other  that  sometimes  does  happen  and  it
[16:02] is  a  little  bit  normal  but  the 
 relationship  that  she  has  with  her 
 father  is  particularly  interesting  and
[16:07] as  you  guys  little  bit  older  you'll 
 really  really  value  like  this  this 
 indicator  of  like  the  quality  of  this
[16:13] girl  is  you'll  look  at  their 
 relationship  and  particularly  which  is 
 painful  to  say  it's  controversial  again 
 but  like  you're  particularly  look  if  the
[16:19] father  is  even  in  the  home  which  it's  so 
 [ __ ]  weird  but  like  the  majority  of 
 girls  that  you  may  date  their  parents
[16:25] may  not  be  together  and  their  father 
 will  not  be  in  the  home  and  this  is  a 
 general  statement  which  I'm  about  to  say 
 it's  controversial  again  so  it's  one  of
[16:31] those  things  that  we're  not  supposed  to 
 talk  about  but  generally  how  your 
 parents  interacted  with  you  and  each
[16:37] other  when  you  were  a  child  is  also  the 
 kind  of  Love  That  We  crave  when  we're 
 older  so  so  if  the  girl  that  you  like  if
[16:43] her  parents  split  up  when  she  was  young 
 and  she  saw  for  example  her  mom  break  up 
 with  her  father  and  kick  him  out  of  the
[16:49] house  and  then  she  saw  for  example  her 
 mum  stop  bringing  in  boyfriends  who  were 
 railing  her  like  if  she  saw  that  stuff
[16:55] she's  not  bound  you  know  she's  not 
 destined  to  live  the  same  life  but  we  do 
 generally  crave  the  kind  of  familiar
[17:01] love  that  we  saw  in  our  parents  honestly 
 even  though  it  sounds  [ __ ]  up  it's 
 like  once  you've  learned  this  fact  maybe
[17:06] you're  thinking  wait  no  no that's  not 
 true  or  something  once  you  really  learn 
 this  fact  and  you  open  your  brain  up  to
[17:11] just  seeing  this  in  the  real  world 
 you'll  see  how  [ __ ]  this  actually  is 
 you  will  see  people  who  will  literally 
 get  into  the  exact  same  kind  of
[17:17] relationship  as  their  parents  even 
 though  that  person  hated  the 
 relationship  that  their  parents  were  and
[17:22] you  will  see  a  girl  who  was  raised  by  a 
 single  mother  end  up  becoming  a  single 
 mother  herself  you  will  see  a  boy  who
[17:27] was  raised  by  an  abusive  father  become 
 an  abusive  father  himself  it  takes  a 
 great  deal  of  self-improvement  to  change
[17:33] this  honestly  it  takes  like  changing 
 your  life  you  don't  realize  like  how 
 deep  into  your  psyche  you  have  to  go  to
[17:40] like  stop  the  the  future  trajectory  of 
 becoming  more  like  your  parents  and 
 trust  me  when  I  say  not  that  I'm  better
[17:45] than  anyone  else  both  but  like  I  have 
 put  in  a  lot  of  effort  into  my 
 self-improvement  journey  a  lot  and  I  am
[17:50] still  not  certain  that  I  won't  end  up 
 like  my  parents  I  have  the  humility  to 
 admit  that  right  now  that  I've  like  been
[17:55] on  self-improvement  full  time  and  I 
 still  I'm  not  certain  that  I  will  not
[18:00] end  up  like  my  parents  so  if  I'm  saying 
 that  bro  if  I'm  saying  that  and  I've 
 like  literally  I've  been  like  employed
[18:06] like  it's  my  business  to  to  Beyond 
 self-improvement  full-time  there's  not 
 many  people  who  are  improving  as  like  as 
 fast  as  I  am  because  I  don't  have  a  job
[18:12] like  this  is  my  job  my  job's  just  being 
 on  self-improvement  right  so  there's  not 
 many  people  who  can  match  my  rates  of
[18:17] like  you  know  discovering  yourself  and 
 everything  and  chances  are  that  when  you 
 meet  your  woman's  family  or  you  kind  of 
 hear  about  them  she  will  end  up  being
[18:23] very  similar  to  her  mother  and  red  flag 
 number  nine  this  took  me  a  while  to 
 realize  even  though  it's  just  common
[18:29] sense  she's  a  bit  of  a  loser  now  I  don't 
 say  that  to  be  disrespectful  but  if  we
[18:34] categorize  or  Define  what  being  a  loser 
 means  we'd  probably  say  like  yes  being  a 
 Jeffrey  being  someone  who  doesn't  really
[18:39] do  anything  with  their  lives  who  eats 
 junk  food  who  maybe  takes  drugs  who  just 
 spends  all  day  watching  Netflix  or
[18:45] scrolling  on  their  phone  the  thing  is  we 
 have  almost  like  a  detest  especially  if 
 we  are  Jeffrey  right  we  don't  want  to  be
[18:50] like  Jeffrey  anymore  we  don't  want  to  be 
 losers  anymore  we  don't  even  want  to  be 
 friends  with  losers  anymore  we  don't 
 like  guys  who  are  Jeffries  or  losers
[18:56] because  we've  just  got  not  much  to 
 relate  to  them  right  what's  interesting 
 is  that  a  lot  of  guys  don't  hold  that
[19:01] same  standard  with  the  girls  that  they 
 date  and  I  was  just  like  this  I  got  onto 
 self-improvement  and  started  doing  all
[19:07] of  the  good  habits  meditating  reading 
 studying  working  hard  on  a  business 
 going  to  the  gym  eating  clean  stopping
[19:13] porn  and  video  games  and  just  watching 
 random  [ __ ]  on  Netflix  or  on  TV  I  did 
 all  that  and  I  didn't  really  hold  the
[19:19] girls  that  I  would  date  onto  the  same 
 standards  I  remember  I  dated  like  a 
 couple  of  girls  who  like  it  kind  of  took
[19:24] me  a  while  to  realize  like  oh  yeah  like 
 she's  kind  of  like  a  Jeffrey  like  and  it 
 just  made  me  cringe  when  I  thought  like
[19:29] she  literally  just  spends  her  days  on 
 social  media  and  just  watching  Netflix 
 but  I  never  really  considered  that  I
[19:34] should  hold  her  to  a  higher  standard 
 just  like  I  would  myself  or  my  male 
 friends  just  because  it  seems  like  a  lot
[19:39] of  girls  just  do  live  like  a  Jeffrey 
 like  a  Jessica  don't  they  do  they  just 
 kind  of  like  just  go  on  Tick  Tock  every
[19:44] day  and  that's  a  red  flag  because  if  you 
 did  respect  yourself  if  younger  me 
 respected  himself  if  we  were  truly
[19:50] masculine  men  like  the  superior  kind  of 
 man  if  we  were  like  that  we  would  not 
 settle  for  mediocracy  into  our  lives  we
[19:57] could  not  expect  anything  less  than 
 Excellence  from  anyone  in  our  life  and 
 if  you  respect  yourself  that  much  you
[20:03] wouldn't  even  consider  being  in  a 
 relationship  with  the  kind  of  girl  who 
 like  you  realize  like  she  doesn't
[20:08] actually  have  that  many  good  habits  and 
 she  just  like  wakes  up  late  and  this 
 reminds  me  of  a  story  so  after  that  you 
 know  the  first  girl  that  I  dated  when  I
[20:14] was  19  years  old  me  and  her  eventually 
 broke  up  and  around  like  one  and  a  half 
 months  after  I  remember  I  started  seeing
[20:19] like  the  second  girl  that  I'd  ever  slept 
 with  and  this  girl  like  it  was  so  weird
[20:24] because  I  didn't  realize  at  the  time  but 
 like  I  kind  of  rebound  I  didn't  know 
 what  rebound  was  but  rebounding  is  kind
[20:29] of  like  you  know  when  you're  going 
 through  heartbreak  and  you  kind  of  like 
 attach  yourself  to  a  new  person  and  so 
 this  random  like  other  girl  I  eventually
[20:35] like  started  dating  her  and  sleeping 
 with  her  and  I  remember  telling  my 
 friend  like  overall  she's  she's  perfect 
 this  girl  like  this  this  new  girl  is  so
[20:41] perfect  oh  my  God  she's  so  amazing  and 
 my  friend  was  just  always  like  he  never 
 really  spoke  to  me  about  this  but  I
[20:46] remember  he'd  always  just  give  me  like  a 
 weird  look  like  oh  yeah  and  I  remember 
 that  this  second  girl  that  I  ever  slept
[20:52] with  when  I  was  like  19  years  old  who  I 
 started  to  date  she  was  like  a  total 
 Jeffrey  and  I  don't  say  this  to  insult 
 her  but  like  with  her  I  literally  got
[20:58] depressed  because  spending  time  with  her 
 and  him  like  you  know  she  would  do  no 
 good  habits  she  would  do  nothing
[21:03] productive  with  the  day  she'd  literally 
 just  kind  of  like  sit  around  and  just 
 watch  Netflix  and  food  I  remember  there
[21:08] were  so  many  days  that  me  and  this  girl 
 would  literally  just  order  food  at  like 
 1am  2  A.M  eat  till  like  3  A.M  literally
[21:14] just  eating  food  watching  [ __ ]  on  like 
 our  phones  and  laptops  I  remember  so 
 often  that  when  I  would  sleep  around  her
[21:19] place  like  her  student  accommodation 
 we'd  both  wake  up  at  like  3  P.M  bro  we'd 
 literally  wake  up  at  3  P.M  I  check  my
[21:24] phone  and  instantly  just  feel  depressed 
 like  the  entire  day  is  just  [ __ ]  gone 
 I've  got  to  go  to  the  gym  and  by  the
[21:29] time  I'm  finished  with  the  gym  it's 
 gonna  be  dark  outside  I  remember  just 
 feeling  so  [ __ ]  depressed  and  like 
 but  thinking  this  girl  was  so  perfect
[21:34] and  I  wish  someone  just  kind  of  sat  me 
 down  like  a  big  brother  just  sat  me  down 
 and  said  okay  evaluate  her  habits  really
[21:39] tell  me  what  are  our  habits  like  because 
 if  I  actually  answer  that  question  and  I 
 said  okay  um  she  uh  she  likes  to  eat
[21:47] food  she  likes  to  stay  up  late  she  likes 
 to  watch  stuff  on  Netflix  she  likes  to 
 gossip  and  get  into  drama  with  her
[21:53] friends  and  she  likes  to  party  and  go 
 out  and  take  some  drugs 
 if  I  thought  about  this  critically  I
[21:59] would  have  probably  ended  that  sort  of 
 dating  situation  a  lot  faster  and  I  wish 
 someone  really  told  me  about  that  red
[22:05] flag  I  really  hope  this  video  doesn't 
 come  across  as  like  me  hating  on  women 
 because  I've  done  a  lot  of  videos  where
[22:10] I  talk  about  like  you  know  we  should 
 strive  to  be  better  men  for  the  sake  of 
 attracting  like  good  women  into  being 
 like  a  better  fathers  and  partners  for
[22:16] them  and  I  know  that  people  can  take 
 like  a  message  quite  wrong  and  so  I 
 really  hope  that  doesn't  happen  because 
 it  is  important  to  empower  young  men
[22:23] especially  and  just  kind  of  pass  down 
 some  like  male  wisdom  to  them  and  just 
 tell  them  like  oh  yeah  like  you  know
[22:28] just  from  me  personally  to  you  like 
 these  are  some  of  my  learning  lessons 
 with  women  they're  probably  not  facts
[22:34] you  know  all  the  red  flags  that  I've 
 told  you  probably  not  a  fact  but  just 
 this  is  my  wisdom  my  experience  passing 
 on  to  you  just  so  you  can  like  equip
[22:39] yourself  with  some  more  knowledge  and  it 
 might  help  you  you  remember  that  rich

"
OriS-jCPgGc,"[00:00] jeffrey  says  there's  nothing  wrong  with 
 fapping  it's  good  for  you  it  reduces 
 your  risk  of  prostate  cancer  just  trust
[00:05] me  and  watching  porn  increases  your  one 
 rep  max  in  the  gym  but  jeffrey  doesn't 
 even  go  to  the  gym  he  spends  his  days  in
[00:11] a  smelly  bedroom  he  loses  all  of  his 
 masculine  drive  and  now  he  has  no  energy 
 left  to  pursue  his  goals  instead  of
[00:17] putting  in  the  effort  to  work  out 
 jeffrey  levels  up  his  strength  skill  on 
 runescape  and  instead  of  trying  to
[00:22] improve  his  looks  and  his  confidence 
 jeffrey  ruins  it  by  adopting  the 
 self-image  of  being  a  fapper  that's  the
[00:27] life  of  most  men  make  sure  you're  not  in 
 this  group  i  discovered  nofap  around  six
[00:32] to  seven  years  ago  and  it  was  hype 
 everyone  was  telling  me  about  all  the 
 benefits  i'd  get  more  testosterone  woman
[00:37] attraction  mental  clarity  girls  will 
 hold  eye  contact  with  you  but  i  went 
 through  the  same  problem  that  you're 
 probably  going  through  i'd  get  to  day
[00:43] three  or  four  and  relapse  oh  come  on 
 i've  gotta  get  to  day  90  or  at  least  day 
 seven  for  the  testosterone  boost  and
[00:48] again  day  three  or  four  and  relapse  it 
 was  frustrating  i  actually  started  to 
 feel  worse  and  more  annoyed  at  myself  on
[00:55] nofap  than  i  did  before  because  i  was 
 constantly  failing  this  goal  that  seemed 
 so  easy  for  everyone  else  i  wish  i  knew
[01:01] about  the  golden  point  of  nofap  earlier 
 adonis 
 adonis  beats  his  meat  but  not  like  that
[01:07] he's  a  farmer  a  hunter  an  old  school  man 
 adonis  was  the  first  man  to  transmutate
[01:12] sexual  energy  into  productive  goals 
 what's  other  men  are  fapping  adonis's 
 training  he  understands  that  just  as
[01:18] good  nutrition  is  fuel  for  our  bodies 
 sexual  energy  is  fuel  for  our  goals  and 
 dispelling  that  sexual  energy  by  oneself
[01:24] is  a  great  sin  indeed  adonis  tries  not 
 to  judge  but  he  can't  help  but  be  upset 
 at  the  hordes  of  men  willingly
[01:30] castrating  themselves  and  then  adonis 
 notices  the  young  men  of  nofap  here's
[01:35] the  real  benefits  of  nofap  because  most 
 of  the  nofap  videos  on  youtube  over 
 exaggerate  this  just  to  get  more  views
[01:41] number  one  and  most  importantly  it  makes 
 you  feel  like  less  of  a  loser  two  you 
 save  a  solid  few  hours  a  week  that  you
[01:46] can  now  put  into  productive  habits  like 
 sleeping  more  or  reading  three  you  feel 
 like  you  have  more  sexual  energy  that
[01:52] you  can  now  use  as  motivation  for  your 
 self-improvement  goals  four  you  begin  to 
 become  attracted  by  normal  girls  again
[01:58] and  you  stop  needing  those  [ __ ]  up 
 fetishes  and  five  you  start  getting 
 those  rock  hard  erections  easier  and
[02:03] faster  i  remember  when  i  was  a  normal 
 guy  when  i  was  flapping  it  would 
 actually  take  me  a  little  while  to  get 
 an  erection  and  sometimes  with  girls
[02:09] right  in  front  of  me  i  was  about  to  have 
 sex  and  my  dick  would  just  knock  it  hard 
 and  now  on  nofap  i  literally  get  hard
[02:14] from  eye  contact  like  seriously  if 
 there's  a  girl  i  love  who's  making  eye 
 contact  with  me  i  get  an  erection  that's
[02:19] exactly  how  it's  supposed  to  be  i've 
 mentioned  the  golden  point  of  nofap  many 
 times  on  my  channel  and  i  think  this
[02:24] hasn't  been  talked  about  on  any  other 
 youtube  video  this  is  the  hidden  key  to 
 the  success  of  nofap  and  the  reason  why
[02:29] no  nofap  youtubers  have  made  a  video  on 
 this  concept  is  because  once  you 
 understand  the  golden  point  of  nofap  you
[02:35] no  longer  ever  have  to  watch  another 
 nofap  video  that's  why  i  hardly  make  any 
 nofap  videos  on  my  channel  even  though
[02:41] they  get  the  most  views  the  golden  point 
 of  nofap  is  where  you  literally  forget 
 that  fapping  and  porn  even  exist  it's
[02:47] where  you  don't  even  think  about  it 
 getting  obsessed  about  nofap  and 
 constantly  watching  all  of  the  nofap
[02:52] benefits  timeline  videos  it's  bad  for 
 you  because  you  become  obsessed  with  it 
 and  then  it  stays  ingrained  in  your  mind
[02:57] when  you're  obsessed  with  nofap  it 
 starts  to  feel  like  a  full-time  job  like 
 when  am  i  never  next  gonna  fap  don't  fap
[03:02] don't  don't  reset  the  streak  we  want  to 
 get  to  the  golden  point  of  nofap  which 
 is  when  you  get  the  urges  you  don't  even
[03:07] associate  the  sexual  urge  with  fapping 
 anymore  you  get  that  sexual  urge  and  it
[03:12] literally  just  feels  good  to  be  a  man  so 
 how  do  you  get  to  the  golden  point  of 
 nofap  there's  two  things  you've  got  to 
 know  one  you've  got  to  have  realistic
[03:18] expectations  of  nofap  that  don't  help 
 your  mental  health  one  of  the  things 
 that  no  one  tells  you  about  nofap  is
[03:24] that  you're  supposed  to  relapse  many 
 many  many  times  when  you're  first 
 starting  out  stop  expecting  to  get  into
[03:29] nofap  and  then  expecting  it  to  be 
 perfect  straight  away  to  get  to  a  huge 
 streak  you  don't  deserve  that  right  now 
 you  have  been  leveling  up  this  habit  of
[03:35] fapping  and  watching  porn  for  like  10 
 years  it's  gonna  take  some  time  to 
 destroy  this  habit  the  most  important
[03:40] thing  is  just  try  not  to  fap  that  much 
 and  just  know  that  it  will  take  months 
 if  not  even  years  for  some  people  to  get
[03:45] to  the  point  where  they  feel  like  they 
 just  are  completely  on  nofa  and  the 
 second  thing  is  your  self-image  and  this
[03:51] is  the  part  that  a  lot  of  people  forget 
 if  you  say  that  you're  on  nofap  i  know 
 for  a  fact  that  you  will  masturbate
[03:56] again  soon  because  imagine  two  guys  at  a 
 party  one  of  them  says  oh  no  thanks  i'm 
 trying  to  quit  drinking  we  know  for  a
[04:02] fact  that  this  guy  is  gonna  fail  his 
 goal  of  quitting  alcohol  but  guy  number 
 two  says  no  thanks  i  don't  drink  this
[04:07] guy  is  way  less  likely  to  crumble 
 because  it's  ingrained  in  his  self-image 
 don't  see  yourself  as  the  guy  who's  on
[04:13] nofap  as  the  guy  who's  trying  not  to  far 
 see  yourself  as  the  guy  who  simply  just 
 does  not  fap  you're  not  trying  you  just
[04:20] don't  you're  not  on  nofap  it's  just 
 something  that  doesn't  exist  in  your 
 mind  anymore  and  to  do  that  you  have  to
[04:26] take  a  step  back  from  the  community  of 
 nofap  videos  online  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
"
INHW_-HGCIs,"[00:00] if  you  want  to  buy  my  course  on  how  I 
 grew  this  YouTube  following  that's  the 
 top  Link  in  the  description  in  this
[00:06] video  I'm  going  to  teach  you  from  my 
 current  understanding  how  to  love  a 
 woman  and  this  gets  so  much  deeper  than
[00:13] just  getting  into  a  relationship  and 
 saying  I  love  you  to  her  it  gets 
 infinitely  more  deeper  than  the  average
[00:20] relationship  and  if  I  can  tell  you  a 
 story  of  the  last  time  that  I  took 
 psychedelic  mushrooms  I  felt
[00:29] 100  masculine 
 I  achieved  100
[00:35] polarity  at  least  that's  what  I  believe 
 with  my  woman  and  it  was  a  beautiful
[00:40] magical  experience  we  went  up  a  mountain 
 to  a  private  part  of  like  this  place  in
[00:46] Thailand 
 and  there  we  sat  down  we  talked  these 
 like  this  mushroom  like  this  dried  thing
[00:51] which  is  like  a  psychedelic  it's  it's 
 meant  to  enhance  your  consciousness
[00:56] and  after  around  10  15  minutes  it  starts 
 the  hit  and  if  you've  never  experienced 
 this  before  it's  like  the  saturation  of
[01:02] the  world  around  you  like  the  colors 
 start  to  pop  and  it  and  brightness  and
[01:08] feelings  just  went  all  through  me 
 and  I  started  to  feel  anxious
[01:14] I  started  to  feel  a  little  bit  scared  a 
 little  bit  sick  the  plan  was  that  we  you
[01:19] know  we  set  out  this  picnic  on  this 
 mountain  that  you  know  we'd  probably 
 just  stay  there  but  it  just  didn't  feel
[01:24] right  for  some  reason  and  so  I  picked 
 everything  up  and  she's  looking  at  me  a 
 little  bit  weird  Okay  this  was  the  plan 
 to  stay  here  but  I'm  like  no  no  we  need
[01:31] to  go  this  way 
 we  pack  everything 
 and  we  start  to  Walk  and  Walk  and  Walk
[01:39] till  I  remember  to  breathe 
 I  remember  to  consciously  breathe  and  I
[01:45] took  one  big  deep  breath
[01:50] and  I  couldn't  help  but  smile  because  I 
 felt  the  strength  that  I  had
[01:55] imagine  this  my  woman  is  stood  next  to 
 me  and  I  felt  strong  and  this  is  when
[02:00] the  visual  started  hitting  in  and  if 
 you've  ever  taken  psychedelics  you  know 
 what  it's  like  and  if  you've  not  it's
[02:05] like  you  start  to  see  like  visuals  it's 
 almost  like  things  kind  of  have  like  a
[02:10] smoky  glisten  to  them  like  the  thing 
 that  you're  looking  at  almost  looks  like 
 it  melts  into  the  next  thing  it's  a
[02:16] beautiful  experience  and  this  starts  to 
 happen  and  it's  almost  like  I  can  hear 
 like  tribal  music  and  I  feel  strong  I
[02:22] look  to  my  arms  to  my  body  like  I 
 physically  felt  really  strong
[02:28] and  she 
 starts  to  melt
[02:33] and  I  don't  say  that 
 metaphorically 
 this  level  of  strength  that  I  just  felt
[02:40] out  of  nowhere  she  started  to  physically 
 melt  not  in  some  weird  way  but  like  I
[02:46] saw  her  physically  go  like  this  like 
 like  this  closer  and  closer  into  my  arm
[02:53] like  she  looks  so  happy  so  submissive  so 
 feminine  so  beautiful 
 like  this
[03:00] and  what  happened  next  is  one  of  the 
 best  experiences  of  my  entire  life  we're 
 on  the  top  of  this  mountain
[03:05] slowly  just  one  step  at  a  time  going 
 down
[03:10] it  was  like  I  had  perfect  posture  it  was 
 like  I  was  divinely  masculine  like  Shiva
[03:16] like  masculinity  I'm  walking  down  with 
 like  a  straight  back  chest  out  feeling 
 strong  and  she's  like  you  know  clutching
[03:22] onto  my  arm  like  look  literally  looking 
 at  me  like  this  like 
 like  this  obviously  she  took  them  as 
 well  so  you  know  she's  like  probably
[03:27] next  to  me  and  everything  and  it  I'm 
 walking  her  through
[03:32] a  trip  of  our  ancestors 
 and  I'm  looking  at  her  and  saying  like
[03:38] this  like  these  strong  things 
 our  ancestors  used  to  Traverse  these
[03:43] mountains 
 take  your  slippers  off  baby
[03:49] let's  feel  the  floor  between  our  feet 
 and  you  know  I'm  saying  these  things
[03:54] which  obviously  the  impact  of  which  it 
 doesn't  feel  the  same  right  now  but 
 imagine  I'm  just  saying  like  the  like
[04:00] strong  romantic  things  to  her 
 and  I  swear  this  is  the  truth  out  of
[04:05] nowhere  we  look  down  like  in  our  side  of 
 this  mountain  and  there's  a  solid  seven
[04:13] a  nine  quite  big  healthy  looking  stray 
 dogs  and  they  look  kind  of  angry  they
[04:19] look  kind  of  like  hungry  stray  dogs  in 
 Thailand  are  usually  no  problem
[04:24] usually  you  know  worst  case  scenario 
 they've  got  like  maybe  some  some  kind  of 
 disease  but  usually  nothing  but  like
[04:29] sometimes  they  can  be  a  little  bit  like 
 Snappy  like  you  know  sometimes  they  can 
 challenge  you  a  little  bit  and  in  fact
[04:34] one  of  my  friends  just  a  few  days  before 
 this  moment  that  like  literally  had  a 
 scar  on  his  leg  that  he  had  been  bitten
[04:39] by  a  stray  dog  I'm  looking  at  this  group 
 and  she  starts  you  know  we  hear  them 
 barking  down  they're  100  meters  away
[04:45] from  us  like  you  know  with  kind  of  like 
 a  lower  altitude  and  she  starts 
 panicking  there's  a  lot  of  them  there's
[04:50] genuinely  like  I'm  telling  you  the  truth 
 genuinely  there's  like  seven  eight  stray 
 dogs  there
[04:55] inside  of  me  is  a  little  bit  of  a  fear 
 because  I'm  thinking  okay 
 we're  actually  far  away  from  like
[05:00] Civilization  you  know  take  us  five 
 minutes  or  so  to  run  to  the  nearest 
 person  or  something
[05:06] this  actually  could  get  kind  of  nasty 
 and  instantly  the  fear  goes  away  because
[05:11] I  knew  what  I  would  do  if  they  did  come 
 up  to  us 
 and  I  did  say  it  to  her  I  said
[05:17] if 
 the  worst  has  happened  just  stay  still 
 stay  behind  me
[05:23] and  don't  be  scared  of  what  I'm  about  to 
 do 
 because  I  was  expecting  if  these  stray 
 dogs  like  a  pack  of  stray  dogs  run
[05:29] towards  maybe  I'm  over  exaggerating  but 
 if  they  did  I  was  gonna  go  absolutely 
 animalistic  mode  I  was  genuinely
[05:35] thinking  that  I  know  this  is  like  weird 
 to  say  but  I  was  genuinely  imagining 
 okay  if  they  come  towards  me  I'm  gonna
[05:40] go  like  fully  Primal  and  start  like  like 
 you  know  if  I  [ __ ]  making  noises 
 throwing  rocks  at  them  because  I'm  not
[05:45] gonna  risk  them  coming  towards  me  and 
 just  you  know  wanting  to  like  slightly 
 pick  up  my  legs  or  something  just  to  see
[05:50] if  we're  like  weak  or  anything 
 I'm  genuinely  think  okay  I'm  gonna  like
[05:55] bark  like  I've  never  parked  before 
 towards  these  dogs  if  they  do  come
[06:00] towards  me 
 and  she's  feeling  terrified  and  so  we're 
 on  kind  of  alert  for  these  dogs  that  are
[06:06] playing  you  know  it's  playing  or 
 whatever  they're  doing  down  there 
 and  it's  like  you  know  we're  taking  one
[06:12] step  the  next  step  one  step  then  the 
 next  step  going  down  the  mountain  and
[06:17] within  a  few  seconds  she's  pretty  much 
 forgotten  about  them  they've  like  ran 
 off  somewhere  else 
 but  it's  in  my  mind  it  is  in  my  mind
[06:23] okay  this  is  it  potentially  is  a 
 dangerous  genuinely  dangerous 
 environment  it  could  go  wrong  anyone  who
[06:29] kind  of  knows  about  like  stray  dogs  in 
 Thailand  probably  knows  yeah  it  would 
 have  been  fine  anyway  but  it  could 
 potentially  go  wrong  it  added  to  the
[06:35] feeling  of  like  you  know  this  masculine 
 femininity 
 polarity  and  taking  mushrooms  and  nature
[06:41] and  wildness 
 and  we  start  walking  down  and  there's 
 something  that  I  told  my  girl  which  she
[06:48] found  very  interesting  I  told  her  that 
 my  visuals  every  single  time  I've  taken 
 psychedelics  is  always  the  same  it  you
[06:54] know  you  see  sometimes  you  see  like 
 patterns  in  everything  that  you  look  at
[06:59] every  single  thing  that  I  look  at  the 
 pattern  that  I  see  is  always  the  same  it
[07:04] is  always  women  submitting  to  me  it  is 
 always  women  literally  provocatively 
 like  dancing  towards  me  getting  closer
[07:10] and  closer  and  closer  towards  me  they 
 want  me  to  take  them  and  I  said  this  to 
 her  and  like  you  know  this  proper  Shiva
[07:16] like  straight  back  way  and  I  was 
 describing  I've  told  her  this  before  so
[07:21] I  described  it  up  everywhere  I  see  is  a 
 woman  submitting  to  me  and  she  gets  like 
 back  into  that  melty  mood  looking  at  me
[07:27] again  like  in  awe  looking  at  me  I'm 
 telling  her  like  here  amongst  these 
 rocks  that  rock  right  there  that
[07:34] formation  as  a  girl  she's  just  pushing 
 herself  into  me 
 they  want  me  they  want  my  seed  I'm
[07:40] saying  these  things  and  I  I  know  it  can 
 seem  kind  of  uncomfortable  you  know  in 
 like  a  dry  situation  I'm  saying  it  to
[07:45] the  camera  with  my  book  still  but 
 but  just  looking  at  her
[07:51] the  way  that  she's  melting  on  my  arms 
 like 
 she's  looking  at  like  imagine  she's  on
[07:57] my  head  like  my  chest  there  like  she's 
 literally  like  like  the  biggest  smile  on 
 her  face  she  looks  so  happy  so  safe  and
[08:04] every  few  steps  that  we  take  I'm  like 
 saying  something  else  about  our 
 ancestors  about  masculinity  about  our
[08:10] love  together  I'm  looking  at  it  deep 
 into  her  eyes  like  grabbing  her  cheeks 
 like  this  and  not  just  saying  like  oh
[08:17] yeah  I  love  you  I  love  you  baby 
 so  much  deeper  than  that
[08:23] the  kind  of  things  if  I  said  them  now  it 
 wouldn't  even  do  it  justice  but  just  to 
 give  you  an  example  like
[08:29] I  reminded  her  that  the  last  time  I  was 
 here  before  her
[08:34] that  I  had  a  gift  for  her 
 and  I  pulled  out  a  seashell  from  my
[08:39] pocket 
 and  I  looked  into  her  eyes  and  said  the 
 ocean  gave  me  this
[08:46] I  held  my  hand  inside  of  the  ocean  and 
 the  ocean  gifted  me  this  and  now  I  give
[08:51] this  to  you  as  a  token  of  our  love  keep 
 it  safe  forever
[08:57] of  course  it  it  doesn't  sound  as  good 
 maybe  it  sounds  a  little  bit  cringe  you 
 know  right  now  but  imagine
[09:04] for  a  woman  the  man  that  she's  in  love 
 with  is  talking  like  this  and  how  much
[09:10] love  that  she  was  feeling  at  this  moment 
 and  how  like  just  melting  she  was
[09:16] this  was  like  this  is  genuinely  like  a 
 real  experience  that  just  happened  a 
 couple  of  weeks  ago  an  absolutely
[09:21] amazing  connecting  experience 
 but  just  three  years  ago
[09:28] ah 
 3  A.M  4  A.M
[09:33] I  was  on  the  fourth  fap  of  the  day 
 watching  hyper  stimulating  porn  the  kind
[09:39] of  porn  that  isn't  even  like  a  normal 
 video  it's  like  they've  merged  multiple 
 videos  into  one  so  it's  like  like  you
[09:44] know  the  like  hyper  stimulant  there's 
 like  extra  music  and  everything  I'm 
 smoking  weed  at  the  same  time  it's  4am
[09:50] and  I'm  eating  junk  food  I've  just 
 ordered  more  like  cheesecake  and 
 everything  and  I'm  literally  like
[09:55] fapping  multiple  times  in  a  row 
 whilst  at  that  time  my  girlfriend  was
[10:00] sleeping  in  the  Next  Room 
 and  when  she  was  gonna  wake  up  this  is
[10:05] different  girls  you  know  this  what  I'm 
 talking  about  now  happened  four  years 
 ago  when  she  was  gonna  wake  up  the  way
[10:10] that  she'd  look  at  me  with  a  sense  of 
 like  distaste  even  though  we  were  living 
 together  and  we  were  in  love  we  didn't
[10:15] love  each  other  we  could  hated  each 
 other  we  presented  each  other 
 to  the  points  like  you  know  all  this
[10:21] this  tension  between  us  this  lack  of 
 attraction  between  us  me  and  this  girl 
 that  I  was  dating  a  few  years  ago
[10:26] eventually  I  remember  that  you  know  I 
 went  away  I  went  back  to  my  my  family's
[10:31] home  for  a  few  days  and  just  looking  at 
 my  phone 
 neurotically  on  her  Snapchat  and  just
[10:37] seeing  something  very  interesting  one 
 night  one  Saturday  night  I  still 
 remember  this  one  Saturday  night  I  was
[10:42] supposed  to  go  back  there  to  see  her  on 
 Sunday  and  on  Saturday  night  I  noticed 
 that  she  turned  her  Snapchat  location
[10:47] off 
 if  you  didn't  know  that  Snapchat  has 
 this  feature  where  it's  kind  of  a  weird
[10:53] feature  where  you  can  like 
 actively  show  everyone  your  live 
 location  it's  like  a  it's  you  know  the
[11:00] kids  really  like  not  kids  but  you  know 
 some  people  are  kind  of  messed  up in  the 
 head  and  they  think  that's  like 
 something  they  should  turn  on  they
[11:05] should  actively  show  everyone  their 
 exact  location  but  a  lot  of  people  have 
 that  on  and  my  girl  did  at  the  time  like
[11:10] you  know  this  was  four  years  ago  this 
 different  girl  that  we're  talking  about 
 like  my  ex-girlfriend  she  always  had  it
[11:15] on  and  then  I  just  had  this  gut  feeling 
 this  neurotic  overthinking  this 
 anxiousness  that  something  bad  was
[11:20] happening  and  on  this  one  fateful  day  I 
 noticed  that  she  had  it  off  on  like  this 
 night  time  and  imagine  how  that  made  me
[11:25] feel 
 compare  these  two  two  different 
 scenarios  where  four  years  ago  or  three 
 years  ago  I  was  this  anxious  overthinker
[11:31] seeing  these  like  you  know  last  online 
 12  58  P.M
[11:36] a.m  whatever  to  this  experience  that  I 
 just  had  a  few  weeks  ago  and  I'm
[11:41] certainly  no  master  of  masculinity  or  no 
 no  master  of  like  sexual  energy  or
[11:48] anything  but  I  think  I've  made  a  really 
 good  amount  of  progress  and  I  want  to 
 try  and  help  you  make  this  this
[11:53] transformation  way  faster  than  it  took 
 me
[12:00] this  video  is  going  to  be  about  how  to 
 grow  the  love  that  you  have  with  your 
 woman  this  video  is  not  going  to  be
[12:06] about  how  to  attract  a  woman  in  the 
 first  place  I've  made  many  videos  on 
 that  if  right  now  you're  single  and  you
[12:12] don't  have  a  girl  interested  in  you  then 
 there's  so  many  videos  I've  made  on  like 
 you  know  how  to  text  a  girl  how  to 
 attract  how  to  be  the  kind  of  man  that's
[12:18] actually  attractive  to  girls  that  gets 
 like  you  know  more  messages  on  Instagram 
 and  all  the  attraction  phase  things  and
[12:24] so  you  can  skip  this  video  up  until  you 
 actually  have  the  girl  but  what  I  would 
 recommend  is  that  there  is  going  to  be  a
[12:29] point  for  you  that  you're  gonna  have  the 
 girl  eventually  right  there's  if  you 
 stay  on  self-improvement  if  you  keep
[12:34] improving  yourself  there's  got  to  be  a 
 point  when  you  get  the  girl 
 at  that  point  is  actually  when  most  guys
[12:40] fail  most  guys  only  focus  on  the 
 attraction  process  thinking  that  once 
 they  get  into  the  relationship  they'll
[12:45] figure  things  out  but  what  they  don't 
 realize  is  that  getting  into  the 
 relationship  is  actually  the  easier  part
[12:52] being  in  the  relationship  being  in  love 
 is  incredibly  harder  than  just
[12:58] attracting  her  in  the  first  place  and  so 
 this  video  is  either  for  the  guys  who 
 already  have  a  girlfriend  or  a  wife  or
[13:04] if  you  already  preemptively  want  to  like 
 just  kind  of  understand  some  things  from
[13:09] from  something  that  will  happen  to  you 
 just  so  you  have  this  knowledge  in  your 
 mind  which  I  think  would  be  a  pretty
[13:15] smart  way  to  go  about  things 
 let's  talk  about  what  a  feminine  woman
[13:20] is  like  when  she's  in  love  and  I'll  give 
 you  a  caveat  like  a  disclaimer  here 
 everything  that  I  talk  about  on  this
[13:27] video  in  every  video  in  everything  that 
 I  talk  about  I'm  always  talking  from  the 
 perspective  of  a  masculine  man  who  is
[13:33] interested  in  feminine  women  there's  a 
 difference  like  it's  a  lot  of  things  I
[13:38] talk  about  are  going  to  seem  quite  weird 
 to  a  lot  of  people  maybe  to  yourself 
 because  this  is  based  on
[13:44] loving  a  feminine  woman  and  this  such  a 
 big  difference  between  loving  a  feminine
[13:50] woman  and  loving  a  modern  day  masculine 
 independent  woman  if  that's  what  you're 
 interested  in  then  I  I  don't  want  to  be
[13:56] associated  with  that  at  all  it's 
 feminine  women  who  are  beautiful  to  me
[14:01] and  I  am  a  masculine  man  I  am  a  goal 
 striving  ambitious  purposeful  man  and  so 
 if  you  can  relate  to  that  or  if  you  find
[14:07] that  something  that  you  want  to  emulate 
 and  you  want  to  be  more  masculine  you 
 want  to  be  more  of  a  man  you  want  to
[14:12] start  get  becoming  more  disciplined  and 
 everything  then  hopefully  you  can  learn 
 quite  a  lot  from  me
[14:17] feminine  woman  in  love  I  have  my  notes 
 by  the  way  a  feminine  woman  in  love  is 
 highly  sensitive  to  your  love  and  the
[14:26] focus  that  you  have  on  her  she  is 
 incredibly  sensitive  to  the  smallest
[14:31] micro  things  that  happen  to  her  to  you
[14:36] that  you  express  to  her  you  don't  even 
 realize  okay  this  isn't  even  just  if  you 
 say  something  big  like  I  love  you  or  if
[14:42] you  say  something  aggressive  to  her  or 
 anything  like  that  this  is  down  to  the 
 smallest  micro  expression  on  your  face
[14:47] the  smallest  thought  that  you  get  in 
 here  that  are  she's  taking  too  long  to 
 get  ready  she  feels  a  sense  of
[14:53] Abandonment  she  is  highly  sensitive 
 extremely  receptive  to  the  smallest
[14:58] signs  that  you  might  not  even  know  that 
 you're  emitting  yourself  because  her
[15:03] life  depends  on  it  because  for  a 
 feminine  woman  through  Evolution  her 
 life  is  totally  dependent  on  the
[15:09] masculine  man  that's  taking  care  of  her 
 and  so  she  is  incredibly  sensitive  most 
 guys  don't  understand  this  she  is  so
[15:15] much  more  sensitive  to  the  micro  signs 
 that  you're  giving  out  than  you  realize
[15:20] and  this  is  why  her  mood  can  swing  this 
 is  why  sometimes  she  can  feel  kind  of 
 happy  and  then  within  a  few  minutes  just
[15:26] feel  kind  of  like  down  and  depressed  and 
 quite  distant  from  you  and  you're 
 wondering  what  what  happened
[15:31] what  actually  happened  was  that 
 literally  three  micro  muscles  in  your 
 face  moved  in  a  certain  way  that  her
[15:37] Primal  brain  registered  it  as  a  slight 
 level  of  detachment
[15:42] and  again  her  Primal  brain  hurts  like 
 you  know  the  amygdala  the  anxiety  part 
 of  her  brain  flared  up  and  started  to
[15:48] like  change  her  heart  rate  and  cortisol 
 and  and  put  her  into  fight  or  flight 
 instead  of  rest  and  digest  because  that
[15:54] would  usually  symbolize  an  extremely 
 like  dangerous  environment  if  we  were  50
[16:00] 000  years  ago  and  the  human  brain  hasn't 
 actually  evolved  that  much  in  the  last 
 tens  of  thousands  of  years  and  so  she  is
[16:06] still  the  same 
 when  she's  in  love  a  feminine  woman  is
[16:11] in  Love  She  is  totally  reliant  on  you 
 but
[16:16] she  could  be  independent  if  she  needs  to 
 if  she  senses  weakness  in  you  and  this
[16:22] is  maybe  something  that  you've 
 experienced  before 
 she's  usually  really  really  into  who
[16:27] she's  usually  looking  for  you  for  your 
 guidance  but  you've  seen  times  when  she 
 seems  to  make  her  own  decisions  and
[16:32] she's  way  more  independent  and  usually 
 those  are  around  the  times  that  you've 
 been  maybe  a  little  bit  lazier
[16:38] she  picks  up  on  it  now  again  50  000 
 years  ago  she  wouldn't  have  had  the 
 luxury  of  being  independent  she  would
[16:44] have  needed  you  to  like  be  that  guy  in 
 the  modern  day  we've  safeguarded  a  lot
[16:49] of  things  and  so  what  this  means  is  that 
 it's  a  lot  harder  to  be  a  masculine  man 
 dating  a  feminine  woman  because  she  has
[16:54] like  a  safety  level  that  she  could  be  at 
 if  you  guys  did  split  up  if  she  did
[17:00] think  that  you  were  just  getting  weaker 
 and  weaker  and  weaker  the  safety  level 
 that  the  government  gives  her  that  she's
[17:05] got  with  her  family  and  that  you  know 
 she  she's  got  a  safe  place  to  live  and  a 
 way  to  get  food  and  everything  and
[17:10] shelter  well  then  she  can  go  to  that 
 level  once  she  feels  like  your  weakness 
 is  too  unbearable
[17:16] this  is  what  happens  to  a  lot  of  guys 
 who  eventually  find  themselves  just 
 watching  porn  and  playing  video  games 
 and  taking  drugs  when  they're  in  a
[17:22] relationship  she  sees  this  and  she  can't 
 help  but  just  think 
 actually
[17:28] I don't  even  need  him 
 her  happiness  anxiety  and  stress  are
[17:36] very  much  so  correlated  with  yours  now 
 what  this  means  is  that  for  this 
 feminine  woman  who's  in  love  with  you
[17:42] pretty  much  all  of  her  emotions  are 
 based  on  what's  happening  with  you  if
[17:47] things  are  good  if  you're  especially  if 
 you're  happy  she's  happy  my  girl  makes 
 this  joke  all  the  time  when  I  you  know
[17:53] it's  time  to  order  food  or  to  eat  I'll 
 sometimes  kind  of  say  to  myself  am  I 
 hungry  are  you  hungry  and  she'll  say  in
[17:59] like  with  like  a  laugh  like  if  you're 
 hungry  I'm  hungry 
 and  she's  I  know  this  can  seem  weird  to
[18:05] other  people  but  she's  genuinely  not 
 joking  if  I  suddenly  say  I'm  hungry  she 
 would  be  hungry  if  I'm  like  oh  I'm  so
[18:11] tired  she'd  be  like  yeah  I'm  tired  too 
 let's  just  lie  down  if  I'm  like  oh  yeah 
 you  know  I  can't  wait  to  move  my  body  I
[18:16] can't  wait  to  exercise  she's  like  yeah 
 me  too  me  too 
 this  isn't  fakeness  by  the  way  a  lot  of
[18:22] people  will  look  down  to  this  and  say 
 like  oh  no  this  is  a  bad  thing  this  is 
 cringe  but  I  don't  you  know  I  want  a
[18:27] girl  who's  her  own  person  but  this  is 
 her  being  her  own  person  because  a
[18:32] feminine  woman  who's  in  love  is  100 
 devoted  to  you  so  much  that  her  emotions
[18:37] and  feelings  are  dictated  or  at  least 
 heavily  correlated  by  how  you  feel  and
[18:43] so  if  you  feel  happy  she  will  feel  happy 
 if  you  feel  certain  she  will  largely
[18:48] feel  certain  to 
 if  you  feel  lazy  then  so  will  she  if  you
[18:54] feel  stressed  then  so  will  she  if  you 
 feel  nervous  anxious  anything 
 so  will  she  because  again
[19:01] remember  those  black  Primal  caveman 
 micro  Expressions  when  you  show  the 
 smallest  level  of  stress  of  anxiety  you
[19:08] know  somehow  it'll  come  across  your  face 
 right 
 she  will  see  that  and  pick  up  on  it
[19:13] if  he's  anxious  anxious  anxious 
 then  I  probably  should  be  too  right
[19:20] I  think  I  said  this  to  my  girl  once  like 
 she  said  oh  yeah  you're  not  scared  of 
 anything  and  you  know  I  was  laughing
[19:25] around  and  I  said  we're  like  if  you  see 
 me  scared  you  should  be  very  scared
[19:31] does  that  make  sense  like  if  something 
 scares  me  as  the  guy  and  she's  saying
[19:36] like  oh  yeah  I've  never  even  seen  you 
 scared  before  I've  never  seen  you 
 anxious  before 
 if  you  see  me  scared  then  that  means
[19:42] okay  shit's  actually  about  to  go  down
[19:48] and  when  she  is  totally  in  love  with  you 
 she  is  perfectly  polarized
[19:54] always  consensing  to  your  love  and  to 
 your  physical  acts  of  Love  to  You
[20:01] caressing  her  undressing  her  and  even 
 going  further  she's  pretty  much  she  is 
 always  consenting  to  you  guys  have
[20:08] experienced  this  before  maybe  you  have 
 you  can  have  a  woman  who's  totally  in 
 love  with  you  and  it  feels  like  you  can
[20:14] have  sex  with  a  100  of  the  time 
 and  unfortunately  a  lot  of  guys  have
[20:19] experienced  that  with  a  woman  and  then 
 seen  it  change  where  suddenly  she's  too
[20:25] tired  to  have  sex  with  them  now 
 suddenly  she's  too  busy  to  meet  them  on
[20:30] the  day  or  the  dates  that  they  usually 
 do 
 when  she's  in  love  with  you  totally  in
[20:36] love  with  you 
 she's  always  consenting  to  you
[20:42] and  finally  when  she  is  totally  in  love 
 with  you  she's  always  submissive  and 
 following  your  direction  now  those  are
[20:47] kind  of  Common  Sense  things  but  you  know 
 just  something  that  a  lot  of  people 
 don't  know  about  a  feminine  woman  there
[20:53] may  be  some  people  watching  this 
 thinking  no  no no  women  aren't  like  that 
 I  don't  know  like  or  maybe  there's  a 
 woman  watching  the  cylinder  I'm  in  love
[20:58] but  I'm  not  like  that  we're  talking 
 about  feminine  women  women  who  are 
 filled  with  femininity  they  are  very
[21:03] quite  rare  these  days  and  if  you  are 
 wondering  very  quickly  I  said  I'm  not 
 going  to  teach  you  the  attraction  stage
[21:08] things  in  this  video  but  the  way  to  find 
 those  feminine  women  is  to  be  that
[21:13] masculine  man  yourself  and  the  way  to  be 
 the  masculine  man  yourself  very 
 interestingly  is  for  you  to  abandon  your
[21:20] feminine  side  people  these  days  try  to 
 trick  young  men  to  tell  them  to  embrace 
 their  feminine  side  to  be  weak  to  cry  to
[21:25] show  their  emotions  to  show 
 vulnerability  all  of  that  is  very 
 manipulative  and  it's  like  a  trap  as  a
[21:31] Young  Man  one  of  the  best  things  you  can 
 do  is  to  destroy  the  feminine  side 
 inside  of  you  to  still  have  you  know 
 some  relics  of  it  to  still  have  the
[21:37] ability  to  enjoy  yourself  and  laugh  and 
 dance  and  stuff  okay  nice  but  to  not  be
[21:42] have  the  counter-intuitive  side  to  not 
 be  their  emotional  focused  on  play
[21:48] instead  of  work  to  be  to  be  ambitious  to 
 be  masculine  and  disciplined  when  you
[21:53] change  your  personality  like  this  you'll 
 find  that  you'll  automatically  start  to 
 attract  women  who've  got  a  feminine
[21:58] personality  who've  got  feminine  energy 
 because  you  know  the  two  just  attract 
 like  opposite  sides  of  a  magnet  that's
[22:04] how  you  attract  a  feminine  woman  they 
 are  somewhat  rare  these  days  in  the  west 
 once  you  leave  the  West  if  you  are
[22:10] interested  again  if  you're  young  and  you 
 haven't  really  seen  this  before  if  you 
 get  out  of  the  US  and  the  UK  and  some  of
[22:16] those  like  basic  countries  and  you  go 
 out  to  places  like  Thailand  or  maybe  to
[22:22] um  to  be  fair  Thailand's  one  of  the  most 
 places  that  I've  traveled  then  I've  been 
 to  some  parts  of  um  like  Pakistan  and
[22:28] everything  once  you  go  outside  more  of 
 these  like 
 somewhat  traditional  places  somewhat
[22:33] like  like 
 wild  places 
 you'll  see  that  the  women  here  are
[22:38] feminine  and  you  automatically  start  to 
 attract  them  when  you  have  this
[22:43] masculine  directional  energy  now 
 how  is  a  woman  like  when  she  doesn't
[22:49] feel  loved  what  is  a  feminine  woman  like 
 when  she  doesn't  feel  loved  and  this  is
[22:55] I  don't  know  if  I  should  say  this  but 
 this  is  kind  of  close  to  my  my  heart 
 because  as  I  was  writing  this  down  I  was
[23:01] journaling  all  of  this  to  try  and 
 present  this  to  you  in  a  video 
 I  couldn't  help  but  just  constantly
[23:06] visualize  my  my  mother  in  this 
 to  just  see  her  alone  in  the  kitchen
[23:12] with  like  this  this  neurotic  and  anxious 
 body  language  trying  to  kind  of  like
[23:18] overhear  what  my  dad's  saying  on  the 
 phone  in  the  other  room  and  you  know 
 just  kind  of  overthinking  closed  body
[23:23] language  like  this  a  feminine  woman  who 
 doesn't  feel  loved  if  there's  one  word
[23:28] that  I  would  use  to  describe  her  it 
 would  be  barren
[23:33] Baron 
 like  an  like  an  empty  Wasteland  like 
 what  do  you  visualize  when  you  when  you
[23:38] hear  the  word  Baron  what  and  imagine 
 that  inside  of  a  woman  I  see  it  as  like
[23:43] a  dead  Forest  inside  of  her  stomach 
 a  gray  heart
[23:50] a  feminine  woman  who  doesn't  feel  loved 
 by  the  man  that  she  is  in  love  with 
 she's  Barren  she's  neurotically
[23:57] overthinking  she  feels  unsafe  and 
 anxious 
 she  feels  ugly
[24:04] and  these  thoughts 
 you  know  we  know  the  power  of  thinking 
 don't  we  these  thoughts  manifest  into
[24:09] reality  when  she  feels  neglected 
 neglected  and  Abandoned  and  ugly  and  you
[24:16] know  she's  having  these  thoughts 
 emotions  and  thoughts 
 they  start  to  manifest  into  reality
[24:22] suddenly  she's  pinching  her  spots  a 
 little  bit  harder
[24:27] she's  constantly  looking  in  the  mirror 
 looking  for  Flaws  and  of  course  finding 
 some  because  everyone's  got  some
[24:34] and  then  she  starts  to  focus  on  them 
 every  single  time  she  steps  in  front  of 
 the  mirror  she  sees  the  same  five  flaws
[24:40] that  she  always  focuses  on  and  they  seem 
 to  get  worse  and  worse  and  worse  because 
 she's  paying  them  more  attention  you 
 know  that  Dynamic  of  like  if  you  think
[24:46] of  the  the  yellow  car  if  you  think  of 
 the  car  make  like  the  Mercedes  or 
 whatever  or  the  motorbike  and  then  you
[24:52] constantly  start  seeing  it  more  the  more 
 you  think  about  it  well  it's  the  same 
 with  her  insecurities
[24:57] usually  a  loving  man  would  just  like  rip 
 away  those  insecurities  and  fill  her  up
[25:02] with  love 
 but  when  she  doesn't  have  that  she 
 doesn't  feel  love  she  starts  to  question 
 why  and  and  oftentimes  women  will  start
[25:09] to  you  know  pinpoint  on  on  their 
 physical  attractiveness  their  physical 
 Beauty
[25:15] her  personality 
 it's  very  interesting  a  feminine  woman
[25:20] who  doesn't  feel  love  her  personality 
 turns  quite  rude  and  disrespecting  you
[25:26] thought  maybe  it'd  be  quite  like  you 
 know  silence  you  know  the  physical 
 manifestation  of  of  you  know  like  closed
[25:33] off  and  feeling  baroness  the  opposite 
 that  it's  the  violent  hostility  it's  a
[25:38] rude  disrespectful  it's  challenging  it's 
 testing 
 the  reason  why  she's  like  this  her
[25:43] personality  is  quite  hostile  to  the  man 
 that  she's  in  love  with  is  because  she's 
 testing  him  to  try  and  see  if  he'll
[25:49] still  love  her  often  times  when  a  woman 
 who  doesn't  feel  loved  acts  in  this  like
[25:54] disrespectful  way  she's  doing  it  because 
 this  in  response  to  this  her  man  will
[25:59] now  show  her  attention 
 sometimes  for  a  lot  of  women  this  is  the 
 only  time
[26:05] they're  men  that  they're  in  love  with 
 will  show  them  attention 
 when  she's  being  disrespectful  when
[26:11] she's  testing  him  when  she's  being  rude 
 that's  when  the  guy  will  blow  up  and  you 
 know  argue  with  her  and  swear  at  her  and
[26:17] as  much  as  she  hates  the  abuse  like 
 at  least  he's  focusing  on  me  at  least
[26:22] he's  like  giving  me  eye  contact
[26:29] there's  the  book  that  I  really  like  that 
 I  mentioned  a  lot  the  way  of  the 
 superior  man
[26:34] it's  written  by  an  author  called  David 
 Dieter  and  in  this  book  there's  a  bit 
 where  he  talks  about  a  feminine  woman
[26:41] who  doesn't  feel  loved  and  there's 
 something  he  wrote  which  is  very 
 interesting  that  when  she  doesn't  feel
[26:46] feel  filled  up  with  love  she  fills 
 herself  up  with  things  like  chocolate
[26:54] drugs  gossip  TV  casual  sex  from  men  that
[26:59] she's  not  in  love  with  tattoos  all  of 
 these  like  short-term  distractions  out
[27:04] think  about  the  things  I've  just  said  to 
 you  chocolate  and  we  can  say  you're  not 
 junk  food  in  general  drugs  gossip  TV
[27:09] Netflix  video  games  uh  YouTube  porn 
 casual  sex  tattoos  essentially
[27:15] degeneracy  a  woman  who  doesn't  feel 
 loved  will  do  this  now  I  want  you  to 
 imagine  right  now
[27:21] a  teenage  girl  aged  16. 
 you  know  from  your  hometown  or  from  your
[27:27] country  right  so  for  me  it's  like 
 Britain  right  I  imagine  a  16  year  old 
 British  girl
[27:32] who  doesn't  feel  loved  by  her  father  who 
 feels  ignored  by  the  guy  that  she's  got
[27:37] a  crush  on  how  is  she  gonna  behave 
 who  doesn't  feel  love  right  because  if
[27:42] you  know  she's  got  Father's  Love  if 
 she's  got  her  father's  love  if  she's  got 
 maybe  a  crush  that's  actually  receptive 
 then  she's  going  to  be  healthy  and  stuff
[27:47] but  when  a  girl  doesn't  have  a  Father's 
 Love  when  she's  young  and  then 
 eventually  the  romantic  love
[27:53] what  happens  to  those  girls  were  like  16 
 years  old  who  don't  have  daddy's  love
[27:59] exactly  this  early  age  they're  taking 
 drugs  early  age  they're  going  out 
 drinking  and  going  to  parties  with
[28:05] boyfriends  that  they  don't  even  care 
 about  and  they're  cheating  on  those 
 boyfriends  and  you  know  this  this  toxic 
 and  horrible  degenerate  environment
[28:11] where  she's  degrading  herself  even 
 though  other  women  are  telling  her  that
[28:16] feminism  is  empowering 
 oh  she's  destroying  herself  she's 
 filling  herself  up  with  a  substitute  for
[28:23] real  love  and  it  never  works  the  issue 
 with  these  substitutes  is  that  they're
[28:28] all  instant  gratification  they're  all 
 destruction  they're  all  like  bad 
 dopamines  bad  habits  and  so  whilst  they
[28:33] do  give  you  like  a  feel  or  they  give 
 women  a  feeling  of  of  being  filled  up  in 
 some  sense
[28:39] there's  always  negative  consequences  the 
 woman  who  fills  herself  up  with  junk 
 food  and  chocolate  tomorrow  steps  on  the
[28:44] scale  and  then  gets  depressed  at  the 
 two  kilogram  weight  gain  that  she's  had
[28:49] consistently  every  week  or  so  the  woman 
 who  then  does  this  with  casual  sex  like
[28:54] you  know  the  guy  that  she  really  wants 
 isn't  really  replying  or  being 
 interested  in  her  maybe  that's  her 
 father  maybe  that's  um you  know  the
[29:00] crush  that  she's  got  the  man  that  she's 
 in  love  with  well  then  she  does  it  with 
 casual  sex  and  she  gets  filled  up
[29:05] by  some  random  guy  and  then  think  about 
 the  consequences  of  that
[29:10] the  consequences  of  a  woman  a  feminine 
 woman  who  doesn't  feel  loved  is 
 absolutely
[29:18] life-changing  and  the  reason  why  this  is 
 a  very  controversial  issue  and  this  is
[29:23] something  that  a  lot  of  people  feel  too 
 uncomfortable  to  talk  about  the  reason 
 why  is  because  a  woman  who  does  these
[29:28] things 
 is  damaged  permanently  a  woman  who 
 doesn't  feel  her  father's  love  when
[29:34] she's  growing  up  it  gets  damaged 
 permanently  when  a  woman  tries  to  fill
[29:39] herself  up  from  like  these  habits 
 especially  the  sex  related  ones  you  know 
 from  casual  sex  she  she  could  go  through
[29:45] a  period  of  transformation  for  10  years 
 she's  going  to  be  damaged  permanently 
 because  of  these  experiences  and
[29:52] I'd  have  to  go  into  too  much  detail  with 
 this  and  it'll  be  too  like  vulgar  and 
 everything 
 but  it's  such  a  sad  sad
[29:59] reality  for  so  many  women  especially 
 what  seems  to  be  in  the  west  where 
 fathers  are  being  taken  out  of  the  home
[30:04] fathers  are  being  demonized  you  know  the 
 father  is  like  this  disrespectful
[30:09] disrespected 
 figure  these  days  you  know  the  father  in 
 every  TV  show  is  a  bumbling  idiot  these
[30:14] days  isn't  it  every  TV  show  you  can 
 think  of  it's  like  the  father  is  like 
 the  idiot  the  mother  is  the  super  mom
[30:19] who  who  looks  after  the  kids  and  also 
 looks  after  the  husband  because  the 
 husband  doesn't  know  anything
[30:24] the  father's  useless  in  the  modern  day 
 in  the  west  of  course  not  all  countries
[30:29] are  like  this 
 that  was  a  side  tangent  but  pretty  much
[30:36] when  she  doesn't  feel  loved  it's 
 horrible  for  her  and  also  for  your 
 relationship  or  because  imagine  think
[30:42] about  these  things  that  she  could  be 
 doing  when  you  don't  make  her  feel  loved 
 of  course  this  is  a  very  extreme  example
[30:47] when  she  really  feels  neglected 
 this  is  what  she's  kind  of  pushed 
 towards  and  this  is  why  the  extreme
[30:53] example  like  you  don't  want  your  woman 
 to  feel  like  she's  unloved  by  you 
 because  this  is  where  it  leads  to  it
[30:59] leads  to  her  hurting  herself  it  leads  to 
 her  filling  herself  up  with  things  that 
 will  damage  her  and  and  your
[31:05] relationship  together  you  want  her  to 
 feel  loved  and  so  how  do  we  do  that  well 
 there  is  a  challenge  to  this
[31:12] the  challenge  that  we've  as  young  men 
 have  never  really  been  taught  about  in 
 terms  of  relationships  you  know  we've
[31:17] always  you  know  you  hear  some  wisdom 
 maybe  from  some  male  family  members  or 
 from  like  men  online  and  you  hear  about
[31:23] how  to  attract  girls  okay  you  know  just 
 take  her  on  a  date  what's  a  dress  like
[31:28] what  to  do  how  to  talk  those  things  are 
 really  nice  but  no  one  really  I  have 
 ever  seen  online  really  explains  the
[31:34] challenge  in  loving  a  woman  and  the 
 challenge  is  that  it  goes  way  further 
 than  the  automatic  mundane  I  love  yous
[31:41] of  the  day  once  you  fall  in  love  with  a 
 woman  guys  think  that  that's  all  there 
 is  yep  okay  accomplishment  no  no no  this
[31:47] is  the  start  the  mundane  automatic  I 
 love  yous  that  we  throw  out  there  do
[31:52] nothing 
 the  challenge  with  loving  a  woman  is 
 that  she  needs  every  micro  interaction
[32:01] of  yours  to  be  filled  with  love  I  will 
 say  this  again  she  needs  every  micro
[32:06] interaction  of  yours  to  be  filled  with 
 love 
 every  micro  interaction  notice  that  I
[32:12] didn't  say  every  minute  every  hour  every 
 day  a  lot  of  guys  think  this  right  a  lot 
 of  guys  think  that  they  get  into  the
[32:18] relationship  and  it's  yeah  okay  sweet 
 we're  in  love  and  then  they  forget 
 everything  else  no  no  then  there's  more
[32:23] clued  up  guys  there's  more  aware  guys 
 who  say  no  no  you've  got  to  make  your 
 woman  feel  loved  every  day
[32:28] okay  that's  that's  okay 
 but  it's  not  good  enough
[32:35] if  you  want  to  make  your  woman  feel 
 loved  every  day 
 you'll  be  slightly  better  than  the
[32:40] average  guy 
 because  a  day  is  huge
[32:46] you  need  to  make  her  feel  loved  in  this 
 exact  micro  second
[32:53] this  is  where  the  challenge  comes  in 
 because  sometimes  it  feels  impossible  to
[32:58] that  to  do  that  sometimes  she's  next  to 
 you  whilst  you're  on  Google  Maps  looking 
 for  like  the  restaurant  that  you  guys
[33:03] are  trying  to  go  to  was  it  a  left  from 
 here  or  was  it  forward 
 every  interact  every  micro  second  you
[33:11] know  two  if  if  we  were  trying  to  get  to 
 the  ultimate  performance  if  we  were 
 trying  to  get  to  your  best  performance 
 with  her  every  microsecond  would  be
[33:17] filled  with  love 
 everyone  not  just  the  dates  a  lot  of 
 guys  think  okay  you  know  you're  in  the
[33:23] middle  of  a  relationship  don't  stop 
 dating  keep  going  on  dates  that  sounds 
 awesome  but  it's  not  good  enough  you
[33:28] can't  just  go  on  a  date  with  her  and 
 think  yep  okay  job  done  no  no  you  go  on 
 the  date  you  sit  down  with  love  looking
[33:35] into  her  eyes 
 and  then  you  bring  like  you  literally 
 grab  her  chair  and  pull  it  closer  to  you
[33:40] with  love  looking  into  her  eyes  every 
 micro  moment  even  when  you're  looking
[33:45] through  the  memory  you  put  your  hand  on 
 her  leg  or  on  her  back 
 every  micro  moment  like  it  needs  to  be
[33:52] as  short  term  as  you  can  possibly  get  it 
 and  even  dinner  for  the  male  brain  bro
[33:57] even  then  it's  like  it's  still  like  too 
 big  for  us  she  needs  to  feel  it  the 
 specific  term  right  now  for  a  woman
[34:05] those  are  the  two  most  important  words 
 that  could  ever  exist  right  now
[34:10] when  she  says  I  love  you  she  means  I 
 love  you  right  now  when  she  says  I'm 
 happy  she  means  I  love  I'm  happy  right
[34:17] now 
 you  need  to  make  her  feel  loved  happy 
 secure  safe  excited  right  now  and  this
[34:25] right  now 
 has  already  passed  I  said  that  I  said 
 right  now  like  a  second  ago  it's  already
[34:31] passed  now  are  you  making  her  feel  loved 
 right  now  okay  maybe  you  are 
 but  then  you  check  your  phone  and  you've
[34:37] oh  there's  that  message  you've  got  to 
 reply  to  and  oh  okay  oh  the  menu  yes 
 okay  yes  what  are  we  gonna  eat  here
[34:43] how  about  right  now  oh  just  one  second 
 you  know  just  quickly  quickly  gotta  look 
 through  the  menu  just  one  second  just
[34:48] want  to  look  through  the  bed  oh  Carnival
[34:53] it  needs  to  be  this  is  what's  so 
 difficult  about  truly  making  her  feel
[34:58] loved  it  needs  to  be  right  now  in  this 
 small  micro  moments
[35:04] now  I  want  you  to  think  right  now 
 imagine  you  gave  her  your  full  attention
[35:10] imagine  you  made  it  your  full  Focus  just 
 like  you  do  with  your  work  just  like  you
[35:15] do  with  your  workouts  and  everything  you 
 know  you've  got  that  ability  right  you 
 know  that  you've  got  that  drive  to  check
[35:20] off  the  boxes  for  your  task  Place 
 imagine  if  you  put  that  much  intention 
 into  making  her  feel  loved  right  now  for
[35:27] the  duration  of  your  dates  together 
 you  could  do  that  right  awesome
[35:32] but  then  imagine 
 after  the  date  imagine  the  next  day  and
[35:37] the  next  day  and  the  next  day  and  the 
 next  day  imagine  you  live  together 
 imagine  you're  on  a  holiday  together 
 there's  going  to  be  moments  when  you
[35:42] slip  up 
 and  it's  so  easy  right  now  there's  a  lot 
 of  guys  watching  this  it's  so  easy  right
[35:47] now  to  try  and  blame  her  or  to  say  no  no 
 this  is  too  much  this  is  oh  this  is  too 
 much  expectations  I'd  rather  just  you
[35:52] know  just  watch  porn  anyway  like  oh  no  I 
 don't  date  women  who  who  are  this  needy
[35:58] anyway  I  I  prefer  more  independent 
 masculine  women
[36:04] as  soon  as  we  say  like  that  all  the  guys 
 take  a  step  back  like  no  no  I  don't  like 
 muscular  women  I  just  like  women  who  who
[36:09] aren't  as  feminine 
 if  you  are  attracted  to  feminine  women
[36:14] submissive  women  and  you  want  to  be  a 
 masculine  man  this  is  what  this  is  the 
 reality  of  it  and  we  can  look  at  this
[36:20] really  negatively  can't  we  oh  it's  so 
 mentally  demanding  let  me  just  look
[36:25] through  the  menu  [ __ ]  we  can  look 
 through  it  we  can  look  at  it  like  really 
 negatively
[36:30] but  this  may  be  the  greatest  gift  that 
 she  can  give  us  her  constant  need  for
[36:35] love  right  now 
 because  this  means  that  we  have  this 
 constant  meditation  reminder  next  to  us
[36:43] we  have  this  real  person 
 who  is  our  reminder  to  be  here  in  this
[36:50] moment  and  that  is  so  valuable 
 another  part  of  the  challenge  that  comes
[36:56] with  loving  a  feminine  woman  is  that  you 
 need  to  balance  this  you  know  her  her 
 need  for  love  with  your  need  for
[37:04] progress  on  your  purpose  and  your 
 mission  so  as  a  masculine  man  the  most
[37:09] important  things  for  you  will  be  like 
 the  major  goals  that  you  have  the  major
[37:15] thing  in  your  life  the  drive  that  you 
 have  whether  it's  you  know  to  get  the 
 degree  or  to  get  the  job  or  to  level  up
[37:20] your  business  or  to  get  success  in  this 
 area  or  to  go  to  the  gym  and  build  the 
 physique  that  you're  proud  of  whatever
[37:25] it  is  that  is  like  the  number  one 
 priority  in  your  life  that  these  big 
 goals  and  a  woman  comes  second  or  maybe
[37:31] third  fourth  like  the  woman  actually  is 
 down  here  on  the  list  for  you  know 
 you're  truly  masculine  when  the  number
[37:36] one  most  important  thing  for  you  is  like 
 your  goals  your  mission  your  purpose 
 how  do  we  balance  her  need  for  love  and
[37:44] what  we've  got  to  give  her  with  our  need 
 for  purpose  this  is  when  it  gets  tricky 
 because  she  needs  this  reassurance  all
[37:50] the  time  and  sometimes  sometimes  you  do 
 need  to  look  through  your  phone 
 sometimes  you  do  need  to  look  at  the
[37:55] menu  to  make  sure  you're  ordering 
 something  that's  healthy  for  both  of  you 
 and  so  this  is  where  it  gets  tricky  and
[38:01] I  don't  have  like  the  perfect  answer 
 here  I'm  just  kind  of  bringing  awareness 
 for  you  that  this  is  the  challenge  that
[38:06] we  need  to  navigate  and  we  need  to  learn 
 about 
 I'm  not  perfect  at  this  at  all  or  bro
[38:11] I'm  barely  even  good  at  this  honestly  I 
 find  it  incredibly  that  once  you  really 
 open  up  your  mind  I'm  not  sure  if  it's
[38:16] clicked  for  you  yet  but  if  you  really 
 open  up  your  mind  to  this  challenge  of 
 thinking  okay  she  needs  to  feel  loved
[38:22] right  now  like  constantly  and  this  isn't 
 because  she's  got  you  know  some  guys 
 might  tell  well  yeah  but  this  is  because
[38:27] you  know  she's  she's  like  too  anxious  or 
 something  right  I  want  like  a  girl  who 
 does  who  is  an  anxious  but  this  is  just
[38:32] how  feminine  women  are  this  is  just 
 through  Evolution  what  a  woman  is 
 supposed  to  be  because  she's  supposed  to
[38:38] feel 
 like  she  needs  reassurance  constantly 
 because  her  brain  is  the  same  she  has
[38:44] the  same  brain  like  you  maybe  there's 
 someone  who  can  correct  me  on  this  in 
 the  comments  I'm  pretty  sure  we  have  the
[38:49] same  brain 
 from  our  caveman  ancestors
[38:54] she  has  the  same  brain  as  the  cave  women 
 in  her  DNA
[39:01] those  cave  women  needed  to  feel  anxious 
 they  needed  to  feel  constant  reassurance
[39:07] and  if  they  saw  the  smallest  micro 
 expression  in  their  cavemen  they  would 
 have  felt  weird  they  would  have  felt
[39:13] agitated  they  would  have  felt  unloved 
 because  this  was  literally  based  on  my 
 Primal  survival
[39:19] and  so  when  we  do  in  this  modern  day 
 have  women  who  say  like  oh  this  is  you 
 know  these  anxious  women  I'm  not  like
[39:24] this  I'm  a  boss  baby  and  everything  well 
 that's  because  you're  not  masculine
[39:29] I'll  be  I've  got  guys  who  said  I  don't 
 know  but  I  don't  want  to  deal  with  this 
 I  just  want  a  more  independent  woman 
 that's  because
[39:34] this  guy  who's  saying  this  he's  quite 
 feminine  he's  in  touch  with  his  emotions 
 he  he  likes  to  like  cry  in  front  of  his
[39:40] girl  he  doesn't  even  go  to  the  gym  and 
 he  prefers  masculine  women 
 but  again  if  you  are  a  masculine  man
[39:47] and  you  are  and  you  want  a  feminine 
 woman  in  your  life  and  you  want  a  love
[39:52] with  this  feminine  woman  this  is  just 
 part  of  it 
 and  it's  okay  like  I  don't  think  we
[39:57] should  view  this  negatively  because  this 
 is  just  who  she  is  she  prioritizes  love
[40:02] above  everything  else  and  interestingly 
 we  prioritize  purpose  and  Mission  above 
 everything  else  and  so  this  is  where
[40:07] there's  a  bit  of  like  deviation  where 
 our  priorities  are  not  the  same
[40:12] and  so  it  is  with 
 responsibility  and  discipline  that  we've
[40:17] got  to  try  and  make  her  feel  loved  as 
 much  as  possible  and  I'll  just  very  like
[40:22] go  into  a  very  quickly  rant  here  this  is 
 not  simping  there's  a  lot  of  guys  out 
 there  in  this  modern  world  maybe  you
[40:28] thought  I'd  be  one  of  them  who  think 
 that  like  being  like  this  is  like  being 
 a  simp
[40:33] the  word  simp  is  thrown  around  like 
 quite  derogracy  these  days  and  maybe  for
[40:38] good  reason  maybe  to  the  guy  who's 
 donating  to  like  only  fans  girls  or  to 
 like  you  know  like  those  women  on  Twitch
[40:44] who  are  like  in  hot  tubs  and  stuff  and 
 there's  a  guy  who  who's  like  oh  my  God 
 you  know  she  said  my  name  wow  okay 
 that's  something  fine  being  a  gentleman
[40:51] and  being  a  lover  and  being  masculine  to 
 your  woman  is  not  simping  do  not  get 
 this  confused
[40:57] for  any  guy  out  there  who  who's 
 listening  to  this  thinking  wait  you  want 
 to  make  your  woman  feel  loved  and
[41:02] appreciated  that  simping 
 I  would  invite  that  man
[41:08] to  go  say  this  to  like  a  1900s  gentleman 
 the  kind  of  guy  who  wore  like  a  a  tuxedo
[41:14] like  a  suit  for  his  first  date  with  your 
 great-grandmother
[41:19] the  kind  of  guy  who  when  you  had 
 handshaking  would  accidentally  crush 
 your  hand  because  this  is  how  hard  men
[41:24] used  to  handshake  those  they're  the  kind 
 of  guy  with  a  four  digit  testosterone 
 for  1076  nanograms  per  deciliter
[41:30] testosterone  and  these  modern  day  it  was 
 skinny  neck  skinny  risk  guys  call  this
[41:35] simping  this  isn't  simping 
 this  is  what  this  is  how  our  great
[41:40] grandfather's  navigated  relationships 
 and  I  don't  think  a  single  one  of  us
[41:46] Modern  Men  could  call  one  of  those  those 
 men 
 Sim  could  we
[41:51] we're  just  emulating  what  our  great 
 grandfathers  did  perhaps  in  hopefully  a 
 slightly  better  more  educated  way
[41:57] because  now  we  understand  a  lot  more 
 about  psychology  and  relationships 
 this  is  not  simping  this  is  love
[42:04] and  there's  a  big  difference  in  it  and 
 it's  okay  like  you  know  the  friend  of 
 mine  sneako  he's  another  Creator  he  I
[42:09] think  he  went  on  this  rant  once  as  well 
 where  people  were  calling  him  as  like  it 
 was  on  like  a  live  chat  on  live  stream
[42:15] and  stuff  so  people  do  turn  a  bit  stupid 
 when  it  comes  to  like  live  streaming  and 
 everything  but  people  were  commenting
[42:20] like  spamming  like  when  he  kissed  this 
 girl  or  he  said  he  loved  this  girl  or
[42:25] something  and  then  he  went  on  around 
 saying  like  how  is  this  isn't  simply 
 like  we're  in  a  relationship  we're  in 
 love  that's  not  simply  it's  not  it's  all
[42:31] like  being  in  love  with  this  woman  and 
 treating  her  with  love  and  respect  and
[42:36] appreciation  is  not  simping  it's  only 
 simping  if  she  doesn't  even  like  you  if 
 she  doesn't  even  like  you  if  she
[42:41] disrespects  you  if  she  doesn't  even  know 
 you  and  then  you're  like  acting  in  this 
 proper  love  Ewa  and  you're  paying  for
[42:46] her  or  something  okay  that's  sipping  but 
 like  with  a  girl  who's  literally  yours 
 who  you  literally  have  like  you  have
[42:52] you've  got  her  soul 
 treating  her  nicely  and  paying  for  the 
 dates  and  and  being  really  conscious  of
[42:58] how  much  you've  got  to  show  love  to  her 
 is  not  simply  at  all  this  is  the  right 
 thing  to  do  this  is  for  her  benefit  and
[43:03] also  for  yours  so  don't  let  any  of  these 
 like  modern  day  Sigma  males  with  like
[43:08] smelly  breath  and  like  weird  facial  hair 
 tell  you  that  this  is  simple  because  I 
 don't  believe  it  is
[43:17] so  then  we  get  to  the  point  how  do  we 
 actually  make  her  feel  loved  we
[43:22] understand  that  we've  got  to  try  and 
 make  her  feel  loved  as  much  as  possible 
 but  how  do  we  actually  go  about  and  do
[43:28] that  because  a  lot  of  guys  don't 
 actually  know  this  and  I  didn't  for  a 
 long  time 
 a  lot  of  guys  say  this  and  quite  like
[43:34] usually  older  guys  and  a  little  bit  more 
 old  school  guys  say  this  oh  she  knows
[43:39] that  I  love  her  so  I  don't  have  to  say 
 it 
 no
[43:45] she  might  rationally  know  that  you  love 
 her
[43:51] but  she's  an  emotional  being  and  it  it's 
 not  her  rational  logical  side  that  even
[43:57] matters  if  she's  a  feminine  woman  it's 
 about  how  she  feels  right  now  she  needs
[44:02] to  be  made  to  feel  like  you  will  love 
 her  right  now 
 foreign
[44:11] you  could  do  this  how  the  Hollywood 
 movies  and  the  modern  day  materialistic
[44:16] propaganda  capitalistic  machine  want  you 
 to  with  these  big  romantic  gestures  and
[44:21] and  the  box  of  expensive  overpriced 
 chocolates  on  Valentine's  Day  and  look 
 honey  I  got  you  flowers  and  look  like
[44:26] you  know  the  the  sad  chump  who  like 
 brings  like 
 um  all  the  at  least  these  these  moments
[44:32] could  be  nice  right  this  isn't  me 
 criticizing  a  Gentleman  Just  just 
 understand  this
[44:37] there  is  a  brainwashing  and  conditioning 
 that's  been  going  on  for  a  long  time  in
[44:42] the  minds  of  men  from  movies  that  we've 
 seen  from  the  ways  that  you  know  what 
 we've  seen  in  school  that  the  way  to
[44:47] show  your  woman  love  is  a  big  romantic 
 gesture  especially  when  you  spend  money
[44:53] make  sure  you  spend  money  make  sure  you 
 spend  money  make  sure  you  spend  money 
 that's  what  they  want  you  to  do
[44:59] but  remember  what  we  said  before 
 we  need  to  make  her  feel  loved  right  now
[45:05] in  every  micro  moments 
 and  so  you  could  do  the  big  romantic
[45:10] gesture  and  the  sweet  dinner  date  that's 
 really  expensive  and  she'll  feel  loved
[45:17] for  30  seconds 
 you  bring  her  into  the  bedroom  and
[45:22] there's  rose  petals  all  over  the  floor 
 she'll  feel  loved  for  five  seconds 
 done
[45:30] now 
 right  now  that  moment's  already  gone 
 okay  she's  seen  the  pencils  okay  she's
[45:35] seen  the  dinner  day  okay  she's  eating 
 the  food  right  now  that  that  moment's 
 gone  what  about  right  now
[45:40] this  is  what  you're  not  really  told 
 it's  not  about  these  big  moments  that
[45:45] are  so  expensive  for  you  to  conduct  and 
 to  that  show  your  love  or  anything  it's 
 about  the  smallest  micro  moments  every
[45:53] as  many  moments  as  possible  that's  how 
 you  make  her  feel  loved  you  don't  need
[45:58] to  spend  money  on  this 
 you  don't  need  to  make  some  big  gesture 
 for  this
[46:03] in  fact 
 the  smaller  and  more  consistent  and  more
[46:08] quantity  of  these  moments  where  you  make 
 her  feel  loved  is  actually  better
[46:16] so  the  way  that  I  think  is  best  to  do 
 this 
 is  to  change  the  way  that  you  talk  to
[46:22] your  woman  and  there's  something  that  I 
 wrote  down  in  fact  I'll  read  it  to  you 
 right  now  so
[46:28] yeah  it's  on  my  phone 
 foreign
[46:33] act  like  you're  on  mushrooms  with  her 
 all  of  the  time 
 just  act  like  him
[46:39] for  if  you  are  wondering  I've  not  really 
 spoken  about  like  psychedelics  much  but 
 I've  taken  mushrooms  like  psychedelics
[46:44] like  maybe  10  times  or  so  and  I'm  not 
 like  a  professional  like  uh  shroom  knot
[46:49] or  whatever  it's  called  but  like  I'm 
 kind  of  like  a  fan  of  them  I'm  really 
 getting  like  a  lot  of  positive  benefit 
 from  this
[46:55] and  what  I  found  is  that  if  if  you 
 haven't  ever  taken  psychedelics  before 
 at  least  for  me  personally  I  turn  into
[47:02] like  such  a  a  romantic  almost  like  it's 
 out  of  a  movie  the  way  that  I  speak  to
[47:07] my  woman  the  way  that  I  speak  to  her  and 
 I  just  wrote  this  down 
 imagine  like  you're  on  shrooms  with  her
[47:14] all  the  time 
 I  remember  remember  this  is  I've  wrote 
 the  song  Right  remember  how  you  used  to
[47:19] talk  to  her  like  it  meant  something 
 and  this  is  I  literally  wrote  down  what
[47:25] I  was  gonna  say  to  her  when  I  was  gonna 
 give  her  this  the  seashell 
 this  is  a  gift  for  you  my  love  the  ocean
[47:32] gave  it  to  me  and  now  I  give  it  to  you 
 keep  it  safe  forever  as  a  token  of  my
[47:37] love 
 so  you  can  change  the  way  that  you  talk 
 and  you  can  talk  with  this  extra  level
[47:44] of  of 
 energy  of  emotion  and  or  more
[47:50] seriousness 
 like  you're  in  a  movie  and  this  doesn't 
 need  to  be  all  the  time  and  of  course  it
[47:55] sounds  a  little  bit  cringe  when  I'm 
 saying  what  I  was  gonna  say  to  my  girl 
 to  you  it  sounds  a  little  bit  cringe  but
[48:01] that's  because  you  know  the  context  has 
 changed  the  context  has  changed  now  I'm 
 speaking  to  you  through  the  internet  and
[48:06] you  know  people  are  listening  and 
 everything  like  that  compared  to  like  me 
 passionately  with  my  girl  there's  a
[48:11] difference 
 change  the  way  that  you  talk  to  her  and 
 talk  to  her  and  more  of  like  this  this
[48:16] beautiful  serious  way  better  than  the 
 mundane  I  love  yous  that  we  throw  out
[48:21] there  like  grab  her  cheeks  I  put  both 
 hands  on  her  cheeks  look  and  deeply  into
[48:26] her  eyes  and  just  feel  the  love  that  you 
 have  and  say  say  what's  on  your  mind  I
[48:32] won't  give  you  like  some  pre-built 
 statements  that  you  can  say  to  her 
 but  there  is  like  some  some  almost  movie
[48:39] star  level 
 sentence  and  and  stuff  that  you  can  say
[48:45] to  her  that  will  arise  if  you  let  it  if 
 you  don't  stop 
 you're  on  the  process  because  it  feels  a
[48:51] bit  cringe  because  you  don't  usually 
 talk  like  this  trust  me  if  she  is  the 
 right  girl  and  she's  totally  in  love
[48:56] with  you  and  you  act  like  this  and  you 
 talk  to  her  with  seriousness  like  with 
 this  level  of  like  you  know  of  this  like
[49:01] psychedelic  love 
 she  will  you  will  physically  see  this  I
[49:07] promise  you  you  will  see  you're  holding 
 the  cheeks  like  this  or  you  know  you're 
 holding  your  hands  you  will  see  her  as
[49:12] you  say  these  like  sweet  words 
 melts  she  will  literally  melt  in  your
[49:17] arms 
 at  least  that's  the  energy  that  I  get 
 from  my  girl  maybe  your  girl's  energy  is
[49:22] different  and  you  know  she  picks  up  and 
 she's  so  happy  to  hear  it  or  something 
 you  will  physically  see  her  energy  just
[49:28] change 
 which  is  beautiful
[49:34] and  so  the  fastest  way  that  I've 
 personally  if  I  was  going  to  recommend 
 anything  of  course  there's  a  not  like  a
[49:40] recommendation  you  can  do  whatever  you 
 want  but  like  the  fastest  way  that  I've 
 personally  been  able  to  like  level  up
[49:46] how  much  she  feels  loved  but  also  how 
 much  I  love  her  is  taking  psychedelics
[49:51] together  they've  been  a  beautiful  part 
 of  my  journey  over  the  last  few  years 
 extremely  impactful  maybe  I'll  make  like
[49:56] a  whole  separate  video  of  of  the 
 experiences  that  I've  had  on 
 psychedelics  they're  kind  of  like  a
[50:02] controversial  thing  and  I'm  not  some 
 like  guy  who's  constantly  doing  them  or 
 anything  in  around  three  years  or  two
[50:08] years  I've  done  them  maybe  I  think  seven 
 eight  times  or  something  like  that  but 
 if  you  are  interested  if  there's  a  bunch
[50:13] of  comments  saying  like  oh  yeah  I  should 
 do  that  maybe  I  will  it's  just  something 
 I've  assumed  people  will  find  too
[50:18] controversial  or  people  might  not  find 
 interest  I  don't  know
[50:24] how  to  make  love 
 so  we've  talked  about how  to  make  her 
 feel  loved  and  and  how  to  love  her  and
[50:30] everything  but  perhaps  the  most 
 important  and  the  fastest  way  to  do  this 
 is  actually  making  love  like  that  like
[50:37] actually  having  sex  in  the  book  The  Way 
 of  the  superior  man  he  defines  sex  as
[50:42] the  bodily  transmission  of  Love  think 
 about  that  that  phrase  that  is  perfect 
 for  like  the  definition  of  sex  the
[50:50] bodily  transmission  of  Love  That  is  a 
 perfect  phrase  and  yeah  it  doesn't  work 
 for  most  people
[50:56] because  most  people  don't  transmit  love 
 to  each  other  when  they're  making  love
[51:02] unfortunately  most  people 
 I  would  assume
[51:07] they're  unconscious  they're  overthinking 
 they're  neurotic  they're  self-centered
[51:12] when  they're  actually  like  getting 
 passionate  with  you  know  the  woman
[51:17] making  love  is  is 
 the  way  that  you're  you  know  magnify
[51:23] everything  that  we're  talking  about 
 today 
 if  you  are  presence  conscious  and
[51:29] actually  doing  it  in  some  kind  of  loving 
 way  and  I  don't  mean  to  you  know  oh 
 you're  gonna  do  it  slowly  or  something
[51:34] you  can  still  [ __ ]  it  but  but  doing  it 
 with  the  elements  of  Love  behind  you
[51:39] there's  something  there's  like  a  system 
 that  I  made  for  myself  and  it's  called
[51:46] dap  plus  cap  dap  plus  cap  and  it  stands
[51:51] for  dominance  aggression  pain 
 connection
[51:56] authenticity  presence 
 I  found  that  when  I  keep  these  six
[52:01] things  in  mind  as  I  make  in  love  my 
 performance  and  the  enjoyment  and  the
[52:06] connection  of  everything  goes  up 
 so  much  more  dominant  aggression  pain
[52:12] connection  authenticity  and  presence 
 Pain  by  the  way  is  an  interesting  one  I
[52:17] found  that  you  need  to  like  most  guys 
 this  is  a  controversial  subject  and 
 stuff  and  maybe  we  shouldn't  talk  about
[52:23] it  like  widely  on  YouTube  because  people 
 will  take  out  of  context  but  I  found 
 that  you  as  a  guy  who's  you  know
[52:28] masculine  man  who  wants  to dominate  your 
 woman  you  need  to  be  okay  with  the
[52:33] feeling  of  inflicting  pain  on  her  that 
 like  a  woman  who's  in  love  who's  having 
 sex  can  experience  like  a  lot  more  pain
[52:39] than  you  think  she  can  and  it's  a  part 
 of  actually  making  the  love  like  there 
 is  a  level  of  like  soreness  and
[52:45] painfulness  in  the  the  DAP  plus  cap 
 system  just  trying  to  remember  that  the 
 next  time  that  you  know  if  it  becomes
[52:51] relevant  for  you  and  if  you're 
 interested  in  one  of  the  links  in  the 
 description  I've  got  a  course  where  I
[52:56] teach  this  in  full 
 there  are  exercises  now  we  can  get  quite 
 practical  here  there  are  exercises  that
[53:03] you  can  do  that  will  make  your  your  love 
 making  sessions 
 significantly  better  like  quite
[53:09] literally  like  five  times  as  good  and 
 there  was  a  point  just  a  few  months  ago 
 when  I  was  in  London  about
[53:15] um  three  months  ago  four  months  ago  that 
 I  had  stopped  all  these  exercises  and  I 
 had  even  stopped  a  lot  of  the  normal
[53:21] exercise  like  weightlifting  and  cardio 
 that  I  was  doing  and  so  I  became  like 
 quite  relatively  unfit  for  my  own  like
[53:27] you  know 
 um  skills  you  know  my  own  sort  of  memory 
 I  became  quite  unfit  right  and  it  made  a
[53:34] huge  difference  it  made  it  that  I  wasn't 
 even  present  when  I  was  making  love  it 
 made  it  that  my  performance  was  way
[53:40] worse  that  I  was  slower  that  I  was 
 lethargic  that  I  would  get  tired  that 
 you  know  like  that  you  just  can't  go
[53:45] with  the  same  like  aggressive  Primal 
 penetration  that  you  used  to  and  so  I
[53:50] know  that  this  is  getting  like  practical 
 here  but  I  really  hope  you  can 
 appreciate  this  there  are  exercises  that
[53:55] you  should  consider  100  and  those  are  in 
 order  stuff  first  of  all  hit  high
[54:01] intensity  interval  training  so  this  is 
 you've  heard  about  this  kind  of  cardio 
 this  isn't  just  you  know  going  on  on  a
[54:06] run  for  like  five  minutes  or  10  minutes 
 that  could  probably  help  but  hit 
 training  high  intensity  interval
[54:12] training  where  you  go  for  a  Sprint  and 
 then  you  slow  down  for  a  few  minutes  and
[54:17] then  you  sprint  again  for  20  seconds 
 then  you  slow  down  for  a  few  minutes 
 then  you  sprint  again  that  kind  of 
 training  where  you  go  hard  then  you  slow
[54:23] down  then  you  go  really  fast  then  you 
 slow  down  like  this  and  this  happens  in 
 Crossfit  workouts  in  martial  art  and
[54:29] boxing  for  example  you  go  for  Rounds 
 this  hap  this  makes  you  so  much  better 
 at  like  the  breathing  elements  of  your
[54:37] performance  when  it  comes  to  love  making 
 it  makes  a  huge  difference  it  genuinely 
 does  and  I  know  it  can  seem  kind  of
[54:42] weird  why  I'm  teaching  this  as  part  of 
 this  video  but  again  making  love  is
[54:47] incredibly  important  in  what  we're 
 talking  about  and  then  being  able  to 
 actually  for  example  have  the  fitness  to
[54:53] be  able  to  make  love  is  also  incredibly 
 important  then  the  next  thing  I  realize 
 is  training  your  core  so  a  lot  of  guys
[54:59] especially  bodybuilders  and 
 weightlifters  think  that  they  can  just 
 kind  of  forget  training  their  core  and
[55:05] that  they  can  just  do  squats  and 
 deadlifts  and  I  found  that  that  doesn't 
 actually  cut  it  doing  your  own  like
[55:10] specific  core  workouts  ab  workouts 
 crunches  planks  they  make  a  huge
[55:15] difference  you  can  find  like  you  can 
 feel  if  your  core  is  letting  you  down 
 when  it  comes  to  having  sex  if  it  just
[55:21] gets  really  tight  and  it  burns  as  you 
 know  like  like  you've  been  working  it 
 out  that  means  that  it's  the  weak  spot
[55:26] and  if  you  improve  it  suddenly  like  you 
 ease  open  the  bottleneck  and  you  can
[55:31] literally  go  like  better 
 and  the  final  thing  that  we  will  talk 
 about  is  kegels  kegels  however  you  say
[55:37] it  there's  a  muscle  a  direct  muscle  that 
 you  can  use  that  directly  influences
[55:44] literally  your  erection  and  also  like 
 how  far  you  can  ejaculate  like  there's
[55:50] of  direct  muscle  that  you  can  train  that 
 will  make  you  harder  last  longer  that
[55:56] will  make  it  so  that  she  feels  better 
 and  it's  called  the  Kegel  muscle  like
[56:01] the  PC  muscle  and  there's  two  easy  ways 
 that  I'd  explain  this  there's  like  two 
 kind  of  muscles  that  we  want  to  train 
 and  there's  easy  ways  to  explain  this
[56:07] the  first  one  I  want  you  to  right  now 
 Act  to  activate  the  muscle  that  you
[56:13] would  if  you  wanted  to  stop  pissing 
 imagine  right  now  you  were  having  a  piss
[56:18] right  you're  having  a  piss  the  the 
 urine's  coming  out  and  then  you  want  to 
 stop  the  piss  what  would  you  do  do  that
[56:24] do  that  movement  right  now  it's  almost 
 like  you're  like  sucking  in  that  kind  of
[56:29] area  that's  you  we  can  say  it's  like  one 
 key  go  like  one  rep  that's  one  but  then
[56:34] another  element  is  imagine  if  you  were 
 having  a  piss  and  you  wanted  to  push  it
[56:39] out  faster  like  imagine  you're  in  a  rush 
 or  something  so  you  can  you  can  like  pee 
 at  the  normal  rate  but  you  can  push  out
[56:45] faster  P  can't  you 
 that  is  another  part  of  the  training  if 
 you  can  do  that  right  now  and  you  won't
[56:50] like  pee  yourself  in  anything  the  same 
 thing  I  imagine  you're  pushing  it  out
[56:55] those  are  two  different  like  ways  that 
 you  can  train  these  like  sexual  muscles 
 and  I  found  that  when  you  put  intention
[57:02] into  this  for  literally  just  a  few  days 
 you  will  see  an  improvement  to  your
[57:07] lovemaking  like  a  significant 
 Improvement  it  the  reason  why  I'm 
 talking  like  this  you  know  it's  such  a
[57:12] practical  tip  to  give  you  in  this  kind 
 of  video  it's  because  it  genuinely  will 
 be  the  fastest  Improvement  to  your
[57:19] lovemaking  which  will  then  genuinely  be 
 the  fastest  Improvement  to  making  her
[57:24] feel  loved 
 we  can  talk  now  about  setting  rules  and
[57:30] expectations  as  a  father  would  this  is  a 
 controversial  part  of  loving  a  feminine
[57:36] woman  that  the  modern  day  the  modern 
 world  do  not  understand  this  one  single 
 bit  a  good  father  would  set  a  very  clear
[57:44] house  rules  for  his  daughter  very  clear 
 this  is  what  you  do  this  is  what  you  eat
[57:49] this  is  how  you  behave  this  is  the  words 
 that  we  can  use  this  is  the  words  that 
 we  don't  use  this  is  what  time  you've
[57:55] got  to  come  home  from  school  everything 
 like  this  and  this  is  absolutely 
 perfectly  normal  and  healthy  for  a 
 father  to  do  this  for  his  daughter  but
[58:01] then  it  gets  kind  of  weird  to  set  these 
 kinds  of  rules  and  boundaries  for  an
[58:08] adult  for  a  grown  woman  and  the  modern 
 world  around  this  question  this  heavily
[58:13] and  says  that  this  is  toxic  controlling 
 everything  but  again  if  you  are  a
[58:18] masculine  man  dating  a  feminine  woman 
 this  is  what  she  needs  why  because  if 
 she's  a  feminine  woman  it  means  that
[58:23] she's  had  a  masculine  father 
 and  she  will  be  attracted  to  the  man  who
[58:28] acts  in  a  somewhat  similar  way  to  her 
 father  her  father  used  to  say  okay  come 
 do  this  no  not  in  a  horrible  way  you
[58:34] know  but  I  can't  come  do  this  it'll  be 
 good  for  you  no  no  don't  do  that  it'll 
 be  bad  for  you  is  used  to  her  father
[58:41] being  like  this  and  now  when  she  grows 
 up  it's  almost  like  she  wants  to  be 
 passed  on  to  the  next  man  who  can  direct
[58:47] her  life  in  the  way  of  the  superior  man 
 that  book  that  I  mentioned  before 
 there's  a  quote  which  says  she  wants  to
[58:52] relax  in  the  guidance  and  the  direction 
 of  your  your  masculinity  she  wants  you
[58:58] to  be  certain  not  just  for  yourself  and 
 your  own  Direction  but  what  she  should
[59:03] do  and  often  most  guys  are  not 
 comfortable  with  this  most  guys
[59:08] literally  are  so  like  like  anxious  with 
 this  and  the  reason  why  is  because  you
[59:14] will  get  punished  in  the  modern  day  if 
 we  talk  about  this  out  loud  like  I'm 
 doing  right  now  you  will  get  people  who
[59:20] respond  to  you  and  say  that  you're 
 manipulative  you're  misogynist 
 everything  but  the  truth  is  a  feminine
[59:25] woman  actually  needs  this  and  will  be 
 more  in  love  with  you  if  you  act  in  a
[59:30] kind  of  a  similar  way  as  her  father  did 
 when  you  set  rules  and  expectations  and 
 boundaries
[59:37] I  journaled  a  lot  for  this  video  there's 
 like  four  pages 
 in  the  modern  day  everyone  is
[59:43] depolarized  honestly  most  like  couples 
 are  depolarized  the  man's  not  that
[59:48] masculine  the  woman's  not  that  feminine 
 this  means  everyone's  quite  unhappy  and 
 because  most  relationships  are  like  this
[59:54] now  we  see  man  and  woman  as  equal  we 
 have  equal  rights  and  so  we  are  equals
[60:00] the  problem  with  this  this  equality 
 thinking  is  that  then  we  don't  need  each
[60:05] other  the  necessity  of  of  being  in  a 
 relationship  disappears  when  you're
[60:11] equals  when  you're  equals  you  don't  need 
 each  other  anymore 
 it  sounds  weird  but  one  of  the  best
[60:18] pieces  of  advice  that  I  could  give  you 
 is  to  not  treat  her  like  like  she's 
 really  cool
[60:24] it  sounds  weird  and  people  will  quote 
 this  and  and  try  and  terrorize  me  and 
 everything  and  they'll  say  that  this  is
[60:29] horrible  one  of  the  best  pieces  of 
 advice  that  I  could  give  you  is  to  treat 
 her  like  she's  weaker  than  you
[60:35] you  know  why 
 this  is  gonna  make  you  be  so  much  more
[60:40] loving  to  her  because  if  you  genuinely 
 keep  in  your  mind  that  she's  weaker  than 
 you  which  is  actually  on  objective  fact
[60:47] she  is  weaker  than  you 
 then  you  will  act  like  the  good  happy
[60:52] agile  active  father  she  needs  something 
 so  you're  gonna  stand  up  and  go  get  it
[60:57] for  her  and  she's  gonna  love  that  this 
 is  not  something  she's  broken  something 
 and  you're  gonna  sit  down  and  help  her
[61:03] clean  it 
 the  weak  lazy  father  who  thinks  that  his 
 daughter's  grown  up  enough  oh  we  need
[61:08] milk  and  he  throws  her  a  pound  like  you 
 know  a  dollar  or  something  oh  yeah  go  go
[61:13] get  it  he  says  to  her  in  the  modern  day 
 this  is  what  a  lot  of  relationships  are 
 like  the  man  is  acting  like  an  equal  or
[61:19] even  below  the  man  is  acting  like  the 
 boy  the  son  to  his  woman  the  mother  and
[61:24] this  is  why  relationships  have  gotten  so 
 ucky  for  a  lot  of  people  especially  if 
 you're  able  to  resonate  with  me  and  you
[61:30] know  like  feel  the  similarities  between 
 maybe  if  you  you  feel  kind  of  similar  to 
 me  in  some  areas
[61:35] if  you're  a  masculine  man  you'll  find 
 that  in  deeply  unattractive  to  think 
 that  your  woman  is  gonna  guide  you  your
[61:40] woman's  gonna  like  look  after  you  she's 
 gonna  provide  for  you  that  she's  gonna 
 make  half  the  decisions
[61:46] treat  her  like  you  would  your  daughter
[61:51] you  would  do  a  lot  for  your  daughter  you 
 would  be  the  one  to  protect  her  you'd  be
[61:56] the  one  to  jump  up  out  your  seat  when 
 your  daughter  needs  something  if  you 
 were  like  the  good  happy  father
[62:03] she  expects 
 to  follow  you 
 remember  this  is  not  all  women  honestly
[62:09] this  is  we're  talking  about  the  small 
 amount  of  women  right  we 
 we  never  wanted  to  date  90  of  of  women
[62:15] right 
 um I  was  gonna  say  no  offense  to  the 
 barnacy  offense  to  them  we  like  90  of
[62:21] men  and  women  are  just  like  Low  T  or 
 aren't  they  you  look  around  everyone's
[62:26] on  Tick  Tock  everyone's  watching  porn 
 and  playing  video  games  and  eating  junk 
 food  and  taking  drugs  and  stuff  okay  90 
 of  people  are  just  like  we  don't
[62:32] okay  if  you're  on  self-improvement  if 
 you're  meditating  if  you're  going  to  the 
 gym  you  can't  even  relate  to  most  people
[62:37] we  don't  want  to  date  some  normal 
 masculine  independent  woman  if  you 
 wanted  to  date  a  feminine  woman  this  is
[62:43] what  she  expects  because  her  father 
 acted  like  this 
 and  there  is  something  iconic  with  how
[62:48] man  and  woman  used  to  get  married  her 
 father  used  to  walk  her  down  the  aisle 
 and  pass  her  to  the  husband
[62:54] in  the  modern  day  feminists  say  that 
 this  yeah  this  was  like  some  some 
 ceremony  that  was  so  Barbara  no  it
[63:00] wasn't 
 he  was  her  protector  the  father  was  her 
 provider
[63:06] and  then  he  passes  the  responsibility 
 onto  the  husband  that  is  one  of  the  like 
 that  is  the  most  sacred  moment  that  a
[63:13] father  could  have  is  like  thinking  to 
 himself  I'm  passing  like  you  know  my
[63:20] how  much  I  have  looked  after  my  little 
 girl  to  this  man
[63:25] and  I  am  trusting  this  man  to  look  after 
 this  the  same  way  that  I  did  that  is  the
[63:31] most  beautiful  moment  the  husband  and 
 father  could  see
[63:36] and  in  the  modern  day  like  feminists  and 
 men  with  like  skinny  necks  and  long  hair 
 is  saying  like  oh  yeah  that's  barbaric
[63:41] it's  sexist 
 let  the  that  let  the  feminine  woman 
 decide  if  there's  a  masculine  woman  out
[63:46] there  who  thinks  it  is  more  better  okay 
 fine  the  thing  is  what  we're  just  doing 
 is  just  invoking  our  own  consent  and  our
[63:52] own  preferences  and  we're  attracting 
 like  we  want  to  attract  the  feminine 
 woman  who  actually  expects  this  because
[63:58] her  father  who's  still  around  who's  not 
 divorced  from  her  mother  her  father 
 raised  her  quite  tightly  securely  her
[64:06] father  set  rules  and  said  no  no  we  don't 
 do  that  because  of  this  no  yes  we  do  no
[64:11] come  on  we  do  this  thing  no  we  don't 
 stay  out  that  late  no  you  know  what  you
[64:16] can't  be  friends  with  that  girl  because 
 she's  not  good  for  you  her  father  was 
 like  this  for  a  good  feminine  woman  that
[64:21] like  you  think  is  actually  good  quality 
 her  father  would  have  it  like  that  this 
 is  the  only  way  a  woman  can  be  of  good
[64:26] quality  her  father  was  like  this 
 and  so  you  must  be  like  this  too  you
[64:31] must  be  okay  with  being  seen  as  a 
 misogynist  patriarchal  figure  you  must
[64:36] be  okay  with  setting  rules  and 
 expectations  and  telling  her  what  you 
 can  and  can't  do
[64:41] foreign 
 if  you  know  that  you're  supposed  to  be  a
[64:46] man  like  this  if  this  sounds  like 
 absolutely  right  and  you  couldn't  even 
 imagine  a  relationship  where  for  example
[64:53] you  didn't  get  to  say  or  you  know  make 
 your  girl  do  something
[64:58] that  would  be  weird  for  you 
 you've  got  to  be  authentic  with  this 
 because  a  lot  of  guys  don't  have  the
[65:03] confidence  to  admit  this  but  if  this  is 
 your  desire  to  have  this  kind  of 
 relationship  where  genuinely  you  are  in
[65:09] control  of  your  woman  then  be  authentic 
 to  it  of  course  this  is  going  to  be  with 
 consent  with  age-appropriate  adults  and
[65:15] everything  so  no  one  can  ever  like 
 criticize  us  for  this  be  authentic  with 
 your  desire  with  this
[65:22] the  extreme  level  of  this  now  she's 
 going  to  be  embarrassed  when  I  tell  this 
 like  mini  story  The  Extreme  level  with
[65:28] you  know  you  telling  your  girl  what  to 
 do  and  her  looking  to  your  guidance  is 
 that  when  you  get  to  the  extreme  levels
[65:35] of  feminine  energy  inside  of  a  woman 
 where  she  has  like  literally  zero 
 Independence  when  she's  with  you
[65:41] and  she's  totally  100  submissive  when 
 she's  with  you 
 is  something  that  I've  just  experienced
[65:47] a  few  days  ago  where  I  was  having  a 
 shower  and  my  girl  lives  with  me  right 
 she's  like  we've  been  all  like  we've
[65:52] traveled  a  lot  the  last  six  months  in 
 different  countries  we  lived  in 
 different  countries  right  I  was  having  a
[65:57] shower  and  it  just  hit  me  I  was  like 
 wait  she's  going  to  be  embarrassed  when 
 I  tell  this  story
[66:02] it  hit  me  I  was  like  she's  not  I  had  a 
 shower  in  like  two  days  or  for  a  little
[66:07] while  and  I  know  this  isn't  like 
 weirdest  it's  embarrassing  to  say  and 
 people  are  gonna  find  this  weird  but  the
[66:12] reason  why  this  hit  me  and  I  thought  oh 
 yeah 
 because  like  I've  gotta  tell  her  to
[66:18] I've  got  to  tell  her  like  oh  yeah  not 
 like  I'll  go  have  a  shower  stinky  but 
 like  you  know  come  come  shower  with  me
[66:24] and  it  this  is  when  it  hit  me  of  how 
 sweet  this  is  even  though  that's  kind  of 
 like  a  gross  example  it  hit  me  because
[66:29] it  made  me  realize  just  how  much 
 responsibility  I  have  to  take  as  a  man
[66:35] that  I  have  to  think  of  her  basic  needs 
 just  as  I  would  a  father  to  a  daughter
[66:41] now  you  might  hear  that  well  probably 
 not  you  but  like  you  know  there's  going 
 to  be  some  people  who  would  hear  this 
 and  say  oh  well  that's  that's  gross  and
[66:47] I  want  a  woman  who's  more  independent 
 and  that's  real  that's  weird
[66:53] whatever  your  preference  is  fine  but 
 then  I  can  have  mine  you  can  have  yours 
 right 
 the  thing  is  there's  a  lot  of  people
[66:59] listening  to  this  there's  a  lot  of  men 
 out  there  perhaps  you're  one  of  them  who 
 actually  in  a  weird  way  think  that
[67:06] that's  kind  of  attractive  she  didn't 
 take  a  shower 
 unless  you  would  kind  of  tell  her  oh
[67:12] yeah  like  come  with  and  of  course  if  she 
 lives  by  herself  if  she  lives  with  her 
 family  or  roommates  or  something  of 
 course  that's  going  to  be  different  and
[67:17] you  know  you're  not  coming  you  don't 
 want  it  to  be  like  oh  yeah  she's 
 literally  just  sat  there  and  felt  till 
 you  come  visit  again  of  course  this  is
[67:23] on  the  dynamic  of  like  oh  yeah  we  live 
 together  we  do  a  lot  of  things  together 
 so  if  I've  not  like  brought  her  into  the
[67:28] shower  for  like  two  days  or  something  it 
 kind  of  like  oh  yeah  it  just  you  know 
 brushed  past  her  mind  or  something  and 
 girls  do  I  sometimes  do  this  weird  thing
[67:33] where  they  don't  shower  for  like  a  day 
 or  something  because  they  don't  want  to 
 get  their  hair  wet  I  don't  know  but  you
[67:38] get  what  I  mean  right  she's  gonna  be 
 embarrassed  that  I  told  this  story  but 
 hopefully  there's  gonna  be  some  guys 
 maybe  you're  one  of  them  who  kind  of
[67:43] understand  what  I'm  getting  at  here  that 
 there's  a  lot  of  responsibility  to  take 
 here  there's  a  lot  you  have  to  think
[67:49] about  her  fundamental  needs  and  so  now 
 I'm  getting  I'm  personally  getting 
 better  at  this  I  wake  up  come  on  baby
[67:55] let's  brush  our  teeth 
 because  if  I  don't  say  that 
 she  might  not
[68:01] and  again  a  lot  of  people  with  no  no 
 that's  weird  that's  weird  fine  fine
[68:06] but  a  lot  of  masculine  men  see  this 
 level  of  feminine  submissive  dependent
[68:11] energy  in  a  woman  and  think  that  is 
 exactly  what  I'm  attracted  to  I  want  her
[68:16] exactly  to  be  like  an  extension  of  my 
 arm  I  want  her  to  be  mine
[68:22] I  don't  want  her  to  be  this  independent 
 girl  who  can  go  live  her  life  I  want  her
[68:27] to  be  mine 
 and  so  this  is  where  it  gets  really 
 controversial  and  many  people  can
[68:33] disagree  and  many  people  can  say  that 
 this  is  too  far  or  anything  for  me 
 personally  this  is  the  right  level  she's
[68:38] happy  I'm  happy  maybe  you  want  something 
 similar  maybe  you  don't  but  I'm  just 
 telling  you  as  an  example  this  is  like
[68:44] the  extreme  example  of  like  okay  when 
 she's  totally  submissive  just  like  a
[68:49] daughter  would  be  like  a  young  girl 
 would  be  this  is  what  it's  like  and 
 actually  we  have  two  comments  here  that
[68:54] I  want  to  read  that  guys  have  left 
 comments  on  my  YouTube 
 there's  a  comment  from  Zaid  chakras
[69:02] realize  you  can't  find  a  good  girl  you 
 must  guide  her  in  the  right  direction
[69:07] yourself  and  then  there's  a  comment  from 
 a  guy  on  YouTube  his  name  was  Chad  on 
 YouTube  love  your  woman  like  a
[69:14] one-year-old  daughter 
 on  dating  a  feminine  woman  this  is  the
[69:19] key  love  your  woman  like  your  one  year 
 old  daughter  like  your  poo  poo  poo  PP
[69:26] one-year-old  daughter  you  cannot  go 
 wrong  if  she's  a  feminine  woman  you 
 cannot  go  wrong  with  this  in  your  mind
[69:32] love  her  like  she's  my  one-year-old 
 daughter 
 oh  she  says  something  like  a  little  bit
[69:38] too  rude  or  something  oh  yeah  no  you're 
 a  poo  poo  head  oh  she's  like  she's  she's
[69:43] misbehaving  a  little  bit  no  come  on  come 
 on  always  loving  her  you  went  with  your
[69:48] daughter  wouldn't  you  imagine  your 
 one-year-old  daughter  acts  in  some  kind 
 of  way  with  slightly  disrespectful
[69:55] you'd  still  love  her  you'd  still  grasp 
 her  in  and  then  she  knows  oh  there  is
[70:00] secure  love  here  this  is  not  like 
 rewarding  bad  behavior  this  is  not  going 
 against  the  red  pill  or  anything  this  is
[70:05] just  to  understand  it  in  a  slightly  like 
 condescending  way 
 that  actually  she  isn't  that  far  off
[70:13] from  the  one-year-old  daughter  in  terms 
 of  how  we  would  behave  to  her  of  course 
 she's  matured  of  course  she's  developed
[70:19] you  know  this  sentence  that  I'm  saying 
 right  now  will  not  be  quoted  when  some 
 male  feminist  puts  us  on  his  YouTube
[70:24] channel  or  his  videos  or  his  articles  or 
 something  but  of  course  like  of  course 
 she's  developed  since  she's  one  years
[70:29] old  but  for  your  own  benefit  and  for  her 
 benefit  if  you  just  imagine  and  treat
[70:34] her  like  she  is  your  one-year-old 
 daughter  your  relationship  will 
 drastically  improve  as  long  as  she  is  a
[70:39] feminine  woman  and  of  course  the 
 disclaimer  there's  going  to  be  masculine 
 women  watching  this  there's  going  to  be
[70:44] male  feminists  watching  this  who  get 
 angry  at  this  this  is  the  most 
 controversial  part  of  this  video  and  I 
 know  that  a  lot  of  people  will  take  it
[70:49] out  of  context  but  those  people 
 generally  aren't  even  in  happy 
 relationships  anyway  those  are  the  kinds
[70:54] of  people  who  are  on  antidepressants  and 
 then  say  that  like  what  we  say  about 
 self-improvement  and  everything  is  is
[71:00] toxic  and  how  are  they  who  who  are  they 
 to  give  us  advice  anyway
[71:05] living  together  so  this  is  a  very 
 specific  few  tips  I  can  just  give  you
[71:10] because  I've  kind  of  like  lived  with  my 
 girl  for  the  last  six  months  or  so  so  in
[71:15] brief  like  the  story  of  us  is  that  we 
 met  in  Thailand  in  uh  July  last  year  in
[71:21] 2022  I  was  traveling  with  my  best  friend 
 Sam  she  was  traveling  with  her  brother 
 and  one  of  her  female  friends  and  then
[71:27] we  met  literally  on  my  last  day  in 
 Thailand  so  I  was  about  to  fly  out  the 
 next  day  we  met  and  in  the  first  day
[71:33] that  we  met  both  of  us  actually  fell  in 
 love  which  was  a  very  magical  experience 
 and
[71:38] there's  a  lot  to  say  about  that  there 
 but  yeah  I  um  I  flew  out  back  home  and
[71:43] we  stayed  connected  which  is  quite  rare 
 for  me  like  I  don't  do  like  internet 
 relationships  or  anything  but  this  was
[71:48] very  rare  for  me  that  I  I  still  had  this 
 extremely  like  strong  pull  towards  her
[71:53] as  she  did  with  me  halfway  across  the 
 world  and  then  shortly  after  she  she  was
[71:58] meant  to  keep  traveling  but  shortly 
 after  she  just  booked  a  flight  and  then 
 a  12  hour  flight  from  Thailand  to  London
[72:04] and  then  a  four  hour  train  to  come  see 
 me  for  a  date  she  traveled
[72:10] genuinely  this  is  an  exaggeration  she 
 genuinely  traveled  the  globe  to  come  see
[72:16] me  for  updates 
 we  had  the  best  dates  of  our  life  which 
 was  a  one  week  road  trip  we  didn't  even
[72:22] use  technology  we  literally  drove  around 
 the  UK  drove  around  Scotland  didn't  use
[72:27] technology  slept  in  the  car  best  week  of 
 my  entire  life  best  week  of  her  life  and 
 then  she  went  back  home  for  a  few  days
[72:32] and  I  told  her  okay  I'm  gonna  book  like 
 a  place  in  Scotland  close  to  where  we 
 were  then  we  stayed  together  there  for  a
[72:37] month  and  then  we  drove  down  to  London 
 and  we  essentially  moved  to  London 
 because  that  was  my  plan  for  last  year  I
[72:42] was  going  to  move  to  London  moved  to 
 London  but  only  for  two  and  a  half 
 months  I  was  meant  to  stay  there  for  a
[72:48] year  but  then  I  just  hated  it  I  hated 
 out  unsafe  and  how  like  degenerate 
 London  and  just  wet  the  West  is  in
[72:54] general  the  UK  cities  are  just  horrible 
 this  is  a  side  runs  so  we  were  there 
 then  we  flew  out  to  Dubai  and  really
[72:59] liked  it  there  for  two  months  and  then 
 we  went  to  Thailand  went  to  Shanghai  and
[73:04] right  we've  been  to  so  many  different 
 locations  and  so  I'm  just  gonna  give  you 
 some  advice  from  the  experiences  that
[73:09] we've  had  because  we've  technically 
 lived  together  but  of  course  in  many 
 different  areas  and  living  together
[73:14] living  with  your  partner  is  a 
 tricky  situation  to  begin  so  maybe  you
[73:20] can  skip  this  if  you  don't  expect  to 
 live  with  your  girl  for  a  while  or 
 whatever  but  it  you  know  if  you  do  if
[73:25] you  are  ever  expecting  to  move  in 
 together  which  maybe  would  be  you  know 
 the  the  right  thing  to  do  especially  if
[73:31] you're  gonna  have  children  or  something 
 we're  not  planting  such  kids  right  now 
 but  I've  just  got  like  one  or  two  tips  I
[73:36] wanted  to  give  you  here  living  together 
 is  the  fast  track  to  depolarization
[73:41] because  of  familiarity  so  that's  a  bad 
 thing  living  together  is  the  fast  track
[73:46] to  depolarization  so  depolarization  is 
 when  the  man  becomes  feminine  and  or
[73:51] like  at  least  your  energy  just  kind  of 
 gets  like  in  this  weird  Gray  Zone  where 
 you're  not  Ultra  masculine  she's  not
[73:56] she's  not  Ultra  feminine  because  you 
 just  spend  so  much  time  with  each  other 
 when  you  were  apart  she  thinks  of  you  as
[74:03] Superman  what's  he  doing  who's  he  with 
 what  girls  is  he  speaking  to  what  you 
 know  she's  got  all  these  big  things  of
[74:08] you  and  then  when  you  spend  all  day 
 together  it's  like  she  smelt  your  poo  by 
 [ __ ]  seven  I  was  gonna  say  seven
[74:13] times  a  day  but  maybe  it's  not  that  much 
 for  you  but  I  eat  a  lot  of  protein  but 
 you  know  what  I  mean  the  mystery's  all
[74:19] gone  and  it  can  be  very  easy  to  lose  a 
 lot  of  the  excitement  and  love  at  this
[74:25] point 
 and  I've  also  found  that  when  you  are
[74:30] living  together  you  are  bound  to  rub  off 
 each  each  other  in  the  worst  where  your
[74:36] bounds  are  just  agitate  each  other 
 slightly  at  some  moment  which  can 
 actually  be  kind  of  significant  at  least
[74:41] for  me  I  I  really  get  agitated  at  how 
 slow  she  is  I'm  just  complaining  but
[74:47] you'll  get  why  in  a  second  because  this 
 is  important  for  you  in  cases  you've  not 
 experienced  this  it's  just  in  cases  you
[74:53] know  because  I 
 I  lived  with  a  girl  three  four  years  ago
[74:58] remember  that  I  told  you  the  comparison 
 story  where  I  had  like  the  trip  with  my 
 girl  but  then  four  years  ago  I  was
[75:04] fapping  at  night  time  and  I  was  living 
 with  like  my  ex-girlfriend  right 
 I  lived  with  her  I  moved  in  with  her  and
[75:09] I  had  never  looked  into  like  living  with 
 a  girl  before  I  wish  that  I  had  this
[75:14] part  of  this  video  like  four  years  ago 
 and  so  this  is  why  I'm  giving  this  very 
 specific  example
[75:20] you  rub  off  on  each  other  in  the  worst 
 way  when  you  live  together  because  you
[75:25] see  these  micro  moments  of  each  other 
 which  are  kind  of  annoying  so  for 
 example  as  a  man  oftentimes  you  want  to
[75:31] go  quite  fast  in  some  areas  so  for 
 example  when  it's  time  to  go  to  the  gym 
 for  me  personally  maybe  for  you  you  want
[75:36] to  put  your  music  in  put  your  shoes  on 
 okay  go  you  know  I  mean  you're  like  in 
 this  flow  of  like  going  forward  come  on
[75:41] let's  go  let's  go  to  the  gym  and  smash 
 it  and  everything  and  then  you  walk  out 
 and  your  girls  like  oh  I  forgot  my  towel
[75:47] like  you  know  she's  having  a  good  time 
 she's  holding  a  little  hip  thrust  pad 
 while  she's  smiling  at  you  and  stuff  and
[75:52] you're  listening  to  like  like  aggressive 
 music  on  the  way  there  like  drill  music 
 or  something  or  metal  music  and  she's
[75:58] there  forever  smiling  at  you  like  oh 
 what  do  you  want  to  eat  for  lunch  after 
 like 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  like  sometimes  she's
[76:05] slow  you  know  I  ride  motorbikes  and  so 
 sometimes  it's  like  my  girl  just  spends 
 too  long  with  the  helmet  and  you  know
[76:11] she's  got  the  airpod  in  and  then  she 
 drops  the  airpod  the  reason  why  I'm 
 saying  this  you  know  it  sounds  like  I'm 
 just  complaining  is  because  this  is  very
[76:17] micro  but  these  small  things  bother  you 
 when  they  can  happen  every  single  day  or
[76:23] multiple  times  a  day  which  is  what 
 happens  when  you  live  together  living 
 together  is  a  fast  track  to  annoying
[76:29] each  other  but  there  is  so  many  benefits 
 you  get  to  see  like  like  you're  on  the
[76:35] micro  moments  through  the  day 
 you  get  to  see  some  beautiful  moments
[76:41] there's  a  moment  when  I  heard  my  girls 
 laugh 
 like  at  night  time  you  know  we  were  just
[76:47] like  goofing  around  giggling  about 
 something  and  she  just  laughed  in  a 
 particular  way
[76:53] and  honestly  it  made  me  like  it  really 
 hit  me  with  some  significance  because  I
[76:58] couldn't  help  but  just  hear  and  feel  and 
 visualize  that  like  that's  how  she  would
[77:03] laugh  with  gray  hair  40  years  from  now 
 like  we're  still  laughing  in  the  same
[77:08] way 
 there's  a  lot  of  good  benefits  and  you 
 know  having  like  a  good  woman  around  a
[77:14] feminine  submissive  woman  around 
 there's  a  lot  of  benefits  to  that  it 
 depends  what  you're  after  if  you  do  want
[77:20] to  live  together  or  not  I'm  not  going  to 
 tell  you  to  but 
 there  is  one  good  tip  I  can  give  you
[77:25] which  is  that 
 try  to  have  a  some  kind  of  daily 
 separation  and  reunion  so  what  I  mean  by
[77:32] this  is  that  even  if  you  live  together 
 don't  spend  all  day  next  to  each  other
[77:37] you  know  okay  so  we're  gonna  wake  up  and 
 we're  gonna  brush  our  teeth  and  we're 
 both  gonna  go  to  the  gym  together  then 
 we're  both  gonna  go  to  like  this
[77:43] restaurant  together  then  I'm  gonna  work 
 here  and  you're  gonna  go  sit  there  and 
 read  or  something  you're  gonna  work 
 there  don't  be  together  all  day  even
[77:50] though  you  live  together  I  found  if  you 
 have  even  a  small  amount  of  Separation 
 through  the  day  like  for  example  right
[77:56] now  I'm  working  in  this  office  space  and 
 she's  downstairs  in  the  apartment  this 
 is  amazing  because  I'm  gonna  walk  in  and
[78:01] we  haven't  seen  each  other  for  like 
 three  hours  or  four  hours  so  there's 
 like  a  reunion  we're  gonna  you  know  it's
[78:06] like  it's  gonna  be  nice  to  see  her  she's 
 missing  me  right  now 
 so  we're  gonna  go  in  for  a  big  hug  and
[78:11] it's  gonna  be  a  lot  more  passionate 
 imagine  the  exact  moment  I  walk  in  that 
 exact  moment  when  we  hug  each  other
[78:16] that's  going  to  be  more  passionate  than 
 if  I  hadn't  been  anywhere  today  wouldn't 
 it  imagine  okay  I  get  home
[78:23] 605  p.m  at  six  or  five  PM  we're  gonna 
 have  a  big  hug  or  you  know  she's  missing 
 me  I've  been  gone  for  a  few  hours  let's
[78:28] go  get  some  food  if  I  didn't  go  out 
 today  at  six  or  five  PM  it's  not  like  we 
 would  have  just  suddenly  like  stood  up
[78:33] and  just  oh  yeah  yeah  oh  like  you  know  I 
 missed  you  so  obviously  not  right  that's
[78:38] separation  and  reunion  if  it  can  be 
 daily  can  be  beautiful  maybe  go  to  the
[78:43] gym  by  yourself  maybe  sign  up  for  some 
 kind  of  Class  by  yourself  maybe  sign  her 
 up  for  a  class  that  would  benefit  her
[78:49] and  it  would  help  her  to  go  to  grow  and 
 then  I  have  this  is  a  specific  thing
[78:55] which  not  a  lot  of  people  could  maybe  do 
 but  try  to  avoid  long-term  stability 
 this  is  I  think  an  absolute  killer  for
[79:03] like  middle  aged  relationships  you  know 
 of  like  married  couples  they  move  in 
 together  and  it's  just  that's  their  life
[79:09] now  and  yep  they  go  to  work  the  same  job 
 for  10  years  and  you  know  the  same 
 routine  and  everything  and  it  gets  just
[79:14] routine  and  and  just  mundane  extremely 
 quickly  and  then  for  10  years  and  20
[79:19] years  you  know  they  try  and  spice  things 
 up  by  taking  an  extra  honeymoon  or 
 something  but  it  doesn't  work  because
[79:24] they  have  this  long-term  stability  one 
 of  the  really  good  things  that  me  and  my 
 girl  have  had  is  that  we've  been  all
[79:30] over  not  not  you  know  purposely  that 
 yeah  let's  just  go  traveling  but  just 
 because  I'm  a  young  man  and  I'm
[79:36] following  my  purpose  us  and  I  want  to 
 keep  moving  around  to  try  and  see  where 
 is  a  good  place  for  me  to  like  you  know
[79:41] call  home  it  was  a  good  place  for  me  to 
 set  up  I  have  a  residency  now  in  Dubai 
 which  means  that  my  company  makes  zero
[79:47] percent  tax  so  that  was  exciting  to  move 
 there  for  that  we  moved  to  London  to  see 
 if  that  was  the  place  where  I  didn't 
 like  it  you  know  imagine  every  time  you
[79:53] move  of  course  moving  is  kind  of 
 stressful  but  it's  like  it  adds  this 
 extra  freshness  and  this  extra
[79:59] dependency  that  she  has  on  you  married 
 couples  don't  do  this  like  maybe  a 
 married  couple  moves  like  once  in  their
[80:05] life  or  twice  in  their  life 
 and  then  it  gets  very  mundane  it  gets 
 very  boring  if  you're  a  young  man
[80:11] watching  this  and  you  are  like  living 
 with  your  girl  you  can  go  on  like  you're 
 a  lot  Freer  than  most  people  are
[80:16] especially  if  you  make  money  online  if  I 
 was  a  young  couple  right  now  I  wouldn't
[80:21] book  some  like  place  to  live  like  some 
 home  for  a  year  you  know  to  rent  this 
 apartment  for  a  year  and  I  would
[80:27] certainly  not  buy  some  house  in  like  my 
 hometown  that  I  see  a  lot  of  young 
 couples  so  I  certainly  wouldn't  do  that
[80:32] because  then  you're  tied  down  there  and 
 then  you've  got  to  kind  of  just  stay  in 
 that  one  area  and  things  get  mundane
[80:38] very  quickly  it'd  be  best  if  you  stayed 
 quite  short  term  here  one  month  here  two 
 months  here  three  months  and  even  though
[80:44] yeah  the  headache  of  moving  is  annoying 
 what  actually  would  happen  is  that  you 
 have  such  significant  chapters  of  your
[80:51] life  with  this  woman  because  you've 
 experienced  so  much  so  they're  the  two 
 like  learning  lessons  I've  had  in  terms
[80:56] of  living  together 
 now  let's  say  you've  you've  done  a  bunch
[81:01] of  this  stuff  where  are  we 
 continue  being  the  best  man  that  she 
 could  get  I  would  absolutely  have  to
[81:08] include  this  part  in  this  video  because 
 even  though  we're  just  talking  about
[81:13] loving  her 
 she  only  wants  your  love  for  as  long  as 
 you  are  competent  and  attractive  for  as
[81:20] long  as  she  is  actually  still  in  love 
 with  you  this  is  a  major  issue  what  a
[81:25] lot  of  guys  go  through  they  think  that 
 the  end  goal  is  to  get  into  the 
 relationship  and  they  forget  that
[81:30] actually  that  is  the  start  it's  not  the 
 end  goal  to  get  into  the  relationship 
 that's  the  end  like  that's  like  the
[81:37] start  of  the  new  big  thing  to  think 
 about  most  guys  get  into  the 
 relationship  and  kind  of  relax  put  their
[81:43] feet  up  go  to  the  gym  a  little  bit  less 
 spend  less  time  with  their  friends  be 
 less  mysterious  relax  and  spend  more
[81:49] evenings  just  watching  Netflix  and 
 wasting  away  with  instant  gratification 
 the  thing  is  you  are  a  man  on 
 self-improvement  and  you  were  able  to
[81:55] attract  her  because  of  the  man  that  you 
 became  because  of  your  discipline
[82:00] because  of  delaying  gratification 
 because  of  your  self-improvements 
 letting  those  things  slack  what  because
[82:06] you've  just  got  her 
 this  is  controversial  as  hell
[82:11] she  will  leave  and  she  has  the  right  to 
 do  so  because  there  is  something  called 
 Branch  swinging  and  this  is  really
[82:18] interesting  Branch  swinging 
 is  when  a  woman  is  with  you  but  she  will
[82:26] like  as  a  monkey  would  she's  got  one 
 branch  right  now  but  she's  kind  of  you 
 know  looking  for  the  next  Branch  to
[82:32] swing  to  and  she  will  grab  the  branch 
 before  she  lets  go  of  the  current  one
[82:38] and  and  of  course  people  will  take  this 
 out  of  context  I'm  not  describing  women 
 as  monkeys  or  cheaters  or  anything
[82:43] but  Branch  swinging  is  essentially  where 
 most  women  especially  this  is  the
[82:48] interesting  thing  especially  feminine 
 women  are  so  much  more  likely  to  like
[82:53] essentially  like  leave  you  abandon  you 
 and  to  choose  another  guy  and  even  to 
 cheat  because  of  evolution  because  she
[83:00] needs  to  constantly  be  with  the  best  guy 
 that  would  give  her  the  best  genes  for 
 her  children  and  also  that  would  keep
[83:06] her  children  safe  if  you  display 
 weakness  if  you  get  complacent  if  you 
 start  lacking  in  the  things  that  she  was
[83:11] attracted  to  it's  natural  for  her  to 
 start  looking  elsewhere  most  guys  don't 
 want  to  like  think  about  this  most  guys
[83:17] reject  this  and  then  get  angry  towards 
 women  and  say  wait  the  the  cheaters 
 that's  horrible  yeah  I  don't  care  about
[83:22] women  anyway  most  women  hear  this  and 
 get  offended  no  we're  not  cheetahs  and 
 everything  but  this  is  absolutely  normal
[83:29] healthy  and  necessary  how  do  you  say 
 that  word  necessary  for  the  the
[83:35] evolution  of  humans  for  the  survival  of 
 our  species  women  must  find  strength  she
[83:41] must  find  and  be  impregnated  it  by  a  man 
 of  strength  always  and  so  if  you  start
[83:47] to  show  weakness  she  can't  help  but  to 
 lose  that  attraction  in  you 
 this  is  the  point  where  you  must
[83:53] continue  being  the  best  man  that  she 
 could  get 
 and  there  is
[83:58] something  we've  got  to  say  here 
 the  sexual  Marketplace  essentially  how
[84:04] we  date  gets  more  and  more  competitive 
 competitive  every  year  you  probably  hear 
 that  like  a  hundred  years  ago  to  attract
[84:10] a  woman  all  you  needed  was  like  an  okay 
 job  a  car  and  if  you  were  like  a  decent
[84:15] man  you'd  be  married  with  Children  these 
 days  it  feels  like  you  need  to  be  six 
 foot  one  with  really  attractive  face  and
[84:20] you  need  to  have  a  good  body  and  you'll 
 also  need  to  make  a  lot  of  money  and  you 
 need  to  have  good  personality  and  you
[84:25] need  to  know  the  tick  tock  dances  and 
 you  need  to  have  the  tick  tock  following 
 and  everything  like  that  you  need  to 
 have  bring  a  lot  to  the  table  and  every
[84:31] year  what's  required  for  you  to  achieve 
 love  from  this  woman  goes  up  and  up  and
[84:36] up 
 the  sexual  Marketplace  is  getting  more 
 and  more  competitive  now  is  not  the  time
[84:42] to  get  complacent  you  must  understand 
 that  if  you  get  into  a  relationship  with 
 this  woman  you  need  to  not  just  stay  the
[84:48] same 
 certainly  not  get  worse  you  need  to  get 
 better  significantly  better  whilst  with
[84:54] her  because  all  the  men 
 are  getting  better
[84:59] you  need  to  see  this  in  your  mind  right 
 now  other  men  are  getting  better  or  the 
 men
[85:05] want  your  woman 
 the  next  time  you  go  to  the  gym  you  can 
 do  this  visualization  a  lot  of  guys
[85:10] won't  because  it's  gross  but  the  next 
 time  you  go  to  the  gym  especially  if  you 
 go  at  peak  times  just  look  around  at
[85:17] some  of  the  masculine  like  attractive 
 hard  looking  guys  there  look  around  at 
 that  massive  bodybuilder  over  there  look
[85:23] at  that  guy  covered  in  tattoos  over 
 there  look  at  that  white  skinhead  over 
 there  look  at  that  black  guy  who  looks 
 quite  fashionable  look  at  that  guy  over
[85:29] there  look  at  that  guy  look  at  that  guy 
 they  would  all  love  to  slam  into  your 
 girl's  [ __ ]
[85:35] and  I  know  this  is  gross  but  I  just 
 sometimes  you  need  like  you  need  to  like 
 hear  this  sometimes  because  you  like  it
[85:41] we  live  in  this  like  safe  modern  world 
 where  we  don't  discuss  this  bro
[85:46] other  men  want  your  woman  other  men  want 
 your  future  wife  of  course  they  do  right 
 if  she's  desirable  of  course  they  do
[85:51] right  and  it's  up  to  her  to  like  you 
 know  like  not  be  receptive  to  them  and 
 stuff  right  but  the  thing  is  other  men
[85:57] are  getting  more  attractive  there  are 
 guys  out  there  who  are  who  are  building 
 more  muscle  who  are  building  more 
 success  who  are  getting  fitter  who  are
[86:04] getting  more  attractive  who  are 
 confident  who  will  look  your  woman  in 
 the  eyes  until  she  looks  away  and
[86:09] slightly  smiles  to  herself  because  he 
 was  kind  of  hot 
 I  know  she  can't  help  but  feel  quite 
 attracted  to  him  because  you've  gained
[86:15] five  percent  body  fat  since  you've  been 
 with  her  these  are  like  these  dark  parts 
 of  like  female  psychology  of  loving  a
[86:21] woman  that  most  people  don't  want  to 
 talk  about  because  it's  gross  to  think 
 this  and  yet  if  you  do  think  that  it's
[86:26] just  every  now  and  then  that  there  are 
 other  guys  out  there  who  would  happily 
 happily  pound  your  woman  and  honestly
[86:35] she'd  be  happy  with  it  too  if  eventually 
 you  guys  broke  up  you  know  she's  gonna 
 get  with  another  guy  eventually
[86:40] it's  worth  just  thinking  okay 
 I'm  not  gonna  let  that  happen
[86:45] [ __ ]  that  guy  over  there  I'm  gonna  keep 
 going  to  the  gym  I'm  Gonna  Keep  lifting 
 really  hard  I'm  gonna  make  sure  my
[86:50] diet's  on  point  I'm  gonna  make  sure  I'm 
 not  just  wasting  away  playing  video 
 games  or  just  relaxing  for  no  reason
[86:56] it's  worth  thinking  this  because  a  lot 
 of  guys  get  complacent  with  their  girl 
 with  this  sense  of  like
[87:02] eternity  yep  she  loves  me  and  things  are 
 going  to  be  the  same  forever 
 no  she  loves  you  right  now  remember
[87:08] those  two  special  words  right  now  the 
 moment  that  she  really  senses  weakness 
 inside  of  you  that  love  starts  to
[87:14] diminish  and  she  it  is  natural  and 
 healthy  for  her  to  start  weighing  up 
 other  options  to  start  grabbing  that
[87:20] other  branch  and  you  don't  want  that  to 
 happen  it's  important  to  keep  this  in 
 mind  that  this  is  part  of  her  female
[87:25] brain 
 and  finally  once  you've  done  all  this
[87:30] once  you've  done  all  of  everything  that 
 we've  talked  about  to  make  her  feel 
 loved
[87:36] it  meant  nothing 
 it  meant  nothing 
 you've  done  all  of  this
[87:42] and  yet  all  of  this 
 was  in  the  past
[87:47] all  of  this  was  in  the  past  all  of  those 
 cute  romantic  gestures  and  how  how
[87:52] masculine  you've  been  is  in  the  past 
 what  happens  and  what  matters  right  now
[87:58] is  right  now  this  moment  this  present 
 moment  this  is  what  men  really  struggle
[88:03] with  and  this  is  why  I  feel  so  hard  to 
 attract  women  what  matters  is  what's
[88:08] happening  right  now  how  she  feels  right 
 now  if  you've  done  all  this  and  you've
[88:13] done  those  cute  romantic  gestures  and 
 you've  been  like  you  know  that  guy  with 
 the  six-pack  to  a  tractor  that  was  in
[88:18] the  past  and  it's  gone  now  what  matters 
 is  how  you  make  her  feel  right  now  this
[88:23] is  a  constant  tussle  a  challenge  of 
 loving  a  feminine  woman  and  it  sounds
[88:28] crazy  it  sounds  horrible  we  don't  want 
 this  like  we  want  something  more  stable 
 we  want  something  with  you  know  more 
 long  term  but  the  thing  is  this  is
[88:35] actually  just  one  it's  the  hand  like  the 
 card  that  we've  been  dealt  but  two  this 
 is  what  we're  attracted  to  we're  not
[88:42] attracted  to  masculine  women  we're  not 
 attracted  to  like  the  independent  woman 
 who's  certain  of  her  career  and
[88:48] everything  we're  attracted  to  this  cute 
 emotional  being  who  needs  this  constant 
 reassurance  right  now  who  values  love
[88:54] and  how  she  feels  right  now  now  above 
 everything  else  and  so  your  track  record 
 does  not  matter  that  is  the  quote  from
[89:00] the  way  of  the  superior  man  your  track 
 record  does  not  matter 
 what  matters  is  how  she  feels  right  now
[89:08] you  don't  need  those  grand  romantic 
 gestures  you  don't  need  that  like  you're 
 the  the  hot  um  air  balloon  where  you
[89:16] propose  or  any  cute  stuff  like  that  you 
 need  those  micro  moments  where  she  feels 
 in  love  with  you  right  now  especially
[89:21] well  with  the  requirements  that  you  are 
 that  top  tier  guy  that  she's  attracted
[89:26] to  if  you  can  maintain  that  and  even 
 grow  it  and  constantly  remind  yourself
[89:31] that  I  need  to  make  her  feel  loved  right 
 now  right  now  right  now  right  now  in
[89:36] every  moment  then  you  will  do  well  with 
 her  this  is  the  great  Challenge  and  it 
 is  extremely  challenging  once  like
[89:42] there'll  be  a  point  I  don't  know  if  I've 
 done  it  for  you  in  this  video  but  there 
 will  be  a  point  where  it'll  really  hit 
 you  and  you'll  think  wow  like  this  is
[89:49] actually  like  tricky  this  is  actually 
 kind  of  difficult  this  is  actually  a 
 constant  hurdle  that  I  need  to  achieve
[89:58] but  it's  worth  it 
 there's  a  woman  outside  little  Asian 
 woman  right  now  like  a  really
[90:03] grandmother  or  something  like  just 
 talking  loudly  on  the  phone  right  behind 
 me
[90:09] this  is  not  the  end 
 this  is  the  beginning

 on  the  subscribe  and  the  post 
 notification  button  if  you  want  to  join 
 in  on  the  cult  my  diet  has  been
[00:39] horrendous  because  i  trusted  these  guys 
 on  the  internet  these  [ __ ]  told 
 me  you  can  eat  whatever  you  want  you  can
[00:44] eat  all  the  junk  food  as  long  as  it  fits 
 your  macros  i  trusted  them  because  of 
 that  i've  never  even  considered  the
[00:49] difference  that  food  has  on  our  health 
 when  i've  done  the  most  basic  research 
 it  hurts  me  to  think  that  i  was  stupid
[00:55] enough  to  follow  fitness  youtubers  that 
 it  hurts  me  to  think  that  my  boys  who 
 are  watching  this  video  who  support  my
[01:00] channel  who  are  in  my  cult  have  taken 
 the  stupid  advice  that  i  have  from  these 
 big  ass  fitness  youtubers  because  i'm
[01:05] telling  you  right  now  none  of  those 
 people  are  healthy  just  because  they've 
 got  muscle  and  they're  like  shredded 
 does  not  mean  they're  healthy  and  it
[01:10] does  not  mean  that  they  will  still  be 
 alive  10  to  15  years  from  now  a  lot  of 
 those  [ __ ]  are  gonna  get
[01:15] diabetes  very  soon  and  i've  said  this  a 
 few  times  i'll  still  keep  saying  it 
 you're  going  to  start  seeing  them 
 literally  die  like  you're  going  to  see
[01:21] big  fitness  youtubers  start  to  die  in 
 the  next  10  years  because  of  the 
 stupid-ass  diet  that  they're  on  and  i
[01:26] followed  that  advice  every  single  day 
 while  i  was  eating  junk  the  amount  of 
 junk  food  i  was  eating  i  was  going  to
[01:31] mcdonald's  i've  literally  got  a  video  of 
 the  viral  semi-viral  video  that  i 
 released  the  aesthetic  body
[01:37] guide  and  i  literally  said  oh  i  eat  junk 
 food  every  day  i  go  to  mcdonald's  every 
 single  day  i  used  to  like  that  was  not
[01:43] an  exaggeration  it  was  every  single  day 
 i was  eating  that  bro  because  all  macros 
 are  you  know  if  all  calories  are  the
[01:48] same  just  eat  your  macros  why  would  i 
 eat  clean  like  what's  the  reason  of 
 eating  clean  what's  the  reason  of of
[01:54] thinking  about  health  if  all  macros  are 
 the  same  you  may  as  well  eat  whatever 
 you  want  right  and  so  i  have  always
[01:59] struggled  with  binge  eating  to  the  point 
 that  it  makes  me  cry  the  fitness 
 transformation  like  my  body
[02:04] transformation  is  one  of  the  most 
 important  things  to  me  and  feeling  that 
 you  don't  have  any  control  over  your
[02:09] diet  which  you  probably  can  relate  to 
 like  you  you  want  to  improve  your  diet 
 you  just
[02:14] keep  on  making  the  same  mistakes  it's 
 because  the  food  that  the  the  people
[02:19] online  like  they're  supposed  to  help  you 
 the  food  that  these  people  are 
 suggesting  for  you  to  eat  one  it  makes 
 them  more  money  you  know  they  get  more
[02:25] views  if  it's  the  guy  who's  jacked  and 
 he's  got  the  picture  of  the  cereal  and 
 he  says  oh  what  i  eat  in  a  day  full  day 
 of  eating  as  a  fitness  person  like
[02:31] but  two  that  food  is  literally  addictive 
 the  reason  why  you  keep  finding  yourself
[02:36] just  freaking  up  on  your  diet  is  because 
 you're  literally  addicted  to  junk  food 
 and  you're  surrounded  by  a  culture  that 
 promotes  it  it  took  me  a  while  like  i
[02:42] went  through  a  very  life  ch  like  i  had 
 to  change  my  life  to  change  my  diets  it
[02:47] wasn't  the  other  way  around  i  had  to 
 truly  like  i  had  to  move  out  of  this 
 [ __ ]  city  i  could  move  back  into  my 
 parents  house  i  had  to  severely  reduce
[02:53] how  much  i  use  the  internet  i  don't 
 watch  youtube  videos  i  especially  don't 
 watch  fitness  youtubers  i  had  to  reduce
[02:59] all  of  this  and  start  looking  at  like 
 real  nutritional  research  and  every 
 single  time  i'd  look  through  i'd  just  be
[03:04] thinking  like  those  those  fitness 
 youtubers  like  they  they  have  no  clue 
 what  they're  talking  about  saying  that
[03:10] all  calories  are  the  same  that  you  can 
 eat  700  like  these  [ __ ]  dead 
 ass  eat  hundreds  of  grams  of  sugar  per
[03:17] day  and  they're  like  oh  but  if  it  fits 
 your  macros  and  so  just  over  a  year  ago 
 i  truly  started  to  transform  my  diet  i
[03:22] did  some  crazy  things  to  do  this  over 
 the  last  year  the  whole  year  i  have  had
[03:27] visible  abs  like  there  is  not  one  point 
 over  the  whole  year  that  i've  not  had 
 visible  abs absolutely  this  is  unheard
[03:32] of  for  me  i've  gotten  lean  before  but  i 
 would  literally  get  lean  like  here's  a 
 few  pictures  of  me  and  uni  and
[03:37] everything  i  would  get  lean 
 and  i  would  just  start  to  gain  the 
 weight  back  because  you  can  force
[03:42] yourself  to  get  into  the  calorie  deficit 
 but  eventually  you  know  it  gets  quite 
 like  restrictive  you've  got  2  000
[03:48] calories  a  day  you  want  to  eat  more  and 
 the  moment  i  start  eating  more  i  just 
 start  binge  eating  again  and  so  i  would 
 get  lean  i'd  do  all  that  work  and  then
[03:53] i'd  lose  the  physique  that  i  was  like 
 really  proud  to  build  up  until  the  last 
 year  where  now  i  i  promise  you  this  is
[03:59] the  truth  i  can  control  my  body  fat 
 percentage  i  have  full  control  over  my 
 diet  now  because  you  don't  get  a  feeling
[04:05] of  uncontrollable  urges  and  cravings 
 when  you  eat  the  food  that  i'm  about  to 
 suggest  to  you  in  the  perfect  diet  the
[04:10] perfect  diet  has  four  factors  it 
 maximizes  muscle  growth  it  minimizes  fat
[04:15] loss  it  improves  your  health  and  it 
 feels  sustainable  if  you  find  a  diet 
 that  has  all  four  you  will  become  a 
 millionaire  let's  break  that  down
[04:21] maximizing  muscle  growth  comes  from  a 
 diet  in  the  macronutrients  that  are  high 
 in  protein  high  in  complex  carbs  not
[04:26] [ __ ]  carbs  not  [ __ ]  carbs  we're  not 
 going  to  eat  sugar  not  simple  carbs  high 
 in  complex  carbs  and  moderate  fats  so  we
[04:33] need  protein  around  the  clock  to 
 maximize  muscle  protein  synthesis  and 
 you  can  imagine  this  is  like  the  process
[04:38] of  turning  protein  into  muscle 
 very  very  stupidly  simplified  and  this
[04:43] is  how  it  works  once  we  eat  protein  this 
 ability  to  make  muscle  is  elevated  but
[04:48] it's  like  a  wave  and  it  starts  going 
 down  after  we've  a  protein  and  if  we  eat 
 more  protein  it  goes  up  what  we'd  like
[04:53] to  do  is  keep  this  elevated  through  the 
 entire  day  next  we  want  complex  carbs
[04:58] around  our  workouts  this  will  increase 
 glycogen  and  that  pretty  much  makes  you 
 stronger  and  just  perform  better  in  the
[05:03] gym  which  will  mean  more  muscle  gain 
 finally 
 finally  we
[05:08] we  want  moderate  fats  we're  not  going  to 
 do  the  full  keto  [ __ ]  we  just  want 
 moderate  fats  which  will  just  make  sure 
 that  all  of  our  hormones  and
[05:13] testosterone  are  regulated  and  then  in  a 
 nice  healthy  level  we'll  break  this  down 
 in  more  detail  soon  the  second  part  of
[05:19] the  perfect  diet  comes  from  minimizing 
 fat  gain  and  this  comes  from  fasting
[05:24] there  is  no  better  way  to  structure  your 
 diet  than  fasting  fasting  means  to  not 
 eat  certain  things  most  people  think
[05:30] that  it's  calories  most  people  think 
 that  you  fast  from  calories  that's 
 [ __ ]  we  fast  from  carbs  maybe  fats
[05:35] and  not  calories  especially  not  protein 
 so  the  issue  that  most  people  have  most 
 bodybuilders  if  you're  into  building
[05:40] muscle  if  you've  been  lifting  weights 
 for  a  while  the  issue  that  you  may  have 
 had  with  fasting  with  intermittent
[05:45] fasting  is  that  you  don't  get  protein 
 and  these  guys  are  telling  you  okay  wake 
 up  don't  eat  protein  don't  eat  any
[05:50] calories  for  for  a  couple  more  hours 
 till  2  pm  but  then  you  missed  the  muscle 
 protein  synthesis  window  that  we  talked
[05:55] about  before  so  we're  going  to  couple  a 
 few  things  and  we're  going  to  do  what  i 
 call  protein  intermittent  fasting  we're
[06:01] going  to  do  intermittent  fasting  where 
 we  wake  up  and  we  just  don't  eat  for  a 
 couple  of  hours  so  we  have  like  just  an 
 eight  hour  window  for  our  calories  but
[06:07] we're  also  gonna  have  scoops  of  whey 
 protein  any  kind  of  protein  powder 
 throughout  our  fasting  window  so  that
[06:12] our  protein  synthesis  gets  elevated  and 
 we  also  get  the  most  of  the  benefits
[06:17] from  fasting  so  this  is  exactly  what  you 
 do  you  wake  up  and  you  immediately  go 
 and  have  a  scoop  of  protein  like  so  many
[06:23] people  say  that  this  would  break  the 
 fast  i  don't  think  so  we  are  not  fasting 
 from  calories  we're  fasting  from  carbs
[06:29] when  you  just  have  a  single  scoop  of 
 protein  powder  you  get  literally  like 
 one  gram  of  carb  in  there  and  if  you  mix
[06:34] it  with  water  as  well  so  we're  gonna 
 wake  up  and  have  a  scoop  of  whey  protein 
 and  then  two  to  three  hours  we're  just 
 gonna  do  some  work  stay  focused  two  to
[06:40] three  hours  later  we're  gonna  go  and 
 have  another  scoop  do  some  more  work  two 
 to  three  hours  later  have  another  scoop
[06:45] then  we're  probably  gonna  start  our 
 eating  window  after  about  six  hours  of 
 waking  up  and  we've  had  like  two  to 
 three  scoops  of  protein  during  this  time
[06:51] now  we're  going  to  be  close  to  our 
 workout  time  so  our  pre-workout  meal  the
[06:56] meal  that  we  eat  an  hour  or  two  before 
 we  go  to  workout  will  be  high  in  complex 
 carbs  moderate  in  protein  it  doesn't
[07:02] need  to  be  high  in  protein  because  we've 
 just  had  a  bunch  of  protein  scoops  and 
 it's  going  to  be  about  moderate  in  fats
[07:07] too  and  then  post-workout  so  the  meal 
 that  we  eat  half  an  hour  to  one  hour  to 
 two  hours  after  our  workout  is  going  to
[07:12] be  pretty  much  the  same  we're  going  to 
 go  into  more  detail  of  exactly  what  you 
 should  eat  but  this  is  the  structure  of 
 the  perfect  diet  we're  gonna  wake  up  do
[07:19] intermittent  fasting  but  also  get  scoops 
 of  whey  protein  during  the  fasting 
 window  when  we  break  off  fast  we're
[07:24] gonna  make  sure  that  we  get  complex 
 carbs  before  and  after  our  workout  so 
 that's  two  things  checked  off  the
[07:29] perfect  diet  already  and  we  have  two 
 more  we've  got  to  make  sure  this  perfect 
 diet  optimizes  our  health  and  it  also
[07:34] feels  sustainable  to  optimize  our  health 
 health  in  terms  of  diet  gets  very 
 confusing  and  no  one  really  knows 
 exactly  what  health  really  means  when
[07:41] you  really  think  about  your  health  in 
 terms  of  diet  what  like  what  are  you 
 thinking  because  most  people  will  still 
 think  it's  fat  loss  but  we've  just  cut
[07:46] we've  covered  the  fat  section  so  health 
 is  actually  about  your  gut  microbiome
[07:51] it's  like  the  second  brain  of  our  body 
 the  foods  that  optimize  and  keep  our  gut 
 healthy  we  can  say  are  healthy  foods  i'm
[07:58] gonna  have  a  big  list  of  healthy 
 ingredients  but  in  general  it's 
 it's  kind  of  like  the  unsexy  answer  is
[08:03] that  it's  a  lot  of  vegetables  and  fruits 
 and  like  natural  unprocessed  non-garbage
[08:09] food  you  don't  see  mcdonald's  in  there 
 you  don't  see  v  shred  pizza  shuts  up  bro 
 it's  literally  just  like  the  one  base
[08:15] ingredients  that's  the  phrase  i've 
 always  said  is  generally  if  you  eat  the 
 base  ingredients  you  will  stay  healthy
[08:21] the  base  ingredient  is  what  you're 
 looking  for  so  instead  of  looking  for 
 like  chips  and  if  you  go  into  the  frozen
[08:26] section  in  some  like  dumbass  supermarket 
 they're  selling  chips  and  it's  got  a 
 bunch  of  different  ingredients  it's  been
[08:31] processed  already  the  main  ingredient 
 that  you  wanted  was  potatoes  now  if  you 
 look  for  the  ingredient  list  on  potatoes
[08:36] there  isn't  one  they  literally  don't 
 have  an  ingredient  list  there  why 
 because  the  ingredient  in  potatoes  is
[08:41] potato  potato  potato  what  you'd  like  to 
 find  is  a  bunch  of  foods  like  this  where
[08:46] there  is  no  ingredient  list  it  is 
 literally  just  the  base  food  generally 
 that  stuff  is  healthy  so  here  is  where
[08:51] people  start  asking  for  the 
 macronutrient  split  even  though  it's 
 been  covered  a  million  times  people
[08:56] always  ask  me  how  many  how  many  grams  of 
 protein  how  many  this  i  don't  agree  with 
 the  standard  advice  that  people  give  you 
 so  you  already  know  the  advice  that
[09:01] you've  been  given  one  gram  of  protein 
 per  pound  of  body  weight 
 it's  pretty  stupid  device  doesn't  really
[09:07] work  for  most  people  because  a  200  pound 
 guy  should  generally  not  be  eating  200 
 grams  of  protein  unless  he's  a  jacked
[09:13] bodybuilder  one  gram  of  protein  per 
 pound  of  body  weight  doesn't  work  what  i 
 would  say  instead  is  eat  into  the  range
[09:18] of  120  grams  of  protein  to  about  180 
 grams  of  protein  if  you  end  up  inside  of
[09:24] this  range  fine  like  what  we  care  more 
 about  is  that  you  get  relatively  close
[09:29] to  the  ideal  number  like  you  get  close 
 enough  to  a  range  of  it  then  to 
 specifically  say  okay  i'm  165  pounds  so
[09:35] i  should  hit  165  grams  of  of  protein  and 
 honestly  i've  even  changed  the  way  that
[09:40] i  track  food  and  i  suggest  you  to  do 
 this  don't  even  track  macros  i  don't 
 think  there's  that  much  of  a  benefit  to
[09:46] making  sure  that  you  get  the  absolute 
 most  optimum  amount  of  carbs  and  fats 
 you  know  the  split  of  the  percentage
[09:51] splits  that  reduces  the  fourth  part  of 
 the  perfect  diet  which  is  sustainability
[09:57] because  the  easier  way  to  wrap  your  mind 
 around  all  this  is  to  think  okay 
 you  have  x  calories  let's  say  you've  got
[10:02] 2 2000  calories  it's  easier  to  say 
 you've  got  2  000  calories  get  into  the 
 range  of  120  to  180  grams  of  protein
[10:10] anywhere  around  this  range  in  this  range 
 is  going  to  be  good  enough  and  then 
 think  purely  about  just  filling  up  the
[10:15] 2000  calories  with  the  huge  list  of 
 ingredients  here  so  you  might  be  looking 
 at  this  list  of  ingredients  and  feeling
[10:21] a  little  bit  okay  confused  like  okay  um 
 like  how  would  i  make  this  into  a 
 realistic  meal  literally  choose  a  couple
[10:26] of  them  which  you  think  you  know  would 
 pair  well  together  and  just  make  them 
 together  put  them  all  onto  a  plate  like
[10:31] you  don't  have  to  make  a  pre-designed 
 meal  that  normal  people  eat  like  we
[10:36] don't  need  like  the  name  of  a  meal  that 
 normal  people  eat  on  the  normal  diets  we
[10:41] can  have  a  meal  which  is  lentils  and 
 potatoes  we  can  have  a  meal  which  is 
 yogurt  and  raspberries  oats  and  nuts  now
[10:48] because  we've  gave  you  the  flexibility 
 to  just  say  okay  reach  this  many 
 calories  with  roughly  this  much  protein
[10:54] and  you  know  what's  inside  the  calories 
 if  you  pick  from  this  ingredient  list 
 it's  going  to  be  healthy  you  now  have
[10:59] the  flexibility  to  look  at  this  list  and 
 just  kind  of  see  which  one  you  feel  like 
 having  today  and  that's  actually  the
[11:04] more  healthy  way  to  do  things  because 
 long  story  short  in  terms  of  our  gut 
 health  it's  better  to  eat  like  different
[11:11] things  quite  different  things  because  a 
 variety  it's  kind  of  like  cliche  terms 
 but  like  a  variety  of  fruits  and
[11:16] vegetables  is  the  best  for  your  health 
 it's  not  exactly  the  best  for  in  terms 
 of  just  you  know  consistency  knowing
[11:21] that  you've  got  the  exact  same  meal 
 every  day  i  prefer  to  do  that  personally 
 i  prefer  to  deliciously  just  have  these
[11:26] same  meals  every  single  day  but  in  terms 
 of  maximizing  health  it's  better  to  just 
 rotate  a  bunch  of  these  ingredients
[11:31] around  like  you've  got  your  list  you've 
 got  your  calories  you  know  roughly  how 
 much  protein  to  have  and  maybe  you  need
[11:37] to  get  like  a  couple  more  scoops  of 
 protein  in  there  you go  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it

NaujrrivX9A,"[00:00] jeffrey  says  that  money  doesn't  even 
 matter  he  lives  an  unambitious  ordinary 
 life  of  playing  video  games  and  eating
[00:06] cheap  junk  food  younger  hamster  didn't 
 like  school  or  learning  and  he  couldn't 
 think  of  what  degree  or  career  he'd  even
[00:12] want  but  his  parents  and  teachers  made 
 it  seem  like  the  only  choice  was  to  go 
 to  university  get  a  degree  and  a  normal
[00:19] job  adonis 
 adonis  laughed  at  the  puny  teachers  who 
 told  him  to  go  to  university  why  would
[00:24] he  he  was  already  making  more  money  than 
 his  teachers  with  all  of  the  businesses 
 that  he  ran  in  high  school
[00:34] you  want  to  make  more  money  than  your 
 teachers 
 i've  been  on  a  two-day  trip  to  portugal 
 and  i  made  about
[00:41] five  thousand  dollars  in  the  last  two 
 days 
 passively
[00:46] passively  bro  you're  gonna  learn  how  to 
 do  that  in  this  video 
 now  you're  probably  thinking  uh  he  he  he
[00:51] must  be  faking  it  he  didn't  really  make 
 five  thousand  dollars  over  the  weekend 
 here's  the  screenshot  here's  the  paypal
[00:56] payment  [ __ ]  here's  the  bank  statement 
 [ __ ] 
 i'm  gonna  walk  you  through  the  three
[01:01] best  passive  income  ideas  that  you  can 
 start  today  and  you  don't  even  need 
 money  to  start  them
[01:06] but  first 
 this  video  is  brought  to  you  by  no  one
[01:11] now  like  the  goddamn  video  you  [ __ ]  i 
 actually  want  to  know  if  what  happened 
 to  me  is  relatable  to  you  does  it  feel
[01:17] like  everyone's  pushing  you  down  this 
 ordinary  like  normal  person  path  of 
 getting  good  grades  in  school  getting  to
[01:23] a  good  university  getting  a  good  degree 
 and  then  a  good  job  does  it  feel  like 
 you  just  don't  believe  in  that  because
[01:28] when  i  was  thinking  about  this  it  just 
 seems  silly  to  put  in  all  that  work  into 
 like  a  good  career  when  little  girls  are
[01:34] making  more  money  than  doctors  on  tick 
 tock  and  i  was  never  a  good  student  this 
 is  what  always  bothered  me  i  was  never  a
[01:39] good  student  and  i  was  recommended  by 
 everyone  to  go  to  university  i  only 
 liked  school  just  for  the  social  aspect
[01:45] and  because  it  was  like  girls  to  just 
 stare  at  so  guess  how  i  spent  my  time  in 
 university
[01:50] [ __ ]  i  spent  my  time  in  university 
 [ __ ]  bro  and  it  was  sick  i  spent  my 
 time  taking  bugs  going  out  and  sleeping
[01:55] with  degenerate  women  so  even  whilst  i 
 was  in  university  i  knew  that  i  was 
 never  gonna  go  for  the  normal  job  after
[02:00] my  second  year  of  university  this  was 
 when  the  first  ideas  of  a  business 
 started  and  i  still  remember  the  exact
[02:06] night  and  the  exact  thing  that  i  sold  to 
 make  the  first  bit  of  money  on  a 
 business  and  you  can  like  literally
[02:11] replicate  this  today  i'll  give  you  the 
 steps  for  it  and  my  idea  was  to  go  onto 
 ebay  and  to  sell  a  bunch  of  clothes  that
[02:17] i  currently  had  get  that  money  and  then 
 use  that  money  to  buy  more  things  from 
 ebay  or  you  know  from  my  thrift  shops  to
[02:22] buy  like  clothes  and  resell  them  for  a 
 profit  so  i  remember  it  was  literally 
 night  time  and  i  listed  i  might  i  might
[02:28] actually  have  the  exact  picture  like  if 
 you  see  a  picture  right  now  i'm  gonna  be 
 impressed  if  i  can  find  this  i  listed 
 this  gym  shark  hoodie  which  i  didn't
[02:34] really  wear  for  like  25  pounds  went  to 
 sleep  woke  up  and  it  literally  sold  it 
 like  through  the  night
[02:41] and  that  was  and  that  was  hype  that  i 
 literally  i  need  to  made  money  whilst  i 
 was  sleeping  and  so  that  became  my  first
[02:46] business  reselling  slash  like  flipping 
 on  ebay  and  i  actually  got  the  idea  from
[02:51] runescape  which  is  like  a  video  game 
 because  i  used  to  i  used  to  literally 
 flip  i  used  to  do  the  exact  same  thing
[02:56] on  this  game  to  make  money  and  i  started 
 doing  it  in  real  life 
 so  just  as  like  a  little  bonus  to  this
[03:02] video  let  me  teach  you  very very  quickly 
 on  exactly  how  to  flip  on  ebay  now  this 
 isn't  one  of  the  passive  income  ideas
[03:08] that  i'm  about  to  teach  you  because  it's 
 quite  active  this  is  more  kind  of  like  a 
 job  but  it's  like  a  business  but  this
[03:14] one  is  way  more  applicable  to  most 
 people  if  you're  a  teenager  because  with 
 ebay  you  can  make  money  today  this  is
[03:19] the  exact  process  i'm  gonna  quickly  walk 
 you  through  it  as  just  a  little  bonus 
 okay  so  you  go  into  the  ebay  app  and
[03:24] you're  gonna  search  for  something  to  buy 
 and  so  what  i  would  search  for  and  my 
 advice  by  the  way  is  to  literally  copy
[03:29] exactly  what  i  do  copy  exactly  what  i  do 
 is  to  search  for  the  adidas  jumper  set
[03:34] this  sword  setting  to  ending  soonest  and 
 filter  it  with  price  for  about  seven 
 pounds  and  we're  just  going  to  put  this
[03:40] into  men's  as  well  so  these  are  all  the 
 ones  that  are  ending  in  you  know  a 
 couple  of  hours  and  look  how  cheap  you
[03:45] can  all  find  them  and  so  this  one  like 
 what  i'll  do  i  need  to  sign  in  hang  on 
 what  even  is  my  account
[03:50] okay  and  so  what  i  would  do  is  i  very 
 very  quickly  go  through  all  of  these  and 
 add  them  to  my  watch  list  like  you  can
[03:55] see  like  this  little  heart  in  the  corner 
 i'm  not  signed  in  right  now  but  i  would 
 add  literally  like  50  of  them  and  when  i
[04:00] had  a  watch  like  this  one  here  this  one 
 will  literally  sell  for  like  25  pounds 
 like  if  anyone  knows  like  adidas
[04:05] clothing  you'll  know  which  ones  sell 
 straight  away  this  one  will  sell  you 
 kind  of  just  get  an  eye  for  it  but  when
[04:10] you're  first  starting  off  my 
 recommendation  is  literally  just  follow 
 as  many  as  possible  set  up  timers  so  i 
 used  to  literally  just  see  like  you'd
[04:16] see  it  in  your  watch  list  that  it's 
 ending  in  like  three  hours  and  21 
 minutes  so  i'd  literally  say  like  hey 
 siri  set  on  a  timer  for  three  hours  and
[04:22] 20  minutes  and  oh  he's  gonna  do  it  now 
 three  hours  and  20  minutes  starting  now
[04:27] hey  siri  cancel  that  timer  please  it's 
 cancelled 
 thank  you  so  you  go  on  to  ebay  and  you 
 bid  for  these  ones  at  the  last  possible
[04:33] second  and  you  end  up  buying  them  for 
 literally  like  five  pounds  where  the 
 jumper  is  worth  like  25  it  gets 
 delivered  to  your  house  you  re-list  it
[04:39] straight  away  for  like  five  times  the 
 price  for  25  and  you  just  kind  of  like 
 keep  us  stuck  with  it  and  i  found  that
[04:44] when  you  have  about  100  pieces  of 
 clothing  like  i've  literally  i  still 
 have  loads  like  underneath  my  bed  and
[04:49] everything  when  you  have  like  100  pieces 
 of  clothing  you  start  selling  like  one 
 every  single  day  two  every  day  and  you
[04:54] start  making  like  literally  20  pounds  30 
 pounds  whilst  you  were  just  sleeping 
 which  it's  not  passive  income  because
[04:59] you  have  to  list  the  stuff  and  you  you 
 know  you  have  to  go  to  the  post  office 
 and  everything  but  the  reason  why  i'm 
 telling  you  is  because  this  really  was
[05:05] the  start  of  my  business  life  and  it 
 really  does  mean  a  lot  to  me  like 
 flipping  on  ebay  started  where  i  am
[05:11] today  so  let's  go  through  the  three  best 
 methods  to  make  passive  income  and  the 
 first  one  obviously  we're  gonna  go
[05:17] through  is  youtube  adsense  and  this  is 
 specifically  the  money  that  you  make 
 directly  from  youtube  so  we're  gonna  go
[05:22] into  my  computer  and  i'm  gonna  show  you 
 exactly  how  much  i've  been  making  so 
 this  is  my  youtube  adsense  page  for
[05:27] january  2021  of  this  year  now  to  get 
 monetized  you  need  to  join  the  youtube
[05:32] partner  program  and  the  requirements  are 
 4  000  hours  of  watch  time  and  1  000 
 subscribers  now  1  000  subscribers  took
[05:39] me  about  seven  months  and  the  4  000 
 watch  hours  took  me  about  eight  months 
 the  4  000  watch  hours  is  probably  a  bit
[05:45] harder  because  really  think  about  what 
 that  means  people  have  to  watch  your 
 videos  for  about  4  000  hours  and  i'm
[05:50] gonna  give  you  like  a  quick  tip  i  made 
 longer  videos  and  i  started  sharing  them 
 to  pages  on  reddit  and  that's  how  i
[05:55] started  building  up  the  initial  audience 
 that  really  started  snowballing  the 
 watch  hours  so  i  first  started  making 
 money  on  the  monday  the  18th  of  january
[06:01] and  i  was  making  about  a  pound  per  day  i 
 think  that's  about  two  dollars  per  day 
 and  i'm  not  gonna  lie  i  was  hype  like
[06:06] when  i  saw  this  and  i was  like  what  the 
 [ __ ]  a  pound  put  that  i  literally 
 remember  telling  like  i  told  a  girl  from
[06:11] tinder  and  i  was  like  getting  so  i  was 
 like  bro  that's  like  that's  like  a 
 takeaway  that's  like  a  meal  per  month  oh
[06:16] my  god  i  was  so  hyper  i  was  so  grateful 
 may  was  74  pounds  and  june  was  1600
[06:22] and  that's  the  difference  which  your 
 videos  blowing  up  really  makes  so  i'm 
 still  making  on  average  like  two  pound 
 three  pound  per  day  and  it  starts  going
[06:28] up  because  this  video  right  here  how  to 
 build  an  aesthetic  body  that  one  really 
 started  to  do  well  i  remember  this  point
[06:33] that  i  started  actually  like  gaining 
 like  a  little  bit  of  traction  and  i  was 
 actually  going  crazy  i  was  gaining  like 
 a  good  amount  of  subs  as  well  like  20  40
[06:39] 50  per  day  and  literally  within  just  a 
 week  i  go  from  making  like  four  pounds
[06:44] per  day  to  like  230  per  day  that's 
 [ __ ]  mad  that's  still  the  most  i've 
 ever  made  now  every  video  that  you
[06:50] upload  onto  youtube  is  like  an  asset  and 
 that's  such  an  important  word  that  you 
 need  to  know  right  there  assets  you've
[06:56] probably  heard  the  phrase  that  rich 
 people  get  assets  and  poor  people  get 
 liabilities  assets  are  things  that  make
[07:01] you  money  and  most  people  when  they 
 think  of  an  asset  they  think  of  like 
 rental  properties  and  like  dividends  and
[07:06] you  know  like  weird  stuff  that  as  like  a 
 young  person  you're  probably  not  like 
 even  thinking  that  you  could  get  that 
 whereas  a  youtube  video  that  you  can
[07:12] make  today  is  literally  an  asset  that 
 you  own  now  all  of  that  is  nice  but  the 
 best  part  of  youtube  is  that  you  gain  an
[07:18] audience  from  it  and  when  you  have  an 
 audience  of  people  who  like  you  you 
 start  to  just  make  so  much  more  money  i
[07:23] want  you  to  remember  this  phrase  that 
 i'm  about  to  say  right  now  the  money  is 
 made  with  the  audience  so  now  we're
[07:28] going  to  move  on  to  the  second  passive 
 income  idea  which  we're  going  to  use  the 
 audience  that  we've  just  built  to  create
[07:33] and  sell  a  course  now  online  courses 
 have  like  this  negative  view  that  a  lot 
 of people  say  like  their  scams  and  stuff
[07:38] like  you  know  what  i  don't  give  a [ __ ] 
 there  is  no  better  way  to  make  money 
 than  selling  a  course  which  you're  going 
 to  learn  just  in  a  second  so  course  is
[07:44] kind  of  like  a  series  of  youtube  videos 
 like  a  load  of  videos  that  you've  put 
 together  and  you've  thrown  in  like  extra
[07:50] stuff  like  bonuses  inside  of  it  so  it's 
 all  packaged  together  and  the  point  of  a 
 course  is  that  you  help  people  get  to
[07:55] like  a  very  particular  goal  so  the  point 
 of  my  course  is  to  help  people  to  build 
 like  their  10  out  of  10  dream  body  so
[08:00] here's  my  course  you  can  see  it's  like  a 
 bunch  of  different  videos  there's  extra 
 like  downloads  for  them  teaching  them
[08:05] exactly  like  what  exercises  to  do  and 
 how  to  do  them  safely  me  showing  them 
 like  what  meals  to  cook  and  everything
[08:10] and  so  you  make  the  course  by  you  know 
 recording  all  the  content  for  it  making 
 all  like  the  books  or  whatever  you  want 
 to  do  and  then  you  put  it  onto  a  course
[08:16] hosting  website  so  the  website  that  i 
 use  is  called  kajabi  and  usually  you'll 
 pay  like  monthly  for  these  and  usually
[08:22] you'll  pay  like  monthly  for  these 
 websites  and  so  then  what  you  do  once 
 the  course  is  uploaded  and  you  know  it's 
 ready  to  sell  you  make  a  sales  page  that
[08:29] actually  sells  the  course  and  so  what 
 i've  done  is  i've  linked  the  sales  page 
 for  this  course  below  in  the  description
[08:34] you  can  click  on  that  and  just  have  a 
 look  at  exactly  like  the  format  of  the 
 page  where  i  sell  this  course  and  then
[08:39] all  you  need  to  do  is  just  tell  your 
 audience  to  go  there  so  in  a  subtle  way 
 i've  just  told  my  audience  to  go  there 
 now  of  course  you  know  i  told  you  to  go
[08:45] there  in  terms  of  like  researching  it 
 but  just  because  i've  told  you  to  click 
 on  that  link  and  thousands  of  people 
 will  click  on  that  link  a  couple  of
[08:51] people  will  buy  my  course  so  just  in  a 
 subtle  way  i've  probably  just  made  600 
 over  the  last  10  seconds  how  much  did
[08:56] you  make  and  so  this  aesthetic  body 
 transformation  course  took  me  about  a 
 month  to  make  and  let's  see  how  much
[09:01] money  i  made  from  it  so  the  aesthetic 
 body  course  i  sold  137  of  them  so  far
[09:06] which  has  made  a  grand  total  of  twenty 
 one  thousand  nine  hundred  and  thirty 
 eight  dollars  so  about  twenty  two
[09:12] thousand  dollars  but  i  also  sell  like  a 
 different  version  of  the  course  right 
 here  for  ninety  seven  dollars  that  one
[09:19] has  sold  four  thousand  four  hundred  so 
 in  total  i've  made  about  twenty  six 
 thousand  dollars  from  this  course  and  i
[09:24] started  selling  it  in  july  so  it's  been 
 two  months  and  i  made  26k  [ __ ] 
 massive  bro  there  is  also  another  way
[09:30] that  you  can  make  money  from  courses  and 
 that  is  with  skillshare  now  skillshare 
 is  an  online  you  know  everyone's  like
[09:35] doing  the  adwords  for  it  i'm  not 
 sponsored  by  them  but  i've  got  a  couple 
 of  classes  on  skillshare  you  can  see 
 i've  got  one  for  deep  work  dopamine
[09:41] detoxing 
 goal  setting  social  skills  and 
 mindfulness  and  i've  linked  all  these
[09:46] below  as  well  so  you  can  go  have  a  look 
 at  them  and  skillshare  pays  you  based  on 
 the  minutes  that  people  have  watched
[09:51] your  course  so  it's  like  kind  of  like 
 youtube  live  so  you  know  as  people  watch 
 it  and  you  get  views  you  get  money  but
[09:56] also  skillshare  pay  you  10 
 for  every  person  that  you  refer  to  a
[10:01] free  trial  which  is  huge  by  the  way  so 
 i've  linked  it  below  you'll  get  a  link 
 which  is  like  you  know  hamza's  invited
[10:06] you  have  a  free  trial  if  you  sign  up  to 
 that  which  i'm  hoping  you  do  i'll 
 instantly  get  ten  dollars  then  if  you
[10:11] watch  my  courses  i'll  get  like  probably 
 a  couple  more  dollars  per  like  couple  of 
 minutes  that  you  watch  so  you  can  see  in
[10:17] total  i've  made  over  the  last  fair 
 amount  of  months  i've  made  seven 
 thousand  six  hundred  dollars  from 
 skillshare  and  here  is  like  the  exact
[10:23] numbers  here  you  can  see  about  the  time 
 that  i  hit  1  000  subscribers  i  started 
 making  more  than  100  and  like  50  from
[10:30] skillshare  by  the  time  i  got  monetized 
 on  youtube  i  started  making  152  so
[10:35] skillshare  was  actually  making  me  more 
 money  than  so  skillshare  was  actually 
 making  me  more  money  than  youtube  was
[10:40] then  it  keeps  going  up  and  then  boom  i 
 have  like  a  pretty  good  ass  month  36 
 people  got  referred  in  this  month
[10:46] because  i  linked  my  classes  just  more 
 often  and  i'm  pretty  sure  like  two  of  my 
 videos  did  pretty  well  and  those  were
[10:52] two  videos  where  in  the  video  i  actually 
 said  okay  go  to  the  link  in  the 
 description  and  sign  up  to  my  skillshare 
 free  trial  and  so  i  made  476  dollars
[10:58] that  month  like  that  was  so  much  more 
 than  what  i  was  making  on  youtube  that 
 was  the  original  screenshot  i  got  paid
[11:03] that  whilst  i  was  in  portugal  4  87 
 passively  like  i  have  not  put  any  work
[11:09] into  skillshare  for  literally  months  i 
 haven't  even  like  said  that  much  anyway 
 it's  just  because  my  old  videos  have
[11:15] said  that  and  people  are  just  finding 
 them  and  clicking  the  link  building  an 
 audience  of  people  who  like  you  and 
 selling  them  a  course  is  literally  the
[11:21] best  way  to  make  money  today  you  could 
 think  of  any  other  business  idea  of  like 
 coding  an  app  or  a  website  or  making
[11:27] like  a  real  life  product  and  making  a 
 course  is  better  it's  lower  effort  and 
 it'll  make  more  money  and  finally  the
[11:32] third  passive  income  idea  is  right  in 
 books  look  how  much  i  made  from  writing 
 an  ebook  like  almost  five  thousand
[11:37] dollars  and  there's  a  secret  why  i  made 
 so  much  money  from  this  ebook  whilst 
 most  people  who  write  ebooks  pretty  much
[11:42] make  no  money  like  they  get  no  sales  on 
 amazon  there's  a  reason  why  this  one  did 
 so  so  well  and  i'm  going to  teach  you
[11:47] that  in  just  a  second  and  writing  ebooks 
 is  literally  as  simple  as  just  opening 
 up  a  word  document  on  your  computer
[11:52] writing  out  what  like  you  know  the  story 
 of  the  book  is  and  then  using  amazon's 
 like  software  to  just  like  format  it 
 like  you  could  literally  do  that  in  like
[11:57] five  minutes  and  then  just  upload  it  to 
 sell  and  write  in  ebooks  was  actually 
 the  first  passive  income  like  online
[12:02] income  method  that  i  tried  and  i  wrote  a 
 couple  of  books  which  i'm  gonna  just 
 link  in  the  description  they're  not  like 
 for  sale  you  can  literally  just  go  and
[12:07] like  read  them  just  so  you  can  kind  of 
 like  see  what  they  were  like  and  there's 
 two  very  big  different  things  that  i  did
[12:12] to  make  four  thousand  six  hundred 
 dollars  for  this  ebook  here  the  first 
 was  that  instead  of  just  writing  the 
 book  i  thought  okay  what  are  like  extra
[12:18] stuff  that  i  can  put  into  this  so  that 
 it's  like  it's  so  much  more  worth  it  i 
 spent  like  a  couple  of  hours  sitting
[12:23] down  and  i  made  40  workout  routines  like 
 that  takes  [ __ ]  asia  and  i  included 
 them  into  this  training  program  book
[12:29] people  can  just  read  this  ebook  click  on 
 the  workout  routine  link  the  workout 
 routine  literally  just  opens  up  on  their
[12:34] phone  and  so  i  included  all  those 
 workout  routines  for  free  in  this  ebook 
 now  the  second  thing  i  did  which  is 
 pretty  important  i  didn't  sell  it  on
[12:39] amazon  now  amazon  make  it  so  easy  for 
 you  to  start  selling  your  book  but  the 
 issue  is  that  it  just  never  really
[12:45] worked  for  me  so  the  thing  that  worked 
 for  me  was  that  i  sold  this  ebook  on  my 
 own  website  but  in  a  really  smart  way
[12:51] because  you  might  have  seen  in  my 
 previous  videos  and  we  go  to  the 
 description  and  there's  get  the  best 
 seven  workout  routines  sent  to  your
[12:57] phone  you  click  on  this  link  and  you're 
 sent  here  so  you'll  get  seven  free 
 workout  routines  if  you  put  in  your 
 details  and  as  soon  as  you  put  in  your
[13:03] details  look  what  happens  you  get  sent 
 to  a  page  to  buy  this  program  like  yes  i 
 want  to  buy  the  program  and  then  i  and
[13:09] this  is  [ __ ]  sick  right  when  you're 
 on  this  page  to  buy  this  program  i've 
 also  put  on  the  upsell  to  the  course  so
[13:15] someone  came  here  just  to  get  the  free 
 workout  routines  but  they  were  sentient 
 they  were  showed  like  wait  you  can  get 
 this  whole  thing  for  only  27  it's  like
[13:21] yeah  you  know  27  i  might  buy  it  and  then 
 they  come  onto  this  page  ready  to  spend 
 27  and  they're  like  wait  you  can  also
[13:26] get  this  course  for  only  97  and  they're 
 like  oh  yeah  why  not  and  boom  it  works
[13:31] so  192  people  bought  the  ebook  just  from 
 that  redirect  and  49  people  also  bought
[13:37] the  upsell  to  the  course  on  that  same 
 page  so  this  is  how  not  only  did  i  sell 
 the  course  for  22  000  but  i  actually
[13:43] sold  another  9  000  worth  just  by  kind  of 
 like  splitting  it  up  and  selling  it
[13:48] separately  in  like  a  really  smart  way  so

gL0DXpYyOGM,"[00:00] so  you're  stuck  in  the  first  stage  of 
 self-improvement  the  self-improvement 
 struggle
[00:05] you  know  about  self-improvements  you've 
 seen  the  results  of  it 
 you  might  have  experienced  some  results
[00:10] of  it  yourself  but 
 you're  still  stuck  in  that  depressive 
 period  you  haven't  dropped  your
[00:15] addictions 
 you  have  for  a  couple  of  days  max 
 and  then  you're  jacking  off  five  times  a
[00:20] day  again  and  then  you're  playing  league 
 of  legends  again  and  then  you're  taking 
 whatever  [ __ ]  drug  you're  addicted  to
[00:25] again 
 and  you  just  can't  seem  to  get  away  from 
 it  if  you  want  this  video  to  help  you  if 
 you  want  me  to
[00:30] help  you  lose  your  ego 
 your  brain  is  the  reason  why  you  are
[00:35] still  here 
 distrust  your  brain  i  can't  tell  you
[00:40] any  advice  up  until  you  can  trust  my 
 brain  over  yours 
 your  brain  is  the  reason  why  you  are
[00:45] still  in  this 
 period  you  still  have  depression  none  of 
 this  not  meditation  doesn't  work  for  you
[00:51] shut  up 
 your  brain  is  has  convinced  you  and  you 
 are  still  in  this  position  because  you
[00:56] keep 
 listening  to  your  brain  so  you  must 
 distrust  your  brain  hopefully  put  your 
 trust  in  someone  else
[01:01] that's  scary  if  you  can't  do  that  then 
 there's  no  point  watching  my  videos 
 hopefully  i've  i've
[01:06] become  the  trustworthy  guide  for  you 
 that  hopefully 
 just  stop  thinking  about  what  your  brain 
 says  and  just  start  thinking  okay
[01:12] what  is  hamza's  brain  recommending  to  me 
 let's  begin  you've  made  fake  attempts  at
[01:17] stopping  your  addiction  and  it's  usually 
 the  type  of  attempts  that  i  criticize  on
[01:22] my  channel  and  yet  you  keep 
 doing  them  you  deleted  the  social  media 
 apps  you  uninstalled  league  of  legends
[01:28] you  threw  away  the  junk  food  you  threw 
 away  the 
 the  drug  that  you  have  in  your  house 
 congratulations
[01:34] you're  a  [ __ ]  when  you're  ready  to  stop 
 the  addiction  properly  please  take  this 
 advice 
 do  not  throw  them  out  by  deleting  social
[01:41] media 
 you're  a  [ __ ]  because  the  reason  why 
 you're  deleting  social  media  isn't 
 because  you're  done  with  it  it  isn't
[01:47] because  you  no  longer  use  it 
 it's  because  you  think  that  just  by 
 holding  the  button  and  pressing  the  x 
 that  oh  oh  i'm  cured  of  the  addiction
[01:53] hamza  are  you  happy  i  deleted  social 
 media  yesterday  i'm  sorry  i  don't  even 
 use  that  [ __ ]  anymore  hamza
[01:58] i  i  uninstalled  league  of  legends  hamza 
 you're  a  [ __ ] 
 you  want  easy  validation  from  me  maybe
[02:03] from  yourself  maybe  from 
 someone  else  you  want  easy  validation 
 without  actually  doing  the  work  what  we
[02:08] want  is  league  of  legends  installed  on 
 your  computer  what  we  want  is 
 instagram  and  whatever  the  [ __ ]  apps
[02:13] you  use  installed  on  your  phone 
 and  we  want  to  slightly  very  slightly
[02:18] build  up  that  willpower  in  you  where  you 
 go  onto  the  apps  less 
 at  this  stage  if  you're  stuck  in  stage
[02:23] one  your  mindset  is  your  biggest  problem 
 it's  your  brain  that's  the  problem  but 
 there's  a  part  of  your  brain  that  could
[02:28] just  choose  to 
 stop  listening  to  itself  and  i  hope  that
[02:33] you  can  just 
 turn  that  part  on  and  start  thinking  you 
 know  what  whatever  thoughts  whatever
[02:38] impulses  i  get  in  my  brain  has  led  me  to 
 this  moment  if  i  keep  listening  to  these 
 impulses
[02:44] i'm  going  to  stay  here  my  brain  is  not 
 good  enough 
 now  there's  this  guy  on  youtube  and
[02:49] maybe  i've  had  a  coaching  call  with  him 
 he  seems  to  know  what  he's  talking  about 
 you  must  just  turn  that  on
[02:54] because  the  next  thing  we've  got  to  talk 
 about  is  streaks  if  you're  stuck  in 
 stage  one 
 it's  because  you  haven't  taken  the  good
[02:59] advice  of  forgetting  about  streaks 
 you  still  want  your  nofap  streak  you 
 start  but  i  i  got  to  day  three  yesterday
[03:06] and  now  i've  reset  my  stream 
 you're  still  talking  about  streaks 
 streaks  are
[03:11] entirely  toxic  you  will  fail  the  streak 
 i  will  fail  the  streak  that's  why  i
[03:17] don't  why  why 
 would  i  set  a  goal  that  i  would 
 literally  100 
 of  the  time  be  failing  how  silly  is  that
[03:23] when  you  set  a  streak  you're  literally 
 saying  to  yourself 
 of  course  i'm  going  to  do  this  thing  one
[03:28] more  time  in  my  life  so  i'm  going  to  set 
 this  goal 
 and  there  is  a  100  chance  that  i'm  going 
 to  fail  it  eventually
[03:33] but  you  get  to  say  that  you're  on  day  7 
 of  nofap  you  get  to  say  oh  it's  been 
 three  days  since  i've  played  league  of
[03:38] legends  it's  been  i've  worked  out  three 
 days  in  a  row  congratulations 
 you  want  that  social  validation  again
[03:43] because  you're  a  [ __ ]  forget  the  90-day 
 challenge 
 dumbass  forget  that  the  nofap  the  month
[03:48] of  nofap  and  stuff  forget  all  of  that 
 you  aren't  good  enough  for  the  street 
 you  aren't  good  enough  for  7x  whatever
[03:54] days  you  want  to  go  to  you  aren't  good 
 enough  for  that  yet  you've  got  to  lose 
 your  ego  and  think  you  know  what 
 i  am  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  i've  got  a  pawn
[04:01] addiction  i've  got  a  [ __ ]  league  of 
 legends  addiction  i've  got  i've  got  an 
 addiction  to  weed  into  some 
 [ __ ]  i'm  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  you've  got  to
[04:08] have  that  in  your  mind  first  of  all  and 
 think  you  know  what 
 i'm  not  so  great  and  so  by  setting  a
[04:13] goal  trying  to 
 not  fap  for  30  days  when  i've  got  a  porn 
 addiction
[04:18] it's  probably  not  gonna  work  out  is  it 
 so  then  don't  do  it  because  the  better 
 way  doesn't  get  you  the  social
[04:23] validation  but  it  does  get  you  out  of 
 this 
 this  depressive  period  so  hopefully 
 you'd  like  to  follow  that
[04:28] the  better  way  is  to  forget  about 
 streaks  and  just  think  about 
 how  many  times  you've  done  the  bad
[04:33] behaviors  or  the  good  behaviors 
 over  a  given  period  that's  why  we  put
[04:38] our  trust  into  these  systems  that  you 
 can't  see  right  now  but  we  put  our 
 trust  into  these  self-improvement
[04:43] systems  like  the  habit  tracker 
 that's  what  we  do  it  on  we  don't  set  a 
 nofap  streak 
 we  don't  say  oh  for  30  days  i'm  not
[04:49] going  to  attack  for  90  days  i'm  going  to 
 go  on  a  dopamine  day  shut 
 up  we  don't  do  the  x  days  challenge
[04:54] because  we  are  not  [ __ ]  we're  not 
 doing  this  for  social  validation  and  the 
 reason  why  you're  still  stuck  in  this
[04:59] stage 
 is  because  you  keep  doing  it  for  social 
 validation  you  want  people  to  hear  your 
 story  of  our  i  was  on  90  day  streak  and
[05:06] that's  why  you  keep  failing  because  that 
 you  can't  succeed 
 when  you've  set  this  dumb  ass  challenge
[05:12] so  in  terms  of  your  bad  habits  let's  say 
 fapping 
 instead  of  setting  the  intention  to  go 
 onto  nofap  and  to  do  a  nofap  streak
[05:19] what  you're  now  going  to  do  is  track  it 
 and  you're  going  to  see  what  is  average
[05:24] for  your  fapping  behaviors  for  a  month 
 let's  say  you  jack  off  20  times  in  this 
 month 
 well  then  guess  what  next  time  we're
[05:29] going  to  aim  for  15.  and  the  next  month 
 we're  going  to  aim  for  12  and  the  next 
 month  we're  going  to  aim  for  10  you  can
[05:34] see  what  we're  doing  you  are  not  good 
 enough  you  haven't  leveled  yourself  up 
 to  the  point  where  you  can  just  make  a
[05:39] zero  you  haven't  leveled  yourself  up  to 
 the  point  that  you  could  even  make  it  10 
 per  month  right  now  because  you  can't
[05:45] because  what  of  what  i've  just  said 
 either  offended  you  or  because  you 
 didn't  want  to  listen  to  it
[05:50] you  will  not  make  any  progress  you  can 
 only  make  progress  when  you  lower  your 
 ego  and  really  really  see  where  you're
[05:55] at  and 
 just  think  about  your  behaviors  recently 
 think  about  your  mindset  recently
[06:00] you  aren't  that  great  you  are  a  piece  of 
 [ __ ]  right  now  and  a  piece  of  [ __ ] 
 isn't  supposed  to  suddenly  be  able  to
[06:05] stop  their  porn  addiction 
 because  you've  been  leveling  this  porn 
 addiction  up  for  like  five  years
[06:10] straight  so  how  are you  expecting  to 
 just  suddenly  drop  it 
 and  have  the  the  willpower  of  it  like  of
[06:15] a 
 warrior  you  are  not  that  great  right  now 
 you  aren't  that  important  you  aren't 
 that  special  you're  actually  a  piece  of
[06:20] and  this  keeps  hurting  if  this  is 
 pissing  you  off  right  now  this  is  why  i 
 want  you  to  be  thinking  of  what  your
[06:26] thoughts  feel 
 as  i've  just  called  you  a  piece  of  [ __ ] 
 five  times  in  this  video  if  you're
[06:31] offended  at  that 
 if  it  does  something  inside  of  you  where 
 you're  like  wait  this  guy's  a  prick  he's
[06:36] like 
 he's  not  helping  that  actually  this 
 guy's  the  piece  of  [ __ ]  it's  your  ego 
 you  know  deep  down  we  all  know  deep  down
[06:41] with  the  type  of  behaviors  you  have  that 
 you're  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and  until  you  can 
 accept  that  you're  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and
[06:46] say  you  know  what 
 tomorrow  i'd  like  to  be  one  percent  less 
 of  a  piece  of  [ __ ] 
 and  again  and  again  and  again  because
[06:52] you  can't  accept  that  because  you  still 
 have  this  this  arrogance  and  this 
 ignorance  to  think  no  i'm  actually
[06:57] pretty  sick  even  though  you 
 you  don't  really  believe  it  you  won't  do 
 the  tasks  you  won't  do  the  work  required
[07:03] lose  the  ego  the  book  ego  is  the  enemy 
 by  ryan  holiday  may  help  you 
 i  highly  suggest  you  have  a  look  at  that
[07:09] it's  literally  like  two  pounds  on 
 kendall  just  buy  it 
 trying  to  stop  your  addictions  in  a  fake 
 manner  it's  fueled  by  haste
[07:15] you  throw  out  the  addiction  in  a 
 monumental  event 
 but  inside  your  mind  you  knew  that  it
[07:20] was  not  the  last  time 
 when  you  uninstalled  league  of  legends 
 you  knew  that  it  wasn't  the  last  time 
 you'd  ever  play  that  game
[07:26] when  you  delete  reddit  or  instagram  or 
 or  snapchat  or  you  unfollow  your  ex  you
[07:31] knew  that  that  was  not  the  last  time  you 
 ever  do  that  behavior 
 and  so  you  do  it  because  you  want  the 
 social  validation  you  want  you  do  it
[07:37] because  you  want  to  tell  someone  huh 
 i  deleted  instagram  but  if  it's  some 
 kind  of  monumental  events  where  you
[07:42] delete  something  you  throw  away 
 the  addiction  it's  not  going  to  work  you 
 are  still  addicted  until  you  can  have
[07:47] the  thing 
 in  front  of  you  and  you  choose  not  to  do 
 it  if  it  if  all  you  do
[07:52] is  throw  the  chocolate  bar  away  then 
 you're  you  still  have  an  addiction 
 you're  just 
 right  now  not  going  to  indulge  because
[07:58] it's  not 
 in  front  of  you  congratulations  you're 
 you're  cured  for  three  hours  up  until 
 you  go  and  buy  some  more  chocolate  or  up
[08:04] until  you  download  league  of  legends 
 again  that  isn't  the  fix  how  many  times 
 have  i 
 if  you've  been  watching  my  videos  for  a
[08:09] while  how  many  times  have  i  said  that  we 
 don't  uninstall  this  stuff 
 we  keep  it  on  our  computers  i  still  have
[08:14] all  of  the  video  games  on  my  computers 
 but 
 will  will  power  get  strained  willpower
[08:19] is  limited  yes  it  is 
 that's  how  we  level  it  up  you've  watched
[08:24] the  one  video  by 
 he's  a  fantastic  youtuber  but  you've 
 watched  that  one  video  by  the  youtuber
[08:29] what  i've  learned 
 and  he  said  that  willpower  is  limited 
 and  it  is  but  that  is  how  we  level  it  up
[08:34] that's  like  saying  oh  but  wait  if  i  go 
 to  the  gym  tomorrow 
 my  muscles  will  be  sore  if  my  muscles
[08:41] are  sore  then  that  means  they'll  get 
 weaker  yeah 
 dumbass  because  they  get  stronger 
 afterwards
[08:47] so  when  we  deplete  our  willpower  by 
 having  the  chocolate  bar  in  front  of  us 
 and  just 
 looking  at  it  eventually  we  might
[08:52] indulge  but  if  we  spent  the  entire  day 
 just  just  this  will  power  of  inside  of 
 us  just  learning  what  our  mind  is  like
[08:57] just  staring  at  the  chocolate  bar  and 
 just  thinking  like 
 being  mindful  of  our  cravings  eventually
[09:03] we're  probably  gonna  eat  the  chocolate 
 and  at  the  end  of  the  night  our 
 willpower  is  gonna  be  depleted  perhaps 
 we  might  even  do  some  of  the  bad  habits
[09:09] but  tomorrow  we're  going  to  wake  up  with 
 a  recharge  willpower  and  it's  going  to 
 be  slightly  bigger  than  it  was  yesterday
[09:14] because  you  just  slightly  leveled  it  up 
 you've  just  been  training 
 the  willpower  skill  too  often  i've  seen
[09:19] guys  who  don't  even  want  to  induce  or 
 think  about  willpower  at  all 
 and  they  want  easy  little  systems  they
[09:24] want  technology  to  help  them 
 they  want  to  delete  the  apps  because 
 yeah  it's  going  to  take  it's  going  to 
 add  some  friction  to  the  habit  it's
[09:29] going  to  take  me  a  few  more  seconds  to 
 download  it  again  and  how  many  times 
 have  you  deleted  the  app
[09:34] how  many  times  has  it  really  helped  you 
 i  haven't  used  snapchat  in  a  while  i 
 still  have  it  on  my  phone  i  haven't 
 binge  in  a  long  time  and  i  still  have
[09:40] all  the  foods  that  i  would  binge  on  and 
 that's  why  i've  i've  cured  these 
 problems  is  because  i've  kept  them  in
[09:46] front  of  me 
 so  that  my  willpower  keeps  increasing 
 every  single  day 
 you're  hiding  away  from  it  because  you
[09:51] don't  want  the  discomfort  of  just 
 acknowledging  that  your  willpower  is 
 like  you  know  being  used  right  now 
 but  that's  how  we  level  it  up  if  you're
[09:57] in  this  stage  stage  one  of  the 
 self-improvement  struggle  please 
 forget  about  women  forget  about  getting
[10:03] laid  just 
 hold  it  in  be  a  [ __ ]  monk  if  you're 
 literally  depressed  right  now 
 if  you  feel  like  you've  got  porn
[10:08] addiction  feel  like  you've  got  a  weed 
 addiction  or  a  binge  you  know  mental 
 health  problems 
 thinking  about  women's  gonna  make  it
[10:13] worse  you've  got  bigger  things  on  your 
 plates  this  is  on  the  red  pill  this  is 
 like  something  that's
[10:18] so  so  heavily  talked  about  on  the  ask 
 trp  subreddits  where  all  these  dumbass 
 little  19  year  olds  are  talking  about
[10:24] wanting  to  get  girls  and  this  and  this 
 and  this 
 and  it's  like  they  haven't  even  checked 
 off  the  step  one  of  self-improvement
[10:29] which  is 
 work  on  yourself  if  your  mental  health 
 isn't  right  if  anything  isn't  right
[10:34] your  success  with  women  is  trash  because 
 let's  say  perfect  scenario 
 you  meet  the  girl  who's  gonna  save  you
[10:39] from  demand  oh  you  know  the  one  special 
 girl's  gonna  help  you  yeah 
 perfect  relationship  you're  gonna  [ __ ]
[10:44] it  up  because  you're  depressed  because 
 you're  in  this  depressive  struggle 
 period  your  framish  trash  you're  not
[10:49] masculine 
 you're  going  to  [ __ ]  it  up  and  feel  even 
 worse  wouldn't  you  like  to  just  wait 
 and  meet  the  girl  when  you're  already
[10:55] doing  good  how  about  you  go  hook  up  with 
 a  girl  oh  you  got  the  the  big  boy 
 confidence  me  me  big  alpha  male
[11:00] me  have  sex  with  lots  of  women 
 congratulations  you're  gonna  have  this 
 empty 
 nihilistic  feeling  afterwards  this
[11:06] darkness  feeling  where  you  finally  got 
 everything  you  wanted  and  you  realized 
 it  was  literally  just  a  stinky  wet  hole
[11:11] congratulations  your  depression  is  worse 
 now 
 life  feels  pointless  because  you've 
 literally  gotten  the  height  of  the
[11:17] masculine  experience  which 
 you  actually  believe  that  is  the  height 
 for  some  reason  instead  of  thinking  of
[11:22] achieving  your  purpose  and  so  you  feel 
 like 
 and  you're  not  going  to  enjoy  it  because 
 you've  got  mental  health  problems 
 because  you're  going  to  be  you're
[11:27] literally  gonna  be  having  sex 
 with  a  girl  whilst  having  insecure 
 thoughts  whilst  having  like 
 mindlessness  you  have  the  confidence  to
[11:32] go  approaching  well  you're  gonna  get 
 black-pilled  immediately  because  you've 
 got  such  a  horrible  mindset  right  now
[11:37] women  should  not  be  in  your  life  at  all 
 in  stage  one  and  i  know  that  there's 
 gonna  be  some  random  [ __ ]  whoa  but  i'm
[11:43] in  stage  one  and  my  girlfriend  shut  up 
 bro 
 you  would  level  up  so  much  faster  if  you 
 just  put  100  of  your  focus  onto  this  and
[11:50] it's  almost  like  a  meditative  practice 
 when  you  see  your  mind 
 bring  up  the  fact  that  women  and  sex 
 exist  if  you  feel  like  you  need  to  go
[11:56] for  a  fap  it's  because  you've  got  an 
 addiction  not  because  you're  actually 
 that  horny 
 just  sit  there  and  just  feel  the  craving
[12:01] you  don't  actually  have  to  do  something 
 when  you  feel  horny  when  you  feel  the 
 need  to  go  and  watch  porn  try  this
[12:07] don't  do  it  we've  built  up  this  habit  to 
 think  okay 
 if  i  feel  like  i  should  watch  pawn  and
[12:12] jack  off  i  should  watch  pawn  and  jack 
 off  instead  of  thinking  okay  if  i  feel 
 like  i  should  watch  pawn  and  jack  off  i
[12:17] should  be  curious  to  actually  see 
 how  that  feels  why  is  that  coming  let  me 
 actually  feel
[12:22] that  craving  just  stop  doing  stuff  if 
 you're  in  this  stage 
 probably  the  best  thing  that  you  could
[12:28] do 
 is  sit  around  and  do  nothing  now  most
[12:33] guys  in  this  stage  won't  do  this  they 
 won't  take  this  advice  because  it 
 doesn't  seem  valuable 
 and  so  they'd  rather  keep  clicking  on
[12:38] the  youtube  videos  hopefully  if  you  can 
 just  trust  what  i  say 
 as  someone  who's  been  through  this  stage 
 as  someone  who's  helped  a  couple  of  guys
[12:43] from  the  stage 
 do  nothing  turn  everything  off  just  sit
[12:48] there  with  a  piece  of  paper  and  a  pen 
 all  day  every  day  this  isn't  a 
 short-term  thing  i'm  not  saying  oh  you
[12:53] know  check  off  the  journaling  box  and  do 
 it  for  five  minutes  no  no  i  mean 
 this  is  like  your  base  attack  now  this
[12:58] is  like  the  activity  that  you  just 
 do  like  there  isn't  much  else  that  you 
 do  in  your  day  apart  from  literally  just
[13:03] sit  there  and  just  journal 
 every  messed  up  thought  that  you  have  in 
 your  mind 
 at  this  stage  if  you've  been  stuck  in
[13:09] this  stage  now  you  can  experience  the 
 stage  fair  enough 
 but  if  you're  stuck  in  this  stage  it's 
 because  something  is  wrong  with  you
[13:15] mentally 
 yes  that's  offensive  and  you're  so 
 annoyed  that  i  said  something's  wrong 
 with  you  but 
 healthy  happy  people  aren't  stuck  at
[13:20] this  stage  and  there's  something  wrong 
 with  me  too  because  i  was  stuck  in  this 
 stage  for  a  [ __ ]  year 
 if  you're  stuck  in  this  stage  your
[13:25] journals  are  going  to  be 
 so  incredibly  valuable  to  yourself  into
[13:30] the  world 
 and  if  you  could  get  into  the  habit  of 
 journaling  for  hours  every  day  make  it
[13:35] like  literally 
 the  thing  that  you  do  like  you  are  now  a 
 journaler  you  literally  journal  for 
 every  hour  that  you  have  free  you
[13:41] journal  and  you  free  up  time  to  journal 
 that's  what's  going  to  get  you  out  of 
 here 
 and  you  are  going  to  be  so  so  grateful
[13:46] that  you've  got  a  couple  of  journals 
 after  this  because  you  might  be  able  to
[13:51] achieve  what  i've  done  here  where 
 because  you've  experienced  this  because 
 you've  journaled  it  so  much
[13:56] you've  now  got  an  exact  resource  and  the 
 perfect  mindset  to  help  someone  else  out 
 of  this 
 out  of  this  struggle  and  there's  a  lot
[14:02] of  people  here  and  this  is  somewhat  of  a 
 priceless 
 pain  point  to  solve  this  can  very  easily
[14:07] be  your  business  within  the  next  12 
 months 
 this  is  my  own  personal  story  but  you 
 might  not  believe  it  right  now  because
[14:12] you  know 
 you're  in  this  this  stage  but  if  you're 
 stuck  in  this  stage  just  know  as  someone 
 who  was  stuck  in  here
[14:17] once  you  do  the  right  things  you'll  look 
 back  and  you'll  be  grateful  for  it  this 
 will  be  one  of  the  most  important  parts
[14:22] of  your  life 
 and  that's  a  very  very  important  mindset 
 you're  stuck  in  this  stage  you're
[14:27] probably  a  young  man 
 you've  probably  got  this  ego  and  this 
 this  feeling  of  importance  that  right 
 now  it's  all  supposed  to  work  and  even
[14:33] though  you'll  you'll  disagree  with  that 
 you  won't 
 you'll  say  no  no  i  don't  expect  it  to 
 work  right  now  but
[14:38] you  do  your  biggest  issue  at  this  point 
 is  your  mindset 
 now  environment  environment  is  important
[14:45] an  environment  will  change 
 quite  a  lot  if  suddenly  you  moved  away 
 from  wherever  you're  living  if  you  moved
[14:51] to  somewhere  else  and  you  were  by 
 yourself  or  you  were  with  family  or 
 whatever  you  know  something  changed 
 that  would  probably  be  a  big  spike  but
[14:57] the  issue  with  that  is  that 
 it  would  only  be  a  big  spike  in  that  it 
 might
[15:02] allow  you  the  the  logistics 
 to  work  on  your  mind  and  so  really  that
[15:08] means  that  the  mind  is  the  most 
 important  part  because  where  are  all 
 your  problems  coming  from  now  you're 
 going  to  say  porn
[15:13] you're  going  to  say  food  you're  going  to 
 say  whatever  whatever  you  know  the 
 symptom  is  but  those  are  all
[15:18] that's  the  word  those  are  symptoms  your 
 porn  addiction  your  league  of  legends 
 addiction  your  social  media  addiction
[15:24] whatever  the  [ __ ]  bad  habits  you're 
 doing 
 those  are  only  symptoms  every  bad  thing 
 that  happens
[15:29] at  least  that  we  do  purposely  to 
 ourselves  is  a  symptom  of  something 
 wrong 
 in  here  and  you  probably  know  what  it  is
[15:35] you  probably  don't  need  me  to  tell  you 
 it's  something  to  do  with  abuse  or 
 something  to  do  with  trauma  it's  because 
 you  think  you're  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  because
[15:40] your  dad  abused  you  something 
 like  that  now  of  course  it's  different 
 for  everyone  but  it's  something  like  you
[15:45] probably 
 have  noticed  like  something  just  jumped 
 inside  of  you  and  you're  like  wait 
 this  [ __ ]  knows  like  something
[15:51] too  much  about  me  because  he  just 
 spelled  it  out  it's  something  about  that 
 and  if  you  don't  dive  deep  into  that
[15:56] through  journaling 
 it  won't  resolve  many  people  don't  ever 
 really  experience
[16:01] this  stage  they  go  from  not  thinking 
 about  self-improvement  not  knowing 
 self-improvement
[16:06] and  straight  to  self  stage  two  and 
 straight  on  to  stage  two  where  there's 
 some 
 you  know  like  kind  of  struggling  with
[16:12] consistency  but  they're  at  least  trying 
 it 
 the  people  who  get  stuck  in  this  stage 
 it's  because  of  the  mind  it's  because  of
[16:17] the  mental  health 
 only  a  few  people  seem  to  get  stuck  in 
 the  stage  but  they  get  stuck
[16:22] hard  and  the  issue  with  these  people  is 
 that  again 
 that  the  problem  is  the  mind  and  imagine
[16:28] trying  to  coach  someone  whose  problem  is 
 the  mind 
 whose  problem  is  his  own  ego  that  he 
 doesn't  believe  that  he's  in  stage  one
[16:34] it's  very  tricky 
 but  the  answers  are  all  there  you  could 
 use  this  one  video  in  a  couple  of  my
[16:40] different  other  videos 
 as  the  guide  to  your  life  right  now  but 
 only  if  you  can  reduce  your  ego  to  think
[16:45] that  this  is  actually  what  you  need 
 because 
 if  you're  in  this  stage  you're  probably 
 thinking  that  this  video  was  made  for
[16:51] someone  else 
 hopefully  not  now  because  you've  watched 
 this  far  of  it  but  that's  the  issue  with 
 helping  someone  in  this  stage
[16:56] they  didn't  watch  this  far  of  this  video 
 they  already  clicked  off  because 
 they  wanted  me  to  say  oh  straight  away
[17:02] cold  showers  will  save  you  uh 
 reading  this  book  this  this  one  thing
[17:07] this  one  quick  trick  it's  a  24-hour 
 reset  your  mind  they  want  to  hear  that 
 they  don't  want  to  hear  that  you're  a
[17:13] piece  of  [ __ ] 
 and  you've  got  to  be  less  of  a  piece  of 
 [ __ ]  tomorrow  one  percent  less  and  it's
[17:18] gonna  take  you  hundreds  of  days 
 potentially 
 to  stop  being  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and  you're 
 still  gonna  feel  like  one  afterwards
[17:23] it's  an  unsexy  answer  because  you've 
 been  sold  this  live  like  the  24-hour
[17:28] change 
 that's  what  it's  gonna  take  if  you're 
 stuck  in  this  stage  i  wish  i  could  hug 
 you  right  now  i  wish  i  could  just  tell
[17:33] you  that 
 you  will  come  out  of  this  stage  with 
 gratitude  but  you  need  to  suffer
[17:38] if  you're  stuck  in  here  honestly  you 
 need  to  suffer 
 that  suffering's  gonna  be  the  most
[17:43] profitable  suffering  you  ever 
 experienced  but 
 with  this  young  man's  ego  you're  not 
 going  to  realize  it  you're  going  to  be
[17:49] so  depressed  and  angry  about  it  you're 
 going  to  be  angry  about  your  anger 
 you're  going  to  be  depressed  about  your 
 depression
[17:54] you  can  have  negative  thoughts  because 
 you're  having  negative  thoughts  your 
 mind  is  your  biggest  enemy  right  now  and
[18:00] it's  uh  i  wish  i  could  just  just  almost 
 force  you 
 to  just  understand  that  it's  your  ego
[18:05] who's  telling  you 
 that  the  basic  habits  of 
 self-improvement  aren't  good  enough  for 
 you
[18:10] that  meditation  doesn't  work  that 
 journaling's  pointless  that 
 like  if  you're  stuck  in  the  stage  you
[18:15] have  not  been  consistently 
 exercising  meditating  and  journaling 
 every  single  day  now  you'll  say  you  have
[18:20] you'll  say  that  wait  but  i  did  meditate 
 but  you  meditated  once  you  meditated  20 
 times  congratulations  meditate  every
[18:26] single  day  for  the  rest  of  your  life  if 
 you  refuse  to  do  that 
 you  will  stay  here  if  you  refuse  to 
 journal  you  will  stay  here
[18:32] oh  but  but  i  exercise  but  you  exercise 
 twice  a  week  three  times  a  week 
 you've  got  to  be  exercising  at  least  six
[18:38] times  a week  there's  no  reason  not  to 
 exercise  seven  times  a  week  just  because 
 you're  on  some  [ __ ]  weight  lifting
[18:43] program  which  tells  you  of 
 ppl  or  whatever  it  doesn't  matter  humans 
 don't  take  rest  days  weight  lifters  can
[18:48] if  they're  competing  gymnastics  whatever 
 if  you're  competing  in  a  real  sport  you 
 can  take  a  rest  day  but  that  doesn't
[18:53] mean  that  you  should  then  just  be  an 
 inactive 
 weirdly  human  being  who  just  sits  there 
 on  his  computer  chair
[18:58] how  could  you  not  have  depression  with 
 the  things  that  you're  doing 
 get  a  picture  of  all  of  the  the  habits
[19:03] and  actions  that  you've  been  taking 
 how  could  you  not  be  in  this  stage  you
[19:08] deserve  to  be  in  this 
 stage  so  just  make  yourself  deserve  to 
 be  in  the  next  stage
[19:14] and  just  stop  listening  to  your  brain 
 set  the  plan 
 and  know  that  as  soon  as  you  deviate
[19:20] from  the  plan 
 it's  your  lizard  brain  get  used  to 
 telling  your  own  brain  to  shut  up  get
[19:25] used  to  listening  to  your  words  and 
 thinking  you  know  what  i  don't  trust 
 what  i've  just  thought 
 be  critical  of  your  own  brain  this  is
[19:31] some  of  the  best  advice  i've  ever  gave 
 out  of  my  mouth 
 listen  to  what  i've  just  said  be 
 critical  of  your  own  brain  it's  your  own
[19:37] voice  in  your  mind  that  is  the  lizard 
 brain  that's  telling  you  to  skip  the 
 workout  that's  telling  you  that  this
[19:42] video  is  not  important  it's  telling  you 
 that  you  don't  even  need  to  journal  it's 
 telling  you  that  meditation  doesn't  even 
 work 
 it's  telling  you  that  you  may  as  well
[19:48] give  up  hope  that  you  may  as well  just 
 go  jack  off  again  then  you  may  as  well 
 just  go  play  league  of  legends 
 it's  going  to  be  your  own  words  in  your
[19:53] brain  telling  you  to  do  that 
 don't  listen  to  your  brain  be  very 
 critical  of  every  thought  that  you  get
[19:58] spend  just  a  bit  of  time  planning 
 the  the  course  of  action  and  then  just
[20:03] make  it  so  clear  to  yourself  that  this 
 one  page 
 if  you  deviate  away  from  this  plan  that
[20:08] is  your  lizard  brain  that  is  failure 
 no  matter  how  logical  it  sounds  that  oh 
 we're  going  to  skip  the  workout  today
[20:13] because  tomorrow  we'll  do  it  all 
 we're  really  tired  today  it  doesn't 
 matter  if  you  don't  do  this  plan  you
[20:18] fail  and  hold  yourself  accountable  to 
 that 
 failure  do  the  hard  work  especially  when
[20:23] you  don't  feel  like  it
"
Efmrx22gTIQ,"[00:00] you're  really  gonna  go  for  the  third 
 relapse  of  the  day  Jeffrey 
 the  third  relapse
[00:21] yo  cut  the  intro  bro  [ __ ]  me  man  I  did  a 
 podcast  interview  like  Discord  call
[00:26] there  was  a  point  when  I  was  like  live 
 streaming  and  one  of  the  guys  who  I 
 invited  up  to  come  speak  to  me  whilst  I 
 was  live  streaming  was  a  13  year  old  kid
[00:32] he  said  that  he  was  given  an  iPad  at  the 
 age  of  four  and  that  he  discovered  I
[00:37] think  he  said  age  nine  or  ten  and  that 
 he  had  an  addiction  before  he  was  11
[00:42] years  old  I  will  say  that  again  an  11 
 year  old  had  a  pawn  addiction  you  want
[00:47] to  do  something  interesting  close  your 
 eyes  see  yourself  as  a  father  a  few 
 years  from  now  and  just  see  your  son  in
[00:53] his  room  with  an  addiction  to  porn  a  bad 
 addiction  to  porn  and  maybe  video  games
[00:58] too  and  imagine  seeing  that  in  your  son 
 and  imagine  not  even  being  able  to  help 
 him  because  of  how  hyper  stimulating  and
[01:04] addicting  it  is  and  I  think  what  makes 
 it  so  much  harder  now  is  that  it's  no 
 longer  even  like  these  porn  companies
[01:10] that  are  pushing  this  onto  kids  it's 
 kids  putting  it  onto  other  kids  it's 
 some  little  girl  12  years  olds  working
[01:16] on  Tick  Tock  kids  in  high  school  like 
 the  boys  in  high  school  bro  a  lot  of 
 them  are  addicted  to  like  Tick  Tock  and
[01:21] stuff  imaginable  imagine  literally  if 
 you  see  this  like  generation  of  high 
 school  boys  on  Tick  Tock  literally
[01:26] seeing  their  generation  of  girls  showing 
 their  bodies  sexually  and  when  you  think 
 about  the  age  of  the  girls  who  are  going
[01:31] viral  on  Tick  Tock  that's  when  it  gets 
 really  [ __ ]  bro  I  remember  the  day 
 that  I  got  into  nofap  like  I  knew  about
[01:36] it  for  a  little  while  but  I  was  age  17 
 I'm  25  now  I  knew  about  it  for  a  while 
 people  talking  about  it  online  or  day  90
[01:41] and  you'll  be  able  to  levitate  and  [ __ ] 
 right  you  know  I  tried  it  here  and  there 
 one  day  two  day  relapse  whatever  I  don't
[01:46] really  care  yeah  whatever  I  remember  the 
 day  that  I  took  it  seriously  bro  I  woke 
 up  and  this  was  somewhat  of  like  a  habit
[01:51] for  me  I'd  wake  up  and  just  grab  my 
 phone  and  just  go  on  like  Reddit  and 
 Instagram  and  stuff  and  fact  once
[01:56] cleaned  up  stayed  in  bed  or  lying  down 
 just  scrolled  more  and  more  and  more 
 click  on  some  more  porn  on  Instagram  you
[02:01] see  ass  or  on  Reddit  it's  like  a  sexual 
 post  or  some  [ __ ]  even  talking  about 
 this  [ __ ]  I  don't  want  to  take  you  out
[02:06] this  story  but  even  just  describing  the 
 story  to  you  and  you  know  just 
 describing  over  on  Reddit  there's  like  a 
 sexual  thing  I  promise  you  I  literally
[02:11] just  had  like  a  little  bit  of  a  desire 
 to  go  and  watch  porn  right  now  years 
 after  I've  watched  that  [ __ ]  the  second
[02:16] time  still  I  haven't  left  the  bed  yet 
 it's  the  second  time  fap  I  remember  the 
 third  time  was  when  I  went  on  to  Pornhub 
 and  watched  like  this  video  of  like  this
[02:22] blonde  girl  getting  railed  and  how 
 [ __ ]  is  that  as  well  not  like  seeing  a 
 sexual  picture  it's  like  it's  still  not 
 good  for  you  and  stuff  but  you  know  of
[02:27] like  a  girl  or  seeing  like  some  video  of 
 her  twerking  or  some  [ __ ]  yeah  fine  but 
 like  actual  porn  where  you  see  like  a
[02:33] man  [ __ ]  a  woman  and  you're  like  the 
 little  monkey  in  the  corner  just 
 checking  off  to  that  what  does  that  do 
 to  your  brain  and  your  beliefs  just
[02:38] everything  about  you  you're  kind  of 
 conditioning  yourself  to  just  be  like 
 this  weirdo  who  isn't  having  sex  but
[02:43] who's  just  watching  bro  the  third  time 
 by  the  time  that  I  finished  I  wasn't 
 even  fully  hard  I'm  looking  down  at  my
[02:50] semi-limp  dick  and  thinking  this  is 
 [ __ ]  bro  I  was  17  years  old  and  my  PP
[02:55] wasn't  even  getting  hard  I  took  no  Fab 
 seriously  after  that  because  bro  that  is 
 gut-wrenching  as  a  man  that's  your
[03:00] manhood  your  PP  is  your  manhood  to  see 
 that  it's  not  working  well  because 
 you've  been  death  gripping  it  whilst
[03:05] watching  porn  oh  that  is  so  upsetting 
 you  need  to  stop  castrating  yourself
[03:10] because  that's  what  this  is  I  always 
 give  this  analogy  and  it  always  opens 
 people's  eyes  so  I'm  gonna  tell  you  it 
 what  happens  if  you  have  a  male  cat  and
[03:16] you  castrate  it  and  essentially  castrate 
 you  like  chop  off  it's  peanuts  and  balls 
 or  something  you  castrate  it  it  goes
[03:21] from  being  like  this  adventurous  cat 
 that's  almost  challenging  you  jumping 
 around  everywhere  being  a  bit  aggressive
[03:26] to  this  like  docile  weak  lazy  submissive 
 little  being  we  know  this  oh  yeah  we  get
[03:32] pets  castrated  it's  like  a  normal  thing 
 right  and  we  see  the  transformation  oh 
 yeah  you  know  if  your  cat's  being 
 misbehaving  yeah  go  get  a  castrate  it  is
[03:38] a  normal  thing  have  you  ever  really 
 stopped  to  just  think  like  [ __ ]  like 
 that's  kind  of  what  I'm  doing  to  myself 
 when  I  check  off  you're  castrating
[03:43] yourself  that  life  that  you're  supposed 
 to  have  inside  of  you  that  drive  that
[03:48] you're  supposed  to  have  to  either  go  and 
 get  women  or  go  and  work  yourself  up  to 
 be  attractive  and  successful  enough  to
[03:53] get  women  that  drive  inside  of  you  just 
 gets  diminished  and  thrown  into  Kleenex 
 I  can't  tell  if  this  is  a  conspiracy
[03:59] theory  but  you'll  remember  being  told 
 that  masturbating  and  watching  porn  was 
 good  for  you  I  swear  so  many  guys  can
[04:04] remember  that  being  like  a  general 
 consensus  by  teachers  perhaps  by  parents 
 for  some  reason  it  feels  like  the
[04:09] government  told  me  that  masturbating  and 
 watching  porn  was  good  for  me  so  many 
 guys  have  been  able  to  agree  we  can't
[04:14] pinpoint  whether  we  were  told  to  this  by 
 the  government  but  it  feels  like  that 
 was  the  message  that  they  conveyed  to  us
[04:19] is  this  a  conspiracy  theory  to  think 
 that  was  convey  to  us  because  they  want 
 a  generation  of  like  submissive  men
[04:24] especially  men  of  like  the  warrior  class 
 the  younger  men  full  of  testosterone  to 
 just  castrate  themselves  so  they're
[04:29] easier  to  control  you're  probably 
 thinking  well  yeah  like  I  want  to  stop  I 
 want  to  stop  but  like  I  keep  fapping  I 
 keep  messing  up  I  keep  relapsing  and
[04:35] honestly  yeah  of  course  you  do  it's 
 normal  that  when  you're  trying  to  stop  a 
 habit  you  still  keep  doing  that  thing
[04:40] for  some  time  it  took  me  a  couple  of 
 years  to  really  actually  make  nofap  work 
 because  it's  not  just  like  you  can  just
[04:45] declare  yeah  I'm  on  nofap  now  I'm  not 
 gonna  fap  anymore  it's  more  so  that  if 
 you've  been  fapping  for  10  years  it's
[04:50] gonna  take  you  some  time  to  be  able  to 
 fully  quit  because  it's  just  like 
 counteracting  those  bad  habits  so  a  lot
[04:56] of  young  guys  really  do  get  obsessed 
 with  this  and  you  know  they  say  like  oh 
 you  know  Hamza  Ramon  no  fap  and  I  get  to 
 day  seven  then  I  keep  relapse  and  I  keep
[05:02] relapsing  keep  relapsing  and  I  tell  them 
 how  long  have  you  been  fapping  for  when 
 did  you  start  at  all  like  you  know  12 
 years  old  13  years  old  so  you've  been
[05:08] fapping  for  four  years  five  years  and 
 you've  been  on  Nova  like  two  months  bro 
 so  it's  like  you  can't  just  expect  it  to 
 be  perfect  overnight  it's  like  are  you
[05:14] fapping  like  once  a  week  that's  probably 
 like  a  good  level  of  progress  perhaps  a 
 month  from  now  fap  every  eight  days  nine
[05:19] days  ten  days  perhaps  six  months  from 
 now  up  every  three  weeks  perhaps  a  year 
 from  now  fap  less  than  once  a  month  and
[05:25] at  that  point  it's  like  yeah  it's  fine 
 bro  why  do  the  people  of  nofa  become 
 successful  and  of  course  this  is  a 
 little  bit  cringe  it's  like  other  guys
[05:30] who  get  onto  nofap  still  stay  losers  but 
 generally  a  lot  of  the  successful  men 
 have  this  in  common  they  stopped
[05:35] masturbating  and  what's  important  the 
 greatest  motivator  that  you  have  is  the 
 drive  to  [ __ ]  women  honestly  like  I  know
[05:41] it's  kind  of  offensive  or  controversial 
 but  it  is  true  the  greatest  motivator  as 
 a  matter  but  if  you  really  think  of
[05:46] yourself  as  an  animal  what's  your 
 motivator  bro  because  this  too  there's 
 one  to  survive  so  if  you're  hungry  or 
 thirsty  or  some  [ __ ]  or  you  need  shelter
[05:52] that's  the  biggest  motivator  you  have  to 
 survive  but  once  your  survival  needs  a 
 met  which  it  is  for  99.99  of  guys  here
[05:58] then  what's  left  is  the  biggest  need  the 
 biggest  desire  to  [ __ ]  and  when  you  get 
 rid  of  that  desire  it's  like  well  you've
[06:04] achieved  like  most  of  what  you  needed  to 
 do  with  your  life  and  so  of  course  you 
 feel  kind  of  lethargic  and  lazy  and
[06:09] shameful  and  just  tired  of  course  you 
 don't  feel  motivated  to  do  hard  work  of 
 course  you  don't  even  enjoy  hard  work 
 after  you've  just  bust  50  nuts  over  the
[06:15] last  two  months  the  men  with  no  fat 
 become  successful  because  they're  able 
 to  harness  their  sexual  energy  which  is
[06:20] so  incred  incredibly  important  and  I 
 know  it  does  sound  cringe  I'll  have  the 
 men  of  no  [ __ ]  stuff  it  sounds  cringe
[06:25] but  the  thing  is  your  sexual  desire  is 
 incredibly  important  and  it's  being 
 Stripped  Away  from  you  by  your  own  hand
[06:31] but  by  the  cause  I  think  of  external 
 influences  which  are  telling  young  men 
 that  it's  okay  to  just  spill  their  seed
[06:37] just  because  it's  normal  I  gave  this 
 analogy  once  and  I  think  you'll  be 
 interested  imagine  you  put  two  men  in  a 
 cage  this  weird  [ __ ]  up  Social
[06:43] experiments  and  you  tell  them  fight  and 
 don't  stop  till  one  of  you  are  dead 
 imagine  you  did  this  like  psychological 
 experiments  and  you  wanted  to  see  what
[06:49] mine  would  fight  harder  one  of  the  men 
 we  fill  him  up  with  food  first  and  we 
 also  tell  them  yeah  you're  a  masturbate
[06:54] oh  you  know  here's  a  woman  have  sex  so 
 he's  empty  of  nut  and  full  of  belly  the 
 other  guy  no  food  for  you  and  also  full
[06:59] balls  for  you  no  nothing  he's  got  an 
 empty  stomach  and  full  heavy  balls  I
[07:04] know  this  sounds  silly  but  I  really  just 
 want  you  to  imagine  this  competition 
 this  fight  we  have  this  man  with  a  full
[07:09] stomach  his  digesting  [ __ ]  refined 
 carbs  right  now  and  empty  balls  and  this 
 man  with  an  empty  stomach  and  full  balls
[07:15] and  we  tell  them  fight  to  the  death 
 honestly  bro  do  I  even  have  to  ask  you 
 who's  gonna  win  all  of  us  right  now  I
[07:20] think  every  single  person  right  now 
 would  say  this  guy  right  some  nerd  might 
 come  in  oh  but  this  guy's  got  more  Cubs
[07:25] and  cubs  like  it  just  shut  the  [ __ ]  up 
 if  you  really  imagine  like  a  realistic 
 scenario  of  some  guy  eating  a  big  meal 
 and  then  like  nothing  and  the  other  guy
[07:30] staying  faster  bro  this  guy  who  stayed 
 fasted  he's  literally  hungry  and  he's 
 horny  bro  he's  gonna  [ __ ]  this  guy  like
[07:37] not  like  that  but  he's  gonna  [ __ ]  him  up 
 though  right  now  okay  this  experiment's 
 like  really  weird  and  stuff  right  but  is 
 it  that  different  from  what's  just
[07:43] happening  in  normal  life  anyway  because 
 we  as  men  we're  in  competition  bro  if 
 you  want  to  study  and  get  good  grades
[07:48] your  grades  are  not  just  in  a  vacuum 
 your  grade  is  based  on  what  other  people 
 get  your  grade  is  actually  a  competition
[07:54] against  other  people  in  your  business  in 
 your  career  you're  competing  against 
 other  people  to  attract  women  you're
[07:59] competing  against  other  men  why  are  we 
 spilling  our  drive  to  compete  why  not 
 hold  that  and  actually  use  it  for
[08:04] something  that's  worth  more  than  just  a 
 few  seconds  of  hedonistic  pleasure 
 that's  why  the  men  of  nofap  become  more
[08:10] successful  because  they're  able  to 
 harness  what  may  be  the  greatest  drive 
 we  have  is  our  sexual  drive  and  this
[08:15] isn't  some  like  weird  ass  advice  I  get  a 
 day  90  or  some  [ __ ]  I'm  not  saying  to 
 get  to  a  particular  day  I've  never  been
[08:20] one  of  these  guys  I  hate  that  advice 
 advice  of  like  yeah  I  get  to  day  90  or 
 something  I  don't  think  the  benefit  of 
 nofa  comes  in  streaks  I  think  the
[08:26] benefit  of  nofap  comes  when  you  just 
 reduce  the  quantity  of  like  nuts  per 
 month  per  year  I  have  a  problem  with
[08:32] most  of  the  nofap  YouTubers  you  can 
 think  of  a  nofap  YouTuber  right  now 
 chances  are  I  don't  like  them  I  think 
 they're  bad  for  you  even  though  that's
[08:38] weird  to  say  it's  like  I  think  they're 
 actually  bad  influences  because  their 
 pressure  needs  to  stay  on  the  street  and 
 they've  convinced  you  that  if  you
[08:43] relapse  if  you  you  know  mess  up  the 
 streak  you  lose  all  the  benefits  and  you 
 have  to  start  again  bro  that  sounds
[08:48] [ __ ]  up to  me  because  imagine  a 
 fitness  channel  telling  a  fat  guy  of  all 
 these  benefits  that  he  could  get  if  he
[08:53] gets  onto  exercise  and  then  tells  him 
 like  oh  yeah  by  the  way  like  if  you  mess 
 up  your  streak  and  you  miss  one  workout
[08:58] all  of  the  benefits  reset  imagine 
 telling  a  fat  guy  that  he  has  to  go  to 
 the  gym  every  single  day  and  if  he
[09:04] misses  one  day  all  of  the  benefits  reset 
 that  is  inhumane  and  that's  what  these 
 nofap  YouTubers  do  to  you  and  they
[09:09] convince  you  that  you  need  to  be  on  a 
 streak  you  don't  need  to  be  on  a  streak 
 you  just  need  to  reduce  how  often  you 
 fap  per  month  per  six  months  per  three
[09:15] months  per  week  keep  your  balls  full  bro 
 like  nice  and  happy  click  on  this  video 
 right  now  do  the  hard  work  especially
[09:20] when  you  don't  feel  like  it  mmm
"
uMlRMAZ0lB0,"[00:00] it's  back  in  Spring  2022  I'm  22  years 
 old  I'm  in  my  apartment  and  I'm  locked
[00:06] away  in  my  bedroom 
 I'm  on  my  computer  watching  something 
 that  I  should  not  be  watching
[00:12] I  feel  dirty  disgusting  I  feel  like  a 
 degenerate
[00:17] I'm  watching 
 self-improvement  videos
[00:22] but  worse  than  that  I'm  procrastinating 
 from  something  important  that  I  should 
 be  doing  right  now
[00:27] but  I'm  wasting  time  watching  video 
 after  video  after  video  I'm  watching 
 videos  on  how  to  quit  procrastinating
[00:32] and  I'm  literally  procrastinating  whilst 
 watching  them  I've  procrastinated  for  so 
 long  that  the  time  goes  11AM  12  o'clock
[00:40] 1pm 
 it's  literally  time  for  the  next  meal  of 
 the  day  so  I  go  to  the  kitchen  I'm
[00:47] eating  something  gotta  get  my  protein  in 
 and  go  back  to  procrastinating  instead 
 of  doing  the  important  task  that  I'm
[00:53] supposed  to  be  doing 
 eventually  it  gets  so  late  that  I'm 
 actually  starting  to  feel  aggressive  and
[00:59] anxious  so  I  get  up  from  my  computer  I 
 go  into  the  other  room  with  my
[01:04] girlfriend's  sleeping 
 and  I  grab
[01:10] my  shirts  my  pants  and  my  shoes
[01:15] 15  minutes  later  I'm  red-faced  I'm 
 sweating  and  I'm  panting
[01:21] I'm  doing  squats  in  the  gym 
 so  I'm  thinking  to  myself  why  did  I 
 procrastinate  this  all  day  I  should  have
[01:28] hit  this  workout  at  like  9am  but  here  I 
 am  hours  and  hours  later
[01:33] and  so  I'm  gonna  make  this  the  best 
 workout  possible  squats  leg  press 
 Sprints  pushing  super  super  hard
[01:43] in  the  end  it  ends  up  being  a  mediocre 
 workout  at  best
[01:48] but  that's  when  I  realized  that  I've 
 never  regretted  being  disciplined  that 
 it's  always  paid  off  to  do  the  hard  work
[01:55] especially  when  I  didn't  feel  like  it  my 
 name  is  Hamza  and  I've  made  this  full 
 guide  on  discipline  that's  taken  me  a
[02:01] lot  of  time  and  I  want  to  take  you  from 
 being  more  of  like  a  normal  average
[02:06] person  who  isn't  very  disciplined  who 
 misses  a  lot  of  workouts  who  doesn't  do 
 their  studying  or  their  work  on  time  and
[02:13] sometimes  you  do  get  bursts  of 
 motivation  to  go  to  the  gym  or  to  do 
 work  but  it's  so  infrequent  that  it
[02:20] starts  to  sacrifice  your  life  and  your 
 goals  and  so  I  want  to  make  that  way 
 more  consistent  for  you  I've  spent  the
[02:25] last  one  and  a  half  weeks  putting 
 together  this  full  guide  it's  taken  me 
 over  40  hours  I've  read  an  entire  book
[02:31] I've  read  discipline  is  Destiny  by  Ryan 
 holiday  which  is  a  really  good  book  and 
 I've  put  it  all  together  in  one  guide  so
[02:37] this  is  the  one  full  guide  that  you  need 
 to  be  more  disciplined  you  can  put  your
[02:42] trust  in  this  one  guide  if  you  follow 
 one  rule  you  watch  it  in  order  I've
[02:48] wrapped  my  brain  to  think  like  what  are 
 the  specific  steps  in  order  that  you 
 would  need  to  know  so  it's  very
[02:53] important  that  you  don't  click  around 
 and  jump  around  I'm  not  saying  that  you 
 need  to  watch  this  entire  video  to  bump 
 up  the  YouTube  algorithm  or  anything
[02:59] it's  just  if  you're  going  to  spend  10 
 minutes  today  20  minutes  tomorrow 
 watching  this  video  just  simply  watch  it
[03:04] in  order  and  I  promise  you  that  by  the 
 end  of  this  video  If  you  put  in  the  work
[03:09] and  you  followed  the  actionable  steps 
 that  I've  laid  out  for  you  you  will 
 become  a  disciplined  young  man  here  is
[03:15] your  first  actionable  step  of  this  guide 
 if  you  just  close  your  eyes  and 
 visualize  how  you  will  like  one  year  ago
[03:23] you'll  realize  that  maybe  you're  a  bit 
 more  disciplined  and  consistent  than  you 
 realize  because  if  you  picture  younger
[03:28] you  who  was  far  more  awkward  and  he  was 
 you  know  he  liked  working  out  less
[03:34] struggled  with  work  and  with  studying  a 
 lot  more  than  you  do  now
[03:39] and  you  can  just  see  him  just  awkward  as 
 [ __ ]  like  you  know  fixing  his  shirt  or 
 something  for  no  reason  in  a  social
[03:45] setting 
 you  can  open  your  eyes  you've  made  more 
 progress  than  you've  realized  naturally
[03:50] when  you  get  onto  self-improvement  and 
 the  fact  that  you  found  this  video 
 chances  are  you're  already  on  a
[03:55] fantastic  trajectory  to  improve  your 
 life  which  is  awesome  now  what  we  just 
 need  to  do  is  give  you  a  real  protocol  a
[04:01] step-by-step  guide  to  take  that  to  the 
 next  level  Step  Zero  understanding
[04:06] discipline  before  we  begin  in  making  you 
 more  disciplined  we  have  to  actually 
 understand  it  and  I  guarantee  you  don't
[04:11] even  know  what  discipline  actually  is 
 because  a  lot  of  people  think  discipline 
 is  going  to  the  gym  a  lot  of  people
[04:17] think  discipline  is  doing  hard  work 
 it's  not  discipline  is  not  doing 
 something  that's  hard  it's  doing
[04:23] something  that  you  specifically  didn't 
 feel  like  doing  so  we  need  to  explain
[04:28] three  concepts  which  you're  going  to 
 find  really  interesting  because  there's 
 motivation  there's  discipline  and
[04:34] there's  willpower  you  need  to  know  the 
 difference  between  these  three  and  most 
 people  don't  even  know  this  motivation
[04:40] is  desire  it  is  craving  it  is  when  you 
 want  to  do  something  discipline  is
[04:46] persisting  it's  doing  something  that  you 
 aren't  motivated  for  it's  doing  the  hard
[04:52] work  especially  when  you  didn't  feel 
 like  it  and  willpower  is  resisting  it's
[04:58] not  doing  something  even  when  you  feel 
 like  it  so  I'm  motivated  for  the  gym
[05:03] means  I  want  to  go  to  the  gym  I  use 
 discipline  to  go  to  the  gym  means  I 
 didn't  feel  like  going  to  the  gym  but  I
[05:09] went  anyway  and  I  used  my  willpower  not 
 to  eat  the  junk  food  meant  that  I  was
[05:14] motivated  to  eat  the  junk  food  I  wanted 
 to  but  I  specifically  didn't  even  though 
 I  felt  like  it  because  motivation  is
[05:20] fickle  it  can  come  and  go  but  discipline 
 is  here  to  stay  because  it's  a  character 
 trait  that  we  can  build  inside  of  us  in
[05:26] fact  I  think  discipline  is  so  important 
 that  I  end  every  single  one  of  my  videos 
 with  a  catchphrase  do  the  hard  work
[05:32] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 that  phrase  do  the  hard  work  especially 
 when  you  don't  feel  like  it  perfectly
[05:39] encapsulates  discipline  it's  only 
 discipline  if  you  didn't  feel  like  it 
 and  this  is  why  as  a  man  it's  so  easy  to
[05:45] win 
 99  of  men  are  just  chasing  instant
[05:50] gratification  because  they're  so  easy  to 
 fall  down  they  want  the  fast  results  in 
 their  business  so  they're  not  willing  to
[05:55] wait  or  to  sacrifice  or  to  settle  for 
 something  for  the  long  term  they  want  to 
 watch  porn  right  now  because  they  feel  a
[06:02] sense  of  loneliness  or  you  know  a  sense 
 of  being  deprived  of  intimacy  which  they 
 won't  go  and  solve  long  term  through
[06:09] improving  themselves  and  learning  how  to 
 navigate  a  relationship  with  a  woman  so 
 they'll  just  go  and  get  that  online 
 right  now  they  want  a  sense  of  status
[06:15] and  Brotherhood  but  they'll  get  that  in 
 video  games  right  now  because  it's 
 instant  so  99  of  men  are  doing  that  if
[06:21] you  can  become  the  one  percent  of  man 
 and  this  isn't  even  me  saying  that  you 
 need  to  become  so  like  you  know  amazing
[06:26] or  anything  literally  just  do  the 
 fundamentals  of  like  not  doing  the 
 ultimate  degenerate  habits  and  you're
[06:31] already  in  the  top  few  percentile  of  men 
 and  getting  into  the  top  one  percent  of 
 men  will  not  come  from  any  kind  of
[06:37] monumental  act  if  you're  starting  to 
 feel  proper  motivated  right  now  and 
 you've  started  to  visualize  with  this
[06:42] proper  hard  grunting  workout  and  you're 
 gonna  you  know  like  make  this  fancy 
 business  it's  not  it's  not  about  the
[06:47] beating  your  competition  isn't  about 
 some  big  act  that  you've  done  it's  just
[06:52] about  showing  up  every  day  and  literally 
 just  setting  the  intention  to  try  and  do 
 it  a  little  bit  better  it's  the  guy  who
[06:58] like  stayed  on  the  basketball  court  for 
 an  extra  five  minutes  when  everyone  else 
 went  home  he's  the  one  who  becomes  like
[07:03] the  world  champion  afterwards  there's 
 two  books  which  are  very  similar  which  I 
 recommend  you  to  read  There  is  The
[07:08] Compound  Effect  and  the  slight  Edge 
 these  two  books  are  really  good  they 
 talk  about  using  discipline  to  change
[07:14] something  quite  small  and  insignificant 
 you  know  like  a  small  decision  like  a 
 one  percent  better  decision  which  then
[07:20] makes  a  huge  difference  over  a  few  years 
 I  bet  you'll  agree  with  this  it's  also
[07:25] harder  to  be  lazy  than  it  is  disciplined 
 yes  it's  harder  to  be  lazy  than  it  is  to
[07:30] be  disciplined  to  be  disciplined  means 
 that  we  have  to  go  hit  a  workout  today 
 it  means  that  we  have  to  we  can't  watch
[07:35] porn  today  oh  wow  you  know  it's  kind  of 
 difficult  fair  enough  but  to  be  lazy  to
[07:40] be  undisciplined  is  harder  because  that 
 means  that  then  you  have  to  deal  with 
 the
[07:46] you  have  to  deal  with  the  demons  in  your 
 mind  every  single  day  knowing  that 
 you're  not  living  to  your  potential
[07:51] dealing  with  the  negative  thoughts  going 
 to  sleep  and  you're  overthinking  you 
 randomly  get  a  memory  of  some  weird
[07:56] awkward  thing  that  you  did  six  years  ago 
 you  feel  like  crap  everyone  treats  you
[08:01] with  disrespect  because  you  don't 
 deserve  the  respect  genuinely  imagine 
 the  kind  of  lives  that  the  other  people
[08:06] live  where  they  don't  even  consider 
 something  like  improving  their 
 discipline  and  so  they  just  go  to  one
[08:11] easy  source  of  dopamine  to  the  next  to 
 the  next  to  the  next  they're  sacrificing 
 their  future  selves  happiness  for
[08:17] today's  pleasure  and  then  they're 
 wandering  three  months  six  months  12 
 months  down  the  line  why  they're  fat  and
[08:22] depressed  it's  because  they  did  it  it's 
 because  we  did  this  at  some  point
[08:27] I'm  glad  that  we're  on  this  pathway 
 where  we've  stopped  sacrificing 
 ourselves  and  instead  we're  making  life
[08:33] better  for  our  future  self-discipline  is 
 a  treat  for  your  future  self  discipline
[08:38] is  the  ultimate  Act  of  self-love  because 
 you're  saying  you  know  what  hair  is  like 
 some  modern  technology  porn  video  games
[08:44] it's  been  made  by  a  company  who  don't 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  me
[08:49] if  I  killed  myself  today  this  porn 
 company  wouldn't  give  a  [ __ ]  they'd  only
[08:54] care  because  you  know  one  uses  when 
 inactive
[08:59] they've  ruined  my  life  they  gave  me 
 depression  I've  got  [ __ ]  Ed  so  my 
 dick  doesn't  even  get  hard
[09:05] how  is  this  nice  for  me 
 but  if  I  quit  watching  porn  today
[09:12] My  Future  Self  is  going  to  be  recovering 
 slowly  and  slowly  and  slowly
[09:17] three  days  in  and  he  feels  you  know  he's 
 gotten  a  bit  more  lust  a  bit  more  male
[09:23] aggression  inside  of  him  testosterone 
 levels  are  rising 
 two  months  without  porn  and  you  start  to
[09:28] feel  very  healthy  towards  women  and  you 
 can  actually  speak  to  them 
 A  Year  Without  pawn  and  you  stop  getting
[09:34] those  flashes  of  like  dirty  thoughts  of 
 of  dirty  like  images  and  videos  that  you
[09:39] remember 
 the  ultimate  Act  of  self-love  is
[09:45] discipline  in  the  long  run  it's  much 
 more  painful  to  be  undisciplined  and
[09:50] there's  a  quote  that  I  like  nobody  who 
 has  given  themselves  over  to  excess  is 
 having  a  good  time
[09:56] here  is  an  actionable  step  I  want  you  to 
 do  and  it's  kind  of  mean  I  want  you  to 
 go  onto  YouTube  right  now  maybe  open  up
[10:02] a  new  tab  and  I  want  you  to  search  for 
 this  name 
 Nick  okado  n-i-k-o-c-a-d-o
[10:11] nekokado  go  find  his  YouTube  channel 
 he  is  a  morbidly  obese  man  who  made  a
[10:17] YouTube  channel  of  him  eating  a  lot  of 
 food  and  it  gets  a  lot  of  views
[10:22] and  he's  become  like  obese  obese 
 this  man  deserves  to  die  early
[10:29] now  I  know  that  a  lot  of  people  watching 
 this  will  just  we  get  panicked  and  think 
 wait  wait  he  said  something  that's
[10:34] really  bad  after  we've  been  told  never 
 to  speak  like  that  this  is  this  isn't  my 
 opinion  this  isn't  like  my  viewpoint  I
[10:40] don't  want  him  to  die  but  he  deserves  to 
 he  deserves  to  feel  this  obliterating
[10:46] pain  in  his  heart  until  he  ceases  to 
 exist  this  chokeness  in  his  throat  he
[10:51] deserves  to  feel  it 
 I  know  this  sounds  horrible  but  there's 
 something  that  you  must  understand  right
[10:56] here  right  now  if  you  want  to  live  a 
 good  life  you  deserve  the  consequences
[11:01] of  your  actions 
 this  is  worth  for  you  to  really  meditate 
 on  to  write  down  right  now  to  stick  it
[11:07] up  on  your  wall  to  write  it  and  set  it 
 as  your  phone  wallpaper  I  deserve  the
[11:12] consequences  of  my  actions  so  why  don't 
 you  just  make  it  so  that  you  deserve 
 what  you  want  some  people  deserve  to  be
[11:19] obese  sick  and  close  to  death 
 whilst  others  deserve  to  have  a  six-pack
[11:25] to  have  high  testosterone  to  have  a 
 wonderful  relationship  others  deserve  to
[11:30] make  a  lot  of  money  others  deserve 
 deserve  to  be  depressed  and  suicidal
[11:35] because  it  all  comes  down  to  the  acts 
 that  we're  willing  to  partake  in  and  so
[11:41] if  you're  willing  to  for  example  like 
 this  young  man  is 
 eat  and  eat  and  eat  and  eat  you  deserve
[11:47] the  consequences  of  that 
 now  of  course  some  shallow  breather
[11:53] might  be  watching  this  and  think  oh  but 
 so  do  you  deserve  to  be  hit  by  a  buzzer 
 barring  extreme  circumstance  let's  use
[11:59] our  brains  here  extreme  circumstances 
 extreme  accidents  are  different  if 
 you're  literally  you've  done  everything
[12:04] right  you're  just  walking  on  the  pathway 
 and  a  car  you  know  there's  a  freak 
 accident  and  like  a  brick  gets  thrown  up
[12:09] into  the  air  or  a  car  swerves  into  you 
 even  though  you  were  on  the  pathway 
 that's  a  bit  different  likewise  if
[12:15] you're  just  like  you  know  just  minding 
 your  own  business  in  a  shop  and  someone 
 just  hits  you  out  of  nowhere  that's  the 
 difference  but  if  you're  overeating  your
[12:22] calories  every  single  day  you  deserve  to 
 be  fat  and  if  you  deserve  to  be  fat  then 
 you  deserve  to  be  sick  and  if  you 
 deserve  to  be  sick  then  you  deserve  to
[12:28] have  a  higher  risk  of  mortality  this  is 
 the  consequences  of  a  lack  of  discipline 
 and  so  I  think  for  you  it  is  very
[12:35] worthwhile  for  you  to  just  take  a  few 
 seconds  right  now  and  think  about  what 
 you  want  to  deserve  not  what  you  want
[12:42] remember  nobody  gives  a  [ __ ]  what  you 
 want  but  what  you  want  to  deserve  I  want
[12:47] to  deserve  a  six-pack  how  could  I 
 deserve  a  six-pack  of  three  nabs  three
[12:52] or  five  times  a  week  and  I'll  go  on  a 
 calorie  deficit  and  I'll  do  cardio 
 I  want  to  deserve  a  good  healthy
[12:59] relationship  with  a  beautiful  woman  how 
 would  I  deserve  that  first  of  all  I'll
[13:04] deal  with  some  kind  of  problems  that 
 I've  got  internally  I'll  learn  how  to 
 actually  speak  to  people  and  effectively
[13:09] communicate  I'll  learn  how  to  actually 
 be  a  first  of  all  good  partner  I'll 
 learn  what  that  kind  of  woman  this  high
[13:14] quality  woman  would  be  attracted  in  in  a 
 guy  I'll  develop  those  things  myself  and
[13:19] then  I'll  also  try  and  put  my  best  front 
 when  it  comes  to  dating  I'll  stop 
 watching  degenerate  red  pill  content  and
[13:24] I'll  start  embracing  more  faith  and 
 spirituality 
 and  then  when  I  do  meet  the  woman  I'll
[13:29] treat  her  right  very  very  kindly  very 
 lovingly  and  I'll  make  it  so  that  she  is
[13:34] super  happy  with  me
[13:39] doesn't  sound  so  cool  now  does  it  almost 
 sounds  like  a  bit  stupid  and  autistic 
 but  this  is  what  you  want  out  of  life
[13:44] this  is  how  you  get  it  just  make  it  so 
 that  you  deserve  that  thing 
 take  a  second  right  now  is  an  actionable
[13:49] step  to  just  think  of  what  you  want  to 
 deserve  in  life
[13:55] and  your  brain  will  already  start  to 
 work  on  okay  well  here's  how  we  do  it 
 what  I  will  say  is  that  the  greatest
[14:01] reward  of  being  disciplined  is  not  the 
 physique  or  the  money  or  the  girl  in
[14:06] your  arms 
 but  it  is  the  man  that  you  become  I  feel 
 good  being  me  and  I  know  that  there's
[14:13] quite  a  lot  of  guys  watching  this  who  it 
 won't  really  click  in  their  mind  so  I 
 just  want  to  kind  of  explain  this  just
[14:18] watching  this  like  imagine  genuinely 
 waking  up  every  day  and  being  happy  that
[14:25] you  are  you 
 because  for  a  long  time  in  my  life  I 
 couldn't  have  said  this  I  wanted  to  be
[14:30] that  other  guy  I  wanted  to  be  that  guy 
 with  the  real  world  results  I  wanted  to 
 be  the  guy  with  the  six-pack  I  wanted  to
[14:35] be  the  guy  who  you  know  had  the  likes  on 
 Instagram 
 I  would  not  change  myself  for  anyone
[14:41] it's  like  your  own  internal  perception 
 you  start  to  like  yourself  you  start  to 
 respect  yourself  my  brain  is  producing
[14:47] more  and  more  positive  thoughts  about 
 myself  than  ever  think  about  that  my  own 
 mind  is  actually  starting  automatically
[14:54] to  like  say  nice  things  about  me  through 
 the  day  you  know  when  your  brain  wonders 
 when  you're  trying  to  read  and  it  thinks
[14:59] about  something  else  or  it  thinks  about 
 memories  and  stuff  my  brain  mostly  now 
 is  going  to  positive  stuff  certainly  in
[15:06] a  student  light  so  you  know  it's  not 
 like  I'm  just  egotistical  thinking  that 
 I'm  amazing  but  it's  more  that  I've  got
[15:11] like  a  sense  of  bliss  thinking  like  yeah 
 well  done  yeah  awesome  progress  I've 
 been  working  super  hard  I'm  not  thinking
[15:16] yeah  better  than  everyone  else  and  you 
 know  like  oh  I'm  so  amazing  I  don't  need 
 to  learn  anymore  it's  the  exact  opposite 
 I  really  do  think  okay  I  want  to  learn
[15:22] more  what  can  I  learn  how  can  I  improve 
 so  I've  still  got  a  student  mindset  but 
 it's  just  very  positive  and  pleasant  I
[15:27] think  that's  the  best  reward  of 
 discipline  so  far  step  one  ego  before  we
[15:32] can  really  begin  to  get  super 
 disciplined  we  need  to  destroy  your  Rico 
 because  there's  a  reason  why  you're  not
[15:38] going  to  make  any  progress  watching  this 
 there's  a  reason  why  you're  gonna  stay 
 in  the  same  position  I  hope  you  don't 
 but  there  is  gonna  be  a  huge  reason  and
[15:45] it's  purely  ego  it's  ego  because  you 
 think  you're  too  good  for  what  it  will 
 take  to  improve  your  discipline  I
[15:51] guarantee  you  do  you're  thinking  right 
 now  I  don't  know  like  you  know  it's  been 
 made  apparent  in  your  mind  right  now  I
[15:56] guarantee  when  I  tell  you  the  real  way 
 to  increase  your  discipline  you're  gonna 
 think  it's  beneath  you  and  when  you
[16:01] think  that  you  won't  make  any  progress 
 you  need  to  have  an  absolute  like  you 
 remember  the  the  gaming  term  like  Noob
[16:07] you  need  to  have  like  a  noobs  mindset  to 
 discipline  because  most  guys  don't  do
[16:12] this  the  real  way  to  be  disciplined  is 
 not  like  David  Goggins  it's  not  doing 
 this  big  ridiculous  run  you  know  he's
[16:18] he's  decades  into  this  so  that's 
 different  but  it's  not  like  doing  this 
 big  ridiculous  run  or  this  eight  hour 
 workout  you  know  the  super  long  workout
[16:24] with  loads  of  sets  it's  not  like  doing 
 all  these  weird  things  it's  none  of  that 
 the  real  way  to  be  disciplined  is
[16:31] finding  the  easiest  good  habits  that  you 
 consistently  aren't  doing  and  start
[16:37] doing  that  it's  so  uncool  it's  so  boring 
 but  discipline  is  not  that  massive
[16:42] workout 
 it's  cleaning  up  the  mess  on  the  floor 
 it's  like  the  clothes  no  the  one  piece
[16:48] of  clothing  that  you've  had  on  the  floor 
 for  like  the  last  [ __ ]  48  hours  it's 
 picking  that  up  and  putting  it  somewhere
[16:53] discipline  is  taking  those  water  bottles 
 done  like  not  even  drinking  the  plastic 
 water  balls  anyway  but  let's  say  you
[16:58] know  you've  got  water  bottles  in  your 
 room  this  thing's  out  of  place  here 
 discipline  is  literally  just  fixing  that
[17:04] stuff  up  you  know  that  there's  that 
 cringe  piece  of advice  like  oh  make  your 
 bed  you  know  disciplines  making  your  bed
[17:09] and  the  first  route  to  success  or  to 
 changing  the  world  is  to  make  your  bed 
 you  know  why  every  single  military  in
[17:16] every  single  Country  Places  an  emphasis 
 on  things  like  making  your  bed  why
[17:21] really  just  ask  yourself  this  question 
 why 
 because  that's  the  real  discipline  the
[17:27] real  discipline  is  not  charging  into  war 
 and  being  super  heroic  it's  making  your
[17:32] bed  when  you  didn't  want  to  it's  these 
 thousand  acts  of  many  discipline  that 
 other  people  will  ignore  saying  that  oh
[17:38] yeah  it  doesn't  matter  it's  not  that  it 
 doesn't  matter  it's  that  your  ego  is 
 bigger  than  this  task  at  hand  your  ego
[17:44] is  stopping  you  to  improve  if  you  think 
 that  something  doesn't  matter  if  you 
 think  the  Art's  not  going  to  make  a
[17:49] difference  so  I'll  just  cut  the  corner 
 there  that's  because  of  ego  not  that 
 it's  the  objective  truth  of  the  world
[17:54] that  whether  or  not  making  your  bed 
 makes  you  more  disciplined  that  is  your 
 big  fat  ego  that's  stopping  you  from 
 making  progress  you  need  to  start
[18:00] challenging  your  own  brain  you  know 
 people  talk  about  critical  thinking  they 
 talk  about  not  just  taking  like  one
[18:05] piece  of  advice  at  once 
 your  own  brain  convinced  you  to  watch
[18:10] porn  over  a  thousand  times  in  your  life 
 so  your  own  brain  probably  shouldn't  be
[18:15] automatically  trusted  right  think  about 
 this  when  was  the  last  time  your  own 
 mind  convinced  you  to  watch  porn
[18:22] you  know  with  100  objective  Universal 
 fact  that  porn  is  a  bad  thing  your  own
[18:28] brain  convince  you  to  do  it  you're  not 
 as  smart  as  you  think  you  are  right  so 
 when  your  brain  is  telling  you  oh  yeah
[18:33] this  video  is  kind  of  stupid  he's 
 telling  me  to  make  my  bed  he's  telling 
 me  to  pick  up  like  another  clothes  from 
 the  floor  that's  not  going  to  do
[18:38] anything  you  know  I'll  go  watch  another 
 David  Goggins  or  Andrew  Tate 
 motivational  workout
[18:44] maybe  don't  listen  to  your  brain  and 
 maybe  start  with  the  thing  that  will 
 actually  work  look  in  your  rubbish  bin
[18:50] probably  full  right  now  empty  water 
 bottles  around  [ __ ]  all  over  the  floor
[18:55] bed  sheets  not  made  this  is  the  daily 
 Act  of  discipline  so  this  is  exactly 
 what  you  do  to  destroy  your  Rigo  and  to
[19:01] begin  leveling  up  your  discipline  pick 
 one  or  two  of  these  things  that  you  have 
 proven  to  yourself  that  you  usually
[19:07] don't  do  this  is  the  important  part  the 
 small  task  that  I'm  telling  you  to  do 
 consistently  has  to  be  one  that  you  have
[19:14] proven  to  yourself  you  usually  don't  do 
 because  you  don't  like  to  do  it  so 
 discipline  is  not  oh  yeah  I'm  gonna  wake
[19:19] up  and  do  50  push-ups  because  you're 
 gonna  be  motivated  for  that  so  it's  not 
 discipline  discipline  is  looking  around 
 your  room  right  now  and  thinking  to
[19:25] yourself  you  know  what  I've  always  got 
 clothes  on  the  floor  so  clearly  I'm  not 
 disciplined  enough  to  clean  that  up 
 that's  going  to  be  my  new  discipline
[19:31] like  activity  specifically  when  you 
 start  to  do  that  activity  you  need  to 
 know  that  every  single  time  you  do  it
[19:37] you're  not  gonna  want  to  do  it  it's 
 gonna  feel  annoying  there's  gonna  be 
 some  kind  of  like  BS  COPE  in  your  mind
[19:42] whether  it  says  oh  well  you  know  I'll  do 
 it  later  or  I  don't  need  to  do  this 
 anyway  you  know  discipline's  stupid 
 anyway  or  this  is  even  discipline
[19:48] there's  going  to  be  some  kind  of  cope 
 right  because  that's  the  whole  point 
 you're  not  motivated  to  do  it 
 so  you  need  to  almost  be  vigilant  for
[19:54] your  brain  to  start  coping  and  to  start 
 creating  these  excuses  it's  these  small
[19:59] insignificant  things  that  are  the 
 training  ground  for  your  discipline  you 
 know  in  a  video  game  you  start  off  with
[20:04] like  the  small  monsters  a  lot  of  us  in 
 real  life  we  start  off  and  it's  like  we
[20:09] want  to  kill  the  dragon  right  now  but  we 
 can't  because  to  get  up  to  the  dragon  in
[20:14] a  video  game  what  do  you  have  to  do  you 
 have  to  kill  like  10  000  cows  right  you 
 have  to  go  kill  the  cows  then  you  level
[20:19] up  to  little  goblins  then  you  level  up 
 to  the  zombies  then  the  security  guards 
 then  you  level  up  to  like  the  little 
 demon  then  the  big  demon  then  you  level
[20:25] up  to  like  the  hellhound  you  have  to 
 start  off  by  killing  the  level  two  cows 
 this  right  here  when  you  look  around  you
[20:30] this  is  like  the  training  ground  like 
 the  place  that  we  get  XP  in  the  skill  of
[20:35] discipline  you  can  never  think  that 
 you're  above  these  things  you  can  never 
 think  that  you  can  never  think  that
[20:40] you'll  reserve  your  discipline  for  the 
 big  dragon  when  you're  like  level  seven 
 right  now  and  you  need  to  still  keep
[20:45] working  on  these  small  things  it's  very 
 important  that  you  destroy  your  ego  and 
 you  really  start  to  say  to  yourself  you
[20:51] know  what  I'm  actually  not  that  great 
 I'm  not  that  advanced  right  now  I'm  not
[20:56] past  the  point  where  something  like 
 cleaning  up  my  room  wouldn't  help  me  I'm 
 not  past  the  point  with  something  like
[21:02] doing  a  tiny  bit  of  exercise  wouldn't 
 help  me  because  a  lot  of  people  in  this 
 stage  they  get  stuck  because  of  ego  here
[21:09] is  your  actionable  step  for  this  part  of 
 the  guide  pick  one  daily  habit  that  you
[21:14] can  do  one  task  that  you  usually  don't 
 do  that  would  require  discipline  so  it 
 might  be  for  example  wiping  your
[21:20] computer  desk  every  day  and  every  day 
 probably  wouldn't  need  that  right  after 
 you  like  wipe  it  down  today  you  probably
[21:25] wouldn't  really  need  it  tomorrow  but 
 just  do  it  anyway  just  to  get  into  the 
 habit  of  it  or  it  could  be  for  example 
 making  your  bed  every  day  that's  a  nice
[21:30] one  make  your  bed  kind  of  nicely  or  it 
 could  be  for  example  making  sure  that 
 you  don't  have  rubbish  in  your  room  you
[21:35] know  taking  down  the  rubbish  bin  every 
 single  day  it's  very  important  that  you 
 just  start  with  something  small  start
[21:40] with  just  one  habit  and  then  you  can 
 make  it  into  like  a  habit  tracker  like 
 I've  just  got  here  like  you  know  just
[21:45] write  the  days  of  the  month  and  then 
 just  have  that  as  the  habit  and  then  you 
 just  take  it  off  when  you're  done  step 
 two  leveling  up  now  we  want  to  level
[21:51] this  up  so  that  you  actually  start  to 
 accomplish  bigger  goals  because  you  know 
 just  cleaning  up  that  your  room  is  kind
[21:57] of  nice  but  we  really  want  to  like  build 
 something  right  so  let's  talk  about  some 
 big  goals  and  how  you'd  actually  level
[22:02] up  your  discipline  for  example  let's  say 
 building  an  aesthetic  body  like  a  10  out 
 of  10  physique  from  the  gym
[22:08] the  way  to  use  discipline  for  this  is  to 
 figure  out  the  exact 
 constraints  the  micro  task  the  current
[22:16] area  of  weakness  a  specific  task  that 
 you're  lacking  in  so  for  example  with
[22:21] building  a  nice  Physique  in  the  gym  a 
 lot  of  guys  think  it's  like  it's  working 
 out  and  dieting  and  then  they're  trying
[22:26] to  like  discipline  themselves  in  those 
 two  areas  working  out  and  dieting 
 working  out  and  dieting  sure  when  you
[22:31] first  begin  discipline  is  like  going  to 
 the  gym  because  you  might  not  want  to  go 
 to  the  gym  but  after  a  while  you  start
[22:37] liking  the  gym  you  start  being  motivated 
 for  it  so  it's  like  you're  not  using 
 discipline  to  go  to  the  gym  anymore  this
[22:43] is  like  a  very  interesting  point  a  lot 
 of  guys  who  go  to  the  gym  think  that 
 they're  disciplined  but  they're  not
[22:49] because  they're  motivated  for  it  you 
 take  that  same  guy  and  put  them  in  front 
 of  a  computer  and  tell  them  to  do  90
[22:54] minutes  of  deep  work  and  he  can't  so 
 it's  not  about  that  you  know  you're 
 discipline  if  you  go  to  the  gym  if
[22:59] you're  motivated  for  the  gym  then  it's 
 not  disciplined  it's  not  even  like  it's 
 it's  still  difficult  but  it  doesn't
[23:04] require  discipline  because  you  felt  like 
 going  so  let's  say  right  now  you've  been 
 going  to  the  gym  consistently  you've
[23:10] been  making  some  progress  right  you're 
 probably  kind  of  motivated  for  it  right 
 now  which  means  that  your  discipline  is
[23:16] kind  of  saved  for  something  else  most 
 guys  will  just  stop  here  and  wonder  why 
 they're  making  less  gains  as  time  goes
[23:22] on  you  know  you  make  like  the  noob  gains 
 and  then  you  just  kind  of  plateau  after 
 that  most  guys  wonder  why  it's  because 
 you're  not  utilizing  discipline  in  the
[23:28] next  level  The  Next  Step  so  you're 
 consistently  going  to  hit  the  workout 
 but  there's  somewhere  in  the  realm  of
[23:35] Fitness  that  currently  requires  your 
 discipline  which  you're  not  very 
 conscious  of  and  it's  a  very  specific
[23:40] task  that  task  could  be  as  something  as 
 specific  as  making  sure  your  kitchen 
 scale  has  always  got  chargeable
[23:46] batteries  inside  of  it  you  know 
 batteries  that  are  charged  so  it  turns 
 on  because  sometimes  you  might  find  that 
 when  the  battery  dies  you  don't  end  up
[23:52] tracking  your  stuff  for  like  weeks  at  a 
 time  or  it  could  be  for  example  making 
 sure  that  you  fill  up  your  water  bottles
[23:58] at  night  time  and  keep  them  next  to  your 
 bed  so  that  the  exact  moment  that  you 
 wake  up  you  can  start  to  drink  a  lot  of
[24:04] water  and  hydrate  before  your  workout  in 
 the  day  it's  like  these  new  specific 
 habits  require  your  discipline  right  now
[24:10] compared  to  the  big  thing  that  you  used 
 to  like  go  into  the  gym  so  do  you  see 
 this  is  the  way  to  level  up  at  first  we
[24:16] use  discipline  for  some  of  the  core 
 activities  like  you  know  just  eating 
 protein  or  going  to  the  gym  but  soon
[24:21] those  activities  kind  of  feel  like  a 
 little  bit  automated  like  they  become 
 habits  and  they  don't  really  require
[24:26] much  discipline  anymore  most  people  will 
 just  stop  here  what  you  need  to  do  is
[24:31] figure  out  okay  what's  the  next  thing 
 that  I  could  discipline  myself  on  that 
 will  still  get  me  some  results  and  this
[24:36] is  how  like  the  the  concept  of  you  know 
 this  this  less  to  gain  the  more  progress
[24:41] you've  made  at  first  to  make  progress 
 you  just  go  to  the  gym  but  then  after 
 that  you've  got  to  start  tracking  your
[24:46] Macos  after  that  you've  got  to  start 
 tracking  your  micros  after  that  you 
 gotta  like  perfect  your  sleep  you  know
[24:51] there's  less  and  less  and  less  things 
 for  you  to  improve  on  which  is  the 
 nature  of  becoming  an  expert  or  a  master
[24:56] in  your  craft  for  example  another  micro 
 task  could  be  going  straight  to  the  yoga
[25:02] mats  after  you  finish  your  workout 
 grabbing  one  of  the  mats  setting  it  down 
 and  just  stretching  for  like  two  minutes 
 over  the  grand  scheme  of  things  that
[25:08] would  help  you  in  your  goal  of  building 
 this  10  out  of  10  physique  because 
 you'll  be  way  more  like  flexible  and
[25:13] you'll  be  able  to  get  a  better  range  of 
 motion  in  the  lifts  right  so  it's  like 
 that's  a  very  specific  micro  task  that
[25:19] that  is  the  thing  that  would  need 
 discipline  the  exact  moment  when  you 
 finish  a  workout  but  you  stay  even
[25:24] though  you  don't  want  to  even  though  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  you  stay  to  stretch 
 for  a  couple  of  minutes  that's  where  you
[25:29] need  discipline  right  now  it's  these 
 small  micro  tasks  these  little  pockets 
 of  potential  that  you're  leaving  on  the
[25:34] table  because  you're  only  focusing  on 
 the  basics  these  things  seem 
 insignificant  right  now  don't  they  but
[25:40] it  is  these  micro  tasks  that  will  make 
 the  difference  between  you  being  a 
 winner  or  a  loser  five  years  from  now
[25:47] use  your  discipline  for  a  new  micro 
 tasket  for  every  goal  that  you  have  and 
 in  some  time  that  micro  task  will  become
[25:53] a  habit  too  so  for  example  right  now  it 
 would  require  discipline  for  you  to 
 stretch  after  you  work  out  so  like  when
[26:00] you  finish  a  workout  you  don't  feel 
 motivated  it's  a  stretch  you  know  you're 
 making  all  these  excuses  but  then  you 
 say  to  yourself  no  no  I  know  that
[26:06] discipline  means  that  I'm  gonna  have  all 
 these  excuses  I'm  just  gonna  like  turn 
 my  brain  off  and  just  go  and  stretch  for
[26:11] a  few  minutes  after  maybe  a  couple  of 
 weeks  this  will  become  a  habit  and  you 
 might  even  start  to  enjoy  it  so  you
[26:16] might  finish  the  workout  and  just  be 
 used  to  going  to  stretch  at  that  point 
 you're  no  longer  using  discipline  so
[26:22] it's  time  to  find  the  next  micro  task 
 after  that  to  continuously  keep  making 
 progress  in  this  goal  here  is  your
[26:28] actionable  step  for  this  part  of  the 
 guide  figure  out  a  specific  micro  task 
 that  needs  discipline  that  would  get  you
[26:34] some  kind  of  progress  and  a  goal  of 
 yours  and  add  it  up  to  your  habit 
 tracker  and  if  I  was  you  get  the  Habit
[26:40] tracker  and  stick  it  up  on  the  wall  this 
 isn't  just  for  the  video  by  the  way  this 
 has  literally  been  on  my  wall  for  like
[26:45] for  um for  about  a  week  now  and  I  up  if 
 you  know  me  for  a  while  for  my  videos  I 
 always  try  to  show  you  quickly  I  always
[26:52] have  stuff  over  my  wall 
 so  obviously  I've  got  like  the  YouTube 
 Plex  there  but  a  lot  of  the  papers  you
[26:57] can  see  like  those  ones  they've  got  like 
 habit  trackers  they've  got  goals  and 
 everything  like  that  I  really  think
[27:02] that's  an  extra  step  that  you  can  take 
 just  have  a  habit  tracker  if  you  make 
 one  right  now  stick  it  up  add  in  the
[27:09] daily  little  discipline  that  we  had  from 
 the  last  time  you  know  maybe  clean  up 
 your  room  and  then  also  add  some  goal
[27:14] specific  ones  so  let's  say  you've  got 
 three  goals  for  Fitness  the  specific 
 task  could  be  okay  stretch  for  one
[27:19] minute  at  the  end  of  the  workout  for 
 your  work  it  could  be  to  read  three
[27:25] pages  of  a  book  every  single  day  or  it 
 could  be  for  example  to  meditate  or 
 something  and  then  let's  say  for
[27:30] relationships  it  could  be  to  just  hug 
 your  mum  first  thing  in  the  morning  as 
 soon  as  you  see  her  easy  things  right
[27:37] they're  not  actually  that  difficult 
 they're  easy  things  but  there  might  be 
 things  that  you  don't  consistently  do
[27:43] right  now  because  you  don't  really  feel 
 like  it  so  please  remember  this  the  next 
 time  you're  about  to  do  one  of  these
[27:48] tasks  you  will  genuinely  not  want  to  you 
 will  probably  not  be  motivated  your
[27:53] brain  will  probably  start  coping  and 
 saying  I  don't  have  time  I'll  do  this 
 it's  a  bit  awkward  you  know  it'll  start 
 to  cope  just  remind  yourself  that  is  the
[28:00] sign  that  you  are  using  discipline  it's 
 specifically  when  your  brain  is  trying
[28:05] to  convince  you  against  it  which  is 
 awesome  because  now  you're  training  like 
 against  that  weak  part  of  your  mind  that
[28:10] wants  you  to  be  complex  in  a  mediocre 
 and  week  we're  destroying  it  with  our 
 own  intentional  effort  the  next  time
[28:16] that  you  finish  up  a  workout  walk 
 blindly  like  it's  automatically  to  the
[28:21] yoga  mats  get  one  and  literally  just 
 like  do  a  cope  stretch  is  what  I  call  it 
 like  literally  just  like  you  know  just
[28:26] grab  your  knee  or  do  a  little  stretch 
 for  like  30  seconds  because  I  do  is 
 you're  not  trying  to  be  like  some 
 professional  flexible  person  right  now
[28:31] you're  starting  with  this  almost  like  a 
 child  would  and  the  idea  is  if  you  did 
 this  you  know  three  times  a  week  five
[28:37] times  a  week  seven  times  a  week  right 
 now  for  the  next  year  Five  Years  bro  in 
 five  years  time  you're  gonna  be  like  the
[28:42] most  flexible  person  you'll  be  able  to 
 do  or  like  the  weird  [ __ ]  you  know  and 
 like  that  would  genuinely  help  you  you
[28:48] would  genuinely  unlock  your  body  and  be 
 able  to  like  just  work  and  move  so  much
[28:53] better  and  the  same  with  for  example  30 
 seconds  of  meditation  today  you  don't 
 feel  like  it's  kind  of  boring  and  you 
 know  it  drags  on  a  little  bit  but  you
[28:59] start  with  30  seconds  or  a  minute  today 
 and  you  keep  doing  it  even  though  you 
 don't  feel  like  doing  it  for  an  entire
[29:05] year  and  by  the  end  of  the  year  you're 
 probably  used  to  doing  10  minutes  every 
 single  day  which  is  perfect  10  years
[29:11] from  now  you're  meditate  in  20  minutes  a 
 day  30  40  a  one  hour  every  single  day 
 which  is  insane  when  you  compare  that  to
[29:17] like  normal  people  this  is  how  you  get 
 ahead  in  life  it  is  always  these  small
[29:22] micro  Pockets  this  is  how  you  end  up 
 having  like  a  relationship  with  your 
 parents  so  much  better  than  everyone
[29:27] else  are  rich  you  know  everyone's  so 
 individual  and  So  like 
 um  so  against  family  like  almost  no
[29:33] one's  family  orientated  these  days  when 
 you're  the  guy  who  simply  all  you  do  is
[29:38] discipline  yourself  to  just  hug  your 
 parents  every  single  time  you  see  like 
 every  morning  when  you  see  your  parents
[29:43] if  you  live  with  them  I  I  always  hug  my 
 mother  like  it's  not  hard  to  do  it's 
 just  that  often  you  don't  really  feel
[29:49] like  it  you  know  your  brain  tries  to 
 convince  you  that  it's  awkward  or 
 something  it's  a  10  out  of  10  habit  for
[29:54] me  now  it  doesn't  require  discipline  I 
 just  do  it  kind  of  blindly  and  I  saw 
 like  literally  just  saw  the  smile
[30:00] because  it's  morning  time  right  now  I 
 just  saw  the  smile  on  my  mom's  faces 
 always  every  time  I  hug  her  in  the 
 morning  I'm  just  used  to  it  if  you've
[30:06] already  got  some  kind  of  value  from  this 
 video  and  you  think  that  it's  really 
 helping  you  please  just  do  me  a  little 
 favor  do  the  YouTube  algorithm  stuff  I
[30:13] hate  saying  this  but  it  really  does  work 
 so  like  you  know  the  like  in  the 
 comments  and  spam  the  comments  and  share 
 the  link  to  some  friends  if  you  know
[30:19] that  there's  some  people  who  would 
 benefit  from  more  discipline  in  their 
 lives  maybe  you  know  some  guys  who  are 
 on  self-improvements  or  some  guys  who
[30:24] should  be  on  self-improvements  if  you 
 send  this  link  to  a  couple  of  people 
 that  would  be  huge  for  me  and  my  goal
[30:30] with  these  guides  that  I'm  spending  a 
 lot  of  time  on  is  that  even  years  from 
 now  you  keep  mentioning  it  to  people
[30:36] that  would  be  like  the  greatest  gift  you 
 could  ever  give  me  so  you  just  casually 
 just  say  it  to  someone  like  oh  yeah  you
[30:41] should  watch  hamza's  full  discipline 
 guide  that  would  genuinely  bring  like 
 the  biggest  smile  on  my  face  because  if
[30:46] you're  spreading  Word  of  Mouth  to  the 
 people  that  means  that  I've  really 
 produced  something  which  has  contributed
[30:51] to  humanity  which  is  Awesome  chapter 
 three  discipline  in  work  and  studies
[30:57] back  in  June  2023  I'm  about  to  send  my 
 dad  a  message  he's  driving  right  now  but
[31:02] he's  got  someone  in  the  back  seat 
 someone  who  he  doesn't  want  the
[31:09] he's  got  a  woman  in  the  back  seats  and 
 he  has  to  be  polite  to  her
[31:17] he's  a  taxi  driver 
 he  has  to  be  polite  because  that's  his 
 passenger
[31:22] I'm  sending  him  a  message  telling  him  of 
 the  recent  success  that  I've  had  in 
 business  I'm  sending  him  a  screenshot  of
[31:28] the  like  carton  notifications  that  I've 
 been  getting  and  how  much  money  I've 
 been  making
[31:35] a  hundred  thousand  pounds 
 per  month
[31:40] I  tell  him  that  I'm  on  track  for  my  goal 
 of  3  million  this  year
[31:45] and  that  he  doesn't  need  to  drive  the 
 taxi  anymore
[31:52] I'm  getting  flushes  of  the  last  few 
 years  that  I've  dedicated  my  life  to 
 this  goal  of  this  business  this  online
[31:58] income  and  this  was  a  big  moment  for  me 
 and  I'm  thinking  how  awesome  it's  going 
 to  be  he's  going  to  come  home  and
[32:03] together  we'll  take  off  like  the  taxi 
 stickers  that  are  on  the  car  and  I  can 
 record  it  and  I'll  get  a  lot  of  views
[32:10] but  unfortunately  that's  not  what 
 happens 
 because  my  father  doesn't  come  home  as
[32:16] expected 
 he  does  come  home
[32:22] but  as  I  see  the  car  pull  up  into  the 
 driveway
[32:28] the  taxi  stickers  are  already  gone 
 I  was  waiting  there  ready  to  record  the
[32:34] moment  that  we're  going  to  be  taking 
 them  off 
 and  I  asked  him  what  you  already  took 
 them  off
[32:40] it  turns  out  that  the  moment  that  I  sent 
 my  dad  the  text  message  or  the  moment 
 that  he  saw  it
[32:45] he  didn't  even  wait  to  come  home  to  get 
 rid  of  all  of  like  the  signs  that  made 
 it  clear  that  he  was  a  taxi  driver  he
[32:51] pulled  up  at  the  side  of  the  road  and 
 did  it  there 
 and  it  hits  me  that  for  the  last  20
[32:57] years  my  parents  have  dedicated  their 
 lives  to  raising  me  and  my  siblings  and
[33:02] my  dad  has  worked  these  low  status  jobs 
 my  dad  has  sacrificed  status  as  a  man's
[33:07] status 
 to  just  provide  for  the  family
[33:12] and  he 
 was  pained  by  that
[33:17] he  was  agitated  by  it  but  he  just  did  it 
 just  for  the  sake  of  family  my  dad  had  a
[33:23] much  better  job  in  Pakistan  he  had  more 
 of  a  leadership  position  more  of  a 
 manager  inside  of  a  um  like  a  big  paper
[33:31] mill  engineering  position  and  here  in 
 the  UK  he's  he  told  me  from  his  words
[33:36] he's  worked  more  as  a  laborer 
 now  20  years  later  I'm  26  years  old
[33:44] and  I've  finally  been  able  to  pay  it 
 back  there  are  many  people  out  there 
 your  age  who  are  making  an  unbelievable
[33:51] amount  of  money 
 and  one  of  the  first  things  that  the 
 smartest  people  in  this  group  do
[33:57] they  retire  their  family 
 they  pay  their  parents  back  for  the  the
[34:02] effort  and  sacrifice  that  they've  made 
 and  it's  such  a  beautiful  experience
[34:07] it's 
 to  be  a  son  who  retires  his  father  is  a 
 beautiful  experience  I  think  it's  like
[34:12] every  son's  Duty 
 and  it's  gonna  require  discipline
[34:19] because  when  you  look  into  any  of  these 
 genuinely  successful  young  people  the 
 young  people  who  are  literal
[34:25] millionaires  there  is  absolutely  one 
 trait  that  they  have  in  common  they  did 
 hard  work  even  when  they  did  not  feel
[34:32] like  it  but  on  the  other  hand  the  young 
 men  who  lack  discipline  they're  hit  with
[34:37] three  major  pain  points  one 
 they  live  a  life  where  they're  not
[34:43] living  up  to  their  potential 
 they're  always  unfulfilled  two  they're
[34:48] experiencing  the  realities  of  being  a 
 poor  performer  which  means  shitty  jobs 
 not  much  money  in  their  business  poor
[34:56] grades 
 and  maybe  worst  of  all  three  the  people 
 in  their  lives  are  let  down  or  maybe  the
[35:02] people  in  their  lives  are  experiencing 
 extra  stress  to  counteract  their
[35:07] laziness  and  lack  of  discipline 
 you  see  there's  only  really  two  paths  in 
 front  of  you  it's  the  path  of  discipline
[35:14] or  it's  the  path  of  destruction 
 the  cost  of  discipline
[35:20] okay  you've  got  to  wake  up  a  little  bit 
 earlier  you  make  some  coffee  and  you  get 
 to  work  even  though  it  feels  kind  of
[35:25] hard  the  cost  of  lacking  discipline  is 
 your  soul  it's  the  pain  that  when  you 
 fall  in  love  with  a  woman  you're  not
[35:31] successful  enough  to  be  able  to  just 
 retire  her  immediately 
 that  seems  like  a  distant  dream  for  a
[35:38] lot  of  guys  but  it  is  a  reality  for  some 
 imagine  that  moment  when  your  woman
[35:43] still  needs  to  go  to  work  in  a  job  that 
 she  doesn't  want  to  go  to  you  know  if
[35:48] you  meet  a  woman  who  loves  her  work 
 that's  different  let's  say  she's  working 
 some  shitty  job  and  it's  actually 
 starting  to  drain  on  her  let's  say  she
[35:54] gets  pregnant  and  even  six  months  or 
 however  long  three  months  into  the 
 pregnancy  she  still  has  to  go  to  work
[35:59] she  still  has  to  commute 
 now  I  can  be  sat  here  like  you  know 
 being  like  nice  as  everyone  else's  to
[36:04] you  but  I'm  gonna  hit  you  with  some  cold 
 hard  [ __ ]  truths
[36:10] you're  discreasing  your  manhood  if  you 
 can't  provide  for  others 
 if  you  have  a  woman  who  hates  her  job
[36:17] but  still  has  to  go  because  you  weren't 
 disciplined  enough  for  long  enough  in
[36:22] your  life 
 you  should  feel  like  a  [ __ ]  [ __ ] 
 you  should  lock  yourself  in  the  mirror
[36:27] and  actually  think 
 [ __ ]  me  I  wasted  years  of  my  life  doing
[36:32] what  porn  video  games  drinking  drugs 
 right  if  it  was  different  if  it  was  like
[36:37] you  know  you  were  really  working  hard 
 but  you  didn't  end  up  achieving  success 
 that's  the  difference  but  look  into  the
[36:43] [ __ ]  mirror  and  just  be  honest  with 
 yourself  did  you  actually  like  work  to 
 the  level  that  you  should  have  did  you
[36:49] did  you  discipline  yourself  to  the  level 
 that  you  should  have  or  did  you  just 
 keep  coping  and  saying  that  one  hour  of
[36:55] video  games  was  fine  and  now  your  girl 
 has  to  go  work  an  overnight  shift  or  you 
 know  like  she  has  to  work  overtime  on
[37:01] Saturdays  now  your  father's  like  60 
 years  old  and  he's  still  like  stretching 
 along  to  work  and  no  one  will  say  this
[37:06] to  you  by  the  way  no  one  will  actually 
 come  to  you  and  say  like  I  wish  you 
 retired  me  your  father's  probably  not
[37:11] going  to  say  that  to  you  but  they're 
 thinking  that  I  can't  believe  I  raised 
 such  a  weak  son  who  didn't  even
[37:17] understand  the  concept  of  masculinity 
 that  you  provide  your  father  provided
[37:22] for  you  and  here  you  are 
 extra  one  hour  on  video  games  every  day
[37:27] eating  carbs  that  [ __ ]  up  your  brain  and 
 now  you  can't  even  work  well
[37:34] I  don't  mean  to  be  insulting  or 
 aggressive  towards  you  but  I  wish  that 
 someone  spoke  to  me  like  this  because
[37:39] everyone  spoke  to  me  like  a  [ __ ]  when  I 
 was  growing  up  it  was  so  weird  it's  like
[37:44] trust  me  when  I  say  people  are  thinking 
 these  thoughts  but  I'm  growing  up 
 playing  video  games  watching  porn
[37:49] [ __ ]  around  wasting  time  and  only  my 
 father  would  just  kind  of  tell  me  you 
 know  these  are  bad  habits  and  stuff  but
[37:54] he  wouldn't  ever  explain  I  wish  he  sat 
 down  like  maybe  I  would  have  thought  of 
 him  worse  but  I  wish  he  sat  me  down  he
[38:00] said  like  you  shouldn't  be  playing  video 
 games  because  in  10  years  I  wish  that
[38:05] you  would  retire  me  I  wish  that  I'd  stop 
 working  these  shitty  jobs  that  I  hate 
 and  I  hate  my  life  and  I  have  to  drink
[38:11] alcohol  to  be  able  to  sleep  I  wish  in  10 
 years  from  now  you'd  be  able  to  retire 
 me  and  I  don't  believe  you'll  be  able  to
[38:16] do  that  because  you  keep  spending  two 
 three  four  five  hours  a  day  on  video 
 games  I'm  disappointed  in  you  I  wish
[38:22] someone  told  me  that  when  I  was  younger 
 these  days  like  everyone  just  speaks  in 
 such  a  polite  like  nice  way  you  need
[38:28] someone  to  hit  you  with  some  truth  that 
 I  don't  say  this  to  be  an  [ __ ]  I 
 don't  say  this  to  hurt  your  feelings  if 
 I  wanted  to  hurt  your  feelings  I
[38:33] wouldn't  be  making  like  a  guide  like 
 this  where  I've  genuinely  put  my  [ __ ] 
 heart  and  soul  into  this  for  the  last
[38:38] like  two  weeks  and  like  numbed  my  brains 
 of  thinking  how  I  can  help  you  be  more
[38:43] disciplined 
 but  sometimes  especially  for  young  men 
 men  who  are  masculine  you  need  a  bit  of
[38:49] criticism  from  someone  else  you  need 
 another  guy  to  look  at  you  and  just  say 
 like  bro  you're  not  living  to  your 
 potential  so  what  the  [ __ ]  is  the  point
[38:55] in  your  life  now  you  can  start  getting 
 depressed  and  think  that  this  is  gonna 
 trigger  you  and  make  you  worse  or  you
[39:00] can  think  you  know  what  it  is  shameful 
 it  is  absolutely  shameful  for  me  to  be
[39:05] like  a  leech  on  my  family  when  I'm  a 
 young  man  I'm  18  years  old  I'm  20  years 
 old  I  can  work  harder  I  can  figure  it
[39:12] out  and  I  don't  have  to  retire  them 
 right  now  because  that  would  be 
 unreasonable  but  I  could  surely  retire
[39:17] my  parents  after  10  years  from  now  if  I 
 said  that  as  the  plan  right  that's  not 
 so  like  super  unrealistic  I'll  give  you
[39:23] a  like  a  random  tip  when  we  talk  about 
 retiring  parents  people  don't  really 
 explain  it  there's  two  ways  that  you
[39:29] retire  your  parents  one  is  that  you  make 
 like  an  absolute  boatload  of  money  and 
 you  just  essentially  transfer  them  the
[39:35] money  like  a  huge  amount  like  let's  say 
 one  million  dollars  and  they  get  to  live 
 off  that  forever  that  they  don't  have  to 
 think  about  anything  else  that's  very
[39:41] unrealistic  because  that  means  that 
 you've  probably  got  10  million  or  50 
 million  in  the  bank  account  you  can  give 
 them  that  much  so  not  many  guys  will  do
[39:47] that  but  the  other  one  is  that  you're 
 making  a  really  good  amount  of  money 
 every  month  like  for  example  your 
 business  is  making  8  000  or  10  000  a
[39:53] month  which  is  really  high  but  it's 
 possible  and  then  from  that  you  give 
 them  more  than  what  they  need  to  be  able
[39:59] to  pay  off  all  the  bills  so  for  example 
 you  give  your  parents  like  four  thousand 
 dollars  a  month  which  means  that
[40:04] suddenly  they  don't  even  need  to  work 
 anymore  let's  say  it's  like  your  mother 
 right  now  like  how  much  does  she  make 
 two  thousand  dollars  a  month  probably
[40:10] less  for  most  of  the  people  watching 
 this  right  now  probably  way  less  right 
 so  if  you  were  making  five  thousand
[40:15] dollars  a  month  in  your  business  and  you 
 were  able  to  give  your  mother  1.5  K  or 
 2K  suddenly  all  of  her  time  is  freed  she
[40:21] doesn't  need  to  work  the  shitty  job  that 
 she  hates  and  it's  like  this  is  a  very 
 strong  point  for  people  because  this  is
[40:27] when  the  leashes  the  chains  of  Finance 
 get  broken  off  and  they  can  discover  who
[40:32] they  really  are  and  what  they  really 
 want  to  do  with  their  lives  and  it  turns 
 out  you  know  people  still  want  to  work
[40:37] and  be  productive  and  do  something  your 
 mother's  been  working  this  [ __ ]  job  that 
 she  hates  now  it  turns  out  that  she
[40:42] actually  wants  to go  and  volunteer  at 
 this  charity  because  like  one  of  the 
 like  some  friends  or  something  is  there 
 or  there's  like  a  cafe  that  she  really
[40:48] likes  and  she'd  love  to  work  there 
 part-time  so  she's  thrilled  bringing  in 
 a  bit  of  income  but  she  like  really 
 enjoys  it  a  lot  more  it's  not  as
[40:54] stressful  it's  closer  to  home  she 
 doesn't  have  to  commute  and  you've  just 
 gave  her  the  genuine  Gift  of  Life
[41:02] for  two  thousand  dollars  a  month
[41:07] not  bad 
 you  should  not  be  hearing  this
[41:12] and  start  a 
 self-destruct  because  there  are  quite  a 
 lot  of  sensitive  young  people  who  are
[41:18] hearing  this  and  that  they're  just  gonna 
 start  getting  really  really  stressed  out 
 and  stuff  that's  not  going  to  help  you 
 don't  just  start  getting  emotional  at
[41:25] this  start  getting  logical  towards  this 
 start  thinking  to  yourself  you  know  what
[41:30] emotions  aren't  going  to  help  me 
 it's  Logic  power  strength  will
[41:35] discipline  well  what's  going  to  help  you 
 is  the  fact  that  barely  one  percent  of 
 young  men
[41:41] are  interested  in  things  like  this  like 
 if  you  really  just  imagine  yourself 
 right  now  if  you  view  yourself  in  third 
 person  you're  sat  here  watching  a  guide
[41:48] on  discipline  now  if  you  imagine  the 
 people  you  grew  up with  what  are  they 
 doing  right  now  one  of  them  is  genuinely
[41:53] edging  his  dick  right  now  you  know  it 
 the  other  one  is  literally  like  he's 
 still  lying  in  bed  right  now  the  other
[41:58] one  is  watching  some  [ __ ]  TV  or 
 something  the  other  one  is  just  well 
 playing  on  his  little  Xbox  with  his
[42:03] little  stubby  fingers  or  something  he's 
 got  like  a  little  like  oily  fingers  from 
 like  a  little  disgusting  junk  food  he's
[42:08] been  eating  whilst  playing  the  game 
 the  other  one  is  working  some  like  [ __ ] 
 job  that  he  hates  but  he's  spending  all
[42:13] the  money  on  like  some  some  car  that 
 gives  him  a  level  of  validation  so  maybe 
 he  can  get  some  stinky  call  from  when  he
[42:19] goes  to  the  club 
 that's  your  competition  you're  telling 
 me  you  can't  beat  those  guys  your
[42:24] competition  is  literally  guys  who  don't 
 even  exercise  your  competition  is  guys 
 who  genuinely  have  never  even  heard  of
[42:29] the  concept  of  like  meditating 
 that's  your  competition  bro  it's  not
[42:35] that  hard  to  beat  99  of  guys  all  you've 
 got  to  do  is  about  10  push-ups  and  30
[42:40] seconds  of  meditation  today  that's  it 
 then  to  beat  the  one  percent  is
[42:45] ruthlessly  hard  because  guys  in  the  one 
 percent  are  actually  doing  bits  they've 
 already  watched  this  guy  they're  already 
 meditating  for  the  last  year  they've  all
[42:51] got  six  packs  they  all  understand  all 
 these  like  Concepts  and  frames  and 
 mindsets  now  it  gets  hard  but  to  be  99
[42:56] of  guys  bro  and  you  know  to  get  to  like 
 the  equivalent  of  that  might  be  one  or 
 two  or  five  k  in  business  it's  like  just
[43:02] just  do  some  stuff  consistently  for  like 
 two  months  and  ask  for  advice  and  just
[43:08] maybe  get  someone  who's  more  experienced 
 than  you  to  help  you  and  to  give  you 
 some  kind  of  Direction  and  just  do  it 
 for  about  an  hour  a  day  for  like  two
[43:14] months  three  months  when  you  go  down 
 this  path  of  discipline  what  you'll 
 realize  is  you'll  start  to  get  this
[43:19] weird  peaceful  Blissful  experience  which 
 kind  of  like  it  reminds  you  it  it  shows
[43:25] you  you  know  the  concept  of  your 
 potential  you  always  heard  this  in 
 school  and  Instagram  little  quotes  uh
[43:31] live  to  your  potential  do  you  know  your 
 potential  your  potential  eventually  goal 
 potential  when  you  start  to  dedicate
[43:36] yourself  to  discipline  and  really  don't 
 [ __ ]  yourself  you  really  become
[43:41] disciplined  in  the  areas  that  you  didn't 
 want  to  like  you  kind  of  want  to  but  you 
 know  you  don't  feel  like  it  you're  not 
 motivated  and  stuff  you  really  start  to
[43:47] do  hardship  I  didn't  want  to  sit  down 
 for  this  [ __ ]  video  right  now  I 
 didn't  want  to  I've  already  done  three
[43:52] hours  of  deep  work  today  my  brain  was 
 kind  of  hurting  and  for  like  a  like  a 
 break  like  a  vacation  I  closed  my  eyes
[43:58] and  did  some  deep  breaths  and  now  I'm 
 here  now  I'm  recording  for  like  a  solid 
 probably  two  hours  whilst  I'm  here
[44:05] and  it  feels  phenomenal  because  as  I'm 
 doing  this  there's  no  thoughts  in  my
[44:10] mind  I've  challenged  myself  today  so  I 
 get  a  free  flow  State  this  is  the 
 happiest  like  a  human  can  be  is  when
[44:16] you're  experiencing  flow  and  there's  no 
 thoughts  in  my  mind  I  don't  need  to  fake 
 it  you  know  I'm  not  like  like  some
[44:21] people  will  pretend  that  they're  happy 
 with  their  work  and  they'll  show  you 
 like  a  fake  smile  I  don't  need  to  show 
 you  like  a  massive  big  smile  I  am
[44:27] totally  and  utterly  like  content  and 
 almost  slightly  like  enlightened  in  this 
 exact  second  right  now  because  of
[44:32] discipline  because  I've  put  the  hard 
 work  in  to  be  here  today  so  I'm  in  like 
 a  flow  as  I  deserve  the  moment  that  I'm
[44:39] done  recording  this  I'm  gonna  feel 
 phenomenal  I've  accomplished  more  in 
 this  morning  than  I  used  to  genuinely
[44:46] over  an  entire  month 
 it's  10  A.M
[44:51] I  woke  up  at  five 
 it's  awesome  living  like  this  now  I  want
[44:58] to  talk  about  some  specific  strategies 
 that  you  can  use  to  use  discipline  in 
 your  work  and  your  studies  step  3.1  wake
[45:05] up  early  now  either  choose  to  wake  up 
 early  or  to  stay  up  late  but  I  think
[45:10] that  you  should  have  either  one  of  these 
 extreme  like  this  pocket  of  window  very
[45:15] early  in  the  day  or  very  late  at  night 
 where  no  one  can  contact  you  and  that's 
 when  you  can  work  on  something  which  is
[45:21] really  really  important  this  is  building 
 up  to  the  most  important  productivity 
 tactic  that  I  could  be  telling  you  about
[45:26] you  must  have  a  few  hours  of  the  day 
 where  no  one  will  contact  you  when  no
[45:31] one's  awake  but  it's  just  kind  of  you 
 with  some  silent  enthusiasm  working  on 
 something  that's  super  hard  and  like  you
[45:37] know  the  hardest  task  possible  and  it 
 like  100  trust  me  that  I  highly  doubt
[45:42] that  you  could  do  this  in  the  middle  of 
 the  day  and  you  need  to  wake  up  early  4 
 AM  5  AM  6  a.m  or  you  stay  up  late
[45:47] midnight  1am  something  like  that  you  can 
 choose  which  one  it  is  some  people  are
[45:52] way  more  night  owls  and  they  do  a  really 
 good  work  there  somebody  people  are  way 
 better  in  like  the  morning  time  I'm  way
[45:58] better  in  the  morning  what  I  will  say  is 
 I  do  genuinely  think  the  morning  is 
 better  for  pretty  much  everyone  because
[46:03] when  you  stay  up  late  you  do 
 automatically  experience  problems 
 there's  more  people  who  are  still  awake
[46:08] at  11  o'clock  even  midnight  you  can't 
 drink  coffee  or  caffeine  or  anything  if
[46:13] you  see  any  bright  lights  or  you  know 
 any  lights  from  your  computer  past  about 
 10  pm  it  really  does  start  to  [ __ ]  up
[46:19] your  mental  health  like  Andrew  huberman 
 talks  about  this  a  lot  that  if  you  look 
 into  the  computer  or  phone  past  10  pm  or
[46:25] 11  pm  it  starts  to  produce  like 
 depressive  symptoms  inside  of  you 
 because  it's  totally  unnatural  to  see
[46:30] light  at  that  time  when  you  wake  up 
 early  at  five  and  you  see  light  it's 
 absolutely  fine  it's  actually  kind  of
[46:35] healthy  so  I  heavily  prefer  morning  time 
 but  if  for  example  I  was  someone  who 
 genuinely  could  not  wake  up  early  but  I
[46:42] feel  fantastic  at  11  or  midnight  or  1am 
 I  would  still  do  that  I  would  be  pushing
[46:47] that  and  literally  like  be  up  at  a  time 
 where  everyone  else  is  asleep  where  you
[46:52] don't  reply  to  any  messages  so  that  you 
 can  do  the  hardest  task  possible  I  do  my 
 absolute  best  work  as  early  as  possible
[46:59] in  the  day  so  right  now  I  wake  up  at 
 five  and  my  deep  work  task  is  between 
 five  and  eight  am  so  in  cases  you  want
[47:05] to  copy  me  you  want  to  take  any  of  my 
 ideas  here's  my  current  exact  routine  at
[47:10] 8pm  I  shut  everything  down 
 non-negotiable  I  don't  care  if  I'm  on  a 
 call  if  I'm  doing  anything  at  8pm
[47:15] everything  is  shut  down  that's  when  I'll 
 go  and  do  my  nighttime  routine  and  you 
 know  brush  my  teeth  I'll  Frost  my  teeth
[47:20] and  stuff  set  up  my  room  and  everything 
 set  up  tomorrow  for  um  for  work  and 
 everything  then  I'll  get  into  bed
[47:25] and  I  just  read  like  sideways  lying  down 
 the  whole  room  is  dark  but  I  have  a
[47:30] Kindle  which  is  on  the  lowest  brightness 
 and  when  you  read  like  literally  to  the 
 point  that  your  eyes  closed  you  have
[47:35] perfect  sleep 
 I  usually  fall  asleep  for  about  8  30  p.m 
 maybe  sometimes  about  9pm  and  I  wake  up
[47:42] usually  5  a.m  like  on  the  dot  just  by 
 myself  wake  up  first  10  minutes  15
[47:47] minutes  I'm  just  quickly  just  going  to 
 the  toilet  drinking  some  water  go 
 downstairs  and  I'll  look  at  bright  light 
 like  I'll  look  at  the  the  sunlight  right
[47:53] now  this  sun  which  is  out  at  like  5  a.m 
 so  I'm  getting  that  into  my  eyes  Andrew 
 huberman  says  it's  good  then  at  about  5
[47:59] 50  and  I  come  up  and  I  literally  just  do 
 deep  work  till  8  A.M  so  I'm  working  on
[48:04] the  full  guides  for  the  script  and 
 everything  it's  like  a  very  mentally 
 demanding  super  hard  task  no  one  can
[48:09] disturb  me  no  one's  awake  I'm  not 
 checking  messages  no  one's  awake  in  my 
 house  so  I'm  just  working  on  that  this
[48:15] is  how  you  move  the  needle  so  there's  a 
 phrase  that  I  want  to  tell  you  which 
 means  a  lot  to  me  it's  called  Eat  the
[48:22] Frog  the  idea  is  I  think  some 
 philosopher  or  something  made  this  but 
 the  idea  is  that  if  you  eat  the  Frog
[48:27] first  the  hardest  thing  if  you  do  the 
 most  gross  thing  the  hardest  thing  first 
 then  the  rest  of  the  day  is  going  to  be
[48:33] easier  and  better  most  people  do  the 
 opposite  thing  they've  got  something 
 hard  that  they  really  don't  have
[48:38] motivation  for  and  they'll  keep  pushing 
 it  on  pushing  it  later  later  until
[48:43] eventually  it's  like  their  entire  day 
 has  just  been  kind  of  like  stressed  out 
 by  that  thing  that  they're  pushing  later
[48:48] and  sometimes  they  don't  even  get  it 
 done  so  you  wake  up  and  you  do  the 
 hardest  thing  straight  away  whilst  your
[48:54] brain's  really  fresh  and  then  you've  got 
 like  an  easier  day  after  that 
 so  when  I  wake  up  I  focus  entirely  on
[49:00] these  full  guides  because  that's  like  my 
 main  thing  that's  like  the  hardest  thing 
 I  could  possibly  be  doing  and  I'll  just
[49:05] be  scripting  the  video  I'll  be 
 researching  it  I'll  be  editing  my  script 
 and  everything  and  then  I  record  the
[49:10] full  guide  as  well  this  is  the  real  me 
 time  this  is  when  I  wake  up  no  one  can
[49:15] bother  me  and  I  can  focus  on  dedicating 
 myself  to  my  craft  and  I  really  think
[49:20] that  I'm  moving  things  along  and  so  you 
 can  copy  this  so  the  first  thing  you've 
 got  to  do  is  figure  out  are  you  going  to 
 be  a  morning  person  or  a  nighttime
[49:26] person  I  really  think  you  need  to  be  one 
 and  I  think  the  more  extreme  that  you 
 can  push  the  time  the  better  if  you  can
[49:33] wake  up  at  like  4am  or  5am  and  then 
 start  to  adjust  you  know  the  rest  of 
 your  life  to  it  the  sleep  schedule  and
[49:39] everything  to  it  fantastic  if  you  can 
 stay  up  1am  or  2  2  A.M  and  you  can
[49:44] really  really  get  good  work  done  and 
 you're  not  coping  and  you  don't  get 
 distracted  and  no  one's  messaging  you
[49:49] and  you  can  like  you  know  stay  awake  at 
 that  time  then  do  that  you  should  have 
 one  of  these  Pockets  the  next  thing  is
[49:54] and  this  is  the  actionable  step  figure 
 out  what  you  you'll  eat  the  Frog  task  is
[50:00] what  is  the  single  greatest  hardest 
 highest  leverage  task  for  your  work  or
[50:05] your  studies 
 for  a  YouTuber  for  example  it's  not  you 
 know  changing  the  channel  Banner  it's
[50:11] not  like  commenting  on  videos  it's 
 simply  just  like  recording  the  video  and 
 maybe  scripting  the  video  that's  like
[50:16] the  hardest  highest  leverage  thing  out 
 there  for  a  YouTuber  so  this  is  what  I 
 do  in  that  first  pocket  of  the  day  if
[50:22] you're  a  nighttime  person  then  you  do 
 this  right  at  the  end  or  for  example 
 let's  say  you  are  an  author  you  could  be
[50:28] messaging  people  you  could  be  writing 
 emails  you  could  you  know  be  sending 
 shout  outs  to  people  or  something  but
[50:33] the  hardest  task  that  eat  the  Frog  of  an 
 author  what  do  you  think  it  is  literally 
 just  writing  words  down  on  a  page  that's
[50:40] the  hardest  task  so  if  you're  an  author 
 you'd  wake  up  and  you  do  that  as  fast  as 
 possible  or  you'd  stay  up  late  and  you
[50:46] do  that  you  get  the  drift  the  point  is 
 that  there's  a  certain  task  for  your 
 work  and  for  your  studies  that  is  super
[50:52] high  leverage  but  it's  really  hard  and 
 that's  the  thing  that  you  should  be 
 doing  in  these  like  pockets  of  time  if
[50:58] you're  a  student  for  example  you  might 
 think  that  oh  yeah  mine  is  studying  for
[51:03] example  needs  to  be  way  more  specific  it 
 can't  just  be  studying  because  then  it's 
 like  you  know  you  can  you'll  just  cope
[51:08] right  because  you  won't  have  a  plan  it 
 needs  to be  a  specific  task  as  specific 
 as  for  example  practicing  the  exam
[51:15] questions  so  you've  got  an  upcoming  exam 
 you've  got  like  a  list  of  all  the 
 questions  that  they've  had  over  the  last
[51:21] five  years  at  Five  AM  you  wake  up  and 
 you  practice  the  exam  questions  for  90 
 minutes  that's  that  is  a  good  deep  work
[51:28] task  right  there  Alex  hamosi  is  a 
 entrepreneur  like  a  YouTuber  who's  got  a 
 bunch  of  subscribers  and  he  spoke  about
[51:35] how  he  ended  up  getting  really  really 
 good  grades  in  college  he  literally  just 
 practiced  the  exam  questions  over  and
[51:40] over  and  over  again  so  that  when  it  came 
 to  the  exam  he  had  already  practiced  the 
 questions  that  come  up  anyway  so  we  just
[51:45] breathe  through  them  that's  a  very  high 
 leverage  task  a  lot  of  students  cope  and 
 they  say  like  you  know  their  task  is
[51:50] just  going  to  be  studying  they  end  up 
 sitting  there  they're  distracted  they 
 don't  know  what  they're  doing  they'll
[51:55] read  a  bit  of  the  book  but  it's  boring 
 it's  not  even  high  leverage  it's  very 
 important  you  have  a  specific  task  that
[52:00] you'll  focus  on  I  will  tell  you  that 
 I've  been  on  self-improvement  full  time 
 for  the  past  three  years  I  haven't  had  a
[52:06] job  other  than  YouTube  and  so  I've 
 literally  had  the  beautiful  opportunity 
 to  like  be  full-time  on  my
[52:12] self-improvements 
 and  I  will  tell  you 
 that  this  is
[52:18] a  10  out  of  10  productivity  tactic  wake 
 up  early  stay  up  late  whichever  one  and
[52:24] work  on  that  Harvest  task  eat  the  Frog 
 that's  what  I  have  in  this  habit  tracker 
 behind  me  I  have  5  am
[52:31] sunlight 
 eat  the  Frog  that's  the  three  things  I 
 do  first  and  then  I've  got  like  my  the
[52:36] rest  of  my  morning  routine  as  well  this 
 will  be  hard  when  you  sit  down  to  try 
 and  do  one  of  these  tasks  it's  always
[52:41] like  quite  brutally  hard  it's  like 
 you're  trudging  through  deep  snow  it's
[52:46] hard  there's  always  a  bit  of  a  struggle 
 you  don't  really  want  to  do  it  but  as 
 you  get  about  20  minutes  or  30  minutes
[52:51] into  one  of  these  hard  like  frog  tasks 
 that's  when  you  start  to  feel  a  lot 
 better  like  I  am  right  now  when  I  was
[52:58] having  a  shower  before  this  I  was 
 literally  thinking  like  you  know  Kobe  do 
 I  want  to  record  this  I  can't  be 
 bothered  what  if  I  do  after  the  gym  what
[53:03] if  I  do  you  know  this  all  these  thoughts 
 the  first  like  10  minutes  or  so  of 
 recording  this  video  I  was  feeling  a
[53:08] little  bit  like  I  don't  know  groggy  not 
 really  feeling  it  now  it's  fine  you've 
 just  got  to  fight  the  struggle  that  will
[53:13] inevitably  arise  with  a  task  like  this 
 hard  and  this  is  really  I'm  gonna  be
[53:18] honest  this  is  where  the  success  is 
 built  because  you  see  how  hard  you  can 
 imagine  how  hard  this  is  I'm  telling  you
[53:24] to  either  wake  up  early  or  to  stay  up 
 late  which  means  that  you've  got  to  kind 
 of  dedicate  your  life  around  this  and
[53:29] then  I'm  telling  you  to  work  on  the 
 super  hardest  task  possible  the  highest 
 level  average  task  everyone  else  is
[53:35] doing  the  exact  opposite  everyone  else 
 is  spending  their  time  doing  like  the 
 pointless  tasks  which  aren't  so
[53:40] important  and  the  hard  really  important 
 task  they're  pushing  that  off  to  like 
 you  know  until  the  later  of  the  day  till
[53:46] they're  tired  and  it's  less  of  a 
 priority  and  they're  doing  other  things 
 first  they're  going  to  the  gym  first
[53:52] this  is  how  you  get  ahead  of  everyone 
 else  you  prioritize  that  big  task  and
[53:57] you  try  and  do  it  first  thing  in  the  day 
 when  no  one  can  message  you  and  do  all 
 this  with  the  vibe  of  enthusiasm  and
[54:02] enjoyment  because  you're  building  your 
 dream  life  and  you're  not  just  building 
 your  dream  life
[54:07] this  is  the  dream  life  when  you  imagined 
 your  dream  life  and  you  thought  of  you
[54:12] know  the  life  that  you  wanted  to  live 
 oftentimes  we've  been  influencing 
 brainwashed  by  media  by  school  by  you
[54:17] know  like  people  that  we  know  and 
 influencers  and  even  like  the  red  pill 
 like  like  based  guys  have  influenced  us
[54:23] to  think  that  we  need  this  Bugatti  or 
 this  this  apartment  or  you  know  like  be 
 a  high  value  man  and  stuff  when  you  take
[54:28] all  that  [ __ ]  aside  when  you  really 
 think  about  your  dream  life  in  some  way 
 you  probably  did  think  about  the  fact
[54:34] that  you'd  be  working  hard  on  some  kind 
 of  project  that  meant  a  lot  to  you 
 because  if  you  think  that  you  know  the
[54:40] dream  life  is  you  just  kind  of  retiring 
 and  having  enough  money  I  have  to  say 
 you're  quite  immature  and  foolish  not
[54:45] not  in  a  insulting  way  it's  just  because 
 you  haven't  experienced  life  anyone 
 who's  experienced  life  especially  as  a
[54:50] man  knows  if  once  you  make  a  [ __ ]  ton  of 
 money  and  you  can  pretty  much  retire  you 
 don't  because  it's  boring  as  [ __ ]  you
[54:56] need  some  kind  of  purpose  fulfillments 
 right  so  it's  like  this  already  was 
 going  to  be  the  the  dream  life  for  us
[55:03] and  we  can  have  it  today  we  can  have 
 something  that  we  can  work  hard  on  that 
 contribute  to  humanity  that  also  gets  us
[55:08] to  the  point  that  we  can  start  to 
 provide  for  our  families  a  year  or  so 
 ago  I  remember  being  on  Instagram  and
[55:14] there  was  an  Instagram  reel  of  like  a 
 basketball  player  who  was  like  um  you 
 know  saying  this  like  motivational
[55:19] quotes  and  he  said  those  days  where  you 
 wake  up  early  and  you  work  hard  those 
 days  when  you  stay  up  late  and  you  work
[55:25] hard  those  are  actually  the  dream 
 which  is  super  like  I  remember  watching
[55:30] that  I  think  that's  actually  so  true  my 
 Instagram's  I  don't  know  if  my 
 Instagram's  Linked  In  the  description 
 you  can  follow  me  if  you  want  I  don't
[55:35] even  post  on  it  but 
 um  and  it's  very  true  the  dream  is  not 
 the  subscribers  it's  not  the  car  it's
[55:40] not  the  number  in  your  bank  account  it's 
 just  working  on  something  that  actually
[55:45] means  a  lot  to  you  if  you  disagree  right 
 now  you  might  be  working  on  the  wrong
[55:50] thing  you  might  be  for  example  either 
 being  forced  or  you're  maybe  forcing 
 yourself  to  work  on  something  that  you
[55:56] don't  actually  care  about  you're  only 
 doing  it  for  the  external  validation  the 
 results  this  is  why  it's  very  important
[56:03] to  slow  down  for  a  second  and  you  know 
 your  response  to  everything  I've  been 
 saying  here  if  it  seems  kind  of
[56:08] depressive  of  like  oh  man  I've  got  to 
 work  hard  on  this  task  you  know  it's 
 going  to  be  [ __ ]  and  stuff  but  you  know
[56:13] maybe  I'll  eventually  make  money  it's 
 probably  the  wrong  thing  for  you  because 
 the  right  task  is  gonna  be  the  kind  of
[56:19] one  where  it's  still  super  difficult  but 
 you're  actually  thinking  man  a  life  of 
 me  waking  up  early  and  working  on  that
[56:25] that  would  actually  be  a  pretty  good 
 life  it  would  be  hard  and  of  course  I 
 want  other  parts  of  my  life  too  but  I
[56:31] would  actually  like  enjoy  that  like  that 
 would  be  good  for  me  that  would  be  good 
 for  the  world  oftentimes  many  young  men
[56:37] they  choose  the  work  they  choose  the 
 studies  which  they  don't  actually  feel 
 intrinsically  motivated  or  or  internally
[56:45] pull  towards  rather  than  you  just  choose 
 whatever  like  your  latest  red  pill
[56:50] influencer  has  been  telling  you  what  I 
 highly  suggest  if  you're  relating  to 
 this  right  now
[56:55] close  off  everything  for  a  little  while 
 and  just  kind  of  you  know  don't  use  your 
 phone  just  for  a  few  minutes
[57:00] and  just  kind  of  sit  silently  and  just 
 ask  yourself  what  do  you  really  want  and 
 question  that  and  maybe  Journal  it  and
[57:06] think  to  yourself  okay  where  have  these 
 desires  formed  into  my  mind  why  do  I 
 want  to  be  rich  and  just  it  sounds  like
[57:11] a  stupid  question  but  ask  it  and  you 
 won't  want  to  write  it  down  I  guarantee 
 you'll  be  too  much  of  a  [ __ ]  to  admit
[57:16] this  but  you'll  say  that  you  want  to  be 
 rich  just  because  Andrew  Tate  talked 
 about  being  rich  that's  it  that  was  the 
 only  reason  why  if  he  didn't  and  if
[57:22] other  people  didn't  you  the  concept  of 
 being  rich  might  have  never  formed  in 
 your  mind  because  that  wasn't  what  your
[57:27] purpose  was  supposed  to  be  as  a  man  you 
 hear  so  much  about  purpose  none  of  these 
 guys  online  know  about  purpose  purpose
[57:32] isn't  about  becoming  the  successful 
 high-level  man  who  wears  a  [ __ ]  shirt 
 pretends  he's  Andrew  Tate  does  the
[57:37] [ __ ]  [ __ ]  sign  and  then  smokes  a 
 cigar  that's  not  purpose  purpose  is 
 detaching  away  from  everything  being  in
[57:43] solitude  or  with  some  good  man  which  you 
 probably  have  not  even  met  just  yet 
 being  in  a  complete  Solitude  and  really
[57:48] investigating  the  reason  for  why  you 
 [ __ ]  exist  and  it  will  probably  not 
 be  related  to  anything  that  you  see
[57:53] these  guys  showing  you  these  male  role 
 models  showing  you  this  life  of 
 hedonistic  this  materialistic  degenerate
[57:59] showing  you  that  oh  here  I  I'm  in  Dubai 
 and  you  know  I'm  sleeping  with  lots  of 
 girls  but  you  know  if  a  woman  sleeps
[58:05] around  then  she's  a  hoe  but  I  can  sleep 
 around  you  know  she's  damaged  if  she 
 sleeps  around  but  I  can  damage  her  by  my
[58:10] course  the  Hustler's  University  you  know 
 people  are  [ __ ]  doing  this  [ __ ] 
 online  the  more  you  watch  that  kind  of
[58:15] content  or  content  in  general  the  more 
 that  your  brain  and  your  heart  will  be 
 polluted  with  weird  new  desires  that
[58:21] weren't  ever  your  own  you  must  spend 
 some  time  away  from  everything 
 and  detach  and  slow  down
[58:29] and  slowly  you'll  start  to  figure  out 
 what  you  really  want 
 but  you're  a  [ __ ]
[58:35] so  what  you  really  want  isn't  as  cool  as 
 what  Andrew  Tate  wants  and  you'll
[58:40] prioritize  his  desire  into  your  own 
 heart  and  mind  instead  of  your  own
[58:45] when  you  hear  about  this  concept  of 
 purpose  it's  all  about  finding  out  what 
 is  internally  right  for  you  and  so  many
[58:52] young  men  have  given  up  their  purpose  to 
 just  go  follow  the  desire  of  the  latest 
 celebrity
[58:58] it's  a  very  shameful  way  to  live
[59:04] perhaps  I  should  have  said  this  before 
 you  even  wake  up  early  before  you  know
[59:09] we  try  and  figure  out  this  frog  task  for 
 you  to  eat  the  Frog 
 we  have  to  make  sure  that  you're  on  the
[59:15] right  track  to  begin  with 
 this  will  come  from  making  sure  that
[59:20] there's  no  desires  that  are  external 
 there's  no  influence  by  these  other
[59:25] people  these  creators  this  validation 
 seeking  that  you  get  from  Instagram 
 it's  awesome  for  example  to  go  build
[59:31] your  your  body  it's  awesome  to  go  to  the 
 gym  and  train  hard  but  if  you're 
 training  hard  to  get  the  Instagram  Likes
[59:37] it's  probably  not  a  good  thing  if  you're 
 training  hard  to  get  more  likes  on 
 Tinder  like  I  was  for  a  very  long  time
[59:42] it's  probably  not  a  good  thing  if  you 
 detach  away  from  all  of  that  and  you 
 pretend  like  none  of  that  exists  and  you
[59:47] are  just  here  empty  in  this  room  for  a 
 few  minutes 
 you'll  start  a  really  like  question
[59:54] things  and  you'll  be  so  scared  of  doing 
 that  because  you  were  on  the  path  to 
 gain  validation  from  other  people  as  you
[60:00] you  know  you  started  to  fulfill  someone 
 else's  desires  the  truth  is  their 
 validation  is  [ __ ]  useless
[60:06] so  it's  valuable  for  you 
 as  an  extra  actionable  step  for  this 
 video  that's  unplanned
[60:12] spend  maybe  10  minutes  maybe  five 
 minutes  maybe  preferably  a  couple  of 
 days  zero  technology  zero  words  spoken
[60:20] from  your  mouth  to  anyone  else 
 pen  piece  of  paper 
 sit  there  look  at  your  wall  talk  out
[60:25] loud  and  ask  yourself  questions  of  like 
 why  do  I  desire  where  did  this  come  from
[60:30] no  no  I  know  that  Andrew  Tate  made  a 
 good  good  reason  but  like  where  did  it 
 come  from  it  came  from  a  tape  podcast  oh
[60:35] it  came  from  a  red  pill  podcast  yep  I 
 was  watching  another  one  of  those 
 useless  podcasts  with  the  angry  men  come
[60:40] on  and  they  Shout  at  the  the  women  for 
 being  hoes  and  then  the  same  men  talk  to
[60:45] those  women  afterwards  and  try  and  sleep 
 with  them 
 that's  where  my  desire  came  from  and
[60:50] that's  where  I'm  dedicating  my  life  to 
 when  you  say  it  out  loud  like  that  you 
 feel  like  a  [ __ ]  idiot  don't  you
[60:57] instead  your  desires  should  form  from 
 the  inside  and  they  should  be  related  to
[61:02] like  your  Soul's  purpose  here  on  Earth 
 this  is  how  you  get  into  spirituality 
 I'm  very  new  to  this  myself  but  I  think
[61:08] that  this  is  the  better  way  this  is  the 
 only  way  to  live  otherwise  you're  just 
 wasting  your  life
[61:14] because  we  know  that  achieving  these 
 external  things  we  know  that  that 
 doesn't  lead  to  happiness  or  fulfillment
[61:19] we  know  this  right  you  don't  even  need 
 me  to  like  question  this  we  know  for  a 
 fact 
 that  when  you  get  the  house  or  the  car
[61:25] that  every  rich  guy  says  this  when  you 
 buy  the  house  of  the  car  it's  like 
 nothing  going  what  look  at  the  video 
 Iman  moved  into  his  place  in  Dubai  look
[61:31] at  his  face  when  he  explains  yeah  like 
 he's  bored  the  take  buys  the  new  car  and
[61:36] he's  super  happy  driving  it  and  then 
 watch  how  he  talks  about  it  the  next 
 time  it's  like  it's  boring  when  you  get
[61:41] these  like  little  materialistic  toys 
 it's  boring  it  doesn't  add  anything  to 
 your  life  and  imagine  sacrificing  a  year
[61:47] of  your  life  for  that  little  [ __ ] 
 like  Smile  as  you  drive  in  this  car  that 
 you've  you've  wasted  like  a  year  of  your
[61:53] life  you  haven't  hugged  one  of  your  like 
 family  members  for  a  while  like 
 instead  very  important  detach  figure  out
[62:00] your  real  purpose  figure  out  your  real 
 desires  I  know  that  this  is  going  off 
 topic  here  I  probably  should  have
[62:05] mentioned  I  should  mention  this  almost 
 every  video  because  there's  no  point  in 
 living  if  you're  on  someone  else's 
 trajectory  there's  a  few  quotes  that  I
[62:11] really  like  days  are  made  of  mornings 
 and  lives  are  made  of  days
[62:17] in  the  morning  win  at  life 
 I  really  think  that's  the  case  if  you
[62:22] start  your  day  with  an  awesome  morning 
 morning  routine  hard  work  the  specific
[62:27] task  that  means  a  lot  to  you  which  is 
 super  hard  to  do  and  you  just  do  it  to 
 the  best  that  you  can  not  expecting  it
[62:32] to  be  perfect  struggling  with  it  losing 
 your  attention  but  just  you  know 
 sticking  to  it  doing  it  anyway  doing  it
[62:37] anyway  waking  up  early  every  single  day 
 doing  that 
 you're  starting  each  day  perfect  that
[62:43] usually  translates  into  a  way  better  day 
 than  you  know  where  you  can  up  late  or 
 anything  and  your  whole  life  is  just
[62:49] made  up  of  these  days 
 so  it  sounds  weird  but  like  the  way  to 
 live  a  good  life  is  just  to  have  like  a
[62:56] good  morning  routine 
 there's  a  lot  of  power  in  that  so  an 
 actionable  step  for  you  right  now  is  to
[63:03] add  on  to  your  habit  tracker  something 
 like  either  wake  up  early  or  eat  the 
 Frog  I've  just  wrote  eat  the  Frog  oh
[63:08] I've  got  both  I've  got  5am  and  I've  got 
 eat  the  Frog 
 and  this  way  you're  gonna  hold  yourself 
 accountable  and  if  you  stuck  this  up  on
[63:15] your  wall  it's  very  obvious  you  can't 
 escape  it  so  that's  why  I  love  sticking 
 up  these  papers  like  this  on  my  wall
[63:20] this  is  the  route  to  self-mastery  it's 
 allocating  time  to  the  hardest  task  you
[63:27] could  possibly  be  doing  and  usually  that 
 means  waking  up  early  which  is  such  a 
 blissful  experience  and  I'm  actually
[63:32] excited  for  you  if  you  haven't  already 
 to  get  into  this  step  3.2  excellence  in
[63:38] all  areas  if  you're  okay  with  dust 
 piling  up  on  your  desk  then  you'll  be 
 okay  with  tasks  piling  up  in  your  to-do
[63:45] list  if  you're  okay  with  leaving  things 
 out  of  place  then  you'll  probably  be 
 okay  with  setting  an  email  with  a
[63:51] spelling  mistake  if  you're  okay  with 
 leaving  the  gym  before  you've  actually 
 finished  your  workout  you'll  be  okay
[63:57] with  cutting  Corners  in  your  studies  or 
 your  work  and  the  results  that  you  get
[64:02] in  life  will  show  but  more  than  that  you 
 will  know  you  will  know  that  you  are  a
[64:07] messy  room  kind  of  entrepreneur  I 
 learned  of  this  concept  of  excellence  in
[64:12] all  areas  from  an  entrepreneur  called 
 some  ovens  he  has  a  YouTube  channel  you
[64:17] can  just  go  search  for  some  ovens  and 
 he's  recently  made  this  platform  like 
 this  online  Community  website  called
[64:22] school.com  that's  where  I  host  to  my 
 business  as  well  and  he  ended  up  just 
 like  in  one  random  video  of  his  he
[64:29] showed  that  he  had  principles  for  his 
 like  previous  business  like  the  kind  of 
 guidelines  and  rules  and  mindset  that
[64:36] everyone  in  his  business  was  following 
 and  one  of  them  was  excellent  excellence 
 in  all  areas  they  won't  cut  corners  and
[64:42] I've  been  inspired  by  that  since  and 
 that's  something  that  I  want  to  get  into 
 myself  Excellence  not  in  just  the  work
[64:49] that  you  produce  or  the  videos  that  you 
 make  here  but  excellence  in  for  example 
 the  form  that  you  have  in  your  workouts
[64:55] in  the  gym  excellence  in  your  diets 
 excellence  in  the  the  way  you  hold  eye
[65:00] contact  when  you're  speaking  to  your 
 loved  ones  it's  without  a  doubt  that  the 
 students  who  are  well  hydrated  they've
[65:06] got  good  diets  they  go  to  sleep  on  time 
 will  get  better  grades  than  the  students 
 who  stay  up  late  on  Tick  Tock  who  refuse
[65:13] to  drink  water  because  they  don't  like 
 the  taste  of  it  that's  obvious  it's 
 common  sense  and  yet  people  miss  this
[65:19] out  this  is  undeniable  we  know  this 
 because  these  are  the  people  who  have 
 got  their  life  in  order  trying  to  get
[65:25] better  grades  when  you're  dehydrated  or 
 trying  to  make  more  money  from  your 
 business  when  you  don't  even  make  your 
 bed  every  morning  or  trying  to  make
[65:31] gains  in  the  gym  when  you  refuse  to 
 improve  your  diet  and  you  keep  eating
[65:36] sugar  that's  obvious  it's  common  sense 
 it's  basic  but  a  lot  of  people  miss  the 
 basics  and  you  might  be  one  of  them  if
[65:41] for  example  you're  a  guy  who's  always 
 well  hydrated  there's  probably  another 
 area  of  life  that  you're  not  even
[65:46] hitting  the  basics  on  just  yet  maybe 
 your  form  in  the  gym  if  you're  just 
 being  honest  maybe  your  form  in  the  gym
[65:51] is  [ __ ]  it  could  be  have  you  ever  had  a 
 personal  training  session  to  have 
 someone  else  like  a  professional
[65:56] evaluate  your  form  have  you  ever  trained 
 with  someone  who's  got  10  years  of 
 experience  have  you  ever  even  like  sat
[66:01] down  and  watched  50  different  videos  on 
 how  to  like  bench  press  correctly  how  to 
 increase  your  squat  form  and  everything
[66:07] all  of  this  this  pursuit  of  becoming 
 excellent  comes  down  to  just  your
[66:12] mindset  of  setting  higher  standards  than 
 you  have  done  previously  so  again  this 
 is  something  that  you  can  do  you  can
[66:17] look  around  your  room  and  just  think 
 okay  what  could  I  slightly  increase  the 
 standards  of  a  lot  of  it  for  a  lot  of
[66:22] people  is  cleanliness  and  you  can 
 increase  the  standards  there  maybe  you 
 can  increase  the  standards  slightly  of
[66:27] the  clothes  you  wear  or  the  hair  that 
 you  keep  the  way  that  you  groom  yourself 
 a  lot  of  young  guys  including  myself
[66:32] kind  of  let  ourselves  go  with  a  little 
 bit  of  laziness  so  booking  in  a  haircut
[66:37] once  a  week  or  two  weeks  and  with  this 
 new  mindset  okay  I'm  gonna  have  higher 
 standards  for  my  appearance
[66:44] that  will  translate  to  higher  standards 
 in  your  work  step  3.3  perfectionism  is
[66:51] simply  a  lack  of  discipline  I  spoke  to  a 
 lot  of  people  who  suffer  with 
 perfectionism  they  want  it  to  be  just
[66:56] rights  they  want  to  wait  months  or  Years 
 to  you  know  do  something  that  should 
 take
[67:01] maybe  a  couple  of  days 
 and  I  speak  to  a  lot  of  guys  who  want  to
[67:06] become  YouTubers  maybe  they've  been 
 inspired  by  seeing  like  my  YouTube 
 channel  growth  and  they  always  ask  me
[67:12] these  [ __ ]  questions 
 you  know  should  it  be  like  this  video  or
[67:17] this  one  sure  how  about  this  this  idea 
 or  this  one  this  one  or  this  one  this 
 like  you  know  they're  just  like 
 literally  just  jumping  around  from  idea
[67:23] to  idea  and  I  always  just  ask  how  many 
 videos  have  you  posted 
 and  the  most  common  answer  that  I  get  is
[67:30] zero 
 here  we  have  a  young  man  who's 
 overthinking  to  such  a  crazy  level
[67:35] thinking  wait  should  his  videos  be  like 
 this  or  like  this  like  this  and  he's
[67:40] made  zero  videos  so  he  doesn't  even 
 understand  this  is  like  a  fat  guy  sat
[67:45] here  saying  no  no  I  won't  go  to  the  gym 
 until  I've  got  The  Perfect  Workout 
 routine
[67:50] how  do  you  think  you'll  find  The  Perfect 
 Workout  routine  you  go  so  I  always 
 always  every  time  I  meet  a  perfectionist
[67:56] I  always  relate  them  to  a  fat  man  you're 
 the  exact  same  it's  just  a  lack  of 
 discipline  the  fat  guy  who  doesn't  go  to
[68:02] the  gym  because  he  doesn't  know  exactly 
 what  The  Perfect  Workout  routine  is 
 going  to  be  is  the  exact  same  as  the
[68:07] little  skinny  fat  nerd  with  the  skinny 
 neck  who's  saying  that  he  won't  make  his 
 YouTube  video  right  now  who's  saying
[68:12] that  he  won't  produce  this  work  right 
 now  or  he  won't  release  it  just  yet 
 because  it's  not  good  enough  it's  not 
 perfect  this  just  comes  down  to  a  lack
[68:18] of  discipline  it  comes  down  to  arrogance 
 and  narcissism  there's  a  weird 
 Counterpoint  here  where  we  want  you  to
[68:24] have  high  standards  but  we  don't  want  it 
 to  be  stupid  for  example  your  first 
 video  that  you  post  onto  YouTube  is
[68:29] probably  gonna  be  trash  now  if  you're 
 some  professional  guy  you're  30  years 
 old  and  you  can  invest  in  a  really  high
[68:35] quality  team  and  you're  already  a  great 
 speaker  then  it's  going  to  be  different 
 but  if  for  example  you're  a  young  guy 
 and  you  don't  have  much  experience
[68:41] you're  not  really  that  great  at  speaking 
 or  anything  you  don't  have  like  a 
 fantastic  team  or  even  a  camera  you're
[68:47] just  using  your  phone  your  first  video 
 is  gonna  be  kind  kind  of  trash  and 
 that's  okay  but  then  having  high
[68:53] standards  would  mean  okay  well  the  next 
 video  I  make  I'm  gonna  try  and  do  one 
 thing  that's  slightly  better
[68:59] having  high  standards  could  mean  okay 
 I'm  going  to  make  sure  that  in  my  videos 
 I  don't  waste  that  much  time  because  you
[69:06] know  a  lot  of  new  YouTubers  they'll 
 press  record  and  they'll  waste  20 
 seconds  30  seconds  just  getting  to  it
[69:11] this  is  the  way  to  increase  standards 
 but  whilst  destroying  perfectionism  just
[69:16] know  that  they'll  always  be  more  things 
 that  you  can  add  into  something  always 
 there  will  always  be  more  that  you  can
[69:22] add  in  that  isn't  the  skill  this  is 
 where  perfectionists  get  stuck  they're 
 always  just  trying  to  add  more  into
[69:28] something  think  that  they  can  make  it 
 better  how  exactly  do  you  use  discipline 
 to  overcome  perfectionism
[69:33] you  find  a  perfectionist  body  kind  of 
 like  an  accountability  partner  but
[69:38] another  guy  who  also  has  these  feelings 
 of  perfectionism  and  you  join  together
[69:43] because  generally  we  have  perfectionism 
 in  ourselves  but  we  can  kind  of 
 rationally  see  for  someone  else  because
[69:49] you  know  perfectionists  can't  see  it  in 
 themselves  they  think  that  it's  still 
 not  good  enough  they  think  that  it's  not
[69:54] ready  to  be  released  but  if  a 
 perfectionist  meets  another 
 perfectionist  they  can  kind  of  help  each 
 other  in  a  weird  way  where  they  both
[70:00] relate  to  the  feeling  that  they  have  and 
 they're  able  to  convince  each  other  well 
 and  so  your  actionable  step  is  to  go
[70:05] down  to  the  comments  right  now  and  go 
 search  for  your  own  perfectionist  slash 
 procrastination  buddy  and  if  you  really
[70:11] want  to  take  action  then  write  your  own 
 comments  and  then  people  can  reply  to 
 you  maybe  you  can  put  your  Discord
[70:16] username  so  people  can  add  you  you  can 
 say  like  I'm  looking  for  a  perfectionist 
 body  this  is  the  thing  that  I  think  I've 
 got  perfectionist  on  oh  you  know  I
[70:22] procrastinate  on  this  task  because  I 
 keep  expecting  it  to  be  perfect  if 
 anyone's  similar  has  my  Discord  has  my
[70:27] email  address  or  something  everyone 
 spamming  in  the  comments  will  also  help 
 the  algorithm  pick  up  this  video  so
[70:32] that's  a  win-win  if  you  are  interested 
 in  all  of  the  entrepreneur  stuff  I've 
 just  spoke  about  like  finding  your  dream 
 business  and  you  want  my  advice  with
[70:38] that  and  you  want  to  join  like  this 
 online  community  Adonis  school  is  the 
 place  to  be  and  that's  the  top  Link  in
[70:43] the  description  step  four  discipline  in 
 health  and  fitness  this  is  the  most 
 common  place  where  young  men  can  use
[70:49] discipline  to  improve  their  lives  go  to 
 the  gym  and  eat  right  eat  clean  even
[70:55] when  you  don't  feel  like  it  it  is  really 
 going  to  the  gym  and  hitting  workouts 
 that  is  usually  most  young  men's  like
[71:01] first  taste  of  discipline  it's  first 
 taste  of  feeling  like  quite  masculine 
 and  you  know  doing  something  even  though
[71:06] you  don't  feel  like  it  doing  it  even 
 though  it's  hard  doing  it  especially 
 because  it  is  hard  and  there's  four
[71:11] major  benefits  to  being  disciplined  when 
 it  comes  to  Fitness  number  one  it's  the 
 concept  of  Hard  Times  create  strong  men
[71:17] you've  probably  heard  of  the  cycle 
 before  Hard  Times  create  strong  men 
 strong  men  create  good  times  good  times
[71:23] create  weak  men  weaker  men  create  Hard 
 Times  wherever  we  are  in  the  cycle  right 
 now
[71:28] I  mean  I  think  we  know  where  we  are  the 
 hard  times  are  pretty  much  here  for  a
[71:33] lot  of  countries  and  it  will  get  worse 
 and  worse  like  we're  talking  potentially
[71:38] Decades  of  like  the  Dark  Ages  on  the 
 other  hand  there  might  actually  be  the 
 biggest  sort  of  resurrection  of  good
[71:44] times  as  fast  as  possible  that  we've 
 ever  seen  in  history  because  of 
 Technology  because  of  AI  like  who  knows
[71:49] where  it's  going  to  go  right  now  it  does 
 seem  to  be  the  case  that  we  are  like 
 entering  the  hard  times  which  means  that 
 if  you  are  a  strong  man  you  will  be  able
[71:56] to  ride  this  wave  that  we're  going 
 through  but  weak  men  won't  weak  men  are 
 coming  every  single  day  to  more  of  these
[72:02] addictions  whereas  some  men  are  getting 
 stronger  even  though  the  times  are 
 getting  harder  it's  hard  right  now  like
[72:08] for  example  I  live  in  the  UK  it's  hard 
 for  an  average  man 
 to  be  able  to  feed  his  family  because  of
[72:14] the  cost  of  living  crisis  that  you  know 
 he's  not  making  much  money  the  weak  men 
 will  just  kind  of  struggle  with  that  and
[72:20] just  keep  struggling  and  complaining  and 
 ask  for  handouts  the  strong  man  will 
 figure  out  extra  ways  that  he  can  make
[72:25] money  and  become  more  capable 
 it's  how  you  use  the  situation  around
[72:30] you 
 and  going  to  the  gym  interestingly  will 
 help  you  with  this  it  will  develop  you
[72:36] into  a  strong  man  because  you're  pulling 
 yourself  through  hard  times  now  I've  got 
 to  make  a  disclaimer  a  lot  of  guys  will
[72:43] not  get  this  benefit  because  for  a  lot 
 of  people  including  like  Fitness 
 influences  and  everything  the  two
[72:50] they're  too  relaxed  they're  too  easy 
 like  you  know  that  their  workout  routine
[72:55] their  their  diet  when  you  I  see  like 
 every  now  and  then  I'll  see  a  video  from 
 a  fitness  influencer  and  he's  having
[73:01] like  200  grams  of  sugar  a  day  he's 
 eating  like  protein  pancakes  and  he's 
 put  little  like  [ __ ]
[73:06] um  chocolate  spread  over  it  or  something 
 like  is  this  the  level  of  discipline 
 we've  got  to  this  is  this  is  the
[73:11] Pinnacle  of  health  is  these  Fitness 
 YouTubers  who  are  literally  showing  you 
 like  oh  look  at  me  I'm  having  a  snack
[73:16] I'm  having  loads  of  sugar  and  stuff  like 
 bro  like  I  said  before  100  if  you  want
[73:21] to  go  out  for  like  a  nice  tree  every  now 
 and  then  100  I  love  to  do  that  as  well 
 so  you  know  I'm  not  I  don't  have  like  a
[73:27] 100  perfect  diet  this  is  the  Pinnacle  of 
 Health  these  days  this  is  like  Fitness 
 influences  20  years  ago  it  was  you  know
[73:32] okay  way  out  the  whites  rice  the 
 broccoli  the  chicken  maybe  a  little  bit
[73:37] too  extreme  and  now  it's  these  guys  who 
 are  like  doing  10  000  calorie  challenges
[73:42] because  all  the  the  disgusting  people 
 just  watch  that  content  it  should  still 
 feel  hard  today  if  you  really  want  to
[73:49] level  up  if  you  really  want  to  get 
 stronger  it  should  be  relatively  hard 
 like  like  I'm  speaking  directly  to  the
[73:55] guys  who've  been  training  for  years  now 
 remember  when  you  first  started  in  the 
 gym  and  how  [ __ ]  hard  it  was  remember
[74:00] how  sore  your  muscles  got  in  that  first 
 ever  like  arm  workout  that  you  did  you 
 know  the  first  time  that  you  did  a  bunch
[74:05] of  bicep  curls  and  the  next  day  you 
 couldn't  even  straighten  your  arm  and 
 you  felt  the  same  way  about  your
[74:10] hamstrings  and  everything  right 
 that  was  a  hard  workout  that  built  you 
 strong  these  days  we  do  a  full  workout
[74:15] and  afterwards  we  could  work  out  again 
 because  even  though  our  workout  is  like
[74:20] you  know  harder  than  it  was  before  our 
 capabilities  have  risen  so  we're  no
[74:25] longer  even  in  that  level  where  we're 
 challenging  ourselves  and  becoming 
 stronger  the  same  with  dieting  remember
[74:31] the  first  time  that  you  started  to 
 dieting  you  the  first  time  you  really 
 made  some  progress  in  dieting  how  like
[74:36] hard  it  kind  of  felt  remember  how  much 
 you  used  to  think  about  this  concept  of 
 eating  less  calories  and  eating  cleaner
[74:41] and  it  would  like  literally  almost  feel 
 like  a  full-time  job  and  these  days  I 
 might  feel  like  way  easier  you're  just
[74:46] not  used  to  it  that  means  that  sure 
 you're  rinsing  out  the  current  benefits 
 but  you're  not  growing  anymore  you're
[74:51] not  getting  any  stronger  right  now  maybe 
 you  don't  need  to  maybe  you're  already  a 
 super  strong  man  chances  are  you're
[74:56] probably  not  because  I'm  not  I've  still 
 got  a  lot  like  a  long  way  to  go  and  if 
 you're  sat  here  like  learning  from  me
[75:02] and  I'm  telling  you  as  your  teacher  that 
 I've  got  a  long  way  to  go  I  think  you 
 should  slap  your  ego  and  think  you  know
[75:07] what  I  probably  do  as  well 
 so  your  diet  and  your  training  should 
 feel  hard  today  I  know  that  I'm  doing
[75:13] this  right  when  I'm  in  the  gym  and  I 
 really  want  to  go  home  but  I  have  to 
 like  really  like  fight  to  stay  there
[75:19] whereas  I've  had  a  lot  of  workouts  over 
 the  last  few  years  where  I've  just  kind 
 of  you  know  I've  just  done  it  yeah  it's
[75:25] hard  you  know  when  you're  pressing  the 
 weight  and  you're  close  to  failure  it 
 feels  hard  but  all  in  all  it  doesn't 
 like  it's  not
[75:31] 10  out  of  10  difficult  it's  kind  of  like 
 fun  going  to  the  gym  but  these  days 
 recently  just  very  recently  only  for  a
[75:36] few  days  I've  literally  been  in  the  gym 
 and  been  like  exhausted  and  tired  and  it
[75:41] really  reminds  me  of  when  I  first  used 
 to  go  to  the  gym  and  like  you  couldn't 
 wait  to  almost  like  leave  like  it  was 
 fun  but  it  was  super  tiring  and  the  same
[75:47] with  my  diet  I  had  to  restrict  it  to  the 
 next  level  now  that  now  it  feels  like
[75:52] like  kind  of  like  how  it  was  when  I  was 
 a  beginner  and  I  can  see  the  progress 
 that  I'm  making  it's  like  I  keep  feeling
[75:58] this  weird  Blissful  feeling  which  is 
 like  I  can  genuinely 
 understand  the  concept  of  potential  of
[76:06] self-mastery 
 because  most  people's  fitness  journey 
 and  you  know  the  journey  to  be
[76:11] disciplined  looks  like  this 
 like  that  like  a  start  and  they  get  you 
 know  loads  of  progress  they're  being
[76:16] really  disciplined  but  then  out  of 
 nowhere  it  just  starts  to  level  off  and 
 they  just  kind  of  stay  comfortable  here
[76:21] even  the  guys  who  consistently  go  to  the 
 gym  if  you've  been  going  to  the  gym  for 
 a  few  years  I  guarantee  you've  been
[76:26] pushing  out  guarantee  that  even  though 
 the  gym  like  you've  been  going 
 consistently  and  the  gym  feels  kind  of
[76:31] hard  guarantee  that  you're  not  like 
 progressively  overloading  not  just  set 
 by  set  but  just  kind  of  workouts  in
[76:37] month  by  month  of  like  you  know 
 restricting  your  diet  more  getting  bit  a 
 little  bit  more  extreme  in  your  training
[76:42] and  people  can  say  oh  well  you  know  this 
 is  you  know  restrictive  diets  don't  work 
 and  stuff  yeah  for  [ __ ]  of  course
[76:47] they  don't  for  shallow  breathers  of 
 course  they  don't  but  for  Superior  men 
 men  who  want  to  become  strong  this  is
[76:53] the  trajectory  it's  like  every  single 
 month  you  slightly  increase  the  level  of
[76:58] discipline  that  you  need  for  your 
 activities  most  guys  stopped  one  year 
 into  going  to  the  gym  and  they  just  kind
[77:04] of  like  maintain  that  level  you  know  if 
 you've  been  finding  that  you're  not 
 making  as  much  gains  recently  and  we  all
[77:09] blame  it  on  like  yeah  you  know  it's  Noob 
 games  you  make  a  lot  of  muscle  when  you 
 first  stop  and  you  don't  make  much  after
[77:14] that  maybe  but  maybe  you've  just  been 
 posting  out  maybe  you're  not  putting  in 
 the  same  level  of  discipline  relative  to
[77:20] when  you  first  started  because  I 
 remember  when  I  first  started  and  I 
 found  it  incredibly  difficult  to  diet
[77:26] and  to  train  and  then  for  years  it  was 
 way  easier  because  my  skill  level  had
[77:32] went  up  but  I  wasn't  challenging  myself 
 anymore 
 so  if  you  want  like  a  little  idea
[77:39] for  example  start  adding  in  some  cardio 
 maybe  you  already  do  some  go  and  track 
 your  cardio  and  do  a  hundred  calories
[77:46] every  single  day  for  the  rest  of  your 
 life  and  every  time  you  get  onto  your 
 favorite  cardio  machine  to  hit  100
[77:51] calories  try  and  beat  your  score  from 
 last  time  like  your  your  time  for
[77:56] example  so  you  really  like  the  treadmill 
 for  example  and  it  takes  you  10  minutes
[78:01] to  hit  100  calories  today  tomorrow 
 you're  going  to  the  gym  and  you  try  and 
 get  it  in  9  minutes  and  30  seconds  then
[78:08] the  next  day  you  try  and  get  it  in  nine 
 minutes  then  randomly  then  you  know  one 
 day  later  you  end  up  getting  it  in  like 
 seven  minutes  and  it's  like  whoa  that's
[78:14] really  good  then  the  next  day  it's  like 
 eight  minutes  and  you're  really  trying 
 to  beat  the  seven  minute  again  but  you 
 know  that  was  quite  lucky  so  you  simply
[78:19] yourself  okay  I'm  gonna  be  you  know 
 progressively  overloading  I'm  going  to 
 be  smart  let's  try  and  get  it  on  average 
 like  eight  minutes  okay  eight  minutes
[78:25] then  750  and  you  you  start  playing  this 
 game 
 and  now  this  is  like  an  actual  level  of
[78:31] challenge 
 you're  there  sometimes  in  the  gym 
 feeling  like  oh  I  don't  want  to  do  the 
 100  calorie  thing  it's  stupid  Hamza  was
[78:36] just  you  know  saying  it  lightly  I  don't 
 want  to  do  it  that's  exactly  how  we  felt 
 when  we  started  going  to  the  gym  you
[78:42] wake  up  the  next  day  and  your  legs  are 
 sore  and  you've  got  that  like  pain  heavy 
 feeling  in  your  Chili's  tendons  and  your
[78:48] carbs  that's  exactly  how  it  felt  when  we 
 first  started  training
[78:53] now  you're  like  being  as  disciplined  as 
 you  was  back  then  relatively  and  you're 
 becoming  stronger  the  second  benefit  of
[78:59] being  disciplined  in  Fitness  is  the 
 physical  and  mental  health  that's  going 
 to  translate  over  to  better  work
[79:04] relationships  happiness  and  love  and  the 
 third  benefit  of  being  disciplined  in 
 Fitness  of  course  is  getting  into  shape
[79:10] Tristan  Tate  was  on  a  podcast  that  I 
 watched  a  little  while  ago  and  he  was
[79:16] asked  what's  like  the  number  one  tip  to 
 look  better  in  a  suit  and  he  ended  up
[79:21] saying  it  was  just  get  into  shape  it 
 wasn't  actually  about  the  suit  or  the 
 tailor  or  the  style  if  you're  in  shape
[79:27] you'd  look  good  in  clothes  or  without 
 clothes  finally  the  fourth  benefit  to 
 being  disciplined  in  Fitness  eventually
[79:33] it  becomes  fun  if  you  keep  going  and  you 
 have  this  playful  mindset  almost  like 
 you're  playing  a  game  you're  trying  to
[79:39] beat  your  high  score  and  you're  trying 
 to  you  know  get  the  high  score  for  the 
 bench  press  you're  trying  to  get  the 
 high  score  for  how  fast  you  can  burn  100
[79:44] calories  that  will  soon  turn  into  you 
 genuinely  just  enjoying  each  and  every
[79:50] gym  session  and  it  becomes  such  a 
 beautiful  enjoyable  and  and  important
[79:55] part  of  your  life  a  lot  of  the  guys 
 who've  been  going  to  the  gym  for  a  while 
 will  know  this  it  really  integrates  into
[80:00] your  personality  and  you  start  to  love 
 being  an  athlete  like  it  adds  to 
 yourself  image  that  you  are  this  healthy
[80:06] person  who's  able  to  delay  gratification 
 who's  able  to  you  know  think  for  the 
 future  who's  able  to  enjoy  the  hard  work
[80:12] the  exercise  the  sweat  the  discomfort 
 the  pain  the  sacrifice  right  now
[80:18] and  I  think  that's  beautiful  I  think  it 
 adds  a lot  of  flavor  to  your  life  step 
 4.1  destroying  depression  with
[80:24] discipline  there's  a  lot  of  people  these 
 days  who  feel  quite  depressed  and
[80:30] whether  there  is  such  a  concept  of 
 clinical  depression  or  not  I  actually 
 don't  know  which  I  know  sounds  stupid
[80:36] but  I  think  that  the  majority  of  people 
 who  have  depression  I  don't  think  it's
[80:41] this  like  weird  mystical  chemical 
 imbalance  that  they  might  need 
 medication  for  it's  in  my  belief  that  we
[80:47] feel  depression  when  we  don't  act  like 
 how  humans  are  supposed  to  act  now  you
[80:52] remember  being  a  child  and  how  playful 
 and  innocent  and  beautiful  the  world
[80:57] used  to  be  and  I'm  not  talking  about 
 being  a  teenager  but  I'm  talking  about 
 actually  being  like  a  pure  child 
 remember  when  you  used  to  climb  trees
[81:02] and  you  used  to  jump  over  puddles  like 
 remember  when  you  used  to  literally  just 
 lie  down  in  the  grass  and  you  just  kind
[81:08] of  like  look  at  the  individual  Blades  of 
 grass  and  you'd  see  tiny  insects  in  your 
 play  with  them  maybe  you'd  kill  them
[81:13] right  we  don't  do  that  as  adults  anymore 
 we're  so  focused  on  our  phones  on  our 
 computers  on  like  just  you  know  these
[81:20] desires  that  have  been  put  into  us  by 
 influencers  and  by  media  we're 
 constantly  thinking  about  sex  but  not  in
[81:25] like  a  loving  way  more  in  like  a 
 validation  like  you  know  obsessed  with 
 ejaculation
[81:30] so  we  left  this  like  shallow  life  this 
 dirty  shameful  life  as  adults  and  we
[81:37] wonder  why  we  don't  feel  like  happy 
 playful  children  anymore 
 so  a  lot  of  people  believe  that
[81:43] depression  is  something  that  they  can't 
 change  I'm  depressed  I  need  medication  I
[81:48] think  the  issue  from  my  understanding 
 with  medication  is  that  it's  not  going 
 to  cure  the  problem  there's  a  reason  why
[81:54] you're  depressed  the  medication  just 
 kind  of  masks  the  symptoms  and  kind  of 
 like  makes  you  feel  a  little  bit  better
[81:59] like  a  bit  more  mellow  today  you  know 
 anti-depressants  kind  of  take  off  the
[82:04] sort  of  extreme  High  and  the  extreme  low 
 and  so  you're  in  this  weird  gray 
 androgynous  Zone  and  I'm  not  sure  if
[82:09] that's  the  best  way  to  go  ahead  like  go 
 about  this  I  think  perhaps  a  better  way
[82:14] which  is  going  to  require  me  to  sound 
 like  a  [ __ ]  [ __ ]
[82:19] is  to  ask  you 
 why  you  deserve  to  be  depressed
[82:24] if  you  really  want  this  full  guide  to 
 help  you  and  if  you  really  want  to  make 
 some  progress  here  it  might  be  worth  for
[82:31] you  to  like 
 not  think  of  me  as  a  bad  person  when  I 
 say  that  and  for  you  to  ask  the  question
[82:36] to  yourself  maybe  write  this  down  and 
 you  know  write  this  as  a  note  or 
 something  and  to  answer  this  what  am  I
[82:42] doing  to  deserve  to  feel  depressed  it 
 sounds  like  a  horrible  question  I  can
[82:47] imagine  so  many  people  might  like  think 
 that  I'm  weird  or  I'm  a  bad  person  for 
 asking  you  this  I  personally  believe
[82:52] like  you  know  you've  tried  you've 
 listened  to  the  entire  world  just  listen 
 to  me  for  like  two  minutes  and  let  me 
 just  explain  my  mindset  you  can  just  try
[82:58] what  I'm  saying  right 
 I  personally  believe  that  we  deserve 
 most  of  what  happens  to  pretty  much
[83:04] everything  apart  from  like  extreme  freak 
 accidents  and  everything  like  that  right 
 and  I  believe  especially  when  it  comes
[83:10] to  things  of  how  we  feel  we  are  in  total 
 control  of  that  whether  or  not  we 
 realize  it  or  and  whether  or  not  we
[83:16] accept  it  and  so  I  believe  it's  more  of 
 an  empowering  thought  to  have  that  our
[83:21] emotions  are  simply  just  caused  by  our 
 actions  and  honestly  when  I've  started
[83:26] to  think  like  this  like  I've  started  to 
 think  okay  I  control  how  I  feel  in  life 
 I've  had  more  control  over  it  so  this  is
[83:32] what  I  want  to  give  you  this  gift 
 because  it's  one  of  the  best  things 
 that's  ever  happened  to  me
[83:37] this  is  gonna  maybe  sound  like  boasting 
 but  it's  not  even  in  the  kind  of  post 
 that  most  people  would  do  you  know  most 
 people  will  talk  about  their  money  in
[83:43] their  Fast  Cars  one  of  the  things  I 
 really  like  am  proud  of  and  I  could 
 boast  about  I'm  genuinely  like  quite  a
[83:50] happy  content  person  if  there's  10 
 people  sat  waiting  for  the  train  nine  of
[83:55] them  are  on  a  phone  and  I'm  the  10th  guy 
 who's  literally  happier  than  all  of  them 
 put  together  with  a  smile  on  my  face
[84:01] just  kind  of  like  looking  at  the  world 
 that's  the  kind  of  man  that  I've  become 
 now  and  I  promise  that  I  was  not  always
[84:07] like  this  this  is  because  I've 
 conditioned  my  own  mind  to  like  fight 
 for  my  happiness  my  joy  my  my  survival
[84:13] my  my  gratitude  and  presence  and  so  I 
 want  to  give  you  this  gift  this  this
[84:18] mindset  that  I've  had  if  you  ask 
 yourself  right  now  and  just  be  totally 
 honest  and  really  write  this  down  as  an
[84:23] actionable  step 
 write  some  notes  on  this 
 what  am  I  doing  to  deserve  to  feel
[84:28] depressed 
 just  write  bullet  point  some  some ideas 
 and  your  lizard  brain  might  pipe  up  and
[84:34] say  oh  you  know  nothing  it's  you  know 
 it's  just  what  my  doctor  told  me  it's 
 just  you  know  it's  it's  genetic  and 
 stuff  but  just  ask  yourself  you  don't
[84:40] even  need  to  you  don't  need  more  in 
 education  or  anything  just  ask  yourself 
 what  are  some  of  the  actions  I'm  doing
[84:45] that  probably  leads  to  this  and  you  Pro 
 you  could  probably  write  a  hundred  let's 
 just  be  honest 
 I  wake  up  late  I'm  sleep  deprived  I
[84:52] don't  drink  enough  water  I  wake  up  and 
 the  first  thing  I  do  is  grab  my  phone 
 even  though  I  shouldn't  I  watch  an 
 Andrew  huberman  podcast  where  he  said
[84:58] that  you  should  get  sunlight  in  the 
 morning  and  I  don't  do  it  I  wear  the 
 same  clothes  and  they're  dirty  and  they
[85:03] stink  but  I  just  throw  them  on  the  floor 
 then  I  put  them  back  up  and  I  put  them 
 on  I  have  no  respect  for  myself  I 
 haven't  groomed  in  a  while  I  missed
[85:09] quite  a  few  days  of  brushing  my  teeth  I 
 haven't  played  anything  other  than 
 stimulation  and  porn  and  destructive
[85:15] habits  I've  been  addicted  to  these 
 habits  for  a  very  long  time  and  I've 
 been  unable  to  quit  I  eat  a  very  poor
[85:20] diet  that  my  parents  probably 
 conditioned  me  to  eat  you  could  write  a 
 massive  list  of  reasons  what  of  actions
[85:25] that  you're  doing  which  are  contributing 
 to  you  not  feeling  good 
 now  please  try  this
[85:31] on  the  other  side  of  the  page  or  maybe 
 just  below  it  on  a  PC 
 right  what  activities  and  tasks
[85:39] was  I  doing  as  a  child  when  I  felt 
 really  happy
[85:44] and  if  you've  got  some  memories  you  can 
 just  replay  them 
 I  was  spending  time  with  my  brother
[85:50] we  would  listen  to  peaceful  music  and  we 
 would  play  Yu-Gi-Oh  like  a  card  game
[85:55] we'd  play  crickets  in  the  back  garden 
 and  would  make  up  games  where  one  of  us
[86:00] had  to  be  blindfolded  but  still  hit  the 
 ball 
 when  it  was  raining  outside  that's  when
[86:05] we'd  go  outside  to  play  cricket  so  that 
 it  was  just  kind  of  in  a  weird  way  more
[86:10] uncomfortable  but  also  like  kind  of  more 
 hardcore 
 would  practice  things  just  for  the  sake
[86:16] of  practicing  like  we  used  to  like 
 parkour  we  weren't  even  good  at  it  so 
 we're  literally  just  trying  to  like  jump
[86:21] over  fences  like  we  would  literally 
 spend  an  hour  trying  to  jump  over  a 
 fence  for  the  sake  of  just  trying  to
[86:27] jump  over  it  just  for  fun 
 I'll  spend  more  time  with  my  mother  and
[86:32] I'd  laugh  and  she'd  tell  me  stories  my 
 dad  would  teach  me  maths
[86:37] I  would  spend  way  more  time  playing 
 outside  with  my  friends  the  things  that 
 we  would  do  before  mobile  phones  was
[86:43] very  enjoyable  we  just  goes  like  parks 
 and  literally  would  just  jump  over  stuff 
 that's  why  childhood  was  just  about
[86:48] jumping  over  stuff  we  would  climb  trees 
 and  I'd  be  in  ore  as  my  dad  could  climb
[86:53] like  the  biggest  tree  ever  and  I  could 
 only  get  to  like  the  second  branch
[86:58] I'd  purposely  jump  into  a  muddy  puddle 
 and  get  it  all  over  my  shoes  and  you 
 know  my  mom  would  be  angry  at  me  but  it
[87:03] was  really  fun 
 would  go  on  adventures  which  was 
 literally  just  like  a  mile  away  from  our
[87:08] house  and  we'd  end  up  going  it's  like  a 
 random  field  and  like  make  up  stories 
 like  oh  yeah  this  is  where  the  homeless 
 man  lives  who  kills  kids
[87:15] innocence 
 like  pure  childish  joy  and  play
[87:23] what  makes  you 
 happy  what  makes  you  not  feel  depressed
[87:28] I'm  not  sure  if  it  changes  that  much  I 
 think  that  you  know  the  things  that  we 
 did  as  children  that  really  brought  us
[87:33] into  a  flow  state  that  made  us  super 
 happy  I  think  that  it's  specifically
[87:38] exactly  the  same  activities  right  now 
 but  it's  that  it  feels  kind  of  weird
[87:44] because  as  a  grown  adult  in  some  ways 
 like  it  shouldn't  but  in  some  ways  it 
 can  feel  a  little  bit  weird  or  awkward
[87:50] to  considered  the  idea  of  going  to  go 
 climb  a  tree  right  or  to  do  like  some  of 
 these  things  or  like  inviting  your
[87:55] friends  like  going  on  to  your  friend's 
 door  knocking  on  the  door  saying  hi  do 
 you  want  to  play  out  don't  bring  your 
 phone  let's  just  go  like  ride  our  bikes
[88:01] for  no  reason  no  hey  hey  bro  can  I  go 
 jump  over  stuff 
 right  there's  a  level  of  like  oh  no
[88:06] that's  not  what  that's  not  what  adults 
 do  you  know  this  age  like  yeah  we  can  go 
 to  the  gym  and  that's  kind  of  nice  but 
 that's  about  it  right  and  any  other  kind
[88:12] of  playing  is  just  online  these  days 
 it's  video  games  and  everything  right 
 but  I  have  an  actionable  step  just 
 something  peaceful  for  you  to  try
[88:19] take  one  activity  that  you  can  remember 
 that  you  used  to  do  as  a  child  that  used
[88:24] to  be  kind  of  fun  and  maybe  exhilarating 
 and  start  doing  it  today
[88:29] climbing  trees 
 like  when  was  the  last  time  you  climbed 
 a  tree  you  can't  feel  depressed  when
[88:35] you're  a  Pioneer  you  literally  just 
 can't  you  can't  feel  depressed  when 
 you're  on  a  tree 
 when  you  go  go  for  a  runoff  for  a  walk
[88:41] right  and  it's  been  raining  and  there's 
 a  puddle  on  the  floor  you  can't  feel 
 depressed  as  you  try  and  jump  over  the
[88:46] puddle  and  you  you  know  you  could  kind 
 of  laugh  at  yourself  because  you  didn't 
 make  it  and  you  got  it  all  over  your 
 shoes  you  can't  feel  depressed  when  that
[88:52] when  you're  doing  that  now  that's  only  a 
 few  seconds  and  then  strip  after  that 
 the  demons  will  come  back  okay  sure  but
[88:59] if  your  day  in  your  life  and  your  month 
 started  to  be  filled  up  with  these 
 little  micro  childish  habits
[89:04] as  they  used  to  be  as  a  kid  we  used  to 
 see  everything  like  a  game  used  to  see
[89:09] everything  like  a  challenge 
 that's  what  we  need  to  be  like  even  as
[89:15] adults 
 it's  only  I  wouldn't  say  Western  but 
 it's  only  in  these  like  like  these
[89:21] somewhat  modern  countries  where  people 
 think  that  to  be  an  adult  means  to  be
[89:26] like  this  stuck-up  person  who  maybe 
 doesn't  smile  so  much  unless  it's 
 socially  appropriate  who  acts  like
[89:31] everyone  else  who  doesn't  act  like  a 
 child  and  so  we  wonder  why  we  feel  so 
 bad  if  you  go  to  some  other  countries
[89:37] not  so  much  countries  but  if  you  go  to 
 especially  tribes  which  have  been  like 
 quite  Untouched  by  modern  civilization
[89:44] you'll  see  the  adults  will  literally 
 dance  for  like  an  hour  or  two  every 
 single  day  they'll  do  things  which  are
[89:51] fun  for  the  sake  of  doing  things  just 
 for  fun  you  can  almost  picture  right  now
[89:56] if  like  a  YouTuber  already  let's  say  if 
 I  did  like  a  vlog  with  some  like 
 African  tribe  you  can  imagine  the  kind
[90:02] of  ones  I'm  talking  about  where  they've 
 all  got  like  a  feathered  headdresses 
 they  make  them  they  spend  an  hour
[90:08] picking  like  feathers  from  chickens  and 
 whatever  dyeing  them  just  because
[90:13] they're  like  oh  yeah  you  know  there's 
 the  yellow  feather  and  the  that's  fun 
 for  them  then  they're  there  like  you're
[90:18] doing  that  they're  dancing  everything 
 and  they're  having  a  good  time  and  here 
 we  are  thinking  that  all  right  shouldn't
[90:24] dance  yeah  that's  awkward  I  feel 
 embarrassed  by  that  back  to  work  or  back 
 to  my  video  games
[90:32] so  I  invite  you  now  as  an  actionable 
 step  to  use  discipline  because  it  will 
 require  discipline  you  will  have  a  lot
[90:37] of  limiting  beliefs  about  this  to  think 
 nope  this  isn't  going  to  work  nope  this 
 is  going  to be  cringe  someone  might  see
[90:42] me  going  to  be  cringe  gonna  be  awkward 
 going  to  be  uncomfortable  I'll  go  back 
 to  my  video  games  Hamza  doesn't  know 
 what  he's  talking  about  depression  can't
[90:47] be  cured  maybe  you  could  be  thinking 
 that 
 but  remember  that  I'm  on  your  side  here
[90:52] and  if  your  brain  is  is  literally 
 arguing  against  he  like  us  and  it's
[90:57] saying  oh  no  no  we  can't  get  any  better 
 is  that  really  your  own  brain  or  is  that
[91:03] like  [ __ ]  evil  demonic  conditioning 
 that's  inside  of  you
[91:09] because  your  own  brain  should  argue  and 
 fight  for  you  shouldn't  it
[91:14] so  what  if  you're  you  can  just  manually 
 input  the  thought  into  your  brain  right 
 now
[91:19] it's  worth  a  try  I  I  remember  being  a 
 kid  and  climbing  and  doing  silly  stuff 
 and  it  was  always  fun
[91:25] yeah  I  could  go  try  it  and  maybe  you're 
 literally  starting  to  think  logistically
[91:31] of  where  you  could  go  around  your  area 
 okay  where  is  there  where  could  I  find  a 
 puddle  or  a  tree  to  climb  up
[91:38] the  easiest  way  to  start  in  a  way  that 
 doesn't  feel  awkward  like  at  all  which
[91:43] is  how  I  started  my  mental  health 
 Journey  was  long  distance  running  by
[91:48] long  distance  I  don't  even  mean  like 
 long  distance  for  me  long  distance  was 
 like  two  kilometers  or  something  but  it
[91:54] was  specifically  running  Outdoors  not  in 
 on  a  treadmill  but  Outdoors  specifically
[91:59] with  a  prioritization  of  Adventure 
 rather  than  just  running  and  calories
[92:06] and  heart  rate  so  what  I  mean  by  this 
 this  is  this  really  transformed  my 
 mental  health  and  I  thought  I  really
[92:11] hope  that  you  could  take  this 
 I  started  running  but  instead  of  me  just 
 trying  to  follow  you  on  the  route  and
[92:16] running  on  the  road  and  everything  like 
 normal  people  would  do  I  ran  with  cardio
[92:21] being  like  the  second  thing  I  was 
 running  for  the  first  thing  I  was 
 running  for  was  adventure  and
[92:27] exploration  so  I  would  specifically  and 
 purposefully  run  into  places  that  I  just
[92:32] wanted  to  see  so  you  know  I'd  like 
 imagine  okay  here's  the  here's  kind  of 
 like  the  road  that  everyone  would  be 
 running  around  like  you  know  this  big
[92:38] estate  where  I  live  okay  here's  the  road 
 everyone  just  runs  there  instead  of  just 
 following  the  same  road  as  everyone  else
[92:43] I  know  is  that  there's  almost  like  an 
 Alleyway  like  not  like  a  dirty  one  but 
 you  know  just  like  a  a  small  Road  or
[92:48] something  to  the  left  which  is  very 
 close  to  my  house  and  it  just  occurred 
 to  me  like  I've  never  been  in  that
[92:54] street  before  so  I've  run  down  there 
 it's  a  cul-de-sac  which  means  you  you 
 literally  just  have  to  run  back  out
[92:59] right  but  it's  kind  of  like  I  just  tuck 
 it  in  for  a  second  and  I  couldn't  help 
 but  to  imagine  you  know  the  game  Grand
[93:05] Theft  Auto  when  you  look  at  the  map  and 
 the  map  is  all  like  kind  of  blacked  and 
 dark  out  up  until  you  kind  of  Discover
[93:10] it  then  the  maps  got  light  and  I  could 
 don't  imagine  like  my  own  City  being
[93:16] like  that  like  this  dark  map  with  a  few 
 areas  really  brightly  lit  and  there's  a 
 few  dark  spots  like  quite  a  lot
[93:22] literally  so  close  to  my  house  where 
 I've  lived  for  so  long  which  I've  never 
 even  seen  because  we've  always  just
[93:28] thought  oh  yeah  well  you  know  it's 
 probably  the  same  but  our  eyes  have 
 never  even  witnessed  something  literally
[93:34] like 
 two  minutes  walk  away  we've  never  seen  a 
 specific  house  before  we've  never  seen  a
[93:39] specific  like  you  know  car  and  the  front 
 garden  before 
 there's  some  places  you've  not  seen
[93:44] which  are  literally  just  minutes  away 
 from  yours  and  if  you  allowed  this  like 
 fantasization  to  build  up  this  this
[93:49] feeling  of  wanting  to  explore  an 
 adventure  and  just  go  out  today  maybe  on
[93:54] a  run  for  the  purpose  of  literally  just 
 like  exploring  your  your  local  area 
 going  somewhere  new  and  almost  looking
[94:01] at  it  like  in  awe  not  focusing  100  on 
 the  run  but  you  know  getting  somewhere 
 and  like  looking  around  smiling  and
[94:07] seeing  okay  I've  never  seen  that  person 
 before  never  seen  that  house  before  oh 
 wow  I  didn't  realize  that  they  had  a  a
[94:12] big  oak  tree  here 
 this  is  what  we  used  to  do  as  children
[94:17] so  I  want  to  ask  you 
 when  was  the  last  time  your  shoes  got
[94:22] muddy 
 on  purpose 
 when  was  the  last  time  you  genuinely  on
[94:28] purpose 
 jumped  into  a  puddle  just  to  like  get 
 wet  and  dirty
[94:33] when  was  the  last  time  you  genuinely 
 went  out  and  had  a  snowball  fight
[94:39] or  that  you  climbed  a  tree
[94:44] and  you  know  if  you  think  that  this  is 
 lame  the  thing  is 
 big  Macho  successful  you  know  these
[94:51] these  masculine  men  that  you  see  online 
 they're  doing  it
[94:56] Andrew  Tate's  playing  with  his  daughter 
 and  he's  probably  like  goofing  around 
 with  her
[95:01] chuckle  willing  Bear  Grylls 
 David  Goggins  these  are  all  guys  who've
[95:07] got  long-term  Partners  who  are  playing 
 with  their  kids  every  day  and  probably 
 fooling  around  with  them  and  laughing
[95:12] and  playing  hide  and  seek  with  them  guys 
 who  have  got  [ __ ]  triple  hour  levels 
 of  testosterone  guys  were  literally  been
[95:17] like  military  and  successful  business 
 and  kickboxer  and 
 and  how  they  are  actually  playing  more
[95:22] than  we  are  because  we're  sat  here 
 trying  to  be  too  like  masculine  for  our 
 own  good  thinking  yeah  you  know  like  oh
[95:28] yeah  no  no  business  you're 
 when  the  best  businessmen  are  literally 
 playing  step  4.2  starting  the  gym  so  you
[95:37] can  skip  this  section  if  you've  already 
 consistently  in  the  gym  but  this  is 
 specifically  for  the  people  who  haven't 
 really  signed  up  for  the  gym  yet  or
[95:43] maybe  who  have  got  a  gym  membership  but 
 aren't  going  consistently  and  you're 
 trying  to  figure  out  okay  how  do  I
[95:48] actually  start  I  know  it  seems  like  a 
 like  a  simple  topic  of  literally  just 
 joining  the  gym  but  I  kind  of  needed  a
[95:53] guide  like  this  when  I  first  started 
 very  quickly  the  way  to  join  a  gym  is 
 that  you'll  go  onto  Google  Maps  or  onto
[95:58] like  just  Google  and  you'll  search  your 
 area  to  your  city  and  just  write  gym  and
[96:03] you'll  start  to  see  the  map  of  where  all 
 these  gyms  are  and  you  just  want  to  pick 
 the  one  that's  closest  to  you  see  it's
[96:08] opening  times  and  you  can  usually  just 
 literally  just  turn  up  and  you  can  buy 
 it  there  or  you  buy  it  on  the  website
[96:13] and  they'll  say  you  know  the  monthly 
 membership  the  yearly  membership  just  do 
 that  and  to  actually  get  started  in  the
[96:19] gym  a  lot  of  people  do  have  that  kind  of 
 perfectionist  mindset  of  like  you  know  I 
 don't  know  what  workout  to  do  yeah  maybe
[96:25] I'll  start  in  two  weeks  and  you  know 
 this  there's  a  lot  of  things  that  just 
 are  stopping  you  from  starting  right
[96:31] away  the  mindset  I  want  to  give  to 
 anyone  who's  in  this  position  is  you'll 
 never  be  100  ready  to  start  the  gym
[96:39] there's  always  going  to  be  another 
 thought  of  like  wait  I  need  to  wait  for 
 the  workout  clothes  wait  I  need  to  wait
[96:44] for  this  other  thing  I've  got  oh  no  I'm 
 not  feeling  it  no  this  thing  okay  I'll 
 start  after  that  trip  and  then  I'll  do
[96:49] this  I  don't  know  the  workout  routine  I 
 don't  know  if  it's  going  to  be  safe  I 
 don't  know  there's  going  to  be  always 
 these  thoughts  whether  you  start  today
[96:55] or  10  years  from  now  you're  not  going  to 
 feel  100  clear  with  going  to  the  gym
[97:01] you'll  only  feel  that  after  you've 
 already  been  to  10  or  20  workouts  so
[97:08] what  I  mean  by  this  is  you  specifically 
 need  to  start  going  to  the  gym  even 
 though  your  brain  isn't  100  convinced
[97:14] that  right  now  is  the  time 
 which  is  powerful  because  now  no  matter
[97:20] what  [ __ ]  your  little  lizard  brain 
 which  is  probably  more  of  an  enemy  than 
 a  friend  let's  just  be  honest
[97:25] it's  telling  you  you  can  just  go  anyway 
 literally  just  tell  yourself  like  well 
 I'll  never  be  100  certain  so  whatever
[97:30] bullshit's  telling  me  it's  like  just 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  I'm  gonna  sign  up  right 
 now  and  I'm  gonna  go  for  my  first
[97:35] workout  and  you  might  think  oh  well  you 
 know  what's  the  workout  you  don't  even 
 need  to  know  because  I  want  you  to  think
[97:40] about  the  concept  of  exposure  and  you 
 know  what  we've  just  talked  about with 
 um  destroying  depression  with  discipline
[97:46] and  that  concept  I  spoke  to  about  like 
 the  the  Grand  Theft  Auto  map  being  kind 
 of  blacked  out  up  until  you  experience
[97:52] something 
 the  exact  same  thing  is  true  with 
 exposure  to  like  how  the  gym  works
[97:58] because  right  now  it's  like  the  gym  in 
 your  mind  is  this  kind  of  like  black 
 kind  of  dark  Beast  that  you  can't  see
[98:03] you  can't  understand  it  but  the  first 
 time  you've  literally  signed  up  to  the 
 gym  you've  went  there  you've  walked
[98:09] around  the  gym  area  and  you've  like  you 
 know  you  just  coped  and  you  did  some 
 stupid  exercise  and  went  home  think 
 about  how  much  extra  light  you've  just
[98:15] added  to  the  whole  concept  of  going  to 
 the  gym  right  now  the  whole  concept  is 
 just  dark  and  that  this  is  why  you're
[98:21] making  no  progress  because  you're 
 thinking  how  do  I  make  it  perfect  for 
 but  you  don't  know  because  it's  all  dark
[98:26] you  need  to  get  a  little  bit  of  exposure 
 first  so  even  if  your  first  day  in  the 
 gym  is  literally  just  you  walking  around
[98:31] looking  at  all  the  different  machines 
 and  then  going  home  or  you're  not 
 literally  just  sitting  on  one  of  the 
 machines  and  just  coping  and  doing  like
[98:37] a  few  Reps  for  no  reason  that  literally 
 will  add  so  much  more  exposure  to  the 
 concept  of  the  gym  that  you'll  be  able
[98:43] to  go  again  more  often  so  I  highly 
 recommend  that  you  get  into  this  concept
[98:48] of  I'm  not  going  to  be  100  certain  so 
 whatever  [ __ ]  extra  excuses  My  Mind 
 Is  Telling  Me  especially  the  one  that  I
[98:54] think  like  right  in  here  right  now  you 
 understand  what  I'm  saying  but  another 
 one  has  popped  in  and  you're  like  okay
[98:59] sure  I'm  gonna  listen  to  times  it  but 
 after  this  one  because  this  is  a  really 
 important  one  no  no  it's  that  one  that
[99:05] will  keep  you  skinny  fat  or  fat  for  the 
 rest  of  your  life 
 okay  so  don't  listen  to  your  [ __ ]
[99:11] brain  because  how  many  times  have  I  told 
 you  this  is  the  exact  same  part  of  your 
 mind  that  convince  you  for  10  000  hours
[99:16] of  video  games  and  a  thousand  episodes 
 of  [ __ ]  fake  taxi  or  something  so 
 your  brain  can't  be  trusted  so  when  your
[99:22] brain's  popping  up  with  seemingly 
 logical  reasons  why  you  shouldn't  join 
 the  gym  or  go  for  the  first  workout
[99:27] right  now  it's  not  logical  it's  just 
 that  your  brain  is  has  been  conditioned 
 to  be  like  a  little  [ __ ]  so  ignore
[99:34] everything  that  your  brain  says  let's 
 sign  up  for  the  closest  gym  nearby  just 
 navigate  through  the  website  absolutely
[99:39] fine  and  literally  just  walk  into  the 
 gym  and  you  might  wonder  okay  what 
 exactly  should  I  do 
 for  your  first  like  real  workout  I  will
[99:46] literally  make  you  the  workout  routine 
 and  I'll  link  it  below  so  you  can  just 
 click  on  the  link  don't  overthink  it  and
[99:51] you're  gonna  say  Oh  either  just  click  on 
 the  link  there'll  be  like  a  strong  app 
 link  you'll  download  the  app  it's  all
[99:56] free  I  don't  make  money  from  this  or 
 anything  but  I'll  do  that  and  then  um 
 it'll  open  up  on  your  phone  once  you've
[100:01] downloaded  the  app  it's  a  very  very 
 simple  workout  then  what  what  you  need 
 to  do  is  just  know  that  you're  using  the
[100:08] right  form  what  this  means  what  form 
 means  it's  kind  of  like  your  Technique 
 so  it's  to  make  sure  that  you're
[100:13] training  in  a  safe  way  so  I'll  link 
 below  the  exact  form  videos  that  I've
[100:18] used  which  are  years  and  years  old  so 
 that  you  can  learn  how  to  do  exercises 
 safely  so  the  next  time  you  go  into  the
[100:24] gym  the  only  thing  that  you'll  need  is 
 your  phone  and  hopefully  some  internet 
 connection  like  your  internet  data  or
[100:29] maybe  the  gym  has  some  internet  go  into 
 the  gym  get  close  to  the  thing  that's  in
[100:34] the  workout  so  for  example  it's  bench 
 press  then  you  see  okay  the  bench  is 
 over  there  you  stand  over  to  it  go  at
[100:40] your  phone  click  on  the  video  that  I've 
 linked  below  and  you'll  learn  how  to 
 actually  do  that  exercise  safely  and 
 someone  will  literally  Show  You  On  video
[100:45] okay  this  is  how  you  rack  the  thing  grab 
 it  like  this  do  this  with  your  shoulders 
 and  then  you  go  and  perform  the  exercise
[100:51] at  a  very  like  low  weight  maybe  like  the 
 empty  bar  is  more  than  enough  for  most
[100:56] beginners  this  is  how  you  start  the  gym 
 you  go  back  to  the  gym  watching  the  same 
 videos  thinking  about  the  same  cues  that
[101:02] they've  said  trying  to  make  sure  it 
 feels  okay  and  hitting  it  again  and 
 again  and  again  eventually  you  probably 
 don't  even  need  like  the  form  videos  for
[101:08] those  specific  exercises  and  you  can 
 start  to  build  on  from  there 
 go  to  the  description  right  now  I've
[101:14] linked  that  stuff  you  can  go  get  it  for 
 free  I've  just  added  it  all  just  to  try 
 and  help  you  here  so  that  it  feels  like
[101:19] less  mentally  demanding  to  start  in  the 
 gym  because  I'm  very  grateful  that  my 
 brother  did  this  for  me  because  if  my
[101:25] brother  didn't  force  me  to  go  to  the  gym 
 and  if  he  didn't  force  me  to  like  follow 
 this  specific  routine  I  wouldn't  have  I
[101:31] just  would  have  been  you  know 
 information  overload  so  I  want  to  be 
 like  the  big  brother  for  you  and  just  be
[101:36] like  bro  just  shut  up  just  here's  the 
 routine  just  please  just  follow  it  and 
 then  you  know  a  month  from  now  two 
 months  from  now  you  can  change  it
[101:41] however  you  like  at  least  this  will  just 
 get  you  into  the  gym  and  once  you've 
 been  in  the  gym  and  you've  seen  it  20
[101:46] times  50  times  you  know  where  everything 
 is  and  you  know  that  area  of  your  of 
 your  mind  is  so  bright  that  now  it
[101:52] doesn't  feel  as  scary  anymore  what  I 
 will  say  is  if  you  can  afford  it  or  even 
 if  it's  slightly  too  expensive  but  you
[101:57] just  want  to  really  do  this  getting  some 
 personal  training  sessions  right  at  the 
 beginning  is  absolutely  one  of  the  best
[102:04] investments  you  can  make  10  out  of  10. 
 if  you've  got  someone  who  you  train  with 
 who  can  teach  you  fine  if  you've  got
[102:09] like  a  big  brother  who  knows  the  form 
 and  the  technique  fine  but  if  you  don't 
 have  anyone  and  you  can  afford  personal
[102:16] training  sessions  like  a  like  a  package 
 of  five  or  a  package  of  ten  or  something 
 it'll  be  like  a  hundred  dollars  two
[102:21] hundred  dollars  something  like  that  100 
 even  if  you're  feeling  kind  of  broke 
 right  now  100  just  like  save  up  for  it
[102:28] and  get  it  because  you  will  genuinely 
 make  so  much  faster  progress  if  you've
[102:33] had  five  hours  or  ten  hours  of  like  a 
 professional  who's  qualified  who's  got 
 years  of  experience  giving  you  direct
[102:40] instant  feedback  who's  already  made  the 
 plan  for  you  which  you  can  follow  even 
 after  your  time  with  them  and  he's  just
[102:46] giving  you  like  like  all  this  micro  bits 
 of  feedback  which  you  might  not  get  for 
 the  next  like  five  years  if  you  train  by
[102:52] yourself  so  it's  super  worth  it  at  the 
 start  to  just  invest  into  this  few 
 hundred  dollars  because  they'll  change
[102:57] like  the  trajectory  of  your  fitness 
 journey  forever  if  you  can't  afford  some 
 PT  sessions  like  I  couldn't  when  I  first
[103:03] started  just  keep  going  on  to  YouTube 
 and  searching  for  technique  videos  so 
 whatever  exercise  you  want  to  get  into
[103:08] you  can  just  educate  yourself  on  YouTube 
 for  free  step  four  point  three
[103:13] keep  skipping  workouts  if  you  find 
 yourself  constantly  skipping  your
[103:18] workouts  and  you  cope  and  you  make  a  lot 
 of  excuses  I'll  do  it  at  7  pm  then  7pm
[103:23] comes  around  and  you  don't  go  anymore 
 I'll  do  it  tomorrow  and  you  know  you  you 
 set  the  plan  to  go  maybe  three  days  a
[103:29] week  or  four  or  five  days  a  week  and 
 you're  not  just  messing  it  all  up  and 
 you  go  on  different  days  you  know  you're 
 very  inconsistent
[103:35] you  just  miss  days  entirely  it's  too 
 sore  you  know  all  these  reasons  to  not
[103:40] be  as  consistent  as  you're  supposed  to 
 be  in  the  gym  I  know  exactly  what  to  do 
 because  I've  done  this  by  the  way  I've
[103:45] been  going  to  the  gym  like  consistently 
 for  I  think  about  eight  or  nine  or  ten
[103:50] years  something  like  that  and  here  is  my 
 bicep  to  show  I  am  incredible  to  talk
[103:55] about  this  yes 
 so 
 this  is  exactly  what  worked  for  me  when
[104:01] I  was  a  lot  younger  and  way  way  less 
 disciplined  and  you  know  more  of  like  a
[104:06] Jeffrey  more  of  like  a  beginner  a 
 shallow  breather  where  I  was  um 
 missing  so  many  workouts  coping  eating
[104:13] [ __ ]  food  and  just  calling  it  a  cheap 
 day  you  know  I  was  all  over  the  place 
 but  I  was  able  to  get  discipline  in  the 
 gym  following  two  things  one  I  made  it
[104:20] easier  to  be  disciplined  to  consistently 
 go  to  the  gym  so  instead  of  just  relying 
 on  discipline  it's  awesome  if  we  can  use
[104:27] some  of  those  productivity  tactics  like 
 routines  and  schedules  so  that's  it's 
 just  kind  of  easier  and  more  motivating
[104:33] to  go  to  the  gym  so  what  this  means  is 
 set  a  schedule  to  go  to  the  gym  at  the
[104:39] exact  same  times  so  that  it's  in  a 
 routine  if  you're  trying  to  go  to  the 
 gym  somewhat  randomly  thinking  okay  when
[104:46] will  I  have  time  oh  man  I  forgot  to  go 
 to  the  gym  for  the  last  three  three  days 
 or  something  that's  going  to  be  super
[104:51] hard  to  get  consistent  but  if  you 
 already  just  spend  literally  just  two 
 minutes  right  now  you  can  pause  the
[104:56] video  just  spend  two  minutes  thinking 
 okay  what  would  be  a  great  time  for  me 
 to  go  to  the  gym  in  general  for  a  lot  of
[105:02] people  it  will  be  in  the  morning  maybe 
 before  work  maybe  before  school  or 
 something  or  maybe  like  a  little  bit
[105:07] afterwards  you  need  to  find  out  a  time 
 that  you  could  imagine  will  work  not 
 only  right  now  but  might  work  for  the
[105:14] rest  of  your  life  like  for  example  for 
 me  I  can  go  to  the  gym  for  the  rest  of 
 my  life  from  around  nine  to  about  12.
[105:20] that's  the  time  that  I  usually  go  to  the 
 gym  now  sure  there's  some  days  where  I 
 can't  right  now  it's  10  a.m  and  I'm
[105:25] still  recording  so  you  know  prioritizing 
 something  else  but  in  general  my 
 exercise  block  is  around  like  9  to  12
[105:31] ish  somewhere  around  that  and  that  works 
 for  me  I'm  energized  at  that  time  I
[105:36] enjoy  training  at  that  time  the  gyms  are 
 super  quiet  at  that  time  because 
 everyone's  in  work  so  that  works  for  me
[105:41] it'd  be  worth  it  for  you  right  now  to 
 figure  out  exactly  the  time  that  you 
 would  go  and  also  to  use  what's  called
[105:47] habit  stacking  this  is  something  from 
 James  clear's  book  Atomic  habits  which
[105:52] the  idea  is  to  put  the  gym  on  top  of  a 
 habit  which  has  already  been  formed  so
[105:57] for  example  every  day  you  wake  up  you  do 
 your  morning  routine  and  you  do 
 something  like  studying  or  something  and 
 you  go  to  the  gym  after  that  every
[106:03] single  day  so  it's  super  super 
 consistent  and  you  know  you  adjust  your 
 workout  routine  to  like  make  it  I
[106:08] personally  think  working  out  every 
 single  day  is  way  better  I  think  that 
 taking  days  off  starts  getting  too
[106:13] complicated  for  your  routine  and  it's 
 better  to  for  example  go  to  the  gym 
 every  day  for  45  minutes  than  it  is  to
[106:19] go  to  the  gym  three  days  a  week  for  one 
 and  a  half  hours  I  think  it's  so  much 
 better  to  go  every  single  day  because  it
[106:24] just  fits  with  your  routine  you  get  so 
 used  to  it  your  bag's  always  ready  you 
 know  you're  going  to  the  gym  at  the  same
[106:29] time  so  it's  always  there  super 
 consistent  so  I  would  say  if  you  can  try 
 and  stack  it  with  another  habit  you'll
[106:35] get  way  more  consistent  the  most 
 consistent  I've  ever  been  in  the  gym 
 it's  all  in  just  working  out  in  general
[106:40] is  when  I've  just  done  it  first  thing  in 
 the  morning  and  it  was  stacked  on  pretty 
 much  waking  up  brushing  my  teeth  having
[106:45] a  poop  and  then  just  literally  just 
 getting  my  my  earpods  in  and  stuff  and 
 then  just  go  into  exercise  straight  away
[106:51] once  you've  utilized  a  few  of  those 
 principles  to  try  and  build  like  a 
 routine  not  just  like  the  gym  routine 
 you  know  push-pull  legs  but  specific
[106:57] like  calendar  routine  going  every  single 
 day  at  9am  once  you've  utilized  some  of
[107:02] those  there's  one  discipline  mindset 
 that  I  want  to  teach  you  I  had  known 
 this  for  a  while  but  eventually  I  had  a
[107:08] conversation  with  a  Marine  like  a  royal 
 Marine  Commando  like  a  hardcore  guy  I
[107:14] hiked  up  a  mountain  everyone  else  has 
 hiked  up  this  mountain 
 I  saw  this  guy  climbing  up  like  scaling
[107:21] up  from  the  peak  side 
 so  whilst  everyone  else  you  know  one 
 step  okay  here  this  guy  was  like  hand
[107:28] like  climbing  like  this  like  from  a 
 steep  side  like  that  that's  when  I  saw 
 him  I  was like  whoa  it's  crazy  that's
[107:34] why  I  asked  him  you  know  what  he  does  we 
 ended  up  speaking  and  I  ended  up 
 speaking  to  him  on  a  podcast  which  is 
 very  old  we  can  have  a  look  if  you  just
[107:40] search  like  Hamza  Marine  Commando  he'll 
 probably  come  up  very  very  old  like  two 
 three  four  years  old  and  um he  ended  up
[107:47] telling  me  the  exact  same  thing  that  I 
 had  been  sort  of  following  in  my  mind 
 which  was  a  really  interesting  where  he
[107:52] said  it's  all  about  taking  it  one  step 
 at  a  time 
 instead  of  looking  at  the  entire  battle
[107:59] what  I  mean  by  this  is  when  we  don't 
 feel  like  going  to  the  gym  it's  often
[108:04] because  we're  thinking  about  how  big  and 
 scary  and  painful  and  uncomfortable  the
[108:09] entire  situation  is  let's  say  right  here 
 right  now  I'm  sat  here  in  my  shirts  you
[108:14] know  my  shorts  and  stuff  I'm  kind  of 
 cozy 
 if  I  think  about  the  hour  of  cardio  that
[108:19] I'm  gonna  go  and  do 
 I  might  start  to  like  not  want  to  go  to 
 the  gym  because  it  can  start  to  feel
[108:24] kind  of  like  like  hard  and  you  know  like 
 kind  of  exhausting  and  and  I'm  comfy 
 here  and  I  might  end  up  coping  I  might
[108:30] not  say  to  myself  yep  I'm  a  [ __ ]  I'm 
 not  gonna  go  today  not  many  people  are 
 that  humble  I  might  say  yeah  I'm  gonna
[108:35] go  today  but  yeah  I'll  go  I'll  go  after 
 you  know  I'll  get  it  I'll  have  a  coffee 
 first  I'll  do  that  call  I'll  do  this
[108:40] other  thing  and  I'll  go  after  I'll  go  at 
 2PM  instead  of  my  usual  time  I'll  go  you 
 know  we  start  pushing  it  off  because
[108:45] it's  this  big  scary  thing  when  actually 
 we  don't  need  to  go  and  do  the  500
[108:51] calories  of  cardio  that's  not  what  the 
 task  is  the  task  is  to  just  get  changed
[108:56] into  the  gym  clothes  the  next  task  is  to 
 like  get  our  water  bottle  and  our
[109:01] earphones  you  can  do  that  right  you  no 
 matter  how  tired  you  are  you  could  go 
 and  literally  just  grab  your  airpods  and
[109:06] put  them  in  right 
 the  next  task  is  to  put  on  your  music 
 you  can  do  that  no  matter  how  tired  you
[109:11] are  you  could  put  on  the  music  right  the 
 next  task  is  to  like  go  downstairs  and 
 put  your  shoes  on  again  no  matter  how
[109:16] tired  you  are  you  could  do  that  then 
 it's  to  leave  your  door  then  it's  to 
 walk  to  the  gym  then  it's  so  I  can  also
[109:21] do  the  warm-up  so  what  the  issue  is  is 
 that  we  are  seeing  the  gym  for  this  big
[109:26] beast  this  workout  which  is  you  know 
 huge  it's  long  it's  uncomfortable 
 especially  when  we're  in  a  state  of
[109:31] comfort  instead  of  seeing  the  specific 
 next  task  that  needs  to  be  conquered
[109:37] because  when  we  are  here  in  our  nice  you 
 know  quiet  cozy  environments  and  we 
 think  about  the  last  set  of  squats  it's
[109:44] like  our  brain  says  no  no  I  couldn't  do 
 this  couldn't  do  that  transformation 
 but  it  doesn't  need  to  because  we  just
[109:50] need  to  do  the  next  step 
 it's  one  step  at  a  time  how  do  you  hike 
 up  a  mountain
[109:56] one  step  at  a  time 
 so  that  idea  is 
 the  next  time  that  you're  supposed  to  go
[110:02] to  the  gym  but  you  start  coping  just 
 remind  yourself  of  this  like  one  step  at 
 a  time  mindset  remind  yourself  that
[110:08] right  now  your  brain  is  convincing  you 
 that  you  couldn't  do  this  massive  leap 
 to  the  gym  but  it's  not  about  the
[110:14] massive  leap  it's  just  the  individual 
 step  and  just  ask  yourself  it  sounds 
 kind  of  foolish  but  ask  yourself  could  I
[110:19] put  my  earphones  on  right  now  you'll  be 
 like  well  yeah  of  course  okay  I'll  stick 
 them  on  could  I  put  my  music  on  right
[110:25] now  yeah  of  course  I'll  put  it  on  one 
 step  at  a  time  and  before  you  know  it 
 you're  outside  of  the  gym  before  you 
 know  it  you're  inside  the  gym  before  you
[110:30] know  it  you're  warming  up  and  by  the 
 time  you've  warmed  up  and  you've  done 
 one  set  of  squats  it's  like  okay  well 
 you've  come  on  let's  [ __ ]  get  it
[110:35] you're  warm  you're  sweaty  you're  you're 
 actually  inviting  the  next  set  of  squats 
 now  you're  awesome  right  step  4.4  a
[110:42] disciplined  diets  I've  mentioned  in  this 
 video  that  you  see  a  lot  of  these  weak 
 modern  Fitness  influences  and  it's  it's
[110:48] a  shame  that  these  are  like  the  scene  as 
 the  Pinnacle  of  health  and  fitness  it's 
 these  guys  who  are  reading  sugar  200
[110:55] grams  of  sugar  a  day  it's  these  guys  who 
 are  making  anabolic  cookbooks  with 
 pancakes  and  you  know  it's like  it's
[111:01] just  childish  to  eat  that  day  to  day  and 
 it's  certainly  not  your  best  it's 
 certainly  not  like  the  best  of  your
[111:07] character  to  indulge  in  sweet  treats  and 
 cope  and  say  that  it's  part  of  your  diet 
 now  you  can  absolutely  make  Muscle
[111:14] whilst  eating  [ __ ]  food  of  course  you 
 can  but  there's  more  to  life  than  just 
 making  muscle  how  about  your  health  how
[111:20] about  your  physical  and  mental  health 
 how  about  your  guts  Health  overloading 
 on  sugar  and  weird  chemicals  which  are
[111:26] in  like  gummy  bears  or  whatever  the  [ __ ] 
 these  influencers  and  these  um  Dunkin 
 Donuts  you  know  Krispy  Kreme  Donuts  that
[111:32] they're  eating  all  the  time 
 there's  a  better  way  to  do  this  for  me
[111:37] the  moment  that  I  was  able  to  improve  my 
 diet  came  when  I  started  to  educate 
 myself  on  it  I  realized  at  age  22  I  had
[111:45] been  through  the  entire  education  system 
 and  I  had  never  had  a  real  lesson  on 
 diet  or  nutrition  before  and  that  I
[111:51] actually  knew  nothing  about  what  these 
 things  were  actually  doing  to  my  body
[111:56] that's  when  I  discovered  this  lecture 
 that's  on  YouTube  that  you  can  watch  for 
 free  it's  from  like  this  it's  just  it's
[112:01] very  good  and  I  highly  recommend  that 
 you  just  watch  every  second  of  it  it's 
 called  Fat  Chance  2.0  and  if  you  just  go
[112:09] on  the  description  of  this  video  I'll 
 link  it  for  you  whenever  you  got  the 
 time  it's  like  an  hour  long  I  highly
[112:14] recommend  you  watch  it  there  might  be 
 some  bits  that  you  get  a  little  bit 
 bored  just  trust  me  when  I  say  if  you
[112:19] watch  every  second  of  it  to  the  end 
 you're  going  to  be  very  grateful  that 
 you  did  because  it's  going  to  give  you
[112:24] the  kind  of  education  you  should  have 
 gotten  when  you  were  in  school  but  then 
 they  don't  teach  this  stuff  for  some
[112:29] reason  so  that  works  really  well  for  me 
 because  online  I  think  there's  only  a 
 voice  right  now  on  this  you  know  Fitness
[112:35] influencer  [ __ ]  of  people  just  being 
 kind  of  like  mediocre  every  day  it's
[112:40] people  who  are  disciplining  themselves 
 or  living  to  like  50  to  60  of  their
[112:45] intensity  they're  eating  some  clean 
 calories  but  then  every  single  day 
 they're  having  a  little  bit  of  chocolate 
 they're  having  this  from  my  experience
[112:52] you  might  be  different  but  I'm  just 
 going  to  tell  you  that  what  I  believe  is 
 the  truth  from  myself  and  also  for  every
[112:58] successful  guy  that  I  know 
 it  doesn't  seem  like  successful  people
[113:03] have  daily  balance  it  doesn't  seem  like 
 the  guys  who  have  the  best  like  the  real 
 best  physiques  or  helpful  business  it
[113:09] doesn't  seem  like  they're  doing  50  of 
 their  intensity  every  day  it  seems  like 
 those  guys  resemble  the  phrase  like  work
[113:16] hard  play  hard  they  go  into  periods  of 
 intense  work  mode  where  they  do  nothing
[113:21] but  work  and  nothing  but  like  you  know 
 strict  calories  and  everything  like  that 
 and  then  they  go  into  periods  of  intense
[113:27] play  time  where  they  literally  just  for 
 a  lot  of  these  people  they're  just 
 totally  generates  they'll  start  drinking 
 and  sleeping  with  loads  of  women  and
[113:32] taking  drugs  and  stuff  I'm  not  doing 
 that  stuff  but  for  me  my  degenerate  time 
 is  like  going  to  a  family  Cafe  and
[113:38] having  some  cake  and  like  talking  to  the 
 family  there  and  everything  so  that's
[113:43] just  what  I've  seen  online  is 
 you're  recommended  to  have  this  kind  of 
 almost  you  know  perfect  sustainable  diet
[113:49] every  day  eighty  percent  of  your 
 calories  from  healthy  stuff  and  20  from 
 like  the  process  you  know  like  nice
[113:54] Foods  I  don't  recommend  that  because 
 that  means  that  you're  not  living  to 
 your  potential  whilst  you're  in  work
[113:59] mode  because  if  you're  eating  20  of  like 
 you  know  junk  calories  per  day  I  promise
[114:05] you  you  will  get  [ __ ]  by  someone  who's 
 competing  with  you  if  there's  someone 
 else  who  wants  to  take  what  you've  got
[114:11] if  there's  someone  else  who's  got  the 
 same  business  as  you  and  he's  on 
 Carnivore  diet  he's  gonna  [ __ ]  you  up  so
[114:17] because  if  you're  in  work  mode  I  think 
 you  should  have  everything  optimized  for 
 work  mode  for  a  lot  of  us  young  guys  we
[114:24] probably  should  be  in  work  mode  because 
 this  is  an  awesome  time  for  us  to 
 develop  I  think  the  better  way  is  we  go
[114:29] into  these  periods  of  work  mode  we  try 
 and  be  as  disciplined  as  possible  with 
 our  diets  and  then  when  we  get  to  you
[114:35] know  this 
 two  weeks  in  three  weeks  in  that's  when 
 we  have  a  few  days  off  and  we  go  on  a
[114:40] little  trip  somewhere  because  this  gives 
 you  the  heightened  experience  so  if  you
[114:45] want  to  copy  this  what  I'd  suggest  is 
 get  onto  like  a  quite  strict  diet  and  I 
 don't  mean  stretched  by  like  you  know
[114:50] super  low  calories  because  that's 
 unhealthy  what  I  mean  strict  is  like  for 
 example
[114:55] no  sugar  no  carbs  preferably  which  means 
 that  you're  literally  just  eating  eggs
[115:02] steak  you  know  Meats 
 butter
[115:08] nuts  that's  about  it  that's  pretty  much 
 like  most  of  what  I  eat  I  have  halloumi 
 as  well  halloumi  is  a  kind  of  like  a
[115:14] Greek  um  goat  cheese  which  is  quite  nice 
 as  well  that's  it  it's  quite  boring  it
[115:19] still  tastes  kind  of  nice  because  if  you 
 can  cook  you  know  eggs  nicely  it  still 
 tastes  nice  if  you  can  cook  steak  well
[115:24] it  still  tastes  nice  but  it  does  feel 
 like  something's  missing  because  we've 
 had  carbs  with  every  meal  for  like  20
[115:30] years  but  your  brain  will  never  be  a 
 shop  here's  an  actionable  step  for  you 
 for  this  part  of  the  guide  write  down  a
[115:37] plan  for  your  workout  and  for  your  diet 
 have  it  super  clear  what  are  you  gonna 
 eat  every  day  what  time  are  you  gonna
[115:42] train  how  often  will  you  train  my  advice 
 is  train  every  single  day  at  the  same
[115:47] time  but  do  like  slightly  less  volume 
 than  you  would  if  you  were  doing  three 
 or  five  days  or  so  whatever  days  a  week
[115:52] this  way  that  it's  so  much  more 
 consistent  my  favorite  way  of  doing  this 
 is  just  the  Habit  trackers  as  I've  shown
[115:58] you  here  step  five  discipline  and 
 self-improvement  habits  so  it's  summer
[116:03] of  2022  and  I'm  in  Thailand  in  a  big 
 Villa  that  I've  rented  out  on  airbn  be
[116:08] I'm  sat  outside  next  to  the  pool  some  my 
 video  editor  sat  next  to  the  pool  he's
[116:13] reading  and  I'm  sat  there  recording  a 
 video  for  Youtube  and  the  videos  on
[116:18] mental  health  so  I  mean  I'm  talking 
 about  all  these  great  habits  that  you 
 can  get  into 
 eventually  I  end  up  finishing  the  video
[116:24] it's  pretty  good  I'm  proud  of  myself  you 
 know  here  we  are  in  a  different  country 
 being  digital  Nomads  and  I've  just  done
[116:29] this  deep  work  task  that's  probably  paid 
 for  the  next  few  days  of  our  stay  which 
 is  awesome  and  as  I  press  the  sort  of
[116:35] stop  button  on  my  camera 
 Sam  looks  over  to  me  and  he  he's  almost 
 like  smirking  a  little  bit  and  he  says
[116:41] Hamza  do  you  still  meditate  because  you 
 mention  it  in  all  of  your  mental  health 
 videos  but  I've  never  seen  you  meditate
[116:47] before 
 straight  away  out  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah 
 yeah  I  meditate  in  my  in  my  bedroom
[116:53] every  day 
 I'm  lying  I  used  to  meditate  every
[116:59] single  day  for  an  hour  I  was  known  as 
 The  Meditation  guy 
 but  at  this  point  I  hadn't  meditated  for
[117:05] the  last  year 
 and  yeah  I  was  still  known  as  The
[117:10] Meditation  guy  because  I  would  speak 
 about  it  so  often  and  I  hadn't  even  told 
 anyone  on  YouTube  or  anyone  who  knew  me
[117:16] that  I  pretty  much  like  quit  or  not  that 
 I  quit  but  that  I  just  kept  on  slacking
[117:21] on  that  I  wasn't  consistent  at  all  I'm 
 teaching  all  of  these  young  guys  around 
 the  world  of  all  these  Habits  Like
[117:26] meditation  and  I  don't  even  do  them 
 myself 
 and  so  I'm  feeling  like  a  fraud  Sam's
[117:31] words  plagued  my  mind  for  over  six 
 months  whilst  I  was  trying  to  get 
 consistent  in  meditation  again  and  I
[117:37] kept  on  failing 
 and  eventually  I  realized  why  so  only
[117:43] just  a  few  months  ago  I  realized  why  I 
 kept  on  struggling  to  get  consistent  in 
 meditation  again  even  though  when  I
[117:49] first  started  I  got  super  consistent  I 
 was  doing  it  for  an  hour  a  day  but  then 
 I  missed  it  for  over  a  year  and  a  half
[117:55] and  I  realized  for  me  it's  because  it 
 wasn't  in  my  morning  routine  anymore  you
[118:01] see  for  the  last  year  or  so  I've  seen  a 
 rise  of  a  bunch  of  YouTubers  and 
 influencers  who  almost  mock  the
[118:07] self-improvement  habits  who  mock  the 
 idea  of  like  a  morning  routine  and  you 
 know  they  think  it's  kind  of  cringe  or
[118:12] weird  and  you  know  there's  been  a 
 cultural  online  of  people  kind  of  saying 
 that  this  stuff  is  like  it  doesn't  work
[118:17] or  whatever  but  then  of  course  there's 
 been  a  culture  online  of  of  like  more
[118:22] qualified  people  like  Andrew  huberman 
 saying  that  this  stuff  of  course  it 
 works  cold  showers  of  course  it 
 increases  your  dopamine  meditation  of
[118:28] course  increases  your  focus 
 but  I  got  influenced  by  the  people  who 
 were  kind  of  disrespecting  the
[118:34] self-improvement  habits  and  you  know 
 saying  that  you  know  morning  routines  a 
 cringe  CEO  morning  routine  and  stuff
[118:40] and  when  I  don't  do  a  morning  routine  I 
 found  that  I  simply  just  don't  do  the
[118:46] self-improvement  habits  because  when  I 
 start  work  for  the  day  it's  like  I'm  in 
 work  mode  so  it's  like  it's  very  hard
[118:52] for  me  to  kind  of  like  get  out  of  that  I 
 found  that  I  have  like  a  pocket  of  time 
 like  a  window  of  between  like  8  A.M  to
[118:58] 9am  which  is  perfect  for  me  to  do  the 
 self-improvement  habits  so  I  wake  up 
 before  that  so  I  can  still  do  like  you
[119:04] know  the  deepest  work  and  wake  up  super 
 early  and  work  super  hard  on  like  the 
 four  guides  but  as  part  of  my  morning
[119:09] routine  I'll  go  outside  I'll  get 
 sunlight  into  my  eyes  whilst  I'm  reading 
 on  my  Kindle  so  it's  like  a  two  in  one  I
[119:15] bring  my  Kindle  up  here  like  up  into  the 
 sky  like  this  so  This  Way  like  the  sun's 
 rays  are  going  into  my  eyes  and  I'm  also
[119:20] like  reading  at  the  same  time  then  I'll 
 come  in  I'll  go  for  a  cold  shower  then
[119:25] I'll  straight  after  the  cold  shower  for 
 two  minutes  I'll  meditate  for  20  minutes 
 then  I'll  do  gratitude  journaling  then
[119:31] I'll  do 
 um  death  meditation  I'll  do  double  deep 
 breaths  I'll  do  like  I've  got  a  bunch  of 
 things  in  my  morning  routine  it  takes  me
[119:37] just  under  an  hour  and  people  find  it 
 like  sad  for  some  reason  which  I  don't 
 get  why  because  it's  like  it's  very
[119:42] wholesome  activities  that  genuinely  have 
 changed  my  life  forever  I  stopped 
 meditating  for  a  long  time  and  my
[119:48] anxiety  like  level  of  intrusive  thoughts 
 really  shot  up  like  I  really  started  to
[119:53] feel  how  I  used  to  feel  for  most  of  my 
 life  which  was  new  for  me  because  for  a
[119:58] solid  year  I  almost  forgot  what  it  was 
 like  to  to  feel  anxious  and  slowly  those
[120:04] anxious  thoughts  started  to  come  back 
 and  I  you  know  I  was  wasn't  so  conscious 
 as  to  why  and  it  was  because  I  just
[120:10] stopped  meditating  this  is  all  about  the 
 concept  of  progressing  one  percent  every 
 single  day  you  know  you've  heard  it
[120:15] before  be  one  percent  better  that 
 actually  comes  from  this  Japanese 
 philosophy  which  is  called  Kaizen  Kaizen
[120:21] is  is  this  kind  of  student  mindset  which 
 means  that  we  prioritize
[120:27] wanting  to  be  slightly  better  like  to 
 learn  something  and  to  be  slightly 
 better  today  every  single  day  for  the
[120:33] rest  of  our  lives  that's  where  like  the 
 concept  of  self-improvement  comes  from 
 it's  like  this  random  Japanese 
 philosophy  that  ended  up  you  know  like
[120:38] we  started  masking  over  it  with  just 
 these  sort  of  habits  and  everything  what 
 you'll  find  is  that  progress  creates
[120:44] happiness  when  you  are  consistently 
 progressing  in  your  developments  as  a
[120:50] man  you  will  consistently  feel  the 
 emotions  and  and  mood  of  happiness  every
[120:55] single  day  when  you  stop  progressing 
 that's  when  your  life  starts  to  turn
[121:00] quite  gray  and  dark  and  let's  say  for 
 example  you  stop  progressing  with  these 
 self-improvement  habits  but  you're  still
[121:06] getting  more  results  like  you're  making 
 more  and  more  money  it  does  nothing 
 telling  like  telling  you  from  my  own
[121:13] personal  experience  I  was  happier  when  I 
 was  totally  broke  but  I  was  meditating 
 an  hour  a  day  than  I  was  when  I  was
[121:20] living  in  Dubai  and  I  was  making  like 
 40K  a  month  because  when  you're  when  you 
 live  like  that  like  this  is  a  separate
[121:26] point  I  guess  but  when  you  know  that 
 you've  seen  this  this  lifestyle  that's 
 been  promoted  to  you  by  the  media  the
[121:31] influences  and  everything  right  when  you 
 live  that  kind  of  Lifestyle  people  only 
 show  you  the  Glamorous  part  of  it  but
[121:37] almost  like  what  I  found  is  when  you 
 sacrifice  these  wholesome  habits  like
[121:42] reading  like  meditating  like  journaling 
 and  you  start  to  make  a  lot  more  money
[121:48] you  still  don't  feel  happy  you  don't  get 
 as  much  power  as  you  think  you  do  by  the
[121:53] pursuit  of  wealth  instead  the  power 
 comes  from  the  exact  opposite  which  is
[121:58] needing  less  the  power  and  happiness  and 
 joy  and  fulfillment  and  success  doesn't
[122:03] come  from  achieving  your  desires  it 
 comes  from  destroying  the  desire  in  the
[122:09] first  place  soon  I'll  have  a  full  guide 
 on  Willpower  and  willpower  is  is  you 
 know  that  habit  that  we  said  is
[122:14] resisting  the  bad  desires  that  will  be 
 super  important  and  it'll  get  very  deep
[122:19] because  it's  not  just  about  you  know  not 
 watching  a  porn  it's  like  literally  not 
 losing  your  [ __ ]  soul  to
[122:25] these  influences  that  you  see  we've 
 probably  seen  this  concept  of  old  guys 
 who  have  worked  for  their  entire  lives
[122:32] and  then  at  some  point  when  they're  60 
 years  old  they  retire  and  their  life
[122:37] actually  gets  worse  afterwards  because 
 we  need  to  keep  working  on  something 
 this  the  studies  and  you  know  things
[122:43] that  I've  I've  read  and  looked  on  online 
 which  I'll  summarize  for  you  which  is 
 that  no  matter  what  our  age  is  we  still
[122:49] have  the  ability  to  to  use  what's  called 
 neuroplasty  which  means  kind  of  that  we 
 can  update  our  brain  with  new  beliefs
[122:56] and  learn  and  learning  and  wisdom 
 everyone  kind  of  understands  this  now 
 but  you  know  only  a  few  years  ago  people
[123:01] genuinely  thought  that  your  brain  stops 
 developing  past  like  the  age  of  25  which 
 is  completely  like  just  idiotic  your
[123:07] brain  develops  and  in  fact  your  brain 
 needs  to  develop  every  single  year  for 
 your  life  otherwise  you  start  having  a
[123:13] [ __ ]  existence  those  those  old  people 
 that  you  know  probably  your  parents  our 
 parents  our  great  grandparents
[123:20] destroying  their  lives  why  because  they 
 don't  [ __ ]  read  because  they  don't 
 learn  because  they're  just  setting  their
[123:26] own  ways  now  they're  dying 
 now  that  it's  Siri  and  now  the  health  is
[123:31] getting  worse  now  their  brain  is  getting 
 destroyed 
 soon  enough  they're  gonna  get
[123:36] Alzheimer's  and  they  won't  even  remember 
 your  name
[123:41] that's  what  happens  when  you  don't  keep 
 learning  and  progressing  when  you  don't
[123:46] use  your  brain  it  just  starts  to 
 deteriorate  so  we  need  to  already  have 
 this  mindset  we  don't  want  to  turn  out
[123:51] like  these  old  people  that  we  see  who 
 you  know  like  for  example  it's  kind  of 
 cute  but  also  not  that  you  know  like
[123:57] they  literally  don't  know  how  to  use 
 phones  and  stuff  we  might  say  that 
 that's  wholesome  it's  not  as  wholesome
[124:02] as  you  think  when  you  can  see  genuinely 
 that  they're  experiencing  like  minor 
 forms  of  brain  damage  because  they're
[124:07] not  learning  we  should  be  old  and  we 
 should  know  how  to  use  the  newest
[124:12] Technologies  because  we're  learning  how 
 to  use  it  now  we  shouldn't  be  addicted 
 to  them  of  course  we  you  know  we  want  to
[124:17] be  wise  enough  not  to  be  addicted  to 
 like  VR  porn  or  whatever  the  [ __ ]  like 
 um AI  sex  spots  or  something  when  they
[124:22] come  out  but  we  should  know  how  to 
 navigate  AI  although  whatever  technology 
 there  is  a  hundred  years  from  now  we
[124:28] should  know  how  to  use  these  things  we 
 should  continuously  keep  learning  and  so 
 if  you  can  start  to  visualize  that  and
[124:33] almost  write  it  down 
 to  form  a  new  identity  for  yourself  that 
 you  are  a  lifelong  student  that  you'll
[124:41] always  keep  learning  because  really  ask 
 yourself  people  don't  do  this  brother 
 make  a  decision  right  now  is  that  the 
 life  you  want  to  live  do  you  plan  to
[124:47] stop  learning  and  do  like  want  your 
 brain  to  just  stop  developing  at  a
[124:52] certain  age  or  do  you  want  to  set  the 
 intention  that  you've  probably  like  to 
 keep  learning  and  developing  and
[124:58] enjoying  and  gaining  wisdom  every  single 
 day  for  the  rest  of  your  life  and  it'll 
 probably  make  your  life  better  and
[125:03] you'll  probably  live  longer  set  that 
 intention  clear  right  now  I  am  a
[125:08] lifelong  students  I'm  Gonna  Keep 
 learning  for  as  long  as  I  live  I'm  gonna 
 be  the  80  year  old  who's  still  reading
[125:13] books  every  single  day  I'm  going  to  be 
 the  90  year  old  who's  still  exercising
[125:18] of  course  I  am 
 people  don't  really  set  this  intention 
 and  then  they  surprise  when  life  just 
 hits  them  and  they're  fat  and  disgusting
[125:25] and  stupid  when  they're  50  years  old 
 never  mind  70.  and  guess  what  the  worst
[125:30] part  of  all  this  is 
 guys 
 our  age  who  are  doing  the  same  things
[125:37] there's  guys  our  age  whose  brains  and 
 bodies  have  already  started  to
[125:42] deteriorate  not  even  70  years  old  not  50 
 years  old  at  20  years  old  25  years  old
[125:47] they're  literally  poisoning  themselves 
 with  alcohol  every  week  they  take  drugs 
 they're  sleep  deprived  they're  [ __ ]
[125:53] up  their  brain  and  their  dopamine 
 receptors  they're  taking  medications 
 which  they  don't  even  know  the  side
[125:58] effects  of 
 content  consumption  and  porn  and  video 
 games  [ __ ]  disgusting  food  destroying
[126:04] their  guts  wondering  why  they  feel  like 
 [ __ ]  all  the  time  and  why  they  have  to 
 cover  it  up  with  more  and  more
[126:09] substances 
 there's  people  our  age  who  are  already 
 like  acting  as  if  they're  80  years  old
[126:16] like  they've  got  like  you  know  no  time 
 left  now  you  may  as  well  just  like 
 slowly  start  killing  yourself  with 
 substances
[126:22] they're  destroying  their  brains  ability 
 to  think  and  to  learn  and  these  same
[126:27] people  will  complain  when  you  make  more 
 money  than  them  and  they'll  say  oh  we 
 should  tax  you  we  should  steal  money
[126:33] from  you  we  should  eat  the  rich  that's 
 what  they'll  say  but  they  literally  wear 
 necklaces  and
[126:40] they  literally  wear  these  types  of 
 people  I  know  them  okay  they  literally 
 wear  necklaces  which  has  like  a  little
[126:46] small  metal  spoon  which  is  what  they  use 
 the  [ __ ]  key  cat  like  a  key  cat  is  a
[126:51] phrase  where  like  this  ketamine  like  a 
 [ __ ]  party  drug  in  the  UK  and  these 
 little  degenerates  will  put  it  into  the
[126:56] bag  of  cats  like  this  drug  and  so  they 
 can  sniff  it  they'll  have  a  piece  of 
 [ __ ]  jewelry  that  they  wear  for  easy
[127:02] access  to  be  able  to  scoop  drugs  into 
 their  nose  already  destroying  their
[127:07] brains  and  their  their  body's  health  and 
 they'll  look  to  you  when  you  make  money 
 and  say  that  oh  yeah  you  should  be  taxed
[127:14] more  because  it's  unfair  that  you  make 
 more  money 
 there's  people  who  live  like  that  right 
 now
[127:20] that's  an  extreme  example  obviously  of 
 like  the  total  degenerates  of  the  world 
 the  thing  is  that  the  50  year  old  who
[127:25] doesn't  read  a  book  is  not  far  from  that 
 the  50  year  old  who's  been  drinking 
 alcohol  for  the  last  30  35  years  he's
[127:31] not  far  from  that  the  first  step  to 
 living  a  great  life  is  to  just  set  the
[127:36] intention  and  to  be  honest  with  yourself 
 and  say  you  know  what  this  is  the  life  I 
 want  to  live  I  want  to  be  old  and  I  want
[127:42] to  be  healthy  and  I  want  to  still  be 
 able  to  go  to  the  gym  when  I'm  90  years 
 old  because  bro  this  there's  literally
[127:48] like  a  92  year  old  or  something  like 
 maybe  82  year  old  African
[127:53] um 
 I  think  he's  from  Kenya  he  comes  to  my 
 gym  I  haven't  seen  him  in  a  little  while
[127:58] actually  so  maybe  that's  concerning  but 
 like  he  comes  to  my  gym  and  he  does  like 
 an  hour  of  cardio  every  day
[128:04] and  here  we  are  people  our  age 
 literally  do  less  than  an  hour  of  cardio
[128:09] a  month  let  me  tell  you  the  story  of  two 
 men  these  two  men  are  very  similar  they
[128:14] both  work  at  the  same  job  and  after  they 
 finish  their  shift  they  drive  home
[128:19] one  of  the  men  listens  to  the  news  and 
 then  sometimes  he  also  changes  that  to
[128:24] his  Spotify  playlist  and  the  other  man 
 listens  to  podcasts  the  first  guy  is
[128:29] driving  home  but  before  he  gets  home  he 
 makes  a  stop  to  McDonald's  and  he  just
[128:34] picks  up  a  small  thing  there  like  a 
 McFlurry  and  he  goes  home  and  he  just 
 has  that 
 the  second  guy  drives  home  without  that
[128:40] stop  without  the  McFlurry  the  rest  of 
 the  day  is  exactly  the  same  imagine  that
[128:45] 100  the  same  it's  only  the  difference  is 
 what  they're  listening  to  in  the  car  and 
 whether  or  not  they  picked  up  like  a
[128:51] little  200  calorie  ice  cream  on  the  way 
 home 
 in  20  years
[128:56] the  guy  on  the  left  is  morbidly  obese
[129:01] just  an  extra  100  200  calories  a  day 
 over  like  10  years  is  like  50  pounds  of
[129:07] fat  and  that's  if  it  literally  stays 
 with  just  like  you  know  it's  like  it's
[129:12] in  a  vacuum  you  only  gain  the  200. 
 naturally  you  can  imagine  the  fat  ass 
 who  stops  for  ice  cream  every  day  is
[129:18] going  to  be  more  likely  to  also  get 
 other  things  as  well  you  know  it's  going 
 to  compound  not  just  like  linearly  but 
 also  like  he's  going  to  be  way  more
[129:24] likely  to  cheat  on  his  diet  even  more 
 not  only  that 
 he's  actually  working  in  the  exact  same
[129:29] job  20  years  later  because  he's  not 
 learning  the  other  guy  listens  to  a 
 podcast  for  30  minutes  on  his  way  back
[129:36] home  he's  listening  to  Chris  Williamson 
 podcast  Deep  dive  with  Ali  abdall  he's 
 listening  to  something  intelligence  and
[129:42] with  that  he  got  one  promotion  after 
 let's  say  four  years  then  one  more  then 
 one  more
[129:47] and  he  makes  at  least 
 triple  what  this  guy  does  he  still  makes
[129:52] like  45k  a  year  decades  later  this  guy 
 makes  like  120k  this  guy's  actually
[129:58] relatively  in  shape  this  guy's  morbidly 
 obese  and  we  only  change  two  variables
[130:03] literally  just  what  you  listen  to  in  the 
 car  for  30  minutes  a  day  and  whether  or 
 not you  stop  to  pick  up  ice  cream  and
[130:08] we're  saying  that  this  is  all  like  in  a 
 vacuum  because  again  the  person 
 listening  to  the  music  is  probably  going
[130:14] to  be  much  more  likely  to  be  a 
 degenerate  and  sex  obsessed  you  know 
 that's  the  state  of  Music  These  Days 
 he's  also  going  to  be  listening  to  the
[130:20] news  which  means  that  his  cortisol  is 
 higher  which  means  it  sleeps  worse  his 
 performance  and  work  is  worse  his 
 relationship  so  worse  so  it's  a  lot  more
[130:26] of  an  effect  than  we  think  but  even  if 
 we're  just  being  nice  to  this  guy 
 literally  just  the  objective  facts  is
[130:31] that  he  makes  three  times  less  and  he's 
 three  times  as  fat  as  this  one  with 
 those  two  small  changes  That's  The
[130:36] Compound  Effect  in  action  You  Don't  See 
 Much  day  to  day  you  can  have  the  ice 
 cream  and  it  doesn't  actually  do  much  to
[130:42] your  physique  right  now  but  if  you  do 
 that  two  three  four  times  a  week  if  you 
 go  to  McDonald's  like  you  know  once  a
[130:47] week  compared  to  the  guy  who  doesn't  go 
 at  all  if  you  have  that  that  extra 
 little  bit  of  sugar  every  single  day  you
[130:52] know  20  of  your  calories  on  junk  food 
 and  eighty  percent  on  unhealthy  food 
 that's  when  over  years  it  makes  a  much
[131:00] bigger  difference  so  it's  your  gift  to 
 your  future  self  to  be  thinking  about 
 The  Compound  Effect  and  thinking  that
[131:06] small  choices  will  really  change  your 
 future  self's  life  a  lot  here's  an 
 actionable  step  for  you  decide  one  good
[131:14] small  thing  that  you  could  do  very  small 
 I'm  talking  the  equivalent  of  like  50 
 calories  for  example  you  could  go  for  a
[131:20] walk  every  single  day  for  just  10 
 minutes  that's  it  what  a  good  habit 
 that's  small  that  you  could  start  to  do
[131:26] every  single  day  for  the  rest  of  your 
 life  maybe  it's  three  minutes  of 
 meditation  maybe  it's  five  minutes  of
[131:33] prayer  maybe  it's  five  minutes  of  deep 
 breathing  or  it's  five  minutes  of 
 reading  maybe  it's  five  minutes  of
[131:38] walking  outside  maybe  it's  five  minutes 
 of  just  playing  with  your  dog  with  no 
 distractions  at  all  what's  a  very  small 
 thing  for  less  than  five  minutes  and
[131:44] then  also  what's  a  bad  habit  that  you'll 
 stop  doing  a  very  small  bad  habit  maybe
[131:50] it's  putting  sugar  in  your  coffee  or 
 your  tea  maybe  it's  using  like  one  of 
 those  [ __ ]  artificial  sweeteners
[131:55] which  are  as  bad  as  sugar  or  even  worse 
 because  it's  just  got  weird  chemicals 
 and  maybe  you  just  stop  doing  that  maybe
[132:00] you  stop  putting  in  whole  milk  which  is 
 full  of  estrogenic  materials  you  know
[132:05] they've  put  stuff  the  cow  full  of 
 disgusting  stuff  and  it's  been  bottled 
 in  plastic  and  everything  maybe  you  just 
 stop  putting  milk  in  your  coffee
[132:11] these  two  changes  if  you  can  make  it 
 easy  enough  to  literally  follow  them
[132:16] every  single  day  for  the  rest  of  your 
 life  and  of  course  knowing  you're 
 probably  still  going  to  miss  like  a 
 thousand  days  you'll  be
[132:23] significantly  very  significantly 
 different  20  years  from  now  more  than
[132:28] you'd  realize  you  know  why  just  if  we  do 
 the  math  that  literally  just  you  know 
 the  splash  of  milk  that  you  put  into
[132:34] your  coffee  is  like  30  calories  50 
 calories  right  if  we  just  do  the  math
[132:39] that  if  you  had  that  every  single  day 
 for  10  years  for  50  like  20  years  30 
 years  there's  the  difference  of  like
[132:44] literally  50  pounds  of  pure  fat  but  and 
 never  mind  the  estrogenic  testosterone
[132:49] killing  effects  of  milk  and  everything 
 but  also  we  know  that  one  decision  often 
 leads  to  the  next  and  so  if  you  stop  for
[132:54] example  putting  in  artificial  sweeteners 
 you  know  like  two  grams  of  sugar  in  your 
 coffee  every  single  day  because  of  the
[133:00] impact  of  that  you'd  be  more  likely  to 
 create  another  really  good  change  and 
 another  one  and  another  one  and  you
[133:06] become  so  different  I  want  to  give  you 
 some  hope  now  I'm  a  little  bit  older 
 than  a  lot  of  the  guys  who  watch  me  on
[133:11] average  hour  audience  is  quite  young 
 it's  like  16  17  18  19  20  years  old  I'm 
 26.  I'm  telling  you  right  now  by  the
[133:17] time  you  get  to  about  25  26  years  old 
 that's  when  you  really  start  to  first
[133:23] see  the  difference  between  you  and  the 
 men  your  age  you  know  when  you're  18 
 years  old  you  don't  see  much  a  lot  of
[133:29] it's  actually  quite  based  on  like 
 genetics  and  early  positive  feedback 
 loops  there's  like  there's  an  absolute 
 imbecile  who's  more  popular  than  you  and
[133:35] might  even  make  more  money  than  you  when 
 you're  18  or  20  or  21  years  old  because 
 they  got  the  positive  feedback  loop  you
[133:40] know  there's  there's  a  guy  who's  kind  of 
 attractive  but  he's  kind  of  like  brain 
 dead  and  he  doesn't  even  work  hard  and
[133:45] he's  getting  more  girls  than  you  when 
 you're  16  years  old  or  even  when  you're 
 21  years  old  because  he's  got  nicer  hair
[133:50] he's  got  a  jawline  he's  you  know  he's 
 like  more  attractive 
 give  it  another  like  five  years  when  The
[133:55] Compound  Effect  takes  off  once  you  get 
 to  around  like  you're  closer  to  your 
 late  20s  it  starts  to  become  apparent
[134:01] when  you  see  that  like  everyone  you  went 
 to  high  school  with  or  let's  say  90  of 
 people  that  you  go  to  high  school  with
[134:06] have  gained  like  20  pounds  30  pounds  of 
 pure  fat  because  they've  been  drinking
[134:11] every  single  weekend  for  the  last 
 [ __ ]  eight  years  even  more  because  in 
 these  degenerate  cultures  in  the  UK  for
[134:18] example  people  drink  when  they're  like 
 15  14  years  old  so  people  my  age  I've 
 been  drinking  most  weeks  for  about  12
[134:25] years  now  I'm  still  guilty  of  this 
 because  I  drank  heavily  for  a  few  years 
 when  I  went  to  University  and  I  was  a
[134:31] like  a  degenerate  and  everything 
 but  for  the  past  few  years  it's  been 
 very  minimal  for  the  last  like  what
[134:37] seven  eight  months  it's  been  absolutely 
 zero 
 The  Compound  Effect  is  showing  in  my
[134:44] life  and  the  people  that  I  come  across 
 and  I  think  this  is  just  the  start  I 
 wonder  what  it's  going  to  be  like  five
[134:49] or  ten  twenty  years  from  now  I'm  a 
 patient  guy  20  years  from  now  What's  it
[134:54] gonna  be  when  I'm  the  guy  who  just  I 
 meditate  20  minutes  every  single  morning 
 I  don't  miss  it  anymore  what's  that  one
[134:59] Change  Gonna  lead  to  20  years  from  now 
 this  is  what  excites  me  of  like  the
[135:05] future  of  being  on  self-improvement  of 
 watching  stuff  like  this  of  implementing 
 these  small  things
[135:10] if  you  are  a  long-term  thinker  which  you 
 probably  are  if  you've  watched  you  know 
 like  two  hours  of  this  video  so  far
[135:17] there's  a  lot  of  power  in  these  small 
 changes  and  I  know  that  you  know  like  we
[135:23] shouldn't  be  in  the  vibe  of  looking  down 
 at  other  people  but  you  can't  help  but
[135:28] in  a  way  feels  sad  but  also  in  a  way 
 just  feels  super  [ __ ]  happy  that 
 you're  part  of  the  enlightened  group  who
[135:34] understands  The  Compound  Effect  of 
 self-improvements  of  Kaizen  of 
 progressive  overload  because  the  people
[135:39] that  you've  went  to  school  with  don't 
 and  if  you're  younger  than  me  right  now 
 like  right  now  it's  gonna  seem  like  this
[135:45] stuff  isn't  doing  much  because  they're 
 better  than  you  in  quite  a  lot  of  ways 
 and  the  difference  will  be  [ __ ]  huge
[135:52] and  that's  the  start 
 then  every  year  after  that  that's  when
[135:57] you  know  like  because  The  Compound 
 Effect  starts  becoming  exponential 
 that's  when  it  starts  the  show  and  it's
[136:02] like  suddenly  they're  35  they've 
 actually  got  like  serious  health 
 problems  they've  had  their  first  like
[136:07] major  health  scare  right  now 
 here  you  are  in  the  best  health  of  your
[136:12] entire  life  because  you've  been 
 improving  your  sleep  for  the  past  10 
 years  15  years  you've  been  exercising
[136:19] consistently  for  15  years  you've  been 
 trying  to  improve  your  diet  you  quit 
 porn  [ __ ]  14  years  ago  compare  that
[136:26] to  the  average  guy  who  10  years  from  now 
 is  literally  gonna  be  addicted  to  like 
 the  the  most
[136:31] the  uh  the  most  unreal  sex  bots 
 available
[136:37] there's  a  good  future  ahead  for  the  guys 
 who  commit  themselves  to 
 self-improvements  step  five  when  you
[136:43] become  successful  so  imagine  that  you've 
 been  grinding  away  for  a  long  time
[136:48] you've  been  developing  yourself  you've 
 been  disciplined  in  yourself  and  you've 
 been  moderating  your  desires
[136:53] eventually  you  build  the  success  that 
 you've  wanted  all  this  time  you  build
[136:58] the  physique  you  get  the  girl  you  make 
 the  money  you  get  the  status  this  is 
 where  Discipline  matters  most
[137:05] and  this  is  also  where  hard-working  guys 
 end  up  messing  up
[137:10] because  when  you  get  those  things  that 
 you  thought  you  wanted  that's  when  you
[137:16] take  your  foot  off  the  pedal 
 that's  when  you  stop  grinding  as  hard 
 that's  when  you  get  distracted  success
[137:22] mark  my  words  when  I  say  this  success 
 leads  to  opportunities  that  will  destroy
[137:29] your  success  let  me  give  you  an  example 
 let's  say  there's  a  young  man  who  wants 
 to  be  an  entrepreneur  and  he  starts
[137:35] working  super  super  hard  he's  literally 
 living  at  home  with  his  parents  and  he's
[137:40] grinding  away  he  wakes  up  he  does  a 
 bunch  of  deep  work  he  just  does  you  know 
 like  a  quick  like  workout  that's  really
[137:45] good  for  his  brain  he's  eating  a  very 
 simple  diet  and  he's  just  grinding  on 
 this  business  that  means  a  lot  to  him
[137:50] and  he  does  that  literally  for  months 
 and  months  and  months  reads  books 
 constantly  learns  you  know  limits  the
[137:56] input  that's  coming  in  from  other  people 
 and  he's  just  working  on  this  one  goal 
 of  making  10K  a  month  20K  a  month  30k  a
[138:02] month  in  his  business  actually 
 eventually  after  a  long  time 
 starts  to  do  really  well
[138:09] what  might  happen  to  this  young  man
[138:14] he's  gonna  upgrade  his  lifestyle 
 he  might  end  up  getting  a  nice 
 girlfriend  and  she  might  not  be  nice
[138:22] suddenly  he's  got  a  watch  that  he  wants 
 to  show  off  on  Instagram  and  he's  got  a 
 car  and  he's  got  this  like  nice  little
[138:27] dinner  and  these  things  seem  nice  and 
 yet 
 he  isn't  waking  up  early  and  working  on
[138:32] his  business  anymore 
 it's completely  distracted  he's  not
[138:37] doing  the  thing  that  caused  him  to  to 
 have  this  momentum 
 and  it's  awesome  you  know  I  mean  the
[138:43] money's  coming  in  you  know  strike 
 notification  to  the  group  chat  to  the 
 like  you  know  the  Instagram  and  the
[138:48] YouTube  thumbnails  everyone's  validating 
 him  and  what  he's  not  realizing  is  right 
 now  he's  riding  on  the  success  of  his
[138:54] younger  self  but  he's  not  adding  to  it 
 he's  not  planting  more  seeds  so  that  his 
 future  self  can  still  have  ripe  fruit  he
[139:00] stopped  planting 
 what  happens
[139:05] one  month  two  months  three  months  from 
 now 
 the  momentum  starts  to  drop
[139:12] he  isn't  doing  what  got  him  here
[139:18] and  worse  than  that 
 he  might  end  up  going  too  far  into  the
[139:23] distractions  he  might  for  example  this 
 happens  to  so  many  guys  and  you  need  to 
 take  this  seriously  he  might  end  up
[139:29] getting  the  wrong  girl  pregnant 
 because  when  he  had  less  success  when  he 
 was  less  disciplined  no  girls  were  into
[139:35] him  and  as  he  started  to  become  more 
 disciplined  which  can  happen  to  you 
 suddenly  more  girls  are  into  him  but  he
[139:41] hasn't  really  like  you  know  really 
 clarified  it  in  his  mind  of  the  risks
[139:48] that  could  come  about  this  now  obviously 
 if  it  ends  up being  like  this  beautiful 
 relationship  and  they  want  to  have 
 children  that's  obviously  different  but
[139:54] let's  say  for  example  this  wasn't  part 
 of  his  plan  he  didn't  expect  to  have 
 children  right  now  but  he  was  just  being 
 a  bit  foolish  careless
[140:02] idiotic 
 so  he  gets  a  woman  pregnant 
 he's  bought  a  car  that's  fifty  thousand
[140:09] dollars  maybe  a  seventy  five  thousand 
 dollars
[140:15] and  now  he  needs  that  money  back 
 you  see  the  same  thing  so  often  with
[140:21] athletes  there's  an  athlete  right  now 
 who's  training  maybe  two  three  times  a 
 day  he's  stretching  he  literally  goes
[140:27] this  sweaty  like  kind  of  almost  run  down 
 gym  and  he  trains  hard  as  hell  there  he 
 comes  back  and  he  does  stretches  at  home
[140:33] he's  eating  the  perfect  diet  he's 
 obsessing  over  he's  reading  the  books 
 listening  to  audio  programs  mentally
[140:38] visualizing  he's  putting  in  the  work  and 
 then  he  actually  gets  the  success 
 because  these  are  the  things  that  cause
[140:43] the  success  so  he  ends  up  playing  really 
 well  in  you  know  the  game  of  basketball 
 or  he  he  joins  the  UFC  or  something  he
[140:48] does  really  well 
 but  then  the  fame  the  women  that  the
[140:53] parties  sex  money  opportunities  all 
 these  things  that  he  thought  he  wanted 
 they  come  into  his  life  and  he  starts  to
[140:59] indulge  and  then  you  see  pictures  of 
 Conor  McGregor  and  he's  there  you  know 
 drinking  and  he's  at  the  party  and 
 everything  everyone  wants  to  take
[141:04] pictures  with  him  and  what  happens 
 because  whilst  he's  there  staying  up 
 late
[141:10] there's  another  athlete  who's  still  in 
 the  sweaty  gym  who's  still  coming  home
[141:16] and  stretching  and  then  going  back  to 
 this  the  sweaty  gym  after  that
[141:21] and  what  happens  when  these  two  men 
 compete  with  each  other 
 the  guy  who's  still  focused  who's  still
[141:28] disciplined  is  gonna  destroy  him 
 and  so  right  now  you  might  get  you  know
[141:33] a  little  bit  depressed  hearing  this 
 because  you  might  be  thinking  and 
 correct  me  if  I'm  wrong  right  you  might 
 be  thinking  but  then  when  do  I  get  to
[141:39] enjoy  the  success  you  know  it  like  I 
 unders  you  can  probably  understand  this
[141:44] concept  of  like  success  can  lead  to  the 
 distractions  but  you  might  be  getting 
 really  upset  thinking  like  but  like 
 that's  the  point  of  it  right  that's  the
[141:50] point  like  you  know  I  want  to  be  able  to 
 experience  the  women  in  the  parties  and 
 and  you  know  the  status  and  the  money
[141:55] and  everything  right 
 again  this  is  when  you  may  realize
[142:02] if  we  have  the  maturity  to  to  you  know 
 be  the  enlightened  ones
[142:07] but  the  reward  for  discipline  was  never 
 the  material  success 
 that's  what  the  average  person's
[142:13] ambition  is  the  Instagram  Likes 
 the  woman  open  up  her  legs  that's  it
[142:20] this  is  like  a  normal  person's  ambition 
 maybe  a  superior  man's  ambition  is
[142:27] personal  fulfillments 
 progression  to  realizing  and  opening  and
[142:35] embodying  your  purpose  as  a  man  you've 
 heard  about  how  important  purposes  Maybe
[142:41] that's  the  reward  of  discipline  it's 
 nowhere  near  as  cool  it's  not  going  to 
 get  you  as  many  likes  on  Instagram
[142:47] but  it  will  mean  that  you  will  die  with 
 a  smile  on  your  face  rather  than  the  man 
 who  looks  back  and  thinks  man  I  I  could
[142:52] have  been  the  champion  and  yet  the 
 cocaine  and  the  pretty  women  with  fig 
 titties  got  me
[142:58] just  like  every  other  stupid  man  who 
 becomes  successful
[143:06] if  my  younger  self  was  watching  this 
 right  now  a  few  years  ago  this  is  the
[143:11] point  where  he'd  lose  interest  because 
 it  just  he  would  not  be  able  to 
 comprehend  what  I'm  saying  here  because 
 his  mind  was  all  about  the  material
[143:17] desires  and  I  really  want  to  help  you 
 with  this  I  will  have  a  full  guide  to 
 willpower  that's  what  we're  going  to
[143:23] talk  about  like  resisting  these  like  bad 
 desires  and  trust  me  when  I  say  when  you
[143:28] see  that  full  guide  come  out  will 
 powerful  guide 
 it's  blowing  my  mind  of  what  I'm 
 learning  in  it  but  let  me  just  give  you
[143:34] like  a  quick  like  a  little  bit  here 
 the  desires  that  form  in  your  mind  will
[143:39] take  you  away  from  the  things  that  are 
 more  important  these  desires  that  you 
 have  you  know  the  idea  is  okay  we're
[143:45] being  disciplined  because  if  we're 
 totally  honest 
 because  we'd  like  to  [ __ ]
[143:50] because  we'd  like  to  be  invited  to  the 
 party  because  we'd  like  the  Instagram 
 likes  or  you  know  the  nice  handshake
[143:55] from  another  guy 
 where's  that  desire  really  coming  from
[144:01] genuinely  where  is  the  desire  really 
 coming  from  for  this  validation  you  know
[144:06] the  girl  and  the  the  cocaine  at  the 
 party  where's  the  desire  coming  from 
 probably  from  somewhere  in  childhood
[144:12] because  like  a  six-year-old  friend  that 
 you  had  didn't  invite  you  to  a  birthday 
 party  and  that's  like  a  wound  that  we've
[144:18] kept  deep  inside  of  us  for  10  15  years 
 later  we're  here  now  dedicating 
 ourselves  12  hours  a  day  of  work  to  try
[144:24] and  get  like  the  same  equivalence  of 
 that  that's  the  wound  that's  directing 
 our  adult  lives
[144:31] if  you  throw  all  away  the  immaturity 
 there  and  you  really  think  to  yourself 
 like  what  is  it  that  I  want  out  of  life
[144:37] it's  probably  not  to  have  stupid 
 unintelligent  people  next  to  you
[144:43] it  probably  is  definitely  to  be 
 financially  well  off  and  I  I  think 
 that's  a  pretty  good  desire  but  it
[144:49] probably  isn't  you  know  if  you  peel  back 
 the  [ __ ]  it  probably  isn't  to  be 
 like  rich
[144:55] 10K  a  month  50k  a  month  you  know  every 
 everyone  in  your  family  is  retired 
 fantastic
[145:00] past  that  point  it's  like  what  is  the 
 gain  of  more  money  at  that  point
[145:06] right  now  if  you  make  more  money  just 
 because  you're  contributing  more  value 
 to  the  the  world  yeah  sure  but  then  at
[145:11] that  point  it's  like  the  focus  changes 
 to  contribution  to  your  craft  to  your
[145:16] fulfillment  and  you  know  to  achieve  flow 
 state  every  day
[145:21] but  a  lot  of  guys  get  distracted  when 
 they  get  here  you  can  choose  to  stick  at
[145:26] the  level  you're  at  right  now  and  to 
 enjoy  that  level  or  you  can  twist  and 
 you  can  actually  reach  for  the  next
[145:32] level  the  next  level  of  discipline  the 
 next  level  of  dedication  and  sacrifice 
 and  this  seems  so  weird  right  so  you
[145:37] could  get  to  a  point  let's  say  you've 
 got  a  six-pack  you're  making  75k  a  year
[145:42] there's  girls  on  Instagram  who  are 
 messaging  you  first  you've  got  a  nice 
 hurt  genuinely  visualize  this  you
[145:47] literally  get  a  notification  on 
 Instagram  where  there's  that  autistic 
 rating  but  there's  a  6.5  girl  who's  in
[145:54] your  city  who's  literally  messages  you 
 flirty  you  could  probably  ban  tonight 
 the  majority  of  guys  will  stay  here  so
[146:01] do  you  know  how  easy  it  is  to  [ __ ] 
 destroy  them 
 most  guys  as  soon  as  they  get  to  the
[146:07] level  where  they  start  getting  some 
 attention  from  women  they'll  stick  there 
 and  then  what  happens
[146:13] the  six  pack  turns  into  a  four  pack 
 the  75k  a  year  in  their  business  starts
[146:19] going  down  because  they  stopped  doing 
 the  thing  waking  up  early  being 
 dedicated  meditating  and  everything  that
[146:24] got  them  there  you  know  one  night  off  of 
 course  is  absolutely  fine  but  when 
 you're  consistently  two  three  nights  a
[146:29] week  you're  waking  up  late  because  you 
 know  that  girl  came  over  again  and  you 
 had  like  some  wine  or  alcohol  or  sugar
[146:35] with  her  and  like  imagine  that  micro 
 habit
[146:40] along  an  entire  year  compared  to  that 
 like  monk  mode  of  like  spiritual  Focus
[146:45] that  you  had 
 that's  sticking  with  where  you're  at  now 
 and  the  thing  is  sticking  with  where  you
[146:51] are  now  is  a  myth  because  if  you  stick 
 with  where  you  are  now  you  naturally 
 will  just  get  worse  you  know  that  like
[146:56] there's  a  phrase  which  has  like 
 maintenance  is  a  myth  like  like  just 
 maintaining  in  life  is  a  myth  because
[147:01] everyone  else  is  still  more  competitive 
 so  if  you  are  number  50  you  can't  just 
 stay  at  number  50  by  like  you  know
[147:06] maintaining  because  there's  other  guys 
 who  are  competitive  in  life  and  so  when 
 someone  else  beats  you  you're  51  then  52
[147:12] right  so  you  can  stick  here  and  enjoy 
 some  of  the  results  of  like  this  point
[147:18] in  life  let's  say  this  point  in  life  is 
 60  of  your  potential  most  guys  don't 
 even  get  here  most  guys  genuinely  get  to
[147:24] like  25  to  35  of  their  potential  and 
 they  stop  there  why
[147:30] because  there's  a  girl  that  they 
 genuinely  consider  a  five  or  a  six  out
[147:35] of  ten  and  they'll  stop  there  again  I'm 
 not  saying  these  like  ratings  to  be  like 
 mean  or  anything  this  is  just  you  know
[147:40] to  explain  things 
 they'll  stop  there 
 some  of  the  more  ambitious  guys  will  go
[147:46] one  level  up  they'll  get  the  six-pack 
 they'll  get  to  12  body  fat  and  then
[147:51] they'll  stop  there  they've  got  a  girl 
 who's  6.5  who  says  seven  now  and  you 
 know  this  is  absolutely  fine  and  then
[147:56] they'll  stop  working  as  hard  then 
 they'll  relax 
 it  takes  a  true  killer  to  get  to  the
[148:02] point  where  like  you  have  a  huge  success 
 and  you're  still  just  [ __ ]
[148:08] disciplining  yourself  not  even  for  the 
 greed  not  even  for  the  money
[148:15] before  the  journey  that  it  takes  you  on 
 for  the  simple  desire  of  actually
[148:21] wanting  to  see  what  your  potential  is 
 and  this  is  where
[148:26] I'm  pretty  proud  of  myself 
 because  when  I  started  this  journey  a
[148:31] good  few  years  ago  you  know  being  on 
 self-improvement  and  being  productive 
 genuinely  I'm  not  lying  when  I  say
[148:37] I  did  it  for  girls 
 I  did  it  because  I  wanted  to  get  laid  I
[148:42] stuck  at  these  like  earlier  levels  and  I 
 was  going  to  be  happy  there
[148:47] but  there  was  this  voice  that  maybe  it's 
 internal  maybe  it  was  something  that  was
[148:52] built  inside  of  me  if  I  was  gonna  say 
 something  I  think  this  voice  came  from  a
[148:57] lot  of  introspectiveness  because  I  do  a 
 lot  of  meditation  and  journaling  and 
 also  from  Wise  mentors  like  I  don't  have
[149:03] any  real  mentors  but  I  just  read  a  lot 
 of  books  reading  not  watching  YouTube  is 
 a  very  different  thing  I  read  a  lot  of
[149:09] books  from  intelligent  people  and  by 
 these  two  things  of  introspectiveness 
 and  wisdom
[149:14] I  couldn't  ever  stay  like  stuck  at  the 
 level  that  I  was  at  with  the  success
[149:19] that  I  do  have 
 I'm  still  waking  up  at  5am  every  day
[149:24] I  still  live  at  home  with  my  parents 
 because  I  did  level  up  my  life  I  did
[149:29] stick  there  I  did  get  the  apartment  in 
 Dubai  genuinely  I  moved  to  Dubai  and 
 everything  I  did  get  the  ten  thousand
[149:34] dollar  a  month  apartment  in  Dubai  I  did 
 post  the  pictures  of  the  Rolex  and  give 
 them  a  nice  shirt  and  everything  I  did
[149:39] that  I  did  make  the  mistake  right  but  I 
 got  myself  out  of  it  after  two  months  of 
 doing  that  and  realizing  like  that's  a
[149:45] stupid  life  and  that  it  was  just  a 
 distraction  from  what  got  me  here 
 it  made  me  realize  and  like  reframe  my
[149:52] mind  which  I  really  want  to  happen  to 
 you  at  this  point  if  you  started  getting 
 like  a  good  level  of  success  you  might 
 be  watching  this  if  you've  not  got  that
[149:58] just  yet  but  there's  going  to  be  a  time 
 if  you  follow  the  principles  from  this 
 full  guide  that  you  do  get  like  a  really
[150:03] good  level  of  success  and  this  concept 
 is  probably  hopefully  going  to  be  in 
 your  mind  thinking  Should  I  stick  or
[150:09] should  I  twist  here  should  I  just  start 
 enjoying  my  life  now  and  I  want  to 
 reframe  your  mind  this  is  not  about
[150:14] abstinence  this  is  not  about  like  hating 
 yourself  and  not  rewarding  yourself  and 
 not  enjoying  yourself  I  think  this  is
[150:21] the  opposite  way  I  think  the  best 
 enjoyment  in  life  comes  from  when  you 
 continuously  keep  disciplining  yourself
[150:27] not  when  you  like  reward  yourself  in 
 what  the  modern  world  considers  the
[150:32] reward  from  what  we  like  you  know  our 
 perception  of  what  the  reward  and  of
[150:37] what  enjoying  success  is  genuinely  our 
 perception  of  it  is  so  incredibly 
 cancerous  we  think  it's  spending  all  the
[150:43] money  we  think  it's  buying  like  the  nice 
 car  and  stuff  and  you  know  it's  like 
 taking  the  holiday  and  everything  and
[150:49] these  things  seem  nice  but  when  you 
 really  think  why  we  have  these  desires 
 it's  literally  just  because  we  like  you
[150:54] know  the  nice  car  if  we're  totally 
 honest  you  know  every  guy  will  cope  and 
 say  no  but  I  really  like  the  exhaust 
 engine  and  wherever  the  truth  is  if
[151:00] we're  really  honest  the  nice  car  the 
 reason  why  we're  spending  100K  through 
 or  however  much  on  a  nice  car  that  you
[151:05] know  the  dream  car  that  we've  got  the 
 reason  why  is  because  we're  hoping  that 
 someone  on  the  street  does  this
[151:11] that  that  Little  Neck  turn  is  why  we'll 
 go  and  sacrifice  our  future  we're  hoping
[151:16] that  a  girl  just  slightly  opens  up  her 
 legs  for  us  and  we're  thinking  yep  see 
 valid  like  I'm  nice  and  validated  see  I
[151:22] am  worthy  of  Love  after  all  because 
 there  was  that  one  day  that  my  mother 
 when  I  was  four  years  old  didn't  respond 
 to  my  tears  and  this  is  why  I  need  this
[151:28] woman  with  her  stinky  hole  today 
 this  is  where  most  men  are  headed 
 towards  and  it's  utterly  important  for
[151:34] you  to  induce  some  stoicism  right  now 
 and  to  really  start  to  clarify  your 
 desires  but  I  think  that  the  best  life
[151:40] we  may  be  able  to  have  is  one  of 
 continuous  discipline  to  ever  strive  for
[151:45] more  not  Material  success  but  more  from 
 ourselves 
 to  realize  the  potential  that  we  could
[151:51] get  to 
 to  realize  that  it  was  never  about  these 
 material  desires  the  money  the  status
[151:57] the  subscribers  it  was  never  about  that 
 it  was  about  having  something
[152:02] challenging 
 that  we  actually  liked 
 that  hopefully  contributed
[152:08] to  the  world  in  some  way 
 when  you  reframe  your  mind  with  the
[152:14] things  you're  disciplining  and  you  start 
 to  see  them  purely  for  this  thing  of 
 like  I  want  to  challenge  myself  I  want
[152:20] to  get  better  I  want  to  contribute  to 
 the  world  in  some  way 
 that's  when  I  think  you  start  to  feel
[152:26] like  you're  getting  rewarded  every 
 single  time  you  work  people  see  you
[152:31] working 
 you're  actually  just  playing  you  see  the 
 guys  who  are  at  the  absolute  top  of  like
[152:37] you  know  every  niche  of  sport  of 
 business  whatever  it's  play  time  for
[152:42] them  they  have  more  fun  than  everyone 
 else  why 
 because  to  them  it  genuinely  is
[152:47] enjoyable  because  they  don't  care  about 
 the  results  when  you  really  look  at  the 
 best  businessmen  out  there  not  to  the
[152:53] ones  who  have  allowed  us  who  get  the 
 most  views  on  Instagram  and  you  know 
 YouTube  these  are  like  literally  Petty 
 influencers  a  lot  of  them  are  lying
[152:59] about  their  success  but  when  you  see 
 like  the  top  tier  like  we're  talking
[153:04] hundreds  of  billions  [ __ ]  Sam  Walton 
 the  guy  who  made  Walmart  and  that  like 
 you  know  Jeff  Bezos  and  stuff  bro  they
[153:10] don't  party  they  wear  the  same  clothes 
 every  day  they  literally  like  to  wake  up 
 and  experience  their  life  their
[153:17] day-to-day  that's  what  their  reward  is 
 imagine  that  the  strength  of  a  man  who
[153:24] what  he  wants  out  of  life  is  his 
 day-to-day  routine  compared  to  the 
 strength  of  the  man  who  wants  the  fancy
[153:30] car  who  needs  the  private  jet  who  wants 
 the  you  know  the  group  of  women  in  his 
 Instagram  picture  because  that  validates
[153:36] him  in  some  way 
 those  things  can  be  nice  you  know  you
[153:41] can  say  oh  I'm  just  coping  I'm  a  broker 
 I  don't  have  those  things  you  can 
 believe  that  if  you  want  but  I  wish  my
[153:46] younger  self  was  able  to  watch  this 
 guide  because  I'd  tell  him  one  thing 
 right  now  when  you  use  discipline
[153:51] consistently 
 you  will  build  the  success 
 and  when  you  build  the  success
[153:58] the  distractions  will  come 
 and  if  you  do  get  distracted  by  them
[154:03] you'll  lose  the  success  you'll  lose  the 
 discipline  and  you'll  just  go  back  down
[154:08] and  what  a  horrible  life  that  is  to  just 
 choose  like  you  know  the  this  little
[154:13] tiny  puny  Mountain  that  is  nowhere  near 
 your  capability  to  climb  up  and  then
[154:18] down  again  and  then  you  know  a  few  years 
 later  when  you  get  pissed  off  and  you 
 realize  oh  man  I've  just  wasted  three 
 years  with  this  degenerate  woman  you
[154:23] know  like  this  [ __ ]  relationship  that 
 I'm  in  and  I  got  kind  of  fat  again  let's 
 climb  up  the  mountain  again  and  then
[154:28] let's  get  to  like  level  six  and  then 
 let's  go  down  again  let's  get  to  level 
 six  again  and  let's  go  down  again  let's 
 get  to  level  six  again  let's  go  down
[154:33] again  this  is  most  people's  experiences 
 in  my  experience  for  a  very  long  time 
 how  about  getting  to  level  seven  how
[154:38] about  getting  to  level  eight  and  nine 
 and  ten  and  into  Infinity
[154:43] da  is  how  you  start  to  find  your  purpose 
 I  believe  this  is  how  you  start  to  find
[154:49] God  I  believe  this  is  how  you  start  to 
 find  like  genuine  fulfillments  in  life
[154:54] so  for  this  actionable  step  let's  do  a 
 visualization  together  whatever  you're 
 working  hard  on  right  now  if  you  imagine
[155:00] yourself  that  you've  finally  got  the 
 real  world  material  success  that  you've
[155:06] thought  that  you've  wanted  all  this  time 
 if  you've  been  working  hard  in  your 
 fitness  journey  maybe  it's  the  physique
[155:11] maybe  it's  the  Instagram  followers  of 
 your  Fitness  page  if  you've  been  working 
 hard  in  business  then  maybe  it's  the
[155:16] money  and  you  know  it's  the  Instagram 
 pictures  of  you  in  the  car  and  the  watch 
 maybe  it's  the  girl  and  after  a  few
[155:23] weeks  of  this  or  months  of  this 
 how's  it  going  to  feel  when  you  finally 
 look  back  to  the  analytics  the  data
[155:30] and  you  realize  that  you've  genuinely 
 significantly
[155:35] backtracked 
 you're  not  waking  up  at  5am  anymore  now
[155:40] are  you  because  you've  already  got  the 
 girl
[155:45] so  what's  gonna  happen  to  all  of  the 
 material  success  then  the  girl  the  money 
 the  car  the  likes
[155:52] when  you  aren't  doing  the  things  to 
 maintain  that 
 foreign
[155:57] step  5.1  slow  down 
 a  friend  of  mine  and  a  very  intelligent
[156:02] man  who's  really  good  at  business  his 
 name's  Andrew  Kirby  and  he  gave  me  some 
 advice  that  I  want  to  give  you  here  I
[156:08] sent  him  a  message  saying  you  know  he 
 knows  quite  a  lot  about  me  my  business 
 and  I  said  to  him  like  you  know  what's 
 some  advice  you'd  have  for  me  at  this
[156:14] stage  and  his  advice  was  slow  down 
 that  the  success  that  I  had  gotten  so
[156:20] far  was  probably  largely  due  to  the  fact 
 that  I  was  quite  fast  I  was  fast  to
[156:25] implement  things  if  I  had  an  idea  like 
 this  new  business  or  this  type  of  video 
 I'd  implement  it  very  quickly  which
[156:31] meant  that  I  was  someone  who  was  taking 
 action  I  was  an  action  taker  at  the 
 start  of  business  at  the  start  of  like
[156:37] your  journey  in  any  Endeavor  for 
 discipline  that  is  amazing
[156:42] later  on  when  you've  already  started  to 
 see  success 
 that  actually  really  really  bad  so  in
[156:49] his  text  message  back  to  me  he  said  in 
 the  early  days  you're  like  a  speedboat
[156:54] it's  very  important  that  you  can  correct 
 course  and  be  able  to  like  realign 
 yourself  and  you  know  move  quickly  but
[156:59] once  you've  built  the  success  it's  more 
 like  a  cruise  ship
[157:04] set  the  direction  and  go  there  you  don't 
 want  to  stop  and  alter  courses  too  often
[157:10] thinking  about  that  analogy  if  you're 
 closer  to  the  start  of  this  journey  in
[157:15] some  area  let's  say  with  Fitness  it's 
 way  better  for  you  to  move  like  a 
 speedboat  be  quick  for  example  you  get
[157:20] the  thought  maybe  I  want  to  start  going 
 to  the  gym  you  sign  up  to  the  gym 
 immediately  and  literally  go  within  24
[157:25] hours  from  now  you  get  the  thought  maybe 
 I  want  to  try  martial  arts  you  sign  up 
 to  the  gym  and  go  literally  within  24
[157:30] hours  from  now  the  same  with  you  know 
 there's  going  to  be  so  many  guys 
 watching  this  who  want  to  be  YouTubers 
 and  they've  been  thinking  about  this  for
[157:35] the  last  like  a  year  the  route  to 
 success  like  in  these  early  levels  is 
 literally  just  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  and  just
[157:42] start  immediately  speedboat  go  fast  make 
 your  first  video  within  24  hours  from 
 now  and  then  you'll  start  to  you  know
[157:48] feel  it  out  you'll  start  to  see  what's 
 happening  but  if  you're  specifically 
 watching  this  because  you're  later  in
[157:53] this  in  this  journey  or  you  know  that 
 you'll  eventually  get  here 
 going  fast  is  actually  going  to  be  a
[157:59] detriment  and  this  is  something  which 
 I'm  struggling  with  because  when  you've 
 been  fast  that's  how  you  get  that 
 earlier  success  but  soon  going  fast  is  a
[158:05] bad  thing  when  I  go  fast  now 
 it's  chaotic
[158:11] when  I  go  fast  I  end  up  literally  like 
 abandoning  a  whole  product  that  I've
[158:16] made  and  I  literally  have  refunded  over 
 a  hundred  people  in  one  day  not  only  did
[158:22] I  like  literally  like  20  or  30  or 
 however  much  thousand  it  was  left  my 
 like  bank  account  in  one  day  but  also  it
[158:29] just  took  like  [ __ ]  six  hours  to  go 
 through  like  every  imagine  like  manually 
 going  through  like  you  know  for  my 
 assistance  and  I  did  it  as  well  because
[158:35] it  was  just  like  a  really  really  hectic 
 day 
 you  don't  want  to  experience  something
[158:40] like  that  and  that's  because  when  you 
 get  these  ideas  and  these  new  fantasies
[158:46] and  and  you  know  like  this  new  project 
 that  you  want  to  build  on  at  this  level
[158:51] it's  actually  important  for  you  to  slow 
 down  and  to  really  question  it  and  to 
 journal  it  and  to  ask  a  bunch  of
[158:57] questions  and  so  the  way  that  I 
 personally  do  this  now  is  with  what  I 
 call  a  decision  making  framework  it's
[159:03] essentially  it's  just  a  list  of 
 questions  that  I  ask  myself  when  I'm 
 making  a  decision  so  that  I  end  up
[159:08] making  decisions  quite  slower  instead  of 
 you  know  just  the  decision  being  just  in 
 my  mind  and  often  those  are  based  on
[159:14] like  emotions  you've  probably  heard  like 
 you  could  literally  have  an  emotion 
 because  you  ate  sugar  yesterday  or  you
[159:19] had  like  too  much  coffee  this  morning 
 and  that  emotion  coupled  with  some  sleep 
 deprivation  coupled  with  a  bit  of
[159:24] influence  from  something  you've  seen 
 online  maybe  one  of  my  videos  you  end  up 
 like  literally  like  deciding  on  a
[159:29] decision  that  changes  your  future 
 without  realizing  it  probably  just 
 happened  because  you  ingested  sugar
[159:35] yesterday  at  this  level  right  now 
 any  of  these  extra  Desires  in  your  mind 
 any  of  these  extra  decisions  could  be
[159:41] extremely  chaotic  and  they  could  be  very 
 stupid  and  so  my  decision  making 
 framework  which  I'll  walk  you  through
[159:46] right  now  is  an  actionable  step  is  one 
 way  where  it  forces  me  to  take  like  a
[159:51] few  minutes  to  be  sat  here  often  I  do  it 
 first  thing  in  the  morning  when  I'm 
 actually  just  here  in  front  of  my
[159:56] computer  with  like  the  the  list  of 
 messages  like  the  list  of  questions  that 
 I  have  to  put  a  decision  through  and
[160:02] I'll  walk  you  through  it  right  now  it 
 has  the  exact  like  step-by-step  protocol 
 but  what  I  do  right  so  for  example  my
[160:07] mind  could  have  just  generated  a  thought 
 like  a  desire  of  should  I  make  this  new 
 product  should  I  change  the  style  of  my
[160:14] videos  these  are  huge  huge  questions  to 
 be  thinking  about  so  this  is  what  I  put
[160:19] them  through  I  get  the  thought  and  I 
 come  in  to  a  notes  page  doesn't  matter
[160:25] which  software  you  use  I  literally  just 
 use  the  normal  iPhone  Notes  you  don't 
 need  anything  fancy  and  I  put  that  as
[160:30] the  title  I  literally  just  write  it  as  a 
 question  should  I  change  the  videos  from 
 what  they  are  now  to  this  new  style  that
[160:37] I'm  thinking  of  in  my  mind  and  this  is  a 
 series  of  questions  that  I  ask  myself
[160:42] first  of  all what's  the  question  or 
 what's  the  decision  to  be  made  just 
 write  it  out  by  the  way  this  is  probably 
 about  50  of  the  battle  if  you  write  the
[160:49] decision  out  on  paper  on  PC  normally 
 like  you've  just  instantly  left  this
[160:55] like  weak  emotional  state  and  you're 
 looking  at  it  logically  so  this  is  the 
 most  important  question  just  write  it
[161:00] out  what's  the  question  what's  the 
 decision  the  second  question  is  where 
 did  this  thought  stem  from  originally
[161:05] was  it  something  someone  said  to  you 
 something  you  saw  from  others  on  social 
 media  try  and  dig  to  find  its  Origins
[161:12] you  know  how  important  this  question  is 
 like  where  did  this  desire  come  from 
 because  sometimes  I've  wrote  down  there
[161:19] was  someone  in  the  gym  who  was  bigger 
 than  me 
 and  then  I'm  realizing  how  stupid  it  is
[161:24] or  I've  rolled  out  I  saw  like  a  [ __ ] 
 Andrew  Tate  shot  and  that's  where  this 
 desire  this  decision  has  come  from  and
[161:30] I'm  like  okay  that's  probably  a  stupid 
 like  place  to  make  a  decision  from  so 
 just  by  writing  okay  I  saw  something  on
[161:35] social  media  you  kind  of  realize  like  oh 
 yeah  this  this  decision  is  probably 
 stupid  as  [ __ ]  because  it's  come  from
[161:40] like  you  know  like  a  low  quality  place 
 the  third  question  is  what  is  the  dream 
 result  so  of  this  area  what  is  already
[161:45] like  your  big  goal  in  it  so  for  example 
 for  me  with  YouTube  it  might  be  like  a 
 specific  goal  if  I  want  to get  to  5
[161:51] million  subscribers  next  year  or  it 
 might  be  for  example  more  of  a  wholesome 
 intention  of  like  you  know  I  want  to 
 contribute  to  the  body  of  knowledge  what
[161:57] is  like  the  end  point  that  you're  first 
 trying  to  get  to  then  an  interesting 
 question  think  about  alternative  options
[162:03] to  achieve  the  same  result  so  I've  got 
 the  dream  result  you  know  the  5  million 
 subscribers  and  the  question  is  you  know
[162:09] should  I  change  my  videos  in  this  style 
 that  I'm  currently  thinking  of  but  this 
 question  think  about  the  alternative 
 option  suddenly  I'm  bullet  pointing  well
[162:16] I  could  probably  just  continue  doing  the 
 same  videos  I  could  change  them 
 completely  to  this  new  idea  I  could
[162:22] maybe  maybe  post  one  video  with  this  new 
 idea  instead  of  changing  it  completely 
 that  sounds  way  more  like  reasonable  I
[162:28] could  you  know  ask  people  on  the 
 community  post  what  they'd  think  about 
 it  and  I'd  probably  get  a  thousand 
 replies  so  that'd  be  pretty  good  data
[162:34] and  suddenly  you  start  to  think  okay 
 probably  this  decision  that's  in  my  mind 
 is  probably  a  little  bit  too  extreme
[162:39] there's  alternative  options  that  I  can 
 consider  instead  of  needing  to  do  this 
 exact  thing  that  my  mind  is  fantasizing
[162:45] on  then  I  have  more  like  an  actionable 
 step  for  myself  which  this  is  exactly 
 what  it  reads  if  this  is  a  big  decision
[162:50] of  high  leverage  go  and  get  a  response 
 from  a  smart  person  first  and  see  what
[162:55] they  say  about  this  decision  and  so  I've 
 got  a  list  of  like  smart  people  that  I 
 know  we've  got  Andrew  we've  got  Victor
[163:00] some  ovens  Chris  Williamson  my  brother 
 the  my  girl  Chachi  BT  literally  Chachi
[163:05] BT  is  like  a  smart  person  that  I  ask 
 these  questions  to  because  sometimes 
 I've  had  these  decisions  and  big  desires 
 and  I've  ended  up  speaking  to  like  one
[163:11] of  these  intelligent  people  and  they'll 
 be  like  comes  a  year  old  for  thinking 
 this  is  like  way  too  dramatic  or
[163:16] something  like  that  you  know  like 
 another  person  who's  not  emotionally 
 invested  into  this  will  look  from  the 
 outside  and  tell  you  no  no  you're
[163:21] thinking  not  right  here  it  might  be 
 better  doing  it  like  this  what's  making 
 you  think  that  ah  then  I  have  a  question
[163:26] what  would  my  85  year  old  self  think 
 about  this  decision  this  is  something  I
[163:31] learned  from  Alex  hamosi  like  one  of  his 
 videos  he  spoke  about  this  we  think  of 
 like  this  Grandpa  frame  when  you're
[163:37] imagining  yourself  either  really  elderly 
 or  maybe  on  your  deathbed  what  would  you 
 think  about  this  decision  is  it  minor
[163:43] would  you  look  back  and  think  like  okay 
 this  was  just  stupid  oftentimes  this 
 kind  of  calibrates  my  life  a  bit
[163:49] differently  because  right  now  I'm  super 
 work  obsessed  like  that's  where  I  am  in 
 life  but  when  I  ask  this  question  what
[163:54] would  my  85  year  old  self  think  of  this 
 decision  for  example  the  decision  is 
 something  that  might  take  me  away  from
[163:59] my  family  or  my  girl  or  friends  or 
 something  I'll  often  ask  myself  what 
 would  my  85  year  old  self  think  and  I'd
[164:05] write  oh  yeah  he'd  probably  think  it  was 
 just  silly  that  like  I  already  had  quite 
 a  lot  of  success  and  money  and 
 subscribers  why  was  I  sacrificing
[164:11] something  that  mattered  more  and  finally 
 the  last  point  of  this  framework  that 
 you  can  copy  to  make  decisions  is
[164:16] literally  just  the  text  which  says 
 decision  made  with  a  colon  an  idea  is 
 that  I  just  write  like  okay  what  I've
[164:21] decided  on  this  here 
 takes  a  few  minutes  but  it  takes  you  out
[164:26] of  this  emotional  state  and  it  makes  you 
 slow  down  and  just  that  could  be
[164:32] honestly  like  this  might  save  you  years 
 of  your  life 
 you  might  end  up  like  you  know  because
[164:38] decisions  are  really  how  we  become 
 successful  decisions  is  you  know  it's 
 discipline  what  are  you  going  to  decide
[164:43] today  is  it  easy  path  or  the  hard  path 
 that  you're  going  to  decide  the 
 long-term  thing  or  the  short  term  think 
 when  you  become  slightly  better  at
[164:49] decisions  just  because  you've  got  a 
 framework  like  this  your  life  might 
 change  forever  so  I'm  actually  very 
 happy  to  share  that  with  you  and  I
[164:54] really  do  hope  it  serves  you  as  well  as 
 it  served  me  step  5.2  be  strict  with
[164:59] yourself  but  tolerance  with  others  by 
 this  point  you've  already  started  to
[165:04] build  a  great  level  of  discipline  and 
 you've  started  to  see  the  success  of 
 that  which  is  wonderful  this  is  where
[165:09] many  young  guys  they've  asked  me  how  do 
 they  get  their  parents  on 
 self-improvement  how  do  they  get  their
[165:15] friends  to  start  working  out  then 
 quitting  these  bad  habits 
 through  my  years  of  doing  this  work  I've
[165:21] always  advised  you  know  let's  help  them 
 let's  do  this  try  and  do  this  try  and  do 
 this  and  I'm  slightly  ashamed  bro  but  I
[165:27] understand  now  that  I  have 
 never  been  able  to  help  someone  in  this
[165:32] situation 
 every  young  man  which  is  over  maybe  100 
 or  200  by  now  that  you  know  I've  spoke
[165:38] to  of  this  specific  problem  comments  and 
 video  calls  and  whatever  right
[165:43] it  has  always  failed  like  our  plan  to
[165:48] help  this  young  man  help  someone  else 
 always  failed
[165:55] why 
 because  you  can  be  strict  with  yourself 
 you  really  want  this  right  you  really
[166:02] want  to  improve  your  life  you  really 
 want  to  get  the  success  and  everything 
 you're  here  watching  a  video  like  this 
 and  so  me  giving  you  this  advice  and
[166:08] being  a  bit  strict  with  you  works  but 
 the  people  in  your  life  your  friends 
 your  family  they  don't  care  as  much  they
[166:15] might  say  that  they  like  they  want  this 
 but  they  really  don't  I  understand  how 
 saddening  and  depressing  it  is  seeing
[166:20] the  people  you  love  waste  away 
 but  you  can't  force  anyone  to  get  onto
[166:26] self-improvement  and  be  disciplined  into 
 delay  gratification  these  things  are 
 hard  enough  when  you  really  want  them
[166:31] and  so  when  there's  someone  who  doesn't 
 even  want  them  as  much 
 there's  not  much  hope  there  but  there  is
[166:36] something  practical  that  we  can  do 
 you  set  a  fantastic  example  you  lead  by
[166:43] example  you  keep  disciplining  yourself 
 you  keep  getting  to  the  next  level  you 
 don't  indulge  in  the  desires  that  arise
[166:49] you  know  the  success  that  leads  to  the 
 distractions  you  keep  disciplining 
 yourself  and  maybe  hopefully  one  day  the
[166:55] people  that  we  love  will  be  inspired  by 
 that  and  that's  when  they'll  come 
 towards  us  that's  when  they'll  really
[167:01] really  want  to  change  and  that's  when  we 
 can  maybe  help  them 
 when  I  moved  back  home  here  to  my
[167:07] parents  house  when  I  was  22  years  old  I 
 was  a  very  different  man  than  what  my
[167:12] family  knew  my  family  knew  me  as  like 
 you  know  the  video  gamer  and  they 
 probably  smelled  like  my  room  smelling
[167:17] of  [ __ ] 
 for  10  years  right 
 and  suddenly  I  came  back  with  this  idea
[167:23] of  being  disciplined  and  you  know  I'm 
 doing  these  crazy  things  that  you  know 
 it  was  locked  down  but  I  would  literally
[167:28] get  a  weighted  backpack  and  just  go  for 
 runs  and  I'd  go  run  specifically  through 
 like  wet  muddy  fields  and  everything
[167:34] just  to  get  uncomfortable  kind  of 
 remember  this  moments  when  I  started 
 waking  up  super  early  and  it  felt
[167:40] amazing  to  do  it  you  know  really 
 disciplined  and  I  felt  really  strong  I'm 
 listening  to  can't  hurt  me  by  David
[167:45] Goggins  and  I  um I  wake  up  it's  you  know 
 the  silent  quiet  enthusiasm  of  the  night
[167:50] time  or  of  the  morning  time  it's  like  5 
 a.m  and  I  go  downstairs  and  I've  got  my
[167:55] earphones  in  listening  to  can't  hurt  me 
 and  I'm  filling  up  the  water  bottle 
 and  my  dad  walks  him  now  my  dad  wakes  up
[168:02] super  early  5  a.m  4  30  whatever  and  he's 
 gonna  go  drive  the  taxi
[168:07] and  he  walks  in  through  the  kitchen  and 
 he's  almost  like  taking  him  back  you 
 know  he's  probably  shocked  because  he's
[168:12] never  seen  me  awake  at  the  same  time 
 that  he's  he  wakes  up  at  4  30  to  work 
 right
[168:17] and  his  youngest  son  the  guy  who's  been 
 a  degenerate  for  as  much  as  he's  known 
 me  who's  been  addicted  to  video  games  is
[168:24] there  in  gym  clothes  with  earphones  on 
 filling  up  my  bottle  and  he  says  like 
 wait  what  oh  like  oh  you're  awake
[168:29] couldn't  you  sleep 
 I  remember  saying  to  him  like  oh  no  I'm 
 going  for  a  run
[168:34] his  his  I  promise  you  the  noise  he  went 
 he  made  was  eh
[168:39] like  an  Asian  parent  eh  yeah
[168:44] he's  asking  me  like  if  I'm  okay  and 
 everything  I  couldn't  I  sleep  I  said  I 
 don't know  like  I  woke  up  on  purpose
[168:49] it's  pitch  black  outside  this  is  not 
 something  that  you  know  me  or  my  family 
 do  like  you  know  there's  hard  discipline
[168:54] stuff  it's  Pitch  Black  it's  probably 
 cold  and  still  I  literally  went  for  a 
 run  at  this  point  fast  forward  a  few
[168:59] years  from  that  moment 
 and  my  dads  went  through  a 
 transformation  of  his  own  he's  reduced
[169:04] how  much  alcohol  he  drinks  he's  improved 
 his  diet  I  see  him  training  he  goes  to 
 the  gym  he  plays  badminton  and  for  most
[169:10] of  all  for  the  like  the  biggest  thing 
 that  he  cares  about  is  cricket 
 and  over  the  last  year  he  kept  on
[169:16] sharing  like  screenshots  to  our  family 
 group  chat  of  like  these  um you  know  the
[169:21] websites  that  post  like  a  cricket  result 
 like  a  match  result  and  his  team  keeps 
 winning  and  he  keeps  getting  like  man  of
[169:27] the  match  and  he's  like  he's  the  bowler 
 and  he  keeps  getting  like  uh  promoted  or 
 whatever  you're  like  recognized
[169:32] is  the  team  captain  now 
 now  of  course  this  is  his  this  is  his 
 effort  of  course  but  I  can  see  like
[169:38] maybe  you  know  I'm  taking  a  bit  of  the 
 credit  who  knows  but  like  I  can  see  a 
 bit  of  a  link  between  like  me  being
[169:43] there  at  5am  and  being  this  excellent 
 example  for  myself  and  for  my  family  and
[169:48] for  the  world  and  my  dad  and  maybe  and 
 hopefully  in  some  ways  getting  inspired 
 by  that  and  thinking  yeah  like  you  know
[169:53] yeah  we  work  hard  yeah  we  kind  of  like 
 exercise  and  everything 
 any  like  w  in  the  chat  is  what  all  these
[170:00] internet  people  say  my  dad  is  the  team 
 captain  of  his  Cricket  Club  now
[170:05] so  yeah  that's  just  my  story  man  if
[170:10] I  think  that's  the  best  way  to  help  the 
 people  that  you  love 
 set  a  fantastic  example  step  six  what  to
[170:16] do  when  you  fall  off  at  any  point  during 
 this  journey  whether  it's  straight  away
[170:21] or  when  you've  built  up  a  good  level  of 
 success  there  must  be  a  bit  when  this 
 climb  starts  to  dip  down  there  must  be
[170:28] you  know  when  you  look  at  the  the  graph 
 of  success  in  any  area  weight  loss
[170:33] business  subscribers  whatever 
 hopefully  you  see  over  time  it  goes  like
[170:39] this  right  sweet 
 when  you  zoom  in  and  you  see  like  you 
 know  really  what  it  looks  like  day  to
[170:45] day  it's  like  this  it  literally  feels 
 random  if  you've  ever  tracked  your  body 
 weight  every  single  day  on  like  a
[170:51] bathroom  scale  you  know  so  you're  seeing 
 how  much  you  weigh  you  know  this  right 
 it's  not  like  it's  just  exactly  like  170
[170:57] pounds  and  it  goes  down  by  0.15  pounds 
 every  single  day  you  know  so  it's 
 completely  like  linear  it's  not  it's  so
[171:03] weird  it's  like  you  could  eat  the  same 
 calories  drink  the  same  amount  of  water 
 and  for  some  reason  your  weight  tomorrow 
 will  be  two  pounds  lower  even  though
[171:09] like  you  ate  like  a  cheat  meal  today  and 
 you  know  it's  like  it's  always  like  this 
 until  you  zoom  out  and  it's  been  a  week
[171:15] it's  been  a  month  now  you  see  like  more 
 of  a  trend  this  is  what  we  need  to  get 
 used  to  there's  gonna  be  many  days  where
[171:21] you  feel  like  you've  fallen  off 
 it's  that  it's  this  like  this  this  day
[171:27] and  so  what  do  you  do  because  for  a  lot 
 of  guys  when  they  experience  this  day 
 that's  when  they'll  change  their  plan
[171:33] that's  when  they'll  be  too  fast  that's 
 when  they'll  start  thinking  oh  you  know 
 I've  got  to  hurt  myself  more  I've  gotta
[171:38] you  know  I'll  double  the  the  cardio  and 
 I'll  eat  even  less  than  a  you  know  I'll 
 do  this  I'll  get  super  super  hard  right
[171:45] that's  the  wrong  mindset  because  the 
 better  thing  to  do  when  you  experience  a 
 day  like  this
[171:50] is  to  try  your  best  to  stick  to  the 
 exact  same  plan  as  before 
 is  to  understand  that  some  of  the  days
[171:55] are  going  to  be  like  this  and  some  of 
 the  days  are  going  to  be  like  that  and 
 they'll  average  out  if  your  plan  was  set
[172:00] in  the  right  direction  many  people  will 
 change  their  plan  on  the  first  bad  day 
 and  then  again  it's  like  that  same
[172:05] concept  of  just  moving  too  fast  making 
 too  many  like  shallow  decisions  and 
 they're  all  over  the  place  and  they're 
 all  like  fickle  with  their  plans  and  the
[172:12] goals  that  being  said  if  you  notice 
 yourself  falling  off  at  least  more  than 
 like  a  few  days  in  a  row  it's  been  weeks
[172:17] it's  been  months  for  example  since  you 
 last  meditated  let's  say  you  got  into 
 meditation  at  some  point  earlier  this
[172:22] year 
 and  then  you  like  you  literally  just 
 haven't  meditated  in  so  long  many  people
[172:27] will  live  with  that  regret  inside  of 
 their  mind  and  not  really  do  much  for  it 
 defining  the  problem  is  three  quarters
[172:34] of  the  answer  just  ants  like  literally 
 just  writing  down  the  problem  so  if
[172:39] you're  here  right  now  and  specifically 
 you  know  you've  got  this  vague  pain  in 
 your  mind  of  like  I've  been  slacking  in
[172:44] meditation  for  the  last  six  months  you 
 just  taking  that  from  your  mind  and 
 writing  it  down  pen  piece  of  paper  or
[172:50] like  I  use  iPhone  Notes  I've  missed  most 
 of  my  meditation  sessions  for  the  last 
 six  months
[172:55] why 
 then  your  brain  will  actually  start  to 
 be  productive  why  have  I  missed  it
[173:02] I  don't  really  want  to  do  him 
 I  don't  find  them  fun  I'm  not  sure  if 
 they're  actually  that  productive
[173:07] then  you  start  asking  more  questions  is 
 this  reasonable  is  it  rational  is  it
[173:12] logical 
 probably  not  because  you  know  I  know  the 
 scientific  research  meditation  has
[173:17] proven  to  be  effective  maybe  I'm  just 
 coping  maybe  I'm  just  procrastinating 
 but  I  just  don't  know  why  I'm  not
[173:23] getting  consistent  in  it  then  you  ask 
 some  more  questions  you  almost  have  like 
 a  step-by-step  you  know  as  we  did  with
[173:29] the  decisions  but  with  like  I've  fallen 
 off  framework 
 what  could  I  do  to  get  back  on  easier
[173:36] well  I  could  start  doing  meditation  in 
 my  morning  routine  again  because  I  was 
 really  consistent  when  I  did  that  I
[173:42] could  reduce  the  time  that  I  meditate 
 for  because  in  my  mind  like  it's  hard  to
[173:47] start  meditating  with  20  minutes  again 
 but  if  I  started  with  like  three  minutes 
 for  the  first  week  I  could  easily  do
[173:52] three  minutes  and  you  know  a  week  from 
 now  I  could  do  five  minutes  and  two 
 weeks  from  then  I  could  do  10  minutes 
 and  you  know  a  month  or  two  months  from
[173:58] now  if  I  just  maintain  10  minutes  a  day 
 that's  already  really  good  but  I  reckon 
 two  months  from  now  I  could  probably  be 
 back  at  20  minutes  a  day  again  maybe  the
[174:05] problem  is  just  that  like  it's  too  hard 
 to  get  back  into  right  now  which  makes 
 sense  and  you  know  your  brain  starts
[174:11] ticking  and  it  starts  saying  like  oh 
 yeah  well  you  know  that  that's  really 
 reasonable  this  is  like  a  really 
 practical  way  to  get  back  to  where  I  can
[174:17] just  progressively  overload  if  I  made  it 
 super  easy  today  and  you  have  like  four 
 new  strategies  to  get  back  to  it  most
[174:22] people  will  literally  like  see 
 themselves  not  being  disciplined  they'll 
 keep  messing  up  on  their  goals  they'll
[174:28] keep  getting  into  a  rut  and  they'll 
 never  really  just  ask  their  brain 
 properly  with  you  know  pen  and  piece  of 
 paper  and  like  note  taking  or  whatever
[174:34] why  is  this  happening  most  people  people 
 just  keep  it  inside  of  their  brain
[174:39] and  your  brain's  thoughts  at  times  like 
 this  is  always  very  jumbled  it's  kind  of
[174:44] like  if  you  imagine  you  know  like  a  pair 
 of  earphones  like  wired  earphones  and 
 you  put  them  in  your  pocket  and  then  you
[174:49] bring  them  out  and  it's  like  all  in  like 
 a  ball  that's  what  your  brain's  thoughts 
 are  like  and  here's  you  like  looking  at
[174:54] the  ball  and  like  you  know  you're 
 getting  stressed  that  it's  a  ball  every 
 day  writing  things  down  is  like  when  you 
 take  those  earphones  and  you  start  to
[175:00] unravel  them 
 and  here  they  are  now  organized  that's
[175:05] 80  of  the  battle 
 so  if  you've  been  getting  this  thought 
 for  the  last  while  of  like  oh  man  you
[175:11] know  I'm  not  consistent  in  this  thing  I 
 keep  slacking  in  my  workouts  you  know  my 
 workout  performance  is  trash  I  keep
[175:16] skipping  my  diet  whatever  it  is  right  I 
 keep  relapsing  just  asking  the  question 
 why  is  this  happening  why  am  I  going
[175:22] through  this  pain  why  am  I  specifically 
 relapsing  why  am  I  grabbing  my  phone
[175:27] halfway  through  the  day  lying  in  bed  and 
 then  ending  up  relapsing  again
[175:32] and  the  answer  might  be  so  like  simple 
 you  might  just  literally  just  say  like 
 oh  it's  because  like  I'm  just  bored
[175:38] because  at  4  pm  I've  got  nothing  good  to 
 do  so  I  just  get  bored  and  I  just  end  up 
 fapping  again
[175:43] how  could  I  solve  that 
 I  could  have  something  to  do  at  4pm
[175:49] like  go  on  a  walk  go  read 
 okay  let's  try  tomorrow  so  this  is
[175:54] exactly  what  you  do  if  you  find  yourself 
 falling  off  you  create  yourself  a  I've
[175:59] messed  up  system  you've  got  like  these 
 few  reminders  that  you  can  have  you  only 
 need  them  on  for  like  a  couple  of  days
[176:05] till  it  becomes  you  know  like  a  bit  more 
 clear  that's  the  new  habit  that  you're 
 gonna  have  and  then  finally  but  very
[176:10] importantly  you  document  this  mess  up 
 this  rut  somewhere  that  you  can  look
[176:15] back  on  again  iPhone  Notes  works  really 
 well  you  make  almost  like  this  Bank  of
[176:21] like  times  that  you've  messed  up  and 
 principles  and  Frameworks  that  you've 
 used  to  come  out  of  this  so  that
[176:27] preferably  you  never  go  through  the  same 
 problem  again  imagine  if  you  literally 
 just  just  literally  a  folder  on  your
[176:32] iPhone  Notes  or  you  know  folder  on 
 notion  or  maybe  a  journal  I  would 
 suggest  doing  it  on  um  technology  which
[176:39] is  rare  for  me  to  say  if  you  watch  a 
 bunch  of  my  videos  you  know  for  a  fact  I 
 don't  often  say  like  I  do  this  on 
 technology  instead  of  paper  the  reason
[176:44] why  I  suggest  doing  it  with  technology 
 like  iPhone  Notes  or  notion  because  then 
 you  can  search  so  if  you  make  like  a  new
[176:50] folder  in  one  of  these  like  note  taking 
 and  having  something  to  do  with  like  I 
 messed  up  in  quotation  marks  I  messed  up
[176:56] you  can  then  start  a  document  with  each 
 time  that  you  feel  like  you've  messed  up 
 what  happened  why  it  happened  the
[177:02] decisions  and  Frameworks  and  mindsets 
 and  then  how  you  were  able  to  resolve  it 
 if  it  was  actually  resolved  and  what  was
[177:07] the  effective  thing  so  that  this  way  six 
 months  down  the  line  if  you  cut  yourself 
 thinking  like  oh  man  I've  not  been
[177:12] meditating  again  wasn't  this  a  problem  I 
 used  to  have  you  go  to  that  folder  you 
 search  for  meditation  since  it's  a
[177:17] computerized  system  there's  a  one  for 
 like  how  I  started  meditating  again  you 
 see  oh  yeah  like  I  did  I  fell  off
[177:22] meditation  and  then  I  got  back  on  it 
 because  I  just  sat  in  an  iPhone  alarm 
 and  I  said  that  I'd  do  three  minutes  a
[177:27] day  ah  recently  I've  been  saying  that 
 article  it's  got  to  be  half  an  hour  a 
 day  I  get  it  so  it's  got  to  be  just  all
[177:33] I've  got  to  do  is  discipline  myself  so 
 just  do  three  minutes  and  maybe  there 
 and  then  in  the  daytime  if  I  want  to  do
[177:38] more  I  can  do  but  if  I  discipline  myself 
 for  three  minutes  like  I  did  last  time 
 that  worked  last  time  I  can  try  it  again
[177:43] soon  you  start  to  have  this  collection 
 of  these  problems  that  you've  went
[177:48] through  and  ways  that  you've  solved  them 
 because  a  lot  of  problems  you  go  through 
 are  just  going  to  be  similar  I  learned 
 this  from  a  billionaire  named  Ray  dalio
[177:55] and  he  calls  this  like  principles  for 
 life  so  here's  your  actionable  step 
 create  your  I  messed  up  system  right  now
[178:03] just  spend  a  few  minutes  really  like 
 because  you  know  yourself  quite  well 
 what  would  work  for  you  when  you  find
[178:08] yourself  quite  aware  and  Vigilant  okay 
 I've  slacked  recently  I've  you  know  I've 
 been  missing  this  thing  I've  not  been
[178:13] doing  this  quite  well  what  would  work 
 for  you  what  questions  should  you  ask 
 should  you  write  this  on  paper  should
[178:18] you  like  you  know  ask  people  about  it 
 should  you  journal  and  write  a  note  and 
 how  could  you  in  the  future
[178:24] when  it's  likely  that  you  might  make  the 
 same  mistake  again 
 end  up  having  some  kind  of  place  you
[178:30] could  look  back  on  to  have  this  a 
 collection  of  knowledge  on  how  to  like 
 recover  from  this  rut  set  up  this  system
[178:36] right  now  you  don't  have  to  completely 
 copy  mine  you  know  yourself  quite  well 
 at  this  point  so  you  know  okay  I've
[178:41] fallen  off  on  these  things  these  are  the 
 things  that  I've  gotten  back  onto  how  do 
 I  consistently  set  this  up  so  my  future
[178:47] self  is  less  likely  to  experience  the 
 same  pains  that  I'm  going  through  today 
 step  seven
[178:52] remember  why  you  started  by  now  I've 
 taught  you  all  that  I  know  about
[178:57] discipline  I've  encapsulated  a  few  years 
 of  my  life  being  like  hyper  focused  on
[179:02] discipline  and  self-improvements  in  this 
 guide  for  you  and  the  one  final  message
[179:07] I  want  to  leave  you  with  is 
 one-off  purpose  and  Direction  and
[179:12] meaning  in  life 
 remember  why  you  started  this  this
[179:17] journey  of  self-improvement  and 
 discipline  who  you're  doing  it  for 
 because  it's  not  just  for  yourself  level
[179:22] one  thinking  is  like  yeah  you  know  it's 
 myself  I  want  to  you  know  build  more 
 muscle  and  I  want  to  make  more  money
[179:27] usually 
 the  internal  desire  that  we  have  is
[179:32] actually  for 
 other  people  and  so  if  you  just  close 
 your  eyes  one  last  time  with  me
[179:37] and  you  do  think  of  like  the  points  that 
 you  do  want  to  get  to
[179:42] and  other  people 
 their  lives  are  benefiting  because  of 
 your  hard  work  and  your  your  dedication
[179:48] and  your  discipline  here
[179:53] being  able  to  help  other  people  and 
 contribute  to  your  community 
 and  you  know  help  and  retire  your  family
[180:02] that's  what  discipline  is  all  about  this 
 is  not  only  for  us  but  it's  for  our
[180:08] future  children  to  not  have  to 
 experience  the  pain  of  poverty
[180:13] it's  for  our  future  wives  who  we  can 
 spoil  even  though  they  don't  you  know
[180:18] they're  not  materialistic  but  it's  like 
 would  be  able  to  like  you  know  buy  them 
 the  nice  thing  that 
 that  they're  surprised  by  we'd  be  able
[180:25] to  retire  our  future  wives  and  our 
 parents  and  our  fathers  who  have  worked 
 so  hard  and  even  our  distant  relatives
[180:32] just  because  of  the  fact  that  they  are 
 blood  related  to  us 
 really
[180:37] that's  what  the  material  success  of  of 
 discipline  is  the  one  major  thing  that  I
[180:42] that  I  want  for  my  own  like  selfish  game 
 and  everything  is  I  really  want  to  have
[180:47] like  positive  word  of  mouth  for  this 
 full  guide  and  for  all  of  them  that  I 
 work  really  hard  on  so  the  greatest  gift
[180:53] that  you  could  give  me  in  return  for 
 this  work  that  I'm  doing  here  is  just 
 when  it  is  relevant  in  your  normal  life
[181:01] mention  this  full  guide  to  someone 
 if  it  becomes  like  something  in  your 
 vocabulary  or  you  know  you  speak  to  a
[181:07] friend  you're  like  oh  you  should  watch 
 hamza's  full  guide  on  discipline  you  end 
 up  commenting  that  somewhere  in  the
[181:12] internet  you  know  oh  watch  Houses  full 
 guide  of  discipline 
 that  would  be
[181:18] my  task  here  like  that  would  mean  that 
 I've  done  an  awesome  job  if  this  video 
 starts  spreading  organically  through
[181:24] word  of  mouth  because  I  make  these  full 
 guides  as  part  of  this  movements  of
[181:29] young  men  who  want  something  better  out 
 of  life  who  want  to  get  onto 
 self-improvement  and  you  know  experience
[181:35] this  good  natural  healthy  life  that  we 
 should  have  in  these  days  again  with  the 
 media  and  the  influences  and  these  evil
[181:41] corporations  of  porn  and  everything 
 not  many  of  us  get  to  experience  the
[181:46] good  life 
 and  I've  realized  that  for  me
[181:51] it  does  seem  like  maybe  my  core  desire 
 you  know  my  core  purpose  or  maybe  you 
 want  to  like  the  the  purpose  layers  is
[181:59] to  teach  and  to  add  to  the  body  of 
 knowledge  like  the  education  of  young 
 men  or  something  I  feel  very  strongly
[182:04] for  so  that's  why  I  do  what  I  do  I  just 
 want  more  guys  out  there  to  learn
[182:09] lessons  like  this  finally  if  you  want  to 
 continue  learning  on  this  topic  it's 
 super  normal  for  a  YouTuber  to  end  their
[182:15] videos  by  trying  to  get  you  to  watch 
 more  of  their  videos  but  I'd  rather 
 direct  you  to  the  resources  that  I've
[182:21] learned  from  so  this  entire  video  has 
 been  inspired  by  the  book  discipline  is
[182:26] Destiny  by  Ryan  holiday  he  has  a  list  of 
 books  which  genuinely  like  have  changed
[182:31] my  life  another  one  is  ego  is  the  Enemy 
 by  Ryan  holiday  and  the  one  I'm
[182:36] currently  reading  is  courage  is  calling 
 again  by  Ryan  holiday  really  really  good
[182:41] books  the  discipline  is  Destiny  one  is 
 super  super  interesting  especially  if 
 you're  somewhat  interested  in  like
[182:47] spirituality  and  like  finding  out  your 
 desire  your  purpose  and  life  that  book
[182:52] is  very  good  I  read  the  entire  book  like 
 the  whole  seven  eight  hour  book
[182:57] just  to  make  this  full  guide  to  be  able 
 to  teach  you  better  that  book  discipline 
 is  Destiny  is  linked  in  the  description
[183:02] if  you  want  to  go  and  read  it  I  hope 
 this  guide  serves  you  well  and  I  think 
 that  this  may  be  the  single  most
[183:10] well-fitting  time 
 for  me  to  say 
 do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you
[183:17] don't  feel  like  it  mwah
"
E_203dUP32Y,"[00:00] imagine  having  a  deeper  more  resonant 
 more  masculine  voice  and  people  start 
 taking  you  more  seriously  because  right
[00:06] now  you  sound  a  little  bit  like  jeffrey 
 and  jeffrey  sounds  like  a  little 
 with  his  high  pitched  creaky  voice  you
[00:13] hear  his  voice  drop  and  so  no  one  takes 
 geoffrey  and  you  seriously  but  jeffrey 
 says  to  you  that  it's  okay  that  trying
[00:19] to  make  your  voice  deeper  is  gay  are  you 
 gonna  listen  to  him  because  you  know 
 what's  interesting  everyone  listens  to
[00:25] adonis  adonis  has  the  loudest  most 
 clearest  most  masculine  most  deepest
[00:31] voice  out  of  all  of  the  men  in  his  tribe 
 well  he's  a  tribe  leader  after  all  he 
 has  to  shout  the  commands  that
[00:37] automatically  makes  him  easier  to  listen 
 to  and  so  adonis  looks  at  you  and  says 
 in  his  most  beautiful  voice  come  on  now
[00:43] son  make  sure  you  subscribe  to  hamza's 
 channel
[00:48] i  remember  being  about  13  14  years  old 
 and  playing  minecraft  and  we  would  all 
 hop  on  skype  and  have  like  skype  calls
[00:54] whilst  we  play  and  i  would  literally 
 practice  like  train  my  voice  to  be
[00:59] deeper  and  i  did  that  because  i  was  the 
 oldest  of  all  the  guys  that  i  would  play 
 with  and  so  i  wanted  to  seem  like  you
[01:04] know  the  leader  like  the  the  most  mature 
 one  the  one  who's  going  through  puberty 
 and  so  i  would  literally  talk  in  more  of
[01:10] a  deep  sort  of  unnatural  voice  but  i 
 didn't  realize  at  the  time  is  that  that 
 is  actually  how  you  train  your  voice  to
[01:16] be  deeper  it's  simple  as  that  i  won't 
 even  make  you  wait  like  15  minutes  into 
 the  video  after  like  trying  to  sell  you 
 some  dollar  shave  club  or  like
[01:22] what's  the  what's  the  shitty  sponsors 
 that  everyone's  like  doing  these  days 
 like  lumen  skip  bro  anyone  who  does
[01:27] these  sponsors  just  know  that  they're 
  waste  men  like 
 skin  care  products  like  just  halfway
[01:32] through  a  youtube  video  you're  trying  to 
 watch  to  get  some  advice  and  these 
  will  just  pull  out  like 
 and  that's  why  i  use  dollar  shave  got
[01:37] like  some  shitty  watch  like  that's  why 
 i'm  i'm  sponsored  by  like  why  are  you 
 trying  to  sell  me  something  a 
 youtube  video  you're  pathetic
[01:43] but  yeah  you  want  the  no  bs  way  of 
 making  your  voice  deeper  you  literally 
 just  practice  just  practice  just  speak
[01:48] more  with  the  deep  voice  so  here  i  am 
 speaking  with  my  normal  just  absolutely 
 authentic  voice  i'm  not  doing  anything
[01:54] to  it  what  i  would  do  if  i  wanted  to 
 practice  making  my  voice  deeper  i  would 
 literally  just  speak  in  a  deeper  way
[01:59] like  i  am  right  now  because  if  you 
 compare  the  way  that  i'm  speaking  i'm 
 just  using  more  of  like  the  back  of  my
[02:05] throat  to  speak  it's  literally  as  simple 
 as  just  telling  yourself  okay  speak 
 these  words  in  a  deeper  tone  than  usual
[02:13] and  the  more  that  you  do  that  the  more 
 that  you  will  get  into  the  habit  of 
 speaking  like  that  and  now  i'll 
 transition  back  to  my  normal  voice  so
[02:19] don't  do  it  at  times  where  it'll  be  like 
  cringe  but  you  should  practice 
 speaking  in  your  deep  masculine  voice
[02:26] especially  with  girls  this  is  so 
 you  don't  realize  how  important  it  is  if 
 you  speak  in  your  normal  way  like  i  am
[02:31] right  now  i'm  speaking  to  the  boys  i'm 
 not  trying  to  think  like  oh  yeah  let  me 
 try  and  this  guy  am  i  but  when  i'm 
 flirting  with  a  girl  100
[02:38] you  need  to  activate  that  slow  residence 
 masculine  voice  you  like  stare  at  her  in 
 her  eyes  and  you  talk  like  this  and  you
[02:45] move  real  slow  you're  getting  turned  on 
 aren't  you  bro  so  this  is  exactly  what 
 you  do  you  put  deep  voice  training
[02:52] somewhere  in  your  schedule  maybe  you're 
 working  on  something  maybe  it's  your 
 morning  routine  you  just  speak  outwards
[02:57] like  you  need  to  speak  out  loud  with 
 more  of  a  deeper  resonant  voice  you 
 literally  just  need  to  train  it  it's  as
[03:03] simple  as  that  bro  like  all  this  advice 
 that  i  see  on  youtube  of  all  this  like 
 weird  exercises  that  you  can  do
[03:08] all  that  but  i'm  like  what  the  bro 
 it's  as  simple  as  just  speaking  more 
 with  your  deep  voice  the  more  you  speak
[03:14] like  this  the  more  that  you'll  really  be 
 able  to  like  articulate  yourself  the 
 more  that  it  will  feel  natural  it's  just
[03:19] kind  of  like  a  habit  you  speak  like  a 
 little  because  you  have  been 
 speaking  like  a  little  for  so  long
[03:25] if  you  want  to  speak  in  a  more  resonant 
 more  deeper  tone  more  masculine  way  then 
 you  simply  just  need  to  practice  it  so
[03:31] that  eventually  it  becomes  a  habit  and 
 eventually  it's  like  your  new  voice  and 
 so  when  i  used  to  do  this  when  i  was  13
[03:36] or  14  we'd  be  playing  like  the  minecraft 
 hunger  games  servers  there  was  this 
 particular  server  called  mcpvp  which  was
[03:42] like  this  hunger  game  server  where  if 
 you  wanted  to  you  could  make  friends  you 
 could  hop  on  skype  and  your  team  up  and
[03:47] try  and  like  kill  everyone  else  and  so 
 there  was  a  lot  of  like  communication 
 needed  oh  my  god  you  know  there's 
 someone  coming  in  we've  got  to  kill  him
[03:52] like  they  oh  this  one  there  he's  got  a 
 full  eye  and  watch  out  guys  wait  i  need 
 more  health  you  know  you  say  all  this 
  as  i  would  speak  those  words  to  the
[03:59] friends  that  i  was  speaking  to  i  would 
 purposely  be  just  thinking  to  myself 
 okay  make  your  voice  deeper  make  your 
 voice  deeper  make  your  voice  deeper  and
[04:05] of  course  sometimes  i'd  mess  up  you  know 
 something  like  crazy  has  just  happened  i 
 just  got  killed  out  of  nowhere  so  of 
 course  i  then  i'd  squeak  back  to  my
[04:11] normal  like  squeaky  little  minecrafter 
 voice  but  i'd  regulate  myself  just  keep 
 practicing  with  a  deeper  voice  and  it
[04:17] really  made  a  big  difference  i  know  that 
 this  video  topics  kind  of  cringe  like 
 wait  why  would  you  try  to  make  your
[04:22] voice  deeper  but  the  truth  is  like  so 
 many  young  men  want  this  young  men  want 
 to  be  more  masculine  so  the  specific
[04:28] thing  we're  talking  about  is  like  yeah 
 make  your  voice  deeper  and  sound  more 
 masculine  but  the  truth  is  this  is  so 
 important  for  young  men  we  want  to  be
[04:34] more  like  men  we  don't  want  to  sound 
 like  boys  anymore  we  don't  want  to  look 
 like  boys  this  is  so  interesting  i
[04:39] didn't  even  think  the  video  would  go  in 
 this  angle  but  i  am  really  seeing  like 
 our  generation  of  men  really  really
[04:44] trying  to  reclaim  our  masculinity  our 
 strength  we  didn't  start  off  with  this 
 for  the  majority  of  us  we  didn't  start
[04:50] off  with  like  that  healthy  masculine 
 male  role  model  because  that  should  have 
 been  our  father  but  maybe  our  father
[04:55] wasn't  around  maybe  he  was  abusive  maybe 
 he  was  taken  out  of  the  home  by  like  the 
 societal  political  structures  which  are
[05:01] against  men  or  either  way  it's  kind  of 
 beautiful  to  see  that  we  as  a  generation
[05:06] of  young  men  are  coming  online  to  like 
 learn  the  things  that  we  should  have 
 been  taught  from  childhood  i  really
[05:12] didn't  think  the  video  would  go  this  way 
 i  thought  i  was  literally  just  going  to 
 speak  about  like  how  to  make  your  voice 
 deeper  and  you  know  to  be  cringe  or
[05:17] whatever  it's  making  me  kind  of 
 visualize  myself  almost  like  a  second 
 father  figure  for  you  where  or  maybe  a
[05:22] big  brother  where  i'm  i'm  going  out 
 there  learning  experience  in  life  and 
 i'm  coming  back  to  just  teach  you  what
[05:28] i've  learned  the  best  things  trying  to 
 give  you  like  the  best  advice  and  the 
 best  wisdom  that  i  have  and  that's
[05:33] exactly  what  a  father  should  do  you  know 
 one  of  my  editors  leon  he  actually  told 
 me  that  the  purpose  of  this  channel  like
[05:38] the  thing  i  should  keep  in  mind  is  that 
 i  should  be  filling  the  shoes  that 
 fatherlessness  has  left  empty  for  our
[05:45] generation  of  men  that  i  should  see 
 myself  as 
 your  father  that  i  should  come  onto
[05:50] these  videos  and  speak  to  you  in  like 
 the  very  sort  of  like  unconditionally 
 loving  way  that
[05:56] we  all  needed  so  much  when  we  were 
 children 
 i  think
[06:01] it's  not  even  something  that  i  think 
 it's  something  that  we  all  know  there  is 
 a  masculinity  crisis
[06:06] men  just  aren't  really  muslim  anymore 
 and  some  people  make  fun  of  this  on 
 people  saying  you  know  oh  that's  that's
[06:11] cringe  and  you  don't  need  to  be 
 masculine  meant  to  be  more  feminine  and 
 everything  but  the  truth  is 
 when  a  guy  isn't  masculine  he  feels  like
[06:17] don't  you  like  i  do  when  we've 
 grown  up  and  we've  grown  up  with  being
[06:22] way  more  feminine  and  not  being 
 masculine  we've  looked  over  at  those 
 guys  who  are  masculine  and  they're 
 getting  the  parts  of  life  that  we  wanted
[06:27] like  attraction  from  women  and  success 
 and  we're  here  with  our  hte's
[06:32] and  low  testosterone  yeah  of  course 
 we're  upset  by  that  this  is  our 
 manhood  that  we're  talking  about  our
[06:37] manhood  in  this  modern  day  has  been  like 
 cut  off  that's  why  i  think  it's  so 
 important  like  maybe  it's  my  ego
[06:42] whatever  but  like  i  think  the  work  that 
 i  do  here  and  my  team  as  well  is  so  damn
[06:47] important  to  like  to  cultivate  a  sense 
 of  masculinity  and  brotherhood  inside  of 
 us  because  you  see  videos  like  the  title
[06:53] for  this  one  how  to  be  how  to  get  a 
 deeper  voice  these  videos  pop  off  they 
 get  millions  of  views  why  because  this
[06:58] is  so  in  demand  that  men  want  to  learn 
 how  to  be  more  masculine  men  want  to 
 learn  these  things  that  they  should  have
[07:03] been  taught  by  their  fathers  but  for  a 
 hundred  different  reasons  aren't  anymore
[07:08] i  feel  so  proud  that  i'm  like  taking 
 responsibility  for  that  and  i'm  coming 
 here  and  actually  like  maybe  filling  the
[07:13] shoes  it's  a  beautiful  mindset  man 
 i  think  what  we're  cultivating  here  in
[07:18] this  cult  this  brotherhood 
 is  so  so  valuable  i  don't  think  that 
 this  is  being  done  anywhere  else  like
[07:25] this  is  not  just  a  simple  youtube  video 
 this  is  literally  like  a  cult  of 
 movement  of  young  men  wanting  to  be  more
[07:30] like  adonis  we  hear  adonis's  wisdom 
 being  passed  down  to  us  and  we  try  our
[07:35] best  through  holistic  self-improvement 
 to  get  to  that  crucial  stage  of 
 self-actualization  to  get  to  that  point
[07:41] of  like  where  we're  living  the  good  life 
 to  save  our  brothers  from  being  down  bad 
 and  a  huge  part  of  this  a  huge  part  of
[07:47] this  is  masculinity  it  is  a  sense  of 
 brotherhood  it  is  a  sense  of  developing
[07:52] your  manhood  that  is  so  incredibly 
 important  for  us  never  let  these 
 jeffries  convince  you  otherwise  never
[07:58] let  them  tell  you  that  oh  well  you  don't 
 need  to  be  more  masculine  now  look  at 
 these  alpha  never  let  them  talk  to  you
[08:03] like  that  never  let  them  say  some 
  to  you  like  men  need  to  be  more 
 feminine  men  need  to  be  less  masculine
[08:08] being  masculine  is  like  a  bad  shut  up 
  up  bro  i'm  very  proud  of  the  work 
 that  we're  doing  here  and  i  think  you
[08:13] should  be  too  you  can  subscribe  to  our 
 channel  if  you  want  to 
 welcome  to  the  cult  do  the  hard  work
[08:18] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it

bsZq4OpnKZw,"[00:00] I've  woken  up  with  morning  wood  there's 
 already  tissues  in  my  bin  from  last  time 
 now  technically  I've  already  gone  day
[00:06] Zero  of  nofap  so  there's  no  harm  in 
 going  for  another  round  is  that  but  no 
 I'm  not  gonna  do  it  I'm  gonna  have  a
[00:11] discipline  productive  masculine  day  I'm 
 a  gladiator  I'm  an  expert  in  Hunter  hand 
 combat  I'm  a  brave  lion  hunter  but  still
[00:19] I  mindlessly  grab  my  phone 
 I  see  that  there's  notifications
[00:24] Instagram  notifications  and  without  even 
 thinking  about  it  I  click  on  them  and 
 then  I  go  on  to  the  explore  page  and  I
[00:30] start  scrolling 
 I  know  what  I'm  looking  for  but  I  don't 
 want  to  admit  to  man's  greatest  weakness
[00:36] gym  girls  these  are  women  who  post 
 videos  of  them  exercising  teaching
[00:41] nutrition  and  Sports  Science 
 whilst  men  masturbate  to  them  I  go  from
[00:47] one  gym  girl  to  the  next  it's  early 
 morning  and  I'm  literally  coping  saying 
 that  this  is  for  testosterone  to  start
[00:53] my  day  and  I  can't  hold  it  any  longer  I 
 get  to  an  Instagram  models  page  and  I
[00:58] beat  my  meat  like  a  sad  little  monkey 
 and  I  officially  reset  my  nofap  streak 
 and  it's  not  even  8am  yet  but  before
[01:04] closing  the  Instagram  app  in  shame  and 
 notice  how  many  likes  that  she  has  on 
 this  picture
[01:10] there's  a  lot 
 48 
 000.
[01:16] and  I  can't  help  but  to  think  that 
 probably  10  times  that  number  of  men
[01:21] have  fat  to  this  girl  I  imagine  48  000 
 men
[01:27] that's  a  small  town  of  men  it's  three  or 
 four  Villages  of  men  it's  the  capacity
[01:34] of  the  Roman  Colosseum  but  there's  no 
 Lions  there's  no  Gladiators  there's  no
[01:40] weapons 
 there's  just  the  Instagram  model  right
[01:45] in  the  middle  of  the  stadium  and  48  000 
 men  spasming  in  their  seats
[01:51] including  me  this  was  not  the  productive 
 masculine  discipline  start  to  my  day
[01:56] that  I  imagined  this  was  not  the  hunter 
 hand  combat  that  I  visualized  this  is  me
[02:01] and  my  48  000  Brothers 
 being  unable  to  control  our  desire  our
[02:07] lust  because  we  lacked  willpower  the 
 lesson  from  this  story  is  that  it  is  so
[02:12] easy  to  beat  99  of  men  you  just  need  to 
 follow  the  seven  steps  to  increasing
[02:17] your  willpower  otherwise  you'll  turn  out 
 like  a  Roman  Colosseum  fapper  like  me  my
[02:23] name  is  Hamza  Ahmed  and  I'm  making  this 
 full  guide  for  you  because  I  think  that 
 we  as  young  men  should  develop  and
[02:29] achieve  self-mastery  this  is  a  movement 
 of  young  men  who  no  longer  want  to  live
[02:34] in  mediocracy  just  for  this  fault  guide 
 that  you're  watching  for  the  past  week 
 I've  been  waking  up  at  4  30  a.m  putting
[02:41] in  a  solid  five  hours  every  single  day 
 to  make  the  script  the  research  and  now 
 for  the  recording  that  means  that  this
[02:46] is  the  one  video  you  need  to  put  your 
 trust  into  to  level  up  your  willpower 
 and  to  understand  how  to  delay
[02:51] gratification  here's  your  first 
 actionable  step 
 think  about  porn
[02:56] think  about  video  games  think  about  some 
 junk  food  think  about  the  thing  that 
 usually  brings  you  into  those  bad  habits
[03:03] really  just  close  your  eyes  for  a  second 
 and  think  about  the  bad  habit  that  often 
 pulls  you
[03:10] and  the  desire  is  forming 
 if  you're  really  really  seeing  it  in
[03:16] your  mind  you're  probably  starting  to 
 feel  a  little  bit  agitated  maybe  a 
 little  bit  scared  or  nervous  or  anxious
[03:21] or  stressed 
 maybe  you're  starting  to  feel  a  little 
 bit  of  some  physical  symptoms  and  upset
[03:27] stomach  some  agitation  in  your  chest 
 what  we're  doing  right  now  is  implanting 
 a  desire  into  our  mind  the  desire  is  for
[03:33] one  of  these  bad  habits  it's  for  porn 
 video  games  drugs  whatever  it  is
[03:38] willpower  is  the  skill  of  resisting 
 desires
[03:43] and  so  for  this  actionable  step  right 
 here  right  now  I  want  you  to  use  your 
 willpower  to  get  rid  of  the  desire  you
[03:49] feel  the  Cravings  of  this  desire 
 and  use  your  willpower  to  resist  against
[03:54] it  every  second  that  you  stay  sat  here 
 looking  at  me  right  now  you  are 
 resisting  the  desire  that  is  your
[04:00] willpower 
 and  now  if  you  just  mentally  see 
 yourself  in  a  moment  of  strength  almost
[04:05] like  punching  away  the  desire  and  saying 
 no 
 and  focusing  back  onto  this  video  you've
[04:11] just  successfully  overcame  an  urge  a 
 craving
[04:16] by  doing  that  you've  just  gained 
 experience  in  The  Willpower  skill  step
[04:21] one  understanding  willpower  imagine  your 
 four-year-old  self  being  escorted  into  a
[04:27] room  an  empty  room  by  a  stranger  told  to 
 sit  down
[04:33] and  just  look  at  the 
 bag  of  sweets  and  they  pull  out  a
[04:39] marshmallow 
 they  tell  you  that  you  can  have  this 
 marshmallow  right  now
[04:44] or  if  you  wait  around  15  minutes 
 you  can  have  two  marshmallows  this  is
[04:50] the  marshmallow  experiment  and  it's  a 
 wonderful  test  of  willpower 
 so  now  you're  hit  with  this  debate  okay
[04:56] do  I  take  the  instant  grassification  the 
 singular  marshmallow  right  now  or  do  I 
 wait  this  15  minutes  and  get  the  two
[05:02] logically  it  makes  sense  to  wait  for  the 
 two  marshmallows  but  of  course  many 
 little  fat  kids  weren't  able  to  if  you
[05:08] put  younger  me  traumatized  abused 
 younger  Hamza  into  that  room  the
[05:13] researcher  wouldn't  have  even  been  able 
 to  finish  his  sentence  now  Hamza  you  can 
 have  the  one
[05:19] oh 
 it  seems  like  a  simple  insignificant 
 test  but  the  results  were  actually  quite
[05:26] scary 
 the  kids  who  weren't  able  to  delay 
 gratification  so  the  kids  who  just
[05:31] grabbed  the  first  marshmallow  and  ate  it 
 they  weren't  even  able  to  wait  15 
 minutes  they  statistically  performed
[05:37] worse  in  so  many  different  metrics  they 
 had  a  higher  BMI  so  they  were  literally
[05:42] fatter  they  scored  on  average 
 210  points  Less  on  the  College  admission
[05:48] SATs  compared  to  the  highest  like  sort 
 of  the  most  patient  peers  that  they  had
[05:54] the  ones  who  were  unable  to  delay 
 gratification  were  even  rated  as  being 
 like  less  socially  desirable  and  more
[06:00] lonely  when  they  were  teenagers  imagine 
 having  that  kind  of  disadvantaged  life 
 just  set  in  the  trajectory  of  your
[06:06] future  being  two  or  three  or  four  years 
 old  just  because  you  had  a  low  level  of
[06:12] willpower  willpower  is  the  skill  of 
 resisting  desires  now  we  desire  all
[06:18] kinds  of  things  we  desire  the  junk  food 
 porn  video  games  these  are  things  that 
 you  already  knew  but  in  the  later  part
[06:23] of  this  full  guide  I'm  also  going  to 
 speak  about  higher  level  desires  I'm 
 going  to  speak  about  the  things  that
[06:28] this  materialistic  modern  world  put  on 
 to  us  which  seemed  productive  but  in 
 fact  are  as  destructive  if  not  even  more
[06:35] destructive  than  these  lower  level  ones 
 at  this  level  we're  thinking  about  porn 
 and  video  games  but  at  the  higher  level
[06:40] it's  more  like  working  too  hard  being 
 too  ambitious  making  too  much  money 
 building  too  much  muscle  for  many
[06:45] shallow  breathers  they're  like  small 
 brain  won't  be  able  to  comprehend  how 
 that  is  a  problem  I'm  assuming  you're 
 someone  who's  a  bit  more  intelligent  and
[06:51] I  can  open  up  your  mind  to  consider  that 
 the  path  that  has  been  laid  out  in  front 
 of  you  of  this  overachiever  great  great
[06:57] body  might  not  actually  be  the  one  that 
 leads  you  to  the  Fulfillment  that  you 
 desire  along  with  that  in  this  full
[07:03] guide  I'm  also  going  to  walk  you  through 
 the  greatest  realization  I've  had  in  my
[07:08] life  so  far  I  don't  exaggerate  when  I 
 say  that  I  think  that  we  might  be  able
[07:13] to  save  Decades  of  our  life  with 
 something  I'm  going  to  be  teaching  you 
 at  the  later  ends  of  this  full  guide  so
[07:19] we're  understanding  that  willpower  is 
 super  important  for  now  I  want  you  to 
 think  about  your  long-term  goals  chances
[07:25] are  you  want  to  be  successful  wealthy 
 happy  loving
[07:30] to  achieve  those  long-term  goals 
 really  the  most  important  skill  out
[07:35] there  is  willpower 
 because  on  the  way  to  the  dream  life
[07:40] there's  going  to  be  countless 
 distractions  hundreds  of  thousands  maybe
[07:46] millions  of  little  desires  that  pop  up 
 that  take  you  away  from  the  goal  the 
 task  the  the  trajectory  of  your  dream
[07:52] life  you  wanted  to  build  a  physique  and 
 there's  a  million  desires  for  sugar  and
[07:57] for  junk  food  and  for  skipping  days  off 
 the  gym  you  want  to  have  a  loving 
 relationship  with  a  beautiful  feminine
[08:02] woman  but  there's  a  million  desires  to 
 cheat  on  her  so  there's  something 
 interesting  that  you  can  do
[08:08] think  about 
 a  fairly  smart  guy  you  know  maybe  a
[08:13] little  bit  nerdy  there's  like  one  guy 
 you  might  remember  from  school 
 and  he  was  quite  intelligent  he
[08:19] performed  pretty  well  and  he's  probably 
 going  to  end  up  getting  like  a  pretty 
 good  job  and  he's  gonna  have  a  pretty 
 good  life
[08:25] and  then 
 one  late  night 
 he  has  a  random  hook  up  with  some  girl
[08:31] he's  just  met  it's  not  really  like  him 
 if  we're  being  honest  he  doesn't  get 
 laid  that  often  but  this  one  time  a  girl
[08:37] that  he  messaged  on  a  dating  app 
 actually  agreed  to  meet  him  at  night 
 time  and  they  ended  up  having  sex
[08:42] and  he  didn't  use  protection 
 and  he  got  her  pregnant
[08:49] this  guy  who  actually  had  a  wonderful 
 life  ahead  of  him  was  going  to  be  making 
 above  average  income  going  to  be  living
[08:55] in  this  great  house  and  you  know  achieve 
 the  sort  of  middle  class  dream  that  he 
 wanted
[09:00] suddenly  he  has  to  pay  1  250  a  month 
 every  single  month
[09:06] for  child  support  for  a  child  that  he's 
 not  even  raising  if  you  think  about  that 
 very  realistically
[09:13] his  life  has  changed  forever  because  of 
 this  one  moment
[09:18] willpower  would  have  saved  him 
 and  this  isn't  for  this  random  high
[09:23] school  student  that  you  know  this  is  for 
 every  man  especially 
 the  top  tier  men  the  athletes  the
[09:30] businessmen  the  guys  who  are  working 
 super  hard  because  it's  these  guys  who 
 get  trapped  by  their  desires  and
[09:36] impulses  it's  the  athlete  who's  been 
 grinding  super  hot  who's  disciplined  who
[09:41] ends  up  getting  some  random  girl 
 pregnancy  it's  the  businessman  who 
 marries  the  wrong  woman  gets  divorced 
 and  loses  half  of  his  stuff  it's  the  guy
[09:47] who's  disciplined  who's  going  to  the  gym 
 every  single  day  progressively 
 overloading  tracking  his  macros  building
[09:52] the  most  perfect  for  ziku 
 gets  into  an  argument  with  a  random  guy
[09:57] in  the  gym 
 and  punches  him 
 and  now  he's  in  jail  for  the  next  six  to
[10:04] 12  months  and  his  life  has  changed 
 forever
[10:09] it  is  willpower  that  will  genuinely  save 
 you  months  or  years  or  Decades  of  your
[10:14] life  so  this  is  a  skill  to  take 
 seriously  think  about  how  much  potential 
 has  been  robbed  off  the  world  because  we
[10:20] were  unable  to  control  our  desires  and 
 now  I  want  you  to  actually  feel  quite 
 great  about  yourself  because  you  are
[10:25] part  of  this  enlightened  group  that's 
 studying  a  concept  like  this  no  matter 
 how  smart  that  kid  was  that  we're
[10:31] thinking  about  in  high  school  he  wasn't 
 smart  enough  to  be  sat  here  literally 
 with  humility  thinking  I'm  gonna  learn
[10:36] about  the  skill  of  willpower  because  I 
 know  for  a  fact  that  there's  going  to  be 
 desires  that  arise  and  I  want  to  have
[10:41] this  skill  of  resisting  them  this  is 
 some  high  level  some  extremely  powerful 
 stuff  you're  doing  here  you're  learning
[10:46] such  a  powerful  skill  you're  spending 
 your  time  sat  here  focused  hopefully 
 you've  got  the  video  in  full  screen
[10:52] because  I'll  help  you  focus  even  more 
 compared  to  the  friends  that  you  know 
 the  little  Jeffrey  shallow  breathers  who
[10:57] are  literally  what  are  they  doing  right 
 now  if  you  could  almost  see  in  a  in  a 
 third  like  sort  of  person  perspective
[11:02] like  a  bird's  eye  view  of  the  houses 
 around  your  area  what  are  the  people 
 that  you  know  doing  right  now
[11:07] one  guy's  laying  in  bed  the  other  one 
 scrolling  on  his  phone  and  hey  you  are 
 actually  watching  a  guide  on  Willpower
[11:12] so  Props  to  you  step  two  lust 
 it's  summer  of  2022  and  I'm  in  Mexico  at
[11:20] the  edge  of  a  lake  which  is  right  next 
 to  the  hostel  that  I'm  staying  in 
 and  there's  a  sign  here  it's  a  red
[11:27] warning  sign 
 it's  a  sign  that  shows  that  there's 
 crocodiles  inside  of  this  Lake
[11:34] but  I'm  laying  down  on  the  grass 
 and  I'm  naked  I'm  with  a  girl  who  I  just
[11:40] met  an  hour  ago  outside  of  a  nightclub 
 and  we  can  hear  the  partying  the
[11:45] laughing  and  drinking  going  on  inside  of 
 the  hostel  and  this  is  when  something 
 appears
[11:51] it's  not  a  prehistoric  reptile 
 it's  not  police  it's  some  security
[11:56] guards  and  they've  caught  me  with  my 
 dick  out  having  sex  in  public  I'm
[12:01] Shuffling  my  clothes  on  getting  stuck  in 
 my  shirt  and  she's  like  holding  onto  my 
 arm  and  the  security  guards  and  her
[12:07] start  speaking  in  Spanish  because  she's 
 from  here  so  she  understands  and  I'm 
 literally  just  left  out  here  I  am  with
[12:12] an  erection  with  three  people  speaking  a 
 language  I  don't  understand  not  knowing 
 what's  gonna  happen  to  me  ask  her  what's
[12:18] going  on  what  are  they  saying  what's 
 gonna  happen  and  she  says 
 they're  not  gonna 
 call  the  police
[12:25] they're  not  going  to  file  a  complaints 
 but  they  want  you  to  go  to  the  reception
[12:32] where  the  ATM  is  I  know  what's  going  to 
 happen  I've  heard  of  this  before  I'm  in 
 Mexico  these  [ __ ]  are  going  to
[12:37] try  and  ask  me  for  like  a  bribe  they're 
 probably  going  to  try  and  charge  me  like 
 a  thousand  dollars  or  something  crazy
[12:42] I  might  run 
 I  might  run  my  heart  starts  going  fast  I
[12:48] might  actually  just  [ __ ]  run  away 
 from  here  right  now
[12:53] fight  flights 
 and  freeze 
 I'm  the  worst  one
[13:00] I'm  a  freezer  now  I'm  at  the  reception 
 of  this  hostel  and  they're  telling  me  to 
 pay  they  want  me  to  pay
[13:07] 150  dollars 
 I'm  an  entrepreneur  so  I  calculate  the 
 return  on  investment  in  my  mind  and  I'm
[13:12] thinking  you  know  what  150  not  get  sent 
 to  a  Mexican  prison  like  this  is
[13:17] actually  quite  a  high  Roi  investment 
 honestly  this  would  make  Warren  Buffett 
 proud  I  might  actually  take  this  deal
[13:23] so  he  points  over  to  the  ATM  in  the 
 corner  I'm  like  yeah  sure  I  go  in  put  my 
 card  in  put  my  pin  in
[13:30] doesn't  work 
 put  my  card  back  in  put  my  pin  in  right
[13:35] doesn't  work 
 I'll  put  my  card  in  again  but  I'm 
 thinking  away  it's  not  worked  twice  if  I
[13:40] try  and  put  it  in  again  it's  you  know  my 
 card  might  actually  get  blocked  by  the 
 bank  or  something  so  I  come  back  now  the
[13:45] ATM's  not  working 
 but  yeah  I  remember  I've  bought  water 
 from  here  from  this  reception
[13:51] um  I  paid  with  like  the  card  machine 
 last  time  I'll  just  pay  with  that  again 
 and  that's  not  what  they  wanted  to  hear
[13:58] because  there  was  a  card  machine  like  a 
 normal  credit  card  machine  behind  the 
 reception  and  I  had  literally  paid  for
[14:03] something  before  like  for  a  water  bottle 
 but  straight  away  the  guy  behind  the
[14:08] desk  starts  saying  like  no  no  you  can't 
 because  um it  doesn't  work  till  6  a.m  it
[14:13] doesn't  matter  it  doesn't  work  today  it 
 doesn't  work  till  like  7  A.M  or  8  A.M  it 
 needs  to  be  cash
[14:18] that's  how  I  understand  what's  happening 
 they  don't  want  me  to  pay  on  the  card 
 machine  because  then  that  money  is  going
[14:23] to  get  sent  to  like  the  company  bank 
 account  they  want  cash  to  split  between 
 the  two  security  guards  and  this  random 
 guy  behind  the  reception  so  what  can  I
[14:29] do 
 I'll  ask  my  sweet  Beloved  the  girl  that 
 I've  just  been  with  I  turn  over  to  her
[14:36] explain  the  situation  and  say  like  you 
 know  um  can  you  just  pay  for  it  with  you 
 know  cash  and  then  I'll  bank  transfer
[14:42] you 
 and  she  does  not  react  how  I  thought  she 
 would
[14:49] because  just  20  minutes  ago  we  were 
 having  sex  and  you  know  the  most 
 intimate  thing  that  you  can  do  together
[14:57] and  she  just  bursts  out 
 aggressively  almost  like  getting  into  my
[15:02] face  no  no  English  no  English  I  know 
 instantly  what's  going  on  it's  like 
 she's  almost  pretending  to  you  know  she
[15:07] it  was  quite  a  embarrassing  situation  so 
 she's  pretending  to  take  a  step  back 
 from  it  not  understanding  what's  going
[15:12] on  either  she  doesn't  want  to  associate 
 with  me  or  something  she  ends  up 
 storming  off  the  security  guards  let  her
[15:17] off  but  they're  actually  like  keeping  me 
 here 
 and  I  actually  don't  know  what  to  do  my
[15:23] heart  is  beating  very  fast  I'm  feeling 
 super  stressed  not  knowing  what  these 
 three  guys  are  going  to  do  to  me  and  so
[15:28] I  have  an  idea  that's  fairly  pathetic 
 I  say  to  them  oh  well  let's  go  into  the
[15:33] hostel  like  where  the  people  are 
 partying  because  there  was  a  few  people 
 there  like  I  partied  with  yesterday  and 
 then  I'll  you  know  I'll  ask  them  to  lend
[15:39] me  the  money 
 so  here  we  are  amongst  all  these  people 
 who  are  drinking  laughing  smoking  and
[15:44] and  I'm  going  one  by  one  asking  them  to 
 lend  me  150  dollars 
 no  one  has  got  the  money  for  it
[15:50] everyone's  like  yeah  yeah  you  know  I 
 don't  I  don't  have  enough  bro  yeah
[15:55] but  soon  there's  almost  like  a  small 
 circle  forming  around  me  the  security 
 guards  because  I've  told  people  the
[16:00] situation  and  you  know  they're  thinking 
 like  oh  you  know  don't  leave  him  alone 
 that's  fine  like  oh  what  are  you  gonna 
 do  you're  finding  him  like  you  know
[16:05] people  are  starting  to  defend  me  and  so 
 I  ask  a  few  of  them  to  come  back  with  me 
 and  we  go  to  the  reception  and  it  turns
[16:10] into  this  big  scene  I  can  see  the 
 security  guards  are  getting  kind  of 
 annoyed  and  so  they  let  me  go  back  into 
 my  room  once  they  like  fix  the  ATM  so
[16:17] I'm  here  in  the  little  hostel  little 
 single  bed  amongst  other  people  who  are 
 like  sleeping  and  everything  and  I'm
[16:22] lying  down  and  I  want  to  sleep  but  I'm 
 actually  terrified  thinking  at  any 
 moment  I'm  gonna  feel  like  a  tap  on  my
[16:27] shoulder  what  if  they're  gonna  wake  me 
 up  an  hour  from  now  say  no  no  yeah  we 
 want  300  because  we've  had  to  fix  the
[16:32] ATM  because  of  you  I'm  at  genuinely  like 
 a  10  out  of  10  state  of  stress  I'm
[16:37] thinking  should  I  just  run  away  they've 
 got  my  details  there  I  don't  even  know 
 what  to  do
[16:42] Indiana  decides  to  just  run  away  I  pack 
 all  my  stuff  in  a  bag 
 I  end  up  just  kind  of  like  watching  out
[16:48] for  the  CCTV  and  just  like  fast  walk  I 
 didn't  even  have  the  courage  to  run  for 
 some  reason  so  I  just  like  fast  walk  out
[16:54] of  the  hostel  never  checked  out  never 
 gave  them  the  little  key  card  just  kind 
 of  fast  walked  as  soon  as  they  noticed
[16:59] me  that's  when  I  started  to  like  jog 
 away  they  didn't  even  chase  me  but  as 
 I'm  jogging
[17:04] I  realize  that  this  whole  thing  started 
 because  of  my  inability  to  control  lust
[17:09] I  had  literally  just  met  a  girl  for 
 minutes
[17:14] and  then  had  sex  with  her  like  less  than 
 an  hour  later
[17:19] and  then  she  almost  she  betrayed  me  she 
 backstabbed  me  and  I  don't  blame  her  for 
 it  because  you  know  she  barely  knew  me
[17:25] but  she  barely  knew  me  she  was  the  kind 
 of  person  who  would  betray  me  and 
 backstab  me
[17:30] and  here  I  was  like  sharing  my  soul  with 
 her
[17:36] it  honestly  made  me  realize 
 casual  sex
[17:41] is  worse  far  worse  than  porn 
 with  porn  it's  just  you  there  by
[17:47] yourself  you're  not  hurting  anyone  but 
 it's  still  obviously  a  really  bad  habit 
 to  get  into
[17:52] but  it's  just  you 
 with  casual  sex  there's  a  whole  other 
 person  involved  in  this  situation  it
[17:57] wasn't  just  one  other  person  involved  it 
 was  two  security  guards  the  guy  behind 
 the  desk  all  the  other  hostel  like  you
[18:02] know  the  people  who  were  partying  and 
 then  also  the  girl  there  was  all  these 
 people  and  yet  I'm  still  alone  it  was
[18:09] honestly  one  of  the  most  like  stressful 
 days  and  somewhat  lonely  days  of  my  life
[18:14] I  want  you  to  think  of  just  how  bad  the 
 problem  of  controlling  our  lust  really 
 is  because  there's  entrepreneurs  out
[18:20] there  whose  entire  job  whose  entire 
 companies 
 are  just  revolving  around  monetizing
[18:27] your  lust  you  feel  this  somewhat  natural 
 desire 
 and  they  make  money  from  it  and  since
[18:34] they  make  money  from  your  lust  well  they 
 want  to  make  sure  that  you're  feeling 
 lustful  all  the  time  way  more  than  you
[18:39] actually  should 
 so  then  we  have  all  these  these  porn 
 companies  only  fans  that  even  the  guys
[18:46] who  are  like  sort  of  running  the  only 
 fans  agencies  and  all  this  pathetic  like 
 degenerate  stuff  that's  going  on
[18:52] and  you  the  consumer  are  the  one  who's 
 experiencing  the  the  pain  of  this
[18:58] because  it  is  everywhere  these 
 Temptations  how  crazy  is  this  it's  more
[19:03] common  for  me  to  speak  to  a  young  man 
 who's  had  a  porn  addiction  for  the  last 
 five  plus  years
[19:08] than  not  more  than  half  of  young  men 
 have  genuine  addictions  to  porn  and  have
[19:14] had  that  since  they  were  12  or  13  years 
 old  and  you  can  probably  relate  to  that
[19:19] I  speak  to  guys  who  tell  me  their  first 
 experience  of  porn  was  age  nine  before 
 puberty  and  not  only  that  I  honestly
[19:25] think  we're  gonna  see  it  such  a  huge 
 uprising  of  women's  problems  with  porn
[19:30] too  because  you  probably  can  imagine  for 
 the  last  few  years  women  have  had  like  a
[19:35] very  sort  of  free  sexual  experience  know 
 your  body  play  with  yourself  and  it 
 seems  like  wholesome  advice  Up  Until  you
[19:41] realize  that  when  a  woman  gets  addicted 
 to  porn  it  has  very  similar  consequences 
 it  truly  does  degrade  her  ability  to  be
[19:48] able  to  like  pair  bond  with  a  man  just 
 like  as  it  does  the  man  to  the  woman 
 because  here  you  are  practicing  these
[19:54] very  poor  like  sexual  habits  you're 
 restraining  your  breath  you're  focusing 
 very  much  on  like  mental  fantasy  you're
[20:01] looking  at  people  who  don't  even  know 
 that  you're  there  you're  conditioning 
 yourself  to  be  the  Observer  of  sex 
 rather  than  the  partaker  you're
[20:08] conditioning  yourself  to  literally  get 
 turned  on  with  your  own  sort  of  mental 
 fantasies  or  like  literally  being  a  [ __ ]
[20:13] and  the  exact  same  thing  is  true  for 
 women  so  here  we  are  degrading  our 
 future  ability  to  make  love  and  it's
[20:19] actually  like  Bond  incredibly  with  our 
 partners
[20:24] for  the  sake  of  some  pleasure  today 
 because  we  couldn't  resist  the  desire  of 
 lust  but  I  think  we  can  adopt  more  of  a
[20:29] positive  note  around  this  you  know 
 because  on  this  space  online  of  men's 
 self-improvement  you  know  the  problem 
 with  porn  is  very  clear  you  knew  this
[20:35] but  I  want  you  to  think  right  now 
 there's  a  lot  of  guys  who  know  about 
 nofap
[20:40] the  concept  of  nofap  of  not  watching 
 porn  it's  actually  quite  like  famous
[20:45] it's  quite  like  public  knowledge  these 
 days  right  like  you  actually  know  fully 
 about  nofap  and  not  watching  porn  and  so
[20:51] do  some  of  the  people  that  you  know  and 
 you  see  all  these  Community  these
[20:56] massive  influencers  talking  about  it  we 
 are  seeing  a  massive  uprise  for  people 
 who  are  like  openly  talking  about  the
[21:02] fact  that  porn  is  really  bad  and  it's 
 almost  become  like  a  counter  Community 
 mindset  to  the  people  who  just  like  you
[21:08] know  just  say  oh  well  you  know  it's  just 
 a  bit  of  fun  it  makes  me  feel  proud  for 
 young  men  like  us  who  are  being  served
[21:13] like  the  most  addictive  substance  and  we 
 literally  have  like  communities  and 
 mindsets  and  movements  training  each
[21:20] other  saying  like  no  no  we're  better 
 than  that 
 the  most  addictive  thing  they  can  put  in 
 front  of  you  and  here  we  are  literally
[21:26] like  routinely  knowing  that  it's  not 
 good  for  us 
 taking  the  harder  path
[21:32] you're  one  of  these  men  I  really  do 
 think  you  should  feel  proud  of  yourself 
 even  if  for  example  you  think  that 
 you've  been  struggling  you've  been
[21:37] relapsing  just  the  fact  that  you're 
 making  progress  the  fact  that  you're 
 trying  the  fact  that  you're  sort  of
[21:42] vigilant  of  this  problem  means  that 
 you've  actually  put  some  work  into  this
[21:47] and  not  only  porn  but  casual  sex  can  be 
 such  a  big  problem  as  well  and  I  think 
 that  this  is  more  of  a  hidden  problem  a
[21:53] lot  of  people  know  about  the  problems 
 with  porn  but  with  casual  Sexes  like 
 this  I'd  speak  to  a  lot  of  guys  who  are
[21:58] actually  kind  of  hoping  for  it  I  speak 
 to  a  lot  of  guys  who've  got  Tinder 
 accounts  and  they  just  want  to  try  and
[22:03] get  laid  because  they've  been  told  that 
 this  is  what  they  should  spend  their 
 time  on  and  I  don't  blame  you  if  you're
[22:08] like  this  because  I  spend  a  lot  of  my 
 life  chasing  like  you  know  this  the  sort 
 of  validation  and  convincing  yourself
[22:14] that  yeah  yeah  you  know  this  is  the 
 thing  I  should  be  spending  my  time  on 
 rather  than  just  developing  yourself  and 
 living  a  happy  life  in  your  happiness
[22:20] not  being  tied  to  some  random  drunk  girl 
 this  is  a  hard  one  to  grasp  for  a  lot  of 
 young  guys  including  when  I  was  younger
[22:26] because  when  you're  told  that  casual  sex 
 is  bad  you  might  be  asking  yourself  well 
 then  how  do  you  like  have  fun  but  it
[22:32] can't  because  it's  really  natural  this 
 isn't  to  say  that  sex  and  making  love  is
[22:38] a  bad  thing  I  think  that  can  be  very 
 very  pleasant  like  a  very  positive 
 experience  of  life  it's  the  say  like
[22:43] let's  just  be  honest  and  obvious  here 
 it's  to  say  that  having  sex  with  a 
 random  girl  that  you've  just  met  who's
[22:49] unintelligent  and  stupid  and  you've  just 
 met  her  in  a  nightclub  and  she  takes 
 drugs  and  she's  nothing  like  you
[22:55] it  means  that  that's  not  a  good  thing  it 
 means  that  matching  with  as  many  girls 
 as  possible  on  Tinder  and  trying  your
[23:01] best  to  just  sleep  with  as  many  as 
 possible  is  it's  not  like  it's  not 
 showing  that  you  respect  yourself  or
[23:07] your  time  you  could  be  building 
 something  great  like  focus  on 
 self-mastery  focus  on  trying  to  like 
 peel  back  the  layers  of  your  purpose  so
[23:13] you  can  discover  yourself  and  to  have 
 some  kind  of  like  spiritual  experience 
 to  feel  your  potential  to  build  like  a
[23:19] beautiful  business  where  you've  hired 
 loads  of  great  people  and  you  work 
 alongside  them  there's  so  many  things
[23:24] you  can  spend  your  time  on  and  also 
 developing  yourself  so  that  you  can 
 attract  a  really  nice  like  great  woman
[23:30] and  then  have  better  sex  with  her  anyway 
 so  the  problem  with  lust  is  that  usually
[23:35] it  will  drive  you  to  these  low  quality 
 places  where  you  don't  want  to  be  which 
 you're  better  than  when  I  think  about
[23:41] even  21  22  year  old  me  in  the  middle  of 
 a  club  or  party  I  just  see  it  so  odd
[23:46] because  I  was  like  you  don't  fit  in 
 there  everyone  there  is  taking  drugs 
 everyone  there  is  unintelligent  here's
[23:52] you  who's  reading  self-improvement  books 
 who's  watching  videos  like  this  here's 
 you  who's  going  to  the  gym  and  tracking
[23:57] your  Macros  and  you're  around  [ __ ] 
 like  stupid  people  just  for  the  sake  of 
 like  oh  but  you  know  I  might  get  laid
[24:02] tonight 
 how  about  you  just  conserve  that  lust 
 just  for  a  little  bit  develop  yourself
[24:08] and  think  to  yourself  when  I  meet  like  a 
 really  good  woman  and  we  really  match
[24:13] I'll  have  10  times  more  sex  with  her  you 
 can  still  enjoy  sex  in  your  life  but 
 just  make  it  with  the  right  person
[24:18] there's  something  from  that  marshmallow 
 experiment  that  we  spoke  about  at  the 
 start  of  this  video  which  I  found  very
[24:23] interesting  so  imagine  here  you  are 
 you're  the  little  little  four-year-old 
 boy  the  experimenter  SAT  you  down  and
[24:28] said  okay  okay  little  Timmy  you  know  you 
 can  have  this  marshmallow  right  now  you 
 can  have  two  later  what  they  found  was
[24:34] that  if  you  simply  just  moved  the  sort 
 of  bad  thing  away  from  your  visual
[24:40] sights  you  were  10  times  more  likely  to
[24:45] resist  the  desire  if  it  was  in  front  of 
 you  visually  it  was  very  hard  to  resist
[24:50] it  how  they  did  this  was  just  with  the 
 marshmallows  they  literally  just  put  a 
 plate  over  it  as  soon  as  they  did  that
[24:56] the  kids  were  10  times  more  likely  to 
 like  pass  this  test  now  I  want  you  to 
 just  visualize  all  of  like  the  the
[25:02] advertisements  billboard  social  media 
 the  porn  companies  everywhere  you  look
[25:07] there's  more  porn  there's  more 
 degeneracy  this  this  talks  of  like 
 casual  sex  and  pleasure 
 what  we  need  to  do  is  the  equivalence  of
[25:13] putting  that  plate  over  the  marshmallows 
 but  for  things  of  our  lust  because  right 
 now  here  right  now  if  you  do  have  a
[25:19] social  media  account  I'm  guessing  that 
 there  is  at  least  one  or  two  profiles 
 probably  from  women  that  are  like
[25:25] causing  urges  inside  of  you  you  go  onto 
 Instagram  just  coping  saying  that's  just 
 a  five  minute  break  you're  there  for  15
[25:30] minutes  and  you  end  up  just  clicking  on 
 the  girl  who's  kind  of  hot  that  you  know 
 and  before  you  know  it  you  probably  end
[25:36] up  relapsing  again 
 or  maybe  it's  on  YouTube  maybe  you  go 
 onto  YouTube  you  go  onto  one  of  these
[25:41] like  degenerate  podcasts  where  one  of 
 the  girls  there  has  got  cleavage  or 
 something  and  here  you  are  just  like 
 starting  to  fantasize  and  boom  you
[25:47] relapsed  again  what  we  need  to  do  is 
 cleanse  our  space  so  that  we  don't  see 
 these  degenerate  like  these  provocative
[25:53] things 
 I  hope  you're  getting  some  ideas  because 
 there's  some  things  that  you  could 
 Implement  right  here  right  now  and  we'll
[25:58] do  that  for  the  actionable  step  coming 
 up  soon  maybe  you  should  unfollow  like 
 the  girl  that  you  follow  who's  causing
[26:04] these  urges  to  arise  whether  there's  any 
 kind  of  social  consequences  or  not  like 
 oh  but  you  know  she's  a  girl  from  my
[26:10] school  and  she  follows  me  back  so  it 
 looks  kind  of  cool  that  I've  got  a  hot 
 girl  who  follows  me  if  you're  constantly
[26:15] just  being  led  by  your  lust  and 
 relapsing  because  of  this  it's  worth  it
[26:20] for  you  to  just  unfollow  her  maybe  it's 
 the  degenerate  music  that's  on  your 
 Spotify  and  you  listen  to  all  these
[26:25] rappers  you  know  I've  realized  so  much 
 recently  how  bad  music  is  and  how  easy 
 it  is  for  you  to  get  like  a  quick  little
[26:30] boost  to  your  self-improvement  your 
 self-esteem  your  self-image  by  not 
 listening  to  degenerate  music  whether
[26:36] you're  plugging  it  in  of  this  like 
 rapper  or  singer  who's  talking  about  how 
 great  he  is  and  how  many  [ __ ]  he
[26:42] [ __ ]  and  how  much  money  he  makes  and 
 has  you  like  little  chump  like  listening 
 to  his  brainwashing  of  like  him  talking
[26:48] about  how  great  he  is  and  you're  tuning 
 into  that  I  just  kind  of  like  I  don't 
 know  I  saw  that  in  a  different
[26:53] perspective  and  thought  man  [ __ ]  me 
 that  side  I'm  never  listening  to  that 
 kind  of  music  ever  again  for  the  last
[26:58] like  three  months  or  so  I've  not 
 listened  to  like  songs  like  that  because 
 it  just  disgusts  me  when  I  think  of  the
[27:03] idea  of  like  here  is  a  degenerate  who's 
 talking  about  having  sex 
 and  that  the  girls  he's  sleeping  with
[27:09] like  it  and  here  I  am  like  listening  to 
 it  it's  literally  it's  kind  of  like  [ __ ]
[27:15] porn  like  most  rap  songs  are  like 
 cockapon  these  days  and  you  are  like 
 this  weird  disgusting  [ __ ]  weirdo  if  you
[27:22] listen  to  that  consistently  and  all 
 these  like  normal  people  are  gonna 
 listen  oh  well  wraps  actually  it's
[27:27] actually  art  bro  and  like  oh  but  you're 
 just  being  like  you  know  you  can  listen 
 to  some  rap  guys  don't  listen  to  him
[27:32] like  yeah  sure  do  what  you  want  but 
 don't  be  surprised  when  you  start 
 getting  these  weird  cuck  fantasies  that
[27:37] are  arising  that  you  feel  like  quite 
 soft  and  timid  when  it  comes  to  you 
 having  sex  with  a  woman  because  you're 
 more  used  to  listening  to  guys  who  are
[27:43] talking  about  pounding  them  and  how  you 
 are  listen  like  tuning  into  that  and 
 you're  more  used  to  watching  porn  with
[27:49] the  guys  [ __ ]  the  girl  and  hey  you 
 are  as  a  passive  Observer  and  so  when 
 it's  time  for  you  to  have  sex  you  almost
[27:54] feel  like  a  passive  Observer  even  though 
 this  girl's  on  you  you  want  her  to  kind 
 of  put  it  onto  you  you  want  her  to
[27:59] engage  it  you  want  her  to  start  on  you 
 you  want  her  to  dominate  you 
 that's  how  they've  conditioned  you  to  be
[28:06] this  isn't  your  natural  impulse  you 
 weren't  born  as  a  [ __ ]  you  weren't  born 
 as  like  you  know  like  as  a  boy  who  was
[28:12] supposed  to  turn  into  a  man  who  was  a 
 coward  this  is  conditioning
[28:17] it'd  be  interesting  to  see  what  kind  of 
 man  you  would  be  without  these  external 
 influences  without  this  lust  being  put
[28:22] onto  you  without  this  messaging  from 
 this  rapper  or  this  TV  show
[28:28] most  men  never  find  out  who  they 
 actually  are 
 when  you  unplug  and  you  really  unplug
[28:36] that's  when  you  start  to  discover 
 yourself  and  there  was  another  Finding 
 from  the  marshmallow  experiment  that's 
 going  to  help  you  overcome  lust  so
[28:41] imagine  okay  they've  put  you  there  again 
 with  the  marshmallow  the  two 
 marshmallows  okay  you've  got  to  wait  for 
 them  okay  then  they  tell  you  why  don't
[28:48] you  think  of  something  that  makes  you 
 happy  remember  the  time  that  you  when 
 your  mummy  pursue  high  on  the  swing  they
[28:54] would  say  that  to  some  kids  some 
 obviously  that  you  know  they  get  like 
 super  happy  thinking  of  like  this  happy
[28:59] moment  they  again  were  super  super 
 significantly  more  likely  to  resist  the
[29:05] temptation  of  just  eating  the  one 
 marshmallow  now  rather  than  delaying 
 gratification  for  the  other  one  was  very
[29:11] interesting  they  also  tried  the  exact 
 opposite  they  told  some  kids  why  don't
[29:16] you  just  think  about  how  good  the 
 marshmallow  is  gonna  taste 
 those  kids  ate  it  almost  immediately
[29:24] so  what  does  this  teach  us 
 we  should  one  be  trying  to  think  of  like 
 positive  thoughts  and  positive  memories
[29:31] but  two  we  should  not  be  fantasizing  and 
 keeping  in  mind  the  bad  desire  that  we
[29:37] don't  want  to  act  on  and  this  is  the 
 exact  opposite  that  a  lot  of  us  often  do 
 when  you  get  an  urge  for  porn  be  honest
[29:43] you're  probably  kind  of  circulate  the 
 urge  in  your  mind  a  bit  you  kind  of 
 almost  fantasize  in  it  mentally  first
[29:48] don't  you  you're  almost  like  play  around 
 with  it  it's  kind  of  annoying  and 
 agitating  to  experience  like  an  urge  to
[29:54] relapse  but  you  almost  like  purposely 
 keep  it  in  your  mind  at  times  the  fat
[29:59] person  who's  like  you  know  thinking 
 should  I  eat  the  cake  or  not  should  I 
 eat  the  cake  or  not  they're  literally 
 just  like  thinking  about  the  cake  for
[30:04] the  next  10  20  minutes  and  of  course 
 they're  going  to  end  up  eating  it  when 
 you  get  thoughts  and  urges  and  Desires
[30:09] in  your  mind  of  okay  ah  maybe  I'll  go 
 watch  porn  and  I  don't  want  to  maybe  I 
 should  maybe  I  should  by  keeping  it  in
[30:15] your  mind  you're  absolutely  going  to 
 relapse  by  like  visualizing  the  kind  of
[30:21] Pawn  that  you  want  to  watch  visualizing 
 you  know  fantasizing  about  the  girl  that 
 you  want  to  sleep  with  you  absolutely
[30:26] will  fail  at  this  goal  of  yours  to  like 
 become  a  better  man  and  to  be  stronger
[30:31] and  to  use  willpower  so  instead  we're 
 going  to  use  a  principle  which  is  called 
 if  then  a  lot  of  programmers  like  nerds
[30:37] know  about  this  if  then  it's  kind  of 
 like  a  mental  model  almost  like  we're 
 forming  a  mental  habit  and  the  way  it
[30:43] works  is  we  clarify  with  humility  that 
 we're  certainly  going  to  experience  a
[30:49] desire  for  porn  or  sex  again  right  we 
 know  this  right  no  matter  even  if  you 
 get  onto  nofap  no  matter  how  long  you've
[30:55] been  on  we  know  for  a  fact  that  we're 
 gonna  have  desires  for  porn  or  sex  at 
 some  point  in  our  lives  probably  like  50
[31:01] million  of  them  right  so  if  we  are 
 honest  with  that  okay  we're  gonna  have 
 those  desires  we  need  to  start  to  plan
[31:07] this  almost  mental  model  where  we're 
 going  to  say  okay  when  I  get  that  mental 
 model  then  what  I'm  going  to  do  is
[31:13] and  set  a  real  consistent  like  super 
 specific  plan  for  that  so  you  can  do
[31:18] this  right  now  think  to  yourself  right 
 here  right  now  I'm  gonna  get  a  lot  more 
 desires  for  porn  and  for  all  bad  desires
[31:25] as  soon  as  I  notice  that  I'm  getting 
 this  desire  this  craving
[31:30] I'm  going  to  do  X 
 now  a  lot  of  people  I've  noticed  will
[31:35] say  like  oh  yeah  do  some  push-ups  do 
 some  exercise  you  possibly  could  do  that 
 I'm  not  sure  if  that  would  be  effective
[31:40] the  people  I've  spoke  to  the  young  guys 
 who  say  like  oh  yeah  you  know  just  do 
 some  push-ups  they  always  end  up
[31:45] relapsing  because  I'm  not  sure  if  trying 
 to  counter  like  a  sort  of  a  mental 
 craving  with  something  real  world  which
[31:51] you  know  it's  almost  a  bit  unimpractical 
 which  sounds  silly  but  it's  like  it's 
 almost  a  bit  impractical  it's  like  get 
 down  and  do  push-ups  a  lot  of  the  time  I
[31:57] think  it's  better  to  almost  make  your 
 like  action  your  response  action  more  of
[32:02] like  a  way  of  thinking  so  mind  for 
 example  is  when  I  have  a  desire  that  I 
 don't  want  to  fulfill  I  will  instead
[32:08] immediately  go  and  think  about  some  kind 
 of  happy  Pleasant  funny  memory  because 
 when  we  have  these  positive  emotions
[32:14] inside  of  us  we're  far  more  likely  to 
 delay  gratification  just  because  we 
 don't  really  need  much  external  things
[32:20] anymore  you  know  when  you  feel  happy  you 
 don't  need  to  eat  as  much  sugar  because 
 you  already  kind  of  feel  happy  so  you
[32:25] can  just  take  my  one  when  you  feel  a 
 desire  for  something  that  you  don't  want 
 to  feel  immediately  go  and  think  about
[32:30] some  kind  of  like  funny  memory  that  just 
 makes  you  kind  of  smile  of  love  and 
 you'll  find  that  your  desire  for  that
[32:35] thing  will  usually  go  down  because  if 
 we're  being  honest 
 the  biggest  reason  why  you  watch  porn  is
[32:40] probably  just  because  you're  sad  bored 
 or  lonely  sometimes  yeah  there  is  the
[32:46] sort  of  the  lust  and  the  horniness  but 
 let's  say  real  emotions 
 I  feel  sadness  I  feel  bored  I  feel
[32:52] lonely 
 so  how  many  times  do  we  really  get  this 
 intense  need  to  fap  when  we're  in  like  a
[32:59] humorous  joyful  grateful  present  happy 
 mood 
 not  often  right  it's  usually  when  we're
[33:05] in  this  quite  silent  mood  and  you  know 
 it's  4  P.M  or  7  p.m  and  we're  just  in 
 our  bedrooms  by  ourselves  we're  not
[33:11] talking  to  anyone  we  haven't  seen 
 sunlight  for  the  last  few  hours  and 
 we're  sat  here  just  mindlessly  looking
[33:16] at  content  and  you're  just  wasting  time 
 pretending  to  study  that's  when  it  hits 
 us
[33:21] it's  not  like  you  ever  are  having  such  a 
 funny  conversation  with  someone  you 
 can't  stop  laughing  and  that's  when
[33:27] you're  thinking  like  yeah  now  would  be  a 
 good  time  to  ejaculate  in  the  sugar 
 section  of  this  full  guide  I  explain 
 fully  how  to  control  your  emotions  so
[33:33] that  these  emotions  of  sadness  boredom 
 or  loneliness  don't  make  you  relapse  on
[33:38] porn  so  you  might  want  to  go  watch  that 
 section  as  well  but  first  your 
 actionable  step  for  this  part  of  the 
 guide  is  to  take  action  right  here  right
[33:44] now 
 with  me 
 grab  your  phone  go  on  to  those  apps
[33:49] which  you  usually  find  have  caused  the 
 trigger  for  you  for  a  lot  of  guys  this
[33:54] will  be  social  media  maybe  you've 
 deleted  your  social  media  already  but 
 let's  say  it's  the  Instagram  and  if 
 you're  just  being  honest  on  Instagram
[33:59] there  is  a  girl  that  for  example  it 
 feels  like  a  lot  of  triggers  a  lot  of 
 cravings  and  desires  happen  because  of
[34:05] her  maybe  it's  some  like  model  or  some 
 celebrity  maybe  it's  some  girl  that  you 
 know  from  like  school  or  work  or
[34:10] something 
 go  in  and  follow  her  this  is  for  your 
 own  mental  health  your  own  good  there's
[34:15] no  reason  to  keep  something  which  is 
 literally  just  like  poisoning  your  mind 
 and  you  know  causing  your  mind  to  fall
[34:21] in  because  remember  for  the  the  kids  in 
 the  marshmallow  experiment  if  we  can 
 cover  the  desire  so  you  can't  see  it
[34:26] you'll  be  far  less  likely  to  relapse 
 maybe  it's  a  girl  on  Instagram  but  maybe 
 it's  also  content  creators  on  YouTube  I
[34:32] know  for  a  lot  of  young  men  they  watch  a 
 lot  of  like  to  seemingly  traditional  but
[34:37] actually  degenerate  male  influencers 
 role  models  and  so  these  people  online
[34:43] like  you  know  who  I'm  talking  about  but 
 like  they'll  they'll  be  causing  more 
 triggers  even  though  they're  pretending
[34:49] to  help  you  so  there's  the  nofap 
 YouTuber  who  shows  you  pictures  of  like 
 attractive  girls  knowing  that  it's  Gonna
[34:55] Make  You  relapse  just  because  he  doesn't 
 actually  give  a  [ __ ]  about  you  he  just 
 wants  you  to  like  you  know  watch  be  more
[35:00] likely  to  click  on  the  video  anytime  I 
 see  a  nofap  YouTuber  who  puts  something 
 like  triggering  as  a  picture  you  know
[35:05] the  thumbnail  or  whatever  he  puts  like  a 
 sexy  girl  or  something  I  always  just 
 think  to  myself  this  is  a  grade  a
[35:10] [ __ ]  the  same  thing  I  see  with  these 
 sort  of  men's  podcasts  where  they  know 
 that  the  major  problem  that  their
[35:15] audiences  of  experiencing  is  like  porn 
 and  masturbation  and  triggers  and  here
[35:21] they'll  bring  in  a  bunch  of  degenerate 
 women  and  telling  them  to  like  dress  up 
 nice  and  put  away  in  the  push-up  bras 
 just  to  kind  of  put  that  into  your  face
[35:27] and  then  there  they  are  shouting  at  them 
 and  tell  them  no  like  you  know  I  am  a 
 high  value  man  and  you  you  do  this  and 
 you  have  sex  and  like  and  then  straight
[35:33] after  the  show  they  just  message  them 
 and  say  like  oh  hey  do  you  wanna  [ __ ] 
 they  desperately  are  trying  to  [ __ ]  the
[35:38] same  girls  that  they're  saying  are 
 damaged  your  actionable  step  which  will 
 genuinely  change  your  life  forever
[35:43] unsubscribe  from  garbage  content  from 
 the  girl  who  doesn't  even  post  anything
[35:49] educational  but  she's  just  you  know  it's 
 like  the  girl  who's  pretending  to  be 
 like  a  fitness  influencer  and  she's
[35:54] posting  like  you  know  her  little  workout 
 routines  but  she's  wearing  quite  like 
 sexual  clothing  the  kind  of  leggings
[35:59] that  like  [ __ ]  go  up  her  [ __ ]  and 
 here  she  is  posting  it  from  the  back  her 
 head  you  know  today  I  hit  four  times
[36:04] eight  squats  he's  not  actually  selling 
 Fitness  she's  selling  sex 
 unfollow  unsubscribe  block  delete  this
[36:12] includes  seemingly  like  educational 
 YouTubers  who  aren't  actually  posting
[36:17] like  valuable  content  and  instead 
 they're  just  posting  triggering  content 
 it's  the  red  pill  podcast  it's  the  um
[36:24] Instagram  Pages  you  post  that  you  know 
 they've  got  pictures  of  girls  in  them 
 whatever  it  is  if  there's  things  that 
 trigger  you  just  get  rid  of  it  you  don't
[36:30] need  to  see  this  stuff  in  your 
 day-to-day  life  if  you  respect  yourself 
 you'll  go  and  do  that  right  now  step
[36:35] three  video  games 
 I'm  17  years  old 
 and  I'm  in  a  dark  quiet  room
[36:43] I'm  grunting  I'm  sweating 
 and  I'm  straining  repetitively  I'm  in
[36:49] our  home  gym  in  the  garage  working  out 
 my  brother's  recently  got  me  into
[36:54] weightlifting  it's  like  this  new  thing 
 that  I'm  doing  where  you  lift  these 
 weights  and  you're  trying  to  get  bigger 
 muscles  and  it  seems  like  super  super
[37:00] fun  and  so  I'm  here  and  last  week  I  hit 
 this  weight  so  I'm  gonna  look  around  for
[37:05] the  smallest  little  weight  here  we  go 
 and  I'll  add  that  in  and  instantly  it 
 clicks  into  my  mind  that  this  is  the  way
[37:12] I  progressed  on  RuneScape  on  the  video 
 game  that  I've  been  addicted  to  for  like 
 10  years  but  the  desire  to  make  progress
[37:17] has  always  been  inside  me  but  it's  just 
 been  brainwashed  manipulated  and  stolen
[37:22] by  games  so  that  I  grew  up  leveling  up 
 in  video  games  instead  of  the  real  world
[37:27] so  I  put  the  extra  weight  plate  onto  the 
 dumbbell  put  it  onto  the  other  one  and 
 I'm  doing  bicep  curls  I'm  literally  just
[37:32] thinking 
 where  I  could  have  been  in  life  if  I 
 started  this  mindset  earlier  of  leveling
[37:38] up  in  the  real  world  instead  of  in  the 
 virtual  world  now  there's  something 
 super  interesting  in  that  same  study  the
[37:44] marshmallow  experiment  they  found  that 
 if  they  complemented  or  criticized  the
[37:49] children  for  their  performance  on  their 
 work  or  school  it  changed  how  much  they
[37:55] were  able  to  resist  the  marshmallow  so 
 right  right  here  right  now  what  do  you 
 think  would  happen  if  we  complimented 
 you  like  four-year-old  you  on  his  little
[38:02] school  work  whilst  you  were  trying  to  do 
 the  marshmallow  experiments  you  know 
 you've  got  this  one  marshmallow  but  if 
 you  wait  15  minutes  you  can  have  these
[38:07] two  if  we  made  you  feel  good  and  we 
 complimented  you  you'd  be  much  more
[38:12] likely  to  delay  grassification  but  the 
 little  kids  who  were  criticized  and 
 given  negative  feedback  for  their
[38:17] schoolwork  they  were  far  more  likely  to 
 be  unable  to  resist  than  just  eat  the
[38:23] one  marshmallow  right  now  and  that 
 really  made  me  think  of  the  concept  and 
 you  can  probably  relate  to  this  of  like
[38:28] the  the  somewhat  lonely  and  shy  video 
 gamer  in  high  school  whose  teachers  keep
[38:33] giving  him  like  bad  grades  and  every  now 
 and  then  they  shout  at  him  and  he 
 doesn't  feel  like  good  in  school  he 
 keeps  getting  this  negative  feedback  and
[38:39] so  he  goes  home  and  plays  video  games  of 
 course  he  does  because  with  this  like
[38:44] quite  inhumane  education  system  some 
 kids  don't  perform  well  in  it  I  didn't  I
[38:50] always  got  like  quite  below  average 
 grades  like  D's  and  E's  and  there  was  a
[38:55] couple  of  F's  and  everything  and  my 
 family  are  quite  High  performing  in  this 
 you  know  I'm  Brown  so  my  brother
[39:00] performed  really  well  he  got  A's  and  a 
 Stars  my  sister  to  perform  really  well 
 she  got  AIDS  and  a  starts  and  here's  me
[39:05] like  the  the  dumb  kid  of  the  family 
 underperforming  every  single  day  every
[39:10] single  exam  underperforming  then  my 
 brother  and  my  sister  getting  compared 
 to  them
[39:15] getting  shouted  out  by  my  father  oh  you 
 you  didn't  study  for  this  one  you  didn't 
 revise  for  this  one  teacher's  telling  me
[39:20] you  know  being  angry  at  me  sometimes  I 
 wasn't  able  to  understand  the  test  or 
 the  homework
[39:25] so  imagine  that  in  my  life 
 where  am  I  gonna  go  other  than  the 
 virtual  world  because  in  the  real  world
[39:31] I'm  failing  I  keep  messing  up  people 
 don't  like  me  my  friends  keep  like
[39:36] essentially  bullying  me  girls  don't  like 
 me  teachers  are  shouting  at  me  my  dad's 
 shouting  at  me
[39:41] but  in  the  virtual  world  I'm  a  dragon 
 slayer 
 in  the  virtual  world  I'm  doing  quests
[39:47] and  killing  demons  and  and  Dracula  and 
 vampires  and  I'm  doing  cool  [ __ ]  you
[39:52] know  I'm  quite  a  high  level  in  there 
 because  I've  been  grinding  and  so  when  I 
 do  meet  other  people  in  these  video 
 games  they  actually  respect  me  and  give
[39:58] me  status  and  compliments  me  a  young  man 
 is  just  going  to  go  away  his  status  is 
 higher  he's  just  gonna  go  where  he's
[40:03] complimented  and  where  he  feels  like  a 
 sense  of  social  connection  and 
 Brotherhood  and  when  we  don't  feel  that
[40:08] in  school 
 then  you  are  going  to  go  to  video  games 
 you  are  going  to  form  that  sort  of  peer
[40:14] circle  of  Gamers  can  we  blame  these  like 
 teenagers  who  are  totally  addicted  to 
 video  games  you  know  I  think  we  have
[40:20] like  quite  a  negative  perception  of 
 games  don't  we  when  we  look  back  we  we 
 get  angry  at  how  much  we  played  them  and
[40:25] that  makes  me  quite  offensive  to  Gamers 
 the  way  that  I  talk  about  them  but  I 
 don't  even  mean  to  honestly  like  when  I
[40:31] get  angry  at  like  video  Gamers  it's  more 
 that  I'm  just  talking  about  my  younger 
 self  but  then  when  I  take  a  moment  to
[40:37] reflect  and  take  like  a  deep  breath  I 
 realize  it's  like  should  we  be  angry  at 
 our  younger  selves  who  who  wasted  so
[40:43] much  time  in  the  virtual  world  when  that 
 was  genuinely  where  he  was  accepted  most
[40:48] was  it  the  problem  of  our  younger  selves 
 or  was  it  a  problem  of  like  probably  the
[40:54] education  system  and  maybe  our  parents 
 and  it's  not  good  to  place 
 responsibility  onto  them  but  when  you're 
 a  child  and  you're  10  years  old  it's
[41:00] like  you  know  we're  not  going  to  put 
 that  much  responsibility  on  a  literal 
 child  right  now
[41:05] because  if  school  was  more  engaging  if  I 
 was 
 you  know  more  involved  in  like  sports  or
[41:11] you  know  I  was  asked  and  encouraged  to 
 be  more  into  Sport  and  I  was  trained 
 there
[41:16] then  I'm  sure  I  wouldn't  have  been  as 
 addicted  to  RuneScape  and  Minecraft  and 
 I  played  those  games  for  literally  like
[41:21] 15  years  straight  hours  every  day  over 
 10  000  hours  in  video  games
[41:29] you  know  it's  often  said  that  to  master 
 its  skill  it  takes  10  000  hours  and  all 
 video  Gamers  know  this  it's  like  you've
[41:34] probably  put  in  10  000  or  maybe  more 
 hours  into  video  games 
 you  could  have  mastered  a  skill  and
[41:40] become  like  like  at  a  World  level  for 
 this  one  sport  for  example
[41:46] and  instead  it's  just  spread  amongst  all 
 the  games  that  we  have  on  Steam  so  this
[41:51] effect  that  when  you're  given  negative 
 feedback  it  reduces  your  willpower  your 
 ability  to  delay  gratification  that  is
[41:58] very  bad  for  us  but  we  can  actually 
 reframe  that  because  if  we're  given 
 positive  feedback  if  we're  given
[42:04] compliments  and  we're  made  to  feel  happy 
 then  we  will  get  like  an  improvement  to
[42:09] our  ability  to  be  able  to  delay 
 gratification  and  wait  for  the  second 
 marshmallow  and  to  improve  our  willpower 
 and  so  we  can  take  control  of  this
[42:15] ourselves  we  don't  need  to  wait  for  the 
 teachers  to  compliment  us  we  can  do  that 
 ourselves
[42:20] you  can  do  it  like  when  you've  been 
 hitting  a  workout  you  can  manually  say 
 positive  thoughts  in  your  mind  often  you
[42:26] have  to  manually  forcefully  say  like 
 positive  things  in  your  brain  because
[42:31] they  don't  often  come  up  naturally  so 
 here  you  are  like  you've  just  done  a 
 workout  and  automatically  your  brain  is 
 just  thinking  about  high  schools
[42:36] thinking  about  you  know  irrelevant 
 things  stupid  thoughts  everything  you 
 know  it's  just  whatever  but  you  can  take
[42:41] a  few  seconds  to  think  yes  like  you  can 
 say  the  words  in  your  brain  like 
 forcefully  I've  completed  the  workout  I
[42:46] feel  awesome  I'm  so  proud  of  myself  for 
 completing  the  workout 
 I've  studied  today  for  25  minutes  it's
[42:52] not  that  it's  not  like  as  much  as  you 
 know  other  people  do  but  it's  quite  a 
 high  amount  for  me  so  I'm  proud  of
[42:57] myself  I'm  happy 
 it's  it's of  utmost  importance  that 
 someone
[43:03] honestly  that's  [ __ ]  sad  but  it's  off 
 very  much  importance 
 for  everyone  but  especially  for  children
[43:09] and  teenagers  that  you're  hearing  some 
 of  these  positive  words  and  I'm  so  like
[43:15] I'm  sad  for  you  that  you're  not  hearing 
 that  from  the  people  in  your  life  and
[43:20] you  know  from  school  from  teachers  from 
 parents
[43:26] but  our  sadness  is  not  going  to  help  us 
 here 
 proactiveness  is
[43:31] if  other  people  aren't  implanting  these 
 positive  happy
[43:36] joyful  words  into  your  mind  then  it's 
 your  duty  to  do  it  yourself  if  you  are
[43:41] trying  to  quit  video  games  the  single 
 greatest  piece  of  advice  that  I  can  give 
 you  is  not  just  the  quit  video  games  or
[43:48] rather  to  replace  them  with  a  hobby  or 
 skill  that  has  a  very  similar  feeling  of
[43:53] like  progression  status  Brotherhood 
 leveling  up  and  weightlifting  is
[43:59] absolutely  perfect  for  this  you  go  from 
 grinding  and  leveling  up  inside  of  the
[44:04] virtual  world  and  you're  getting  some 
 level  of  status  for  like  the  high  score 
 that  you're  hitting  and  the  boss  that 
 you've  just  killed  so  getting  into  the
[44:10] gym  and  grinding  and  leveling  up  like 
 the  weight  of  the  big  movements  the
[44:15] bench  press  and  the  squat  and  the 
 deadlift  and  you  get  some  level  of 
 status  there  you  get  some  Brotherhood 
 when  you  work  out  with  guys  understand
[44:20] this  every  single  guide  that  I  have 
 known  who  has  successfully  quit  video
[44:25] games  which  is  hundreds  of  people  that 
 I've  spoke  to  in  this  work  that  I've 
 done 
 every  single  one  of  them  replaced  video
[44:32] games  with  weightlifting  every  time 
 literally  like  it  seems  to  me  that  you
[44:38] can  like  100  guarantee  that  you'll  quit 
 video  games  if  you'd  rather  get  into 
 weightlifting  instead  and  it  seems  to  me
[44:43] that  people  who  try  to  quit  video  games 
 without  specifically  getting  into 
 weightlifting  often  don't  end  up  being
[44:50] successful  they  often  go  back  to  playing 
 video  games  of  course  there's  some 
 people  who  have  quit  playing  games  and 
 you  know  they  ended  up  doing  some  other
[44:55] skill  or  whatever  but  it  seems  to  me 
 that  weightlifting  is  probably  the  best 
 one  on  my  recent  discipline  full  guide  I
[45:01] actually  had  a  whole  section  on  like  how 
 to  start  going  to  the  gym  it's  like  it's 
 it's  in  like  autistic  detail  of  like
[45:07] okay  this  is  how  you  find  a  gym  this  is 
 how  you  sign  up  this  is  the  workout  you 
 should  hit  I  even  made  the  workout
[45:12] routine  and  linked  all  the  videos  that 
 you  need  to  watch  to  begin  so  the 
 discipline  full  guide  will  be  like 
 linked  somewhere  as  a  card  that  you  can
[45:18] go  watch  now  and  just  go  look  out  for 
 the  section  that  says  like  starting  the 
 gym  but  before  you  can  make  progress  in
[45:23] quitting  video  games  and  moving  on  and 
 you  know  leveling  up  in  real  life  we 
 have  to  acknowledge  that  your  social 
 life  will  have  a  huge  influence  here  if
[45:30] you're  friends  with  these  guys  these 
 losers  who  are  stuck  or  who  are  happy  in
[45:35] mediocrity  who  are  happy  to  continue 
 playing  video  games  and  you  stay  friends
[45:40] with  them  you  will  stay  stuck  at  this 
 level  here  you  are  like  a  young  man
[45:45] who's  so  different  from  your  friends  but 
 you  just  haven't  really  shown  it  that 
 much  you  still  keep  for  example
[45:50] pretending  to  be  friends  with  them  you 
 don't  want  to  play  video  games  but  then 
 you  still  join  the  Discord  server  of
[45:56] your  little  gamer  friends  and  you  it's 
 just  kind  of  agitating  to  listen  to 
 people  play  games  whilst  they're  on 
 Discord  you  have  a  voice  chat  and  so  you
[46:02] end  up  joining  and  you  just  like  relapse 
 your  your  non-gaming  streak  and  you  feel 
 pathetic  and  you  know  one  of  the  guys
[46:07] there  isn't  even  nice  he's  actually  a 
 bit  of  an  [ __ ]  and  everything  so  that 
 piece  of  advice  I'd  give  you  is  if  you
[46:13] do  genuinely  want  to  quit  playing  video 
 games 
 you  probably  need  to  stop  being  friends
[46:18] with  the  same  video  Gamers  because 
 you'll  realize  that  a  lot  of  your 
 friendship  just  revolves  around  the
[46:24] video  game  which  you  might  not  think  it 
 does  because  you  might  laugh  about 
 things  you  might  talk  about  other  things 
 and  oh  you  know  new  tape  podcast  guys
[46:30] and  stuff  when  you  stop  playing  video 
 games  you'll  realize  just  how  little  you 
 have  in  common  with  them  and  the  more
[46:35] that  you  attach  yourself  to  the  same 
 people 
 the  less  you're  going  to  be  able  to 
 progress  in  life  because  if  they're  here
[46:42] at  this  level  you're  trying  to  climb  but 
 while  spending  time  talking  and 
 integrating  their  beliefs  their  mindsets
[46:48] their  words  into  your  brain  so  your  own 
 self-improvement  journey  is  just  slower
[46:53] like  you're  literally  delaying  the 
 points  of  which  you're  gonna  meet  like  a 
 beautiful  feminine  wife  because  you're
[46:58] still  friends  with  these  guys  and  that 
 woman's  not  gonna  like  you  feel  like  a 
 [ __ ]  loser  like  this  because  this  is
[47:03] below  you  the  Discord  Friends  the  video 
 games  it  is  below  you  if  you're  watching 
 a  video  like  this  undoubtedly  you  are
[47:09] better  than  that  now  you're  better  than 
 these  modern  addictions  but  too  many 
 young  guys  they  want  to  quit  video  games
[47:14] but  they  don't  quit  that  friendship 
 group  because  it  feels  super  painful  to 
 leave  like  the  Social  Circle  that  we're
[47:19] in  you  must  get  used  to  this  concept  of 
 shedding  layers  of  your  life  that  for
[47:24] example  whilst  you  wear  this  video  gamer 
 all  part  of  your  life  aligned  to  it  you 
 know  the  clothes  you  wore  the  hairstyle
[47:30] you  had  the  friends  you  kept  the  apps 
 that  you  had  on  your  phone  and  on  your 
 computer  when  you're  not  like  this
[47:35] anymore  you  need  to  almost  shed  that 
 identity  that  means  shedding  the  the 
 kinds  of  clothes  that  remind  you  of
[47:41] being  a  video  gamer  that  means  shedding 
 like  the  desktop  wallpaper  that  reminds 
 you  from  it  shedding  the  Discord  server
[47:47] even  the  friends  the  people  who  remind 
 you  of  that  lesser  version  of  you 
 because  you're  no  longer  that  guy  but  if
[47:52] you  don't  actually  make  actions  in  the 
 real  world  then  you  technically  haven't 
 changed  at  all  so  this  seems  scary  but
[47:58] your  actionable  step 
 is  the  construct  a  respectful  message
[48:04] which  you're  going  to  send  over  to  this 
 chart  and  then  you're  going  to  leave 
 straight  after  that
[48:09] this  is  something  I've  helped  quite  a 
 lot  of  young  men  with  and  this  is  the 
 most  effective  way  to  quit  playing  video
[48:16] games  and  say  like  get  away  from  this 
 friendship  group  that  aren't  really 
 doing  much  with  their  lives
[48:21] we've  tried  different  ways  like  I've 
 spoke  to  hundreds  of  guys  speaking  about 
 this  problem  there's  so  many  different
[48:26] ways  you  could  consider  you  can  try  to 
 just  you  know  ghost  them  a  little  bit 
 you  can  try  to  just  be  friendly  and  be 
 on  good  terms  none  of  that  ever  works
[48:34] your  real  like  big  progress  will  come 
 from  you  specifically  creating  like  a
[48:39] full-on  okay  point  I'm  like  leaving  this 
 I'm  no  longer  this  person  anymore  this 
 is  why  I'm  saying  you  construct  a
[48:44] respectful  message  you  don't  blame  them 
 you  don't  say  anything  bad  to  them  if 
 you  really  want  this  full  guide  to  help
[48:49] you  this  is  a  task  that  you  must  get 
 through  right  now  open  up  like  a  word 
 doc  or  maybe  just  open  up  the  exact
[48:54] Discord  server  that  you  usually  go  to  or 
 the  fact  like  you  know  the  WhatsApp 
 group  chat  or  whatever  it  is  that  you
[48:59] use  for  these  friends  and  you  just  can 
 tell  like  they're  not  getting  onto 
 self-improvement  they're  not  interested
[49:05] in  this  they  think  that  going  to  the  gym 
 is  gay  they  just  want  to  keep  playing 
 games 
 you're  going  to  construct  it  just  a  few
[49:11] sentences  just  saying  like  hello 
 everyone  you  know  thank  you  so  much  for 
 like  the  experiences  and  memories  that 
 we've  had  I'm  grateful  to  have  like  you
[49:17] know  experienced  this  all  but  video 
 games  that  just  don't  interest  me 
 anymore  and  I  don't  and  I  want  to  like
[49:22] shed  this  layer  of  my  life  and  move  on 
 to  the  next  part  of  like  my  my  growth  as 
 a  person  and  this  is  nothing  against  you
[49:28] guys  I  really  hope  that  you  keep  having 
 lots  of  fun  take  care  you  send  a  message 
 like  that  where  you  don't  say  anything
[49:33] mean  to  them  but  you  just  kind  of  say 
 like  you  know  I'm  just  kind  of  like 
 shedding  the  layers  of  my  life  or
[49:38] something  like  that  right  and  you  end  up 
 sending  it  and  then  leaving  the  group 
 chat  you  fully  like  leave  the  server  you
[49:44] might  think  wait  this  is  really  scary 
 one  but  you're  already  past  this  you 
 don't  even  play  games  with  them  anymore
[49:49] you  don't  even  enjoy  it  there's  no  value 
 for  you  being  there  it's  just  the  fear 
 of  like  stepping  into  the  unknown  it's
[49:55] the  fear  of  just  going  about  it  yourself 
 but  what  I've  found  is  like  you  almost 
 have  to  go  through  this  transition
[50:00] period  where  you  have  the  bad  friends 
 you  have  this  period  of  loneliness  and 
 then  you  start  making  the  good  friends
[50:05] the  good  friends  aren't  going  to  be 
 attracted  to  you  when  you're  still  the 
 guy  who's  in  the  middle  of  like  a  bad 
 video  gamer  friendship  group  it's  better
[50:11] to  be  by  yourself  than  it  is  with  people 
 who  are  dragging  you  back  and  who  are 
 like  negative  influences  when  you  send
[50:16] this  message  you  probably  will  get  like 
 a  barrage  of  disrespect  they'll  send  you
[50:21] a  bunch  of  messages  they  will  talk  about 
 you  and  chat  [ __ ]  about  you  which  I  know 
 sounds  scary
[50:26] this  will  last  for  about  three  days  the 
 retention  span  isn't  that  powerful
[50:32] after  that  they'll  go  back  to  playing 
 their  games  with  mild  depression  and 
 they'll  stop  thinking  about  you  you'll
[50:38] realize  that  this  strong  friendship  that 
 you  thought  you  had  all  this  time 
 because  you  speak  to  each  other  for
[50:43] three  hours  a  day  you'll  realize  it  100 
 revolved  around  video  games
[50:48] which  you  don't  want  to  play  anymore 
 the  best  friend  like  the  nicest  guy  the
[50:54] most  like  awoke  guy  from  the  group  will 
 probably  send  you  a  private  message  he's
[50:59] the  one  that  you  can  try  and  save  and 
 try  and  get  onto  self-improvement  but  it 
 most  likely  will  be  a  waste  of  your  time
[51:05] the  exact  same  Dynamic  please  trust  me 
 when  I  say  I  have  seen  this  happen  over
[51:11] a  hundred  times 
 the  work  that  I've  done  here  is  over  the 
 last  three  years  this  has  literally  been
[51:16] like  my  full-time  job  is  getting  guys  to 
 like  quit  the  bad  habits  and  stop  the 
 good  ones  trust  me  when  I  say  over  the
[51:21] last  years 
 it's  such  a  wasted  time  trying  to  hold
[51:27] on  to  these  people  who  aren't  even  good 
 for  you 
 there's  better  growth  coming  from  this
[51:33] and  it's  not  terrible  to  be  alone  for 
 some  time  when  you're  trying  to  figure
[51:38] things  out  and  learn  who  you  are  and 
 you're  navigating  self-improvement  even 
 more  there's  two  paths  that  you  can  take
[51:43] here  if  you  do  want  to  join  my  online 
 community  I  have  a  paid  school  called 
 Adonis  school  where  we've  got  like  the
[51:48] whole  Community  then  we've  got  teachers 
 we  teach  yourself  Improvement  tactics  we 
 teach  you  like  business  models  I  think
[51:54] it's  an  awesome  place  to  be  and  you  can 
 consider  joining  that  that's  the  top 
 Link  in  the  description  but  you  can  also
[51:59] just  join  communities  and  make  friends 
 without  needing  to  pay  for  anything  they 
 can  go  to  the  gym  and  make  a  workout
[52:04] friend  there  like  make  like  a  workout 
 partner  and  you  can  even  go  and  find 
 free  communities  online  it's  far  better
[52:09] for  you  to  be  in  the  middle  of  other 
 guys  who  are  on  self-improvement  who  are 
 going  to  the  gym  who've  got  values  just
[52:15] like  you  do  than  it  is  to  be  around 
 people  who  like  you  don't  even  respect 
 anymore  step  four  sugar
[52:22] I'm  in  the  car  with  my  girlfriend  and 
 we're  in  the  Scotland  Highlands  right  at
[52:27] the  top  of  the  UK  we're  here  on  a  road 
 trip  we've  been  driving  around  having  a 
 great  time  sleeping  in  the  car  going
[52:33] from  Cafe  to  Cafe  enjoying  all  these 
 like  treats  and  coffees  and  we're  sat
[52:38] here  right  now 
 I've  got  a  cookie  I've  got  a  cake  and 
 we've  got  coffee  next  to  us
[52:45] but  it  doesn't  feel  quite  right  on  our 
 last  trip  here  we  were  so  loving  and  we 
 stumbled  upon  these  beautiful  family  ran
[52:52] cafes  where  we  enjoyed  some  of  the 
 treats  that  were  made  by  like  the 
 authentic  60  year  old  grandmas  this  time
[52:57] I  was  autistically  mapping  out  our 
 itinerary  to  make  sure  we  could  hit  all 
 these  cafes  again  and  it  was  like  I
[53:03] became 
 a  sugar  fiend 
 like  a  crackhead
[53:08] and  we're  sat  here  when  I've  got  a 
 hundred  grams  of  sugar  between  my  legs
[53:13] the  cookie  and  the  cake  and  like  the 
 cake  that  we've  traveled  300  miles  for
[53:19] and  she  actually  says  it  to  me 
 I  don't  think  you're  as  loving  as  you
[53:25] were  last  time  we  were  here 
 and  that  hits  me  because  you  know  I've
[53:30] been  reading  the  web  the  superior  man 
 and  I've  been  leveling  up  my  my  skill  of 
 relationships  of  love
[53:36] has  my  own  woman  telling  me  that 
 not  only  have  I  been  less  loving  on  this
[53:41] trip  or  rather  she  has  seen  this  weird 
 addictive  side  to  me  where  I've  been  so 
 obsessed  of  making  sure  that  we  hit
[53:46] every  Cafe  that  I  had  plotted  out  on 
 Google  Maps
[53:51] and  it  hits  me  but  we  are  hundreds  of 
 miles  away  from  home
[53:56] the  reason  why  I  was  super  Keen  for  this 
 trip 
 wasn't  to  spend  loving  time  with  her
[54:05] it  was  for  sugar 
 I  realized  even  here  right  now  today  the
[54:10] sugar  has  a  huge  hook  on  me  a  hook  to 
 the  level  that  it  will  make  me  travel
[54:16] the  entire  country  hundreds  of  miles  to
[54:21] just  go  get  some  cake  and  you  know  this 
 yourself  whether  it's  with  sugar  or 
 other  kinds  of  junk  food  the  food  that
[54:27] we  have  in  this  modern  day  is  so 
 addictive  low  quality  lacking  in 
 nutrition  and  here  we  are  just  eating  it
[54:33] as  if  it's  completely  normal  and  if  you 
 don't  have  a  problem  with  the  things 
 that  you  eat  then  maybe  it's  someone
[54:38] that  you  know  what  there's  a  lot  of 
 people  you  know  which  have  literally  got 
 health  problems  inside  of  them  there's
[54:44] genuine  the  cancer  and  diabetes  forming 
 right  now  and  yet  we're  still  having  100
[54:49] grams  of  sugar  every  single  day  without 
 realizing  if  you  can  relate  to  this  I 
 just  want  to  twist  the  knife  on  your
[54:54] pain  a  little  bit  are  we  really  men  of 
 character  and  strength  if  there's 
 substances  that  we're  consuming  every
[55:00] day  that  actually  have  such  a  hook  on  us 
 from  what  you  know  about  me  you  probably 
 think  that  I'm  quite  like  a  disciplined
[55:06] regimented  guy  who  likes  being  on  his 
 routine  and  working  hard  and  everything 
 but  here  I  was  on  this  trip  genuinely
[55:12] having  drove 
 10  hours  straight 
 to  go  to  a  particular  Cafe  because  I
[55:19] just  wanted  the  cake  from  the 
 that  kind  of  sounds  like  a  cute  like  lit 
 bonding  moment  with  your  girl  but
[55:24] genuinely  I'm  telling  you  it  was  not  for 
 love  it  was  for  sugar
[55:29] so  I  have  the  humility  to  admit  the 
 sugar  is  very  addictive  for  me  even 
 though  I  don't  have  that  much  of  my
[55:34] day-to-day  diet  and  so  this  is  exactly 
 what  you  do  to  overcome  the  pull  that
[55:39] sugar  and  junk  food  has  on  you  in  that 
 same  marshmallow  experiment  they  found 
 that  when  they  cued  the  children  to  feel
[55:46] negative  and  to  feel  unhappy  they  were 
 far  less  likely  to  delay  gratification 
 so  if  you're  sad  you'll  have  less
[55:53] willpower  if  you're  happy  you  have  more 
 willpower  and  you  can  almost  imagine 
 like  the  middle  aged  women  who  struggle
[56:00] with  their  diets  and  you  always  hear  of 
 this  of  like  guilty  upset  depressive
[56:05] eating  when  someone  is  sad  they  always 
 are  more  likely  to  cheat  on  their  diets 
 and  the  same  thing  for  us  with  not  just
[56:11] diets  but  let's  say  porn  and  video  games 
 I  think  that  when  we've  done  these  bad 
 habits  our  emotions  have  played  a  huge
[56:17] part  in  that  we  often  will  eat  the  sugar 
 or  we'll  watch  the  porn  not  when  we're 
 hungry  or  when  we're  feeling  horny  but
[56:25] rather  when  we're  just  bored  sad  and 
 lonely  what's  super  interesting  is  that 
 when  when  those  researchers  cued  these
[56:31] children  to  feel  sad  or  to  feel  happy  to 
 see  what  the  effective  emotion  was  on 
 their  ability  to  delay  gratification
[56:37] guess  how  they  did  it 
 it  was  as  simple  as  just  telling  the
[56:42] children  to  remember  a  specific  type  of 
 memory  so  when  they  wanted  to  see  the 
 effect  of  like  being  sad  on  your  ability
[56:48] to  have  willpower  they  literally  just 
 said  to  the  children  like  a  standardized 
 sentence  that  they  said  to  each  of  them 
 think  of  something  sad  like  when  you're
[56:55] crying  but  there's  no  one  there  to  help 
 you  that  was  the  one  cue  that  they  gave 
 that  literally  put  the  children  in  a  sad
[57:02] mood  I  keep  saying  this  in  every  video 
 that  I  record  you  can  control  which
[57:07] emotions  that  you  feel  you  do  it  by 
 manually  putting  a  thought  inside  of 
 your  mind  manually  thinking  of  a  memory
[57:13] that  makes  you  feel  sad  manually 
 thinking  of  something  that  makes  you 
 feel  anxious  now  most  of  the  time  these
[57:18] emotions  and  thoughts  and  memories  come 
 about  automatically  in  our  brain  don't 
 they  it's  like  you  know  you're  just
[57:23] going  through  life  you're  just  whatever 
 you're  doing  whatever  you're  supposed  to 
 be  doing  and  suddenly  there's  a  thought 
 of  anxiousness  suddenly  there's  a
[57:28] thought  of  sadness  that  happens  but  we 
 need  to  be  manually  implanting  positive
[57:33] thoughts  recalling  happy  memories  like 
 manually  forcefully  into  our  brain 
 because  when  they  did  that  and  the
[57:38] researchers  asked  children  think  of 
 something  that  makes  you  happy  like  when 
 your  mommy  pushes  you  really  high  on  the
[57:43] swing  you  know  like  the  little  swing 
 thing  like  a  children's  playground  this 
 was  their  standardized  sentence  and  it
[57:49] literally  worked  to  make  the  children 
 happy  which  then  meant  that  they  delayed 
 gratification  more
[57:54] so  why  don't  we  just  start  doing  this 
 just  through  the  day  just  recall  to 
 things  that  make  you  happy  more  quite
[57:59] frankly  there's  a  lot  of  like  weak  and 
 hateful  people  in  this  modern  world
[58:04] usually  the  weaker  people  are  more 
 hateful  and  so  when  they  see  you  being 
 quite  happy  and  when  they  see  us
[58:09] discussing  something  like  this  they'll 
 for  some  reason  think  that  this  is  this 
 is  evil  like  you  can  imagine  the  kind  of
[58:15] person  I'm  thinking  about  there's  people 
 who  if  they  found  out  that  we  were 
 manually  implanting  positive  thoughts
[58:20] and  memories  in  our  brain  they  would  say 
 that  this  is  like  a  bad  practice  they 
 would  almost  like  they're  there  in
[58:25] depression  like  wanting  you  to  feel 
 depressed  but  we've  all  like  we've 
 experienced  what  it's  like  to  feel
[58:30] depressed  and  it's  [ __ ]  awful  so  why 
 would  we  stay  like  that 
 it  sounds
[58:35] so  inconsiderate  like  insensitive 
 but  really  the  cure  to  like  your
[58:41] emotional  problems  is  like  just  think  of 
 something  pleasant  it's  pretty  much  as
[58:46] simple  as  that 
 just  think  of  something  pleasant  right 
 here  right  now  is  like  a  mini  actionable
[58:52] step 
 think  of  a  happy  memory  that  you've  got 
 one  that  you  couldn't  stop  laughing  like 
 when  was  the  time  where  you  can  remember
[58:58] were  you  like  fully  laughed  a  lot 
 play  that  memory  into  your  mind
[59:04] hmm 
 you  can't  help  but  to  feel  more  pleasant
[59:09] when  that  happens  and  when  you  have  that 
 Pleasant  feeling  you're  gonna  wait  out 
 for  the  second  marshmallow  well  now  what
[59:14] do  you  think  would  happen  when  they  kept 
 on  reminding  the  kids  who  were  trying  to 
 delay  gratification  of  what  the  reward
[59:20] would  be  if  they  waited  remember  they 
 get  two  marshmallows  if  they  wait  but
[59:25] only  one  if  they  eat  it  right  now  when 
 the  researchers  kept  on  reminding  the 
 children  that  they'd  get  essentially
[59:30] double  the  reward  they  were  more  likely 
 to  delay  gratification  because  they  kept 
 the  dream  results  in  their  mind  and  that
[59:36] reminds  me  of  what  you  can  probably 
 imagine  like  a  bunch  of  businessmen  do 
 they  write  their  goals  every  morning
[59:41] they're  keeping  the  dream  result  in  mind 
 and  do  you  do  this  why  not  think  to 
 yourself  every  single  day  what  the  dream
[59:47] result  that  you're  waiting  out  for  is 
 there's  a  random  girl  like  giving  you 
 flirtatious  eyes  and  she's  speaking  to
[59:53] you  maybe  she's  approached  you  but  you 
 don't  want  to  cheat  on  your  woman 
 why  don't  you  just  think  of  like  the
[59:59] dream  results  with  your  woman 
 happy  long-term  relationship  the
[60:04] children  the  beautiful  loving  safe 
 household 
 because  one  of  mine  is  tempted  if  that's
[60:10] the  things  that  he's  thinking  of  but 
 then  he's  not  going  to  cheat  on  the 
 other  side  the  man  who  gets  tempted  and
[60:15] he  thinks  about  the  pleasure  that  he 
 could  go  and  gain  right  now  and  he 
 almost  tries  purposely  not  to  think 
 about  his  family  he's  the  one  who  breaks
[60:21] his  commitments  remind  yourself  of  what 
 the  dream  results  you  want  is  this  works
[60:26] super  super  well  for  this  step  right 
 here  with  sugar  with  your  diet  with  your 
 physique  put  a  picture  of  your  dream
[60:31] physique  on  your  phone  lock  screen  go 
 take  like  the  best  picture  you've  taken
[60:36] so  far  in  the  gym  and  put  it  as  your 
 phone  lock  screen  and  if  you  get  tempted 
 by  sugar  and  by  diet  just  look  at  that
[60:42] picture  look  at  that  picture  and  feel 
 proud  of  yourself  and  think  to  yourself 
 like  you  know  this  is  what  I'm  working 
 so  hard  for  I  like  looking  good  I  like
[60:49] feeling  strong  I've  built  this  myself 
 and  so  when  you  get  tempted  and  you  look 
 at  a  picture  like  that  you  remind
[60:54] yourself  this  is  what  you're  doing  it 
 for  there's  two  books  that  I  read  for 
 this  full  guide  one  is  the  marshmallow
[60:59] test  by  Walter  Miss  Chell  and  this  is 
 the  one  you  know  talking  about  the 
 marshmallows  and  the  children  but  the
[61:05] other  book  I  read  which  is  super 
 interesting  is  called  discipline  is 
 Destiny  by  Ryan  holiday  I  read  that  book
[61:10] for  the  discipline  full  guide  that's  on 
 my  channel  but  a  lot  of  it  was  about 
 willpower  resisting  desires  and  there
[61:15] was  a  quote  which  I  want  to  read  you  out 
 and  I  just  as  I  read  it  to  you  maybe 
 just  visualize  what  I'm  saying  remember
[61:21] to  conduct  yourself  in  life  as  if  at  a 
 banquet  as  something  being  passed  around
[61:26] comes  to  you  reach  your  hand  and  take  a 
 moderate  helping 
 does  it  pass  by  you  don't  stop  it  it
[61:34] hasn't  come  yet  don't  burn  in  desire  for 
 it  but  wait  until  it  arrives  in  front  of 
 you  act  this  way  with  children  espoused
[61:41] towards  position  with  wealth  one  day  it 
 will  make  you  worthy  of  a  Bankai  with 
 the  Gods
[61:46] if  you  imagine  yourself  in  that 
 situation  you're  in  this  restaurant  and 
 they're  bringing  delicious  food  over 
 most  people  will  have  such  intense
[61:52] desires  or  like  this  uncontrollable  urge 
 to  Feast  right  now  you  know  they  can 
 smell  the  nice  tasty  like  like  trans
[61:58] fats  coming  into  the  air  and  they'll 
 really  want  a  lot  you  can  imagine  a  fat 
 relative  of  yours  who  would  take  like
[62:03] big  servings  stick  it  onto  his  plate  and 
 some  of  your  other  fat  relatives  will 
 almost  compliment  him  on  that  and  say
[62:09] like  wow  you  know  you're  eating  so  much 
 oh  but  imagine  yourself  this  stoic 
 unperturbed  by  the  addictions  of  food
[62:16] still  enjoying  it  but  within  moderation 
 of  mastering  the  desire  inside  of  you
[62:21] for  this  addictive  food  and  it's  very 
 hard  to  have  the  thing  that  you  might  be 
 addicted  to  the  sugar  the  junk  food
[62:28] right  in  front  of  you  but  to  be  able  to 
 act  with  character  at  the  same  time
[62:33] that's  why  I'm  inviting  you  to  do  a 
 practice  which  is  what  I  call  willpower 
 training  I  did  this  for  a  year  straight
[62:40] every  single  day  and  it  changed  my  life 
 it  will  change  yours  and  it's  super 
 simple  go  out  to  a  store  as  soon  as  you
[62:45] can  and  go  and  buy  your  all-time 
 favorite  treat  maybe  it's  a  chocolate 
 bar  maybe  it's  Chris  maybe  whatever  it
[62:51] is  like  the  thing  that  is  unhealthy  but 
 you've  always  like  really  really  liked 
 for  me  it's  like  chocolate  bars  and
[62:56] there's  one  in  specific  called  Kinder 
 hippos  like  absolutely  delicious 
 chocolate  bar  and  there's  also  um  Lindor
[63:03] chocolate  like  people  in  the  UK  will 
 know  what  I'm  talking  about  okay  you  go 
 out  and  you  go  buy  one  of  those  like  one 
 chocolate  bar  right  put  it  on  your  desk
[63:10] put  it  in  front  of  you 
 stare  at  it  like  a  psychopath
[63:17] feel  the  emotions  that  arises  the  copes 
 that  start  in  your  brain  thinking  like 
 yeah  you  know  this  is  kind  of  weird  I
[63:22] may  as  well  just  eat  it  otherwise  you 
 know  it'll  be  wasted  like  you  know 
 because  someone  else  might  eat  it  so 
 yeah  I  may  as  well  just  eat  it  now
[63:27] because  I'm  just  being  weird  with  that 
 thing 
 stare  at  it  and  just  analyze  the 
 thoughts  and  feelings  that  happen  get  a
[63:34] journal  out  and  ask  yourself 
 why  does  this  have  power  over  me 
 I  know  that  it's  not  good  why  do  I  feel
[63:41] an  urge  to  indulge  in  it  right  now 
 this  will  drain  your  willpower  but  this
[63:47] is  how  you  level  will  power  up 
 it's  when  you  use  your  willpower  like  a 
 muscle  and  then  it  gets  strengthened
[63:53] overnight  you  do  this  as  like  a  specific 
 practice  you  just  go  and  get  the 
 all-time  favorite  snack  put  it  in  front
[63:59] of  you 
 the  reason  why  I  suggest  this  is  because 
 I've  heard  in  the  self-improvement  space
[64:05] online  of  everyone  just  saying  like  oh 
 hey  just  throw  away  the  junk  food  and 
 don't  buy  it  at  the  store
[64:10] so  that  you  know  your  environment  is 
 clean  that's  actually  pretty  good  advice 
 but  it's  not  good  enough  you  know  why
[64:16] I  want  you  to  imagine  like  there's  some 
 fat  woman  who's  got  problems  with  with 
 dieting  and  she's  got  a  bunch  of  snacks
[64:22] in  the  kitchen  and  she  hears  this 
 self-improvement  you  know  this  lay  Mass 
 like  average  advice  like  yeah  just  throw
[64:27] it  away  and  just  don't  buy  it  at  the 
 store  anymore  this  is  what  most  people 
 do  this  is  probably  what  you've  thought 
 is  the  right  answer  it's  not  because
[64:32] what's  going  to  happen  sir  she's  gonna 
 throw  it  all  away  feel  kind  of  proud  of 
 herself
[64:38] and  then  she's  going  to  go  to  work  and 
 her  co-worker  is  going  to  offer  it  to 
 her  and  then  there's  the  birthday  party
[64:43] coming  up  and  someone's  gonna  offer  it 
 there  with  how  prevalent  sugar  and 
 unhealthy  food  is  and  just  addictions
[64:49] and  Drugs  in  general  you're  never  safe 
 just  by  changing  the  environment  we 
 should  absolutely  set  up  our  environment
[64:55] for  Success  you  don't  want  to  like  you 
 know  just  have  porn  open  24  7  on  your 
 computer  or  something  but  at  the  same
[65:00] time  you  want  to  develop  like  the  mental 
 strength  The  Willpower  so  that  if  porn 
 was  blasted  right  in  front  of  you  you'd
[65:05] be  okay  so  that  if  someone  pulls  out  the 
 ultimate  chocolate  bar  that  you've 
 always  loved  your  entire  life  you'd  be
[65:11] okay  saying  no  because  you've  been 
 training  for  this  very  moment  throwing 
 it  out  is  like  level  one  like  you've
[65:17] made  some  progress  throwing  it  out  but 
 then  specifically  getting  the  like  the 
 hardest  thing  for  you  to  use  your
[65:22] willpower  again  and  dangling  that  in 
 front  of  you  like  a  psychopath  and 
 staring  at  it  with  your  squinted  eyes
[65:28] and  thinking  why  do  you  have  control 
 over  me 
 that  will  make  you  realize  things  that
[65:34] you've  never  known  about  yourself  if  you 
 feel  like  you  have  absolutely  no 
 self-control  at  all  then  maybe  skip  this
[65:40] step  because  it's  quite  Advanced  but 
 will  power  training  will  work  for  you  if 
 you  can  kind  of  imagine  yourself  that  if 
 you've  got  this  sort  of  chocolate  bar
[65:46] you  would  be  able  to  somewhat  resist  you 
 might  even  cope  and  just  eat  it  and  say 
 like  oh  well  you  know  the  experiment  is
[65:51] done  like  you  know  there's  willpower 
 training  was  kind  of  stupid  so  I'm  just 
 gonna  eat  it  because  otherwise  it'd  be  a 
 waste  even  if  you  coped  you'd  benefit
[65:56] because  straight  after  that  you'd  feel 
 guilty  as  [ __ ]  realize  how  much  extra 
 power  it  had  over  you  I  had  my  favorite
[66:02] chocolate  bar  on  my  desk 
 for  an  entire  year 
 you  know  after  a  few  days  you  lose  the
[66:09] desire  for  it  because  it  these  things 
 are  very  unnatural  you  know  how  does 
 this  piece  of  food  just  last  there  just
[66:16] there  on  your  desk  it  makes  you  realize 
 this  it's  not  even  real  food
[66:21] it's  just  like  this  weird  chemical 
 substance  that  some  scientists  and 
 entrepreneurs  have  put  together  to
[66:27] addict  you 
 so  when  I've  got  my  favorite  chocolate 
 bar  on  top  of  my  desk  and  I  haven't
[66:33] touched  it  for  months 
 when  it's  time  for  someone's  birthday 
 and  I  can  see  that  they've  got  a  kind  of
[66:38] a  mediocre  shitty  cake 
 I'm  not  gonna  have  any 
 when  I  go  out  to  a  restaurant  I'm  not
[66:45] gonna  have  the  dessert  menu  because  I've 
 already  had  the  perfect  thing  in  front 
 of  me  I've  been  training  my  willpower  so
[66:50] that  when  the  addiction  is  in  front  of 
 me  I  can  resist  it  do  that  while  still 
 setting  up  your  environment  for  Success
[66:56] you  still  for  example  don't  want  to  be 
 using  your  phone  or  your  computer  for 
 work  and  stumble  upon  something  that's 
 going  to  trigger  you  into  relapsing  in
[67:02] your  nofap  streak  so  you  want  to  set  up 
 that  you  still  for  example  want  to  go 
 through  the  kitchen  and  make  your  food
[67:07] without  seeing  something  that  you  might 
 quickly  grab  it  and  eat  but  some 
 specific  time  for  willpower  training  can
[67:13] be  very  beneficial  that's  your 
 actionable  step  go  and  get  the  thing 
 that  you  feel  addicted  to  it  can  be 
 sugar  it  can  be  junk  food  it  can  be  for
[67:19] any  of  the  other  like  addictions  that  we 
 spoke  about  and  just  put  it  in  front  of
[67:24] you  and  journal  about  what  you  feel 
 and  be  pissed  off  step  five  find  your
[67:31] hot  triggers  now  think  about  how  crazy 
 it  is  to  think  of  a  World  level  athlete
[67:36] or  a  president 
 extremely  disciplined  committed  men  who
[67:41] will  eventually  go  on  and  cheat  on  their 
 wives  I've  experienced  this  firsthand 
 myself  for  the  last  three  years  I've
[67:47] lived  in  this  house  with  my  family  I've 
 been  super  disciplined  I  wake  up  every 
 day  5  a.m  cold  showers  you  know  I  do
[67:53] like  the  discipline  stuff  and  yet  I've 
 traveled  to  Thailand  twice  in  the  last
[67:58] few  years  along  with  some  other 
 countries 
 and  it's  so  interesting  of  what  happens
[68:03] to  my  discipline  when  I  go  somewhere 
 else 
 I  turn  into  a  degenerate
[68:09] here  I'm  super  productive  my  diet  is  is 
 like  on  point  I'm  training  hard  every
[68:15] day  I'm  working  super  super  hard  I  go  to 
 Thailand  and  I'm  literally  edging  my 
 dick  whilst  High  whilst  like  message
[68:21] like  barrage  messaging  girls  on  on 
 Tinder  or  Instagram  I  go  to  Mexico  and
[68:27] I'm  literally  caught  having  public  sex 
 why  is  it  that  you  can  show  like  a 
 spectrum  of  character  traits  you  would
[68:32] assume  that  someone  who  is  disciplined 
 is  disciplined
[68:37] but  not  exactly  someone  who's  discipline 
 is  not  always  disciplined  rather  he  is
[68:42] disciplined  when  the  context  is  the  same 
 and  so  if  he  keeps  the  context  the
[68:48] environment  the  same  then  he  stays 
 disciplined  and  he  seems  like  an 
 all-round  discipline  in  person
[68:54] put  that  same  discipline  guy  let's  say 
 this  world  level  athlete 
 and  put  his  type  of  woman  in  front  of
[69:01] him 
 like  some  curvy  light-skinned  woman 
 that's  you  know  his  his  exact  type
[69:06] and  suddenly  he's  not  disciplined  and 
 he's  cheating  on  his  wife
[69:12] so  this  is  called  your  hot  trigger  and 
 this  is  something  you'll  really  want  to 
 do  alongside  me  right  now
[69:18] be  honest  with  yourself  and  start  to 
 think  what  your  hot  trigger  could  be
[69:23] what  is  the  thing  that  triggers  you  to 
 behave  in  a  way  that  you  wouldn't  like
[69:28] for  a  lot  of  guys  it  might  be  like  a 
 sexually  attractive  woman  who's 
 specifically  showing  some  interest  in
[69:33] you  most  married  men  may  feel  kind  of 
 like  committed  to  their  wives  and 
 they've  been  good  boys  but  it's  just
[69:38] because  that  situation  hasn't  arose  but 
 once  that  situation  does  arise  in  their 
 10  20  30  year  marriage  when  the  other
[69:45] guys  working  at  some  convention  or 
 something  and  that's  when  some  like 
 random  woman  that  he  works  with  starts
[69:50] like  speaking  to  him  flirting  and  he 
 ends  up  cheating  it  was  never  that  he 
 was  like  this  totally  committed  guy  all
[69:55] this  time  it  was  like  he  always  had  this 
 hot  trigger  that  was  just  not  in  front 
 of  him  likewise  for  you  you  might  be
[70:00] quite  a  disciplined  guy  and  yet  when  you 
 get  triggered  to  for  example  get  into 
 that  like  incessant  urge  to  fap  because
[70:07] you've  been  on  social  media  and  you've 
 seen  some  like  gym  girl  who  posts  a 
 picture  of  her  ass  then  you're  not  as
[70:12] disciplined  anymore 
 what  is  the  equivalent  of  of  going  to
[70:17] Thailand  for  you 
 for  me  my  hot  triggers  and  I'm  just
[70:23] going  to  be  totally  honest  and  vulgar 
 if  I  smoke  weed 
 I  turn  into  a  degenerate  I  get  horny  as
[70:30] [ __ ]  and  I'm  literally  like  I  get 
 obsessed  with  having  sex
[70:36] if  I  go  and  move  to  a  different  place  if 
 I  go  travel  and  specifically  if  I'm  away
[70:41] from  like  either  family  or  or  people  who 
 ground  me  even  when  I've  moved  with  like
[70:47] with  good  friends  I've  still  turned  into 
 like  a  degenerate 
 being  with  my  family  seems  to  keep  me
[70:53] quite  stable 
 which  of  course  is  like  it's  common 
 sense  that's  what  family's  supposed  to 
 do  and  these  days  we  don't  even  value
[70:58] family  anymore  this  part  of  this  guide 
 might  literally  save  you  from  making  the 
 biggest  mistakes  of  your  entire  life
[71:05] what  could  be  your  hot  triggers  what  are 
 the  negative  if  then  situations  if  x
[71:13] then  y  if  I  smoke  weed  then  I  turn  into 
 a  degenerate
[71:18] if  a  girl  approaches  me  I  might  end  up 
 cheating  on  my  girlfriend  be  honest  with
[71:23] yourself  in  this  practice  and  this 
 actually  reminds  me  of  something  that  Dr 
 Andrew  huberman  talks  about  on  his
[71:28] podcast  where  he  spoke  about  failure 
 forecasting  the  idea  is  that  we  should
[71:33] take  some  dedicated  time  every  now  and 
 then  to  think  about  the  ways  that  we 
 could  actually  fail  the  obstacles  that
[71:39] could  arise  so  that  we  can  plan  to 
 overcome  them  we  don't  want  to  live  in 
 this  way  we  don't  want  to  you  know  24  7
[71:44] be  thinking  about  the  ways  we  could  mess 
 up  the  failures  and  you  know  feeling 
 quite  negative  and  reserved  but  rather
[71:49] just  for  like  some  dedicated  time  maybe 
 once  a  month  once  every  few  months  you'd 
 want  to  just  project  forward  and  think
[71:55] okay  what  could  be  the  mistakes  and 
 failures  that  I  could  make  soon  if 
 you've  got  a  girl  that  you  really  love
[72:00] and  you  really  want  this  relationship  to 
 be  a  success  you  should  be  asking 
 yourself  this  question  like  what  kind  of
[72:05] situation  might  I  cheat  in 
 maybe  if  I  take  drugs  maybe  if  I  drink
[72:11] alcohol  maybe  if  a  girl  really  really 
 you  know  approaches  me  and  she's  like
[72:16] being  very  straightforward 
 maybe  if  I  get  a  DM  from  a  girl  on 
 Instagram  maybe  if  I'm  on  Instagram  or
[72:22] whatever  app  and  like  an  awesome  girl 
 has  liked  my  picture  when  you're  honest 
 with  yourself  you  know  the  tendencies
[72:27] that  you  have  you  know  the  situations 
 where  you  might  actually  sway 
 and  most  people  will  never  do  this  most
[72:35] people  will  never  have  the  honesty  to 
 admit  this  to  themselves  this  is  what's 
 going  to  set  you  apart  from  the  Lesser
[72:40] version  of  yourself  who  doesn't  want  to 
 have  the  honesty  or  humility  to  admit 
 this  once  you're  becoming  aware  of  your
[72:46] if  then  situations  if  this  happens  then 
 I  might  act  like  that  whether  it's  for
[72:51] positive  things  or  negative  things  it's 
 time  to  start  really  thinking  deeply 
 about  the  kind  of  environments  you  might
[72:57] want  to  set  up  for  yourself  you  want  to 
 set  up  an  environment  a  place  to  live 
 situations  to  get  into  context  to  be  in
[73:04] which  are  going  to  support  your  goals 
 they're  going  to  support  the  the 
 character  traits  that  you  want  so  for
[73:09] example  for  a  long  time  since  around 
 2019  I  wanted  to  be  a  digital  Nomad 
 that's  where  you  work  online  you  make
[73:15] money  online  and  you  just  take  your 
 laptop  and  you  can  work  from  any 
 different  country  I  wanted  to  do  that 
 for  so  long  covet  happened  I'm  waiting
[73:22] I'm  waiting  I'm  waiting  waiting  making 
 money  online  it  gets  to  2022  and  I'm
[73:27] ready  to  actually  fly  out  to  Thailand 
 and  live  out  the  stream  I'm  gonna  live 
 there  for  literally  like  months  or  even 
 years  and  not  even  come  back  to  the  UK
[73:34] and  after  literally  just  a  few  days 
 it  was  so  clear  that  like  that  wasn't
[73:40] the  place  to  be  but  there  was  this  huge 
 goal  that  I  had  been  working  on  to  be 
 there  for  so  long  that  you  know  I  stayed
[73:45] there  for  a  little  bit  longer  then  we're 
 one  month  in  and  I'm  really  turning  into 
 a  degenerate  I'm  smoking  a  lot  of  weed
[73:50] this  was  like  a  solid  you  know  year  of 
 year  and  whatever  ago 
 and  it  was  so  strange  to  be  in  this
[73:56] situation  because  just  a  month  before 
 that  when  I  was  at  home  I  was  waking  up 
 at  4am  going  to  the  gym  and  so  I  started
[74:01] to  doubt  myself  thinking  wait  am  I  still 
 a  Jeffrey  am  I  still  like  you  know  I 
 must  still  not  be  disciplined  at  all  it
[74:06] was  so  strange  to  literally  see  myself 
 like  beginning  to  like  [ __ ]  not  fap
[74:11] fap  but  like  Edge  and  cope  and  say  that 
 it  was  for  a  testosterone  boost  that's 
 how  I  that  was  my  morning  routine  I  used
[74:17] to  wake  up  and  literally  look  at  girls 
 on  Instagram  and  say  that  it  was  for 
 like  a  testosterone  boost  and  then  me
[74:22] and  my  friend  would  drive  to  the  gym 
 whilst  listening  to  like  [ __ ]  porn 
 audio  saying  that  it  was  a  testosterone
[74:28] boost  and  it's  not  like  don't  [ __ ]  do 
 that  because  it's  a  stupid  idea  and  it 
 literally  ruins  your  workouts  but  like
[74:34] just 
 I  think  about  that  and  I'm  like  what  the 
 [ __ ]  was  I  doing  that  like  doesn't  even
[74:40] sound  like  me  at  all  but  when  your 
 environment  changes  so  much  then  you 
 can't  expect  your  behavior  not  to  so
[74:47] what  happened  around  that  time 
 my  channel  literally  started  to  die  off 
 like  it  was  the  first  month  of  my
[74:53] Channel's  history  that  it  actually  went 
 down  because  I  was  so  distracted  because
[74:58] you  know  my  brain  was  just  going 
 elsewhere 
 and  I  let  that  happen  for  about  a  month 
 one  month  and  a  half  and  then  I  just  got
[75:04] so  frustrated  thinking  like  I'm  not  even 
 happy  here  I'm  not  even  making  progress 
 to  the  goals  that  I  care  about  I'm
[75:10] wasting  my  time 
 I  don't  care  about  like  this  digital 
 Nomad  feeling  of  you  know  working  in  the
[75:16] cafes  and  stuff  and  so  I  left  the  trip 
 early  moved  back  home  and  got  straight 
 onto  like  a  great  grind
[75:23] luckily  the  day  before  I  left 
 I  ended  up  meeting  my  girlfriend  there
[75:30] in  Thailand 
 so  that  was  like  at  least  a  happy  moment 
 with  that
[75:35] but  then  we  went  to  Thailand  together 
 just  in  um  in  January  of  this  year
[75:42] and  I  went  again  not  really  for  the 
 digital  Nomad  lifestyle  but  more  for 
 this
[75:47] um 
 why  did  I  even  go  I  went  with  this  like
[75:53] goal  of  becoming  like  a  martial  artist 
 and  I'm  gonna  go  train  there  but  Muay 
 Thai  and  everything  and  um  I  realized
[75:59] that  that  wasn't  actually  for  me  that  I 
 was  pretty  much  just  pursuing  this  goal 
 of  becoming  a  fighter  just  because  it
[76:05] would  look  cool  online  and  that  I  didn't 
 actually  give  a  [ __ ]  about  that  like  you 
 know  it's  kind  of  nice  to  try  and  show
[76:10] so  we  went  together  and  I  literally  just 
 wasted  another  two  months  of  my  life 
 it's  been  a  six  months  of  my  entire  life
[76:16] has  been  wasted  because  I  was  following 
 like  a  goal  that  randomly  popped  into  my
[76:21] mind  which  you  know  seemed  kind  of  cool 
 like  yeah  go  to  Thailand  go  to  like  a 
 different  country  and  stuff  and  you  know 
 it  for  me  it's  like  okay  go  to  Thailand
[76:27] go  to  like  one  of  these  countries  for 
 you  it  might  be  something  like  pursuing 
 a  certain  sport  which  isn't  even  right
[76:32] for  you  it  might  be  like  being  friends 
 with  this  friendship  group  that  are 
 always  going  out  and  taking  drugs  or 
 this  friendship  group  that  are  always
[76:38] playing  video  games  it's  about  the 
 situations  that  you  get  yourself  in  you 
 can  see  that  mine  it  seemed  kind  of
[76:43] productive  and  so  yours  might  too  you 
 might  feel  like  it's  productive  to  go 
 and  pursue  this  kind  of  situation  or
[76:48] environments  but  it's  only  when  you  get 
 there  you  realize  you  don't  actually 
 like  the  kind  of  person  you  are  when
[76:53] you're  there 
 so  six  months  of  my  entire  life  which  is 
 a  lot  that's  about  five  percent  of  my
[76:59] life 
 wasted  not  wasted  in  the  learning  sense 
 you  know  I  learned  things  about  myself
[77:05] but  wasted  in  like  the  goal  sense  of  you 
 know  getting  closer  to  the  things  that  I 
 I  want  out  of  life  six  months  of  my
[77:11] entire  life  wasted  because  I  was  putting 
 myself  into  an  environment  where  I
[77:16] didn't  do  best 
 because  I  didn't  have  the  realization
[77:22] that  you  might  be  getting  now 
 that  there's  an  environment  that  is 
 right  for  you
[77:28] now  for  me 
 it's  here  in  my  family's  home
[77:35] so  the  environment  that's  right  for  you 
 might  not  sound  as  cool  as  going 
 somewhere  else  across  the  world  and  move
[77:40] into  Dubai 
 because  mine  doesn't  it  doesn't  sound 
 very  cool  when  I  tell  you  yep  I  live  at
[77:45] home  with  my  family  and  it  almost  sounds 
 strange 
 when
[77:50] you  know  the  normal  I  mean  that's  a  side 
 topic  but  like  it's  it's  strange  to  like
[77:55] live  with  your  family  when  your  business 
 is  doing  very  very  well  and  you  can 
 afford  like  a  place  by  yourself  and  you
[78:01] know  people  find  that  it's  strange  in 
 some  ways 
 but  this  is  where  I'm  doing  best  this  is
[78:06] where  I  am  the  like  I  act  like  the  man 
 that  I  want  to  act
[78:11] this  is  where  the  environment  has  set  me 
 up  for  success  in  the  areas  that  I  care 
 about  so  why  change  that
[78:16] why  change  that  for  the  perceptions  of 
 other  people 
 so  I  ask  you  if  this  situations  and
[78:22] environments  that  you  keep  getting  into 
 where  you  don't  act  like  you  want  to
[78:28] where  your  traits  are  worse  or  poorer  or 
 weaker
[78:33] or  your  personality  is  you  know  much 
 more  reserved  maybe  insecure  then  why
[78:39] keep  putting  yourself  back  into  those 
 situations  you  need  to  find  your  hot 
 triggers  the  things  that  trigger  you
[78:44] into  letting  go  of  the  the  willpower
[78:49] and  start  to  consider  the  kind  of 
 environment  that  you  could  set  up  for 
 that  and  so  your  actionable  step  for
[78:55] this  part  of  the  video 
 it's  the  just  Journal  this  question 
 maybe  for  a  few  minutes  maybe  if  you
[79:00] want  you  can  write  it  as  a  comment  below 
 the  video  and  then  that  will  like  help 
 the  YouTube  algorithm  as  well  and  just
[79:05] answer  this  question  what  could  be  my 
 hot  triggers  how  could  I  set  up  an 
 environment  with  those  hot  triggers
[79:11] don't  bother  me  step  six  high  level 
 desires  this  is  the  part  of  the  full
[79:16] guide  which  I  think  might  save  you 
 Decades  of  your  life
[79:22] I'm  not  exaggerating  when  I  say  that 
 Decades  of  your  life  saved  because  high 
 level  desires  are  something  that  no
[79:28] one's  ever  spoke  to  you  about  will  say 
 the  low  level  desires  are  those  things 
 that  we've  been  talking  about  so  far
[79:33] it's  the  porn  it's  the  video  games  it's 
 the  sugar  the  things  that  we  all  know 
 are  wrong  for  us  the  high  level  desires
[79:38] are  the  things  that  seemingly  are 
 productive  and  yet  might  still  be  wrong 
 for  us
[79:44] overworking  too  much  ambition  how 
 different  is  the  depressed  millionaire
[79:49] who  needs  to  keep  working  working 
 working  working  from  the  fat  man  who 
 needs  to  keep  eating  eating  eating
[79:54] eating  they  both  have  this  incessant 
 desire  for  more  more  more  more  not  good 
 enough  unsatisfied  more  but  the
[80:01] depressed  millionaire  we  rank  so  highly 
 these  days  they're  both  as  soulless  as 
 each  other  they're  both  as  depressed  and
[80:08] unhappy  and  unhealthy  as  each  other  but 
 the  millionaire  we  will  regard  with  so
[80:13] much  Social  Status  these  days  the 
 millionaire  doesn't  want  to  be  alive
[80:18] only  with  everyone's  attention  to  his 
 ego  does  he  feel  anything  this  is  why
[80:25] these  guys  you  see  a  lot  as  like 
 influencers 
 more  attention  more  attention  more  money
[80:31] validation  please  please  please  please 
 please  you  might  think  that  I'm  going 
 crazy  at  what  I'm  getting  at  here
[80:36] I'm  saying  that  working  too  hard  making 
 money
[80:41] being  ambitious  setting  goals  might 
 actually  be  a  desire  that's  bad  for  you
[80:46] just  open  up  your  mind  to  this 
 realization  that  I've  had  okay  if  you 
 knew  that  the  next  level  of  your
[80:54] business  success  let's  say  you  know  it's 
 10  years  from  now  you're  happily  married 
 and  everything  and  you  knew  that  the 
 next  level  of  your  business  success  you
[81:00] pursuing  it  was  going  to  be  you  know 
 super  super  hard  work 
 that  you  would  literally  ruin  your
[81:05] family  that  you  would  literally  get 
 divorced  from  pursuing  the  next  level 
 because  of  how  much  harder  you  needed  to
[81:11] work  and  you  know  you  started  to  like 
 almost  resent  and  push  away  your  family 
 and  they  felt  so  withdrawn  from  you
[81:17] if  you  knew  that  Desiring  more  money  was 
 going  to  lead  you  to  getting  divorce  and
[81:22] being  unhappy  would  you  still  do  it 
 how  about  for  athletes  if  you  knew  that
[81:27] Desiring  to  win  that  upcoming  season  was 
 literally  going  to  get  you  divorced  and
[81:32] you  know  for  your  child  to  develop  like 
 this  weird  conditional  love  feeling  when
[81:37] now  they've  got  like  slight  trauma  for 
 the  rest  of  their  lives  and  they  don't 
 even  like  you  and  your  woman  wants  to 
 leave  you  if  you  knew  that  those  things
[81:43] were  gonna  happen 
 because  of  chasing  the  next  level  of 
 success  too  much  success  would  you  still
[81:49] Chase  it  I  don't  blame  you  for  not 
 wanting  to  listen  to  this  part  of  this 
 video  almost  it  seems  a  bit  crazy  at
[81:54] what  I'm  saying  because  everyone  online 
 every  influencer  that  you  see  these  days 
 has  gone  viral  it's  it's  so
[82:01] materialistic  so  like  everyone  just 
 wants  more  money  more  success  more  like 
 you  know  this  is  what  we're  covering  our
[82:06] soul  on  top  of  here  we  are  all  broken 
 inside  but  more  money  okay  you  know  we 
 can  go  get  the  car  and  the  watch  and  the
[82:11] fancy  subscribe  you  know  the  subscribers 
 the  likes  and  everything  this  is  all 
 what  we're  thinking  about  but  again  this
[82:17] is  like  a  low  level  of  ambition  you  know 
 why 
 because  constantly  Desiring  more  success
[82:22] and  more  money 
 it's  [ __ ]  normal 
 it's  mediocre  everyone  wants  this  right
[82:31] by  watching  a  full  guide  like  this  where 
 you're  studying  willpower  is  a  topic 
 you're  not  normal  you're  not  average  and
[82:39] yet  average  mediocre  people  including 
 those  which  who  seemingly  seem  very 
 successful  Rich  you  know  influencers  and
[82:46] everything  they're  all  here  they  just 
 want  more  success  more  success  more 
 success  they're  trapped  in  The  Matrix
[82:52] they're  trapped  in  The  Matrix  that  they 
 tell  you  that  they're  gonna  free  you 
 from  and  then  they  tell  you  to  make  more
[82:57] money  to  free  yourself  from  the  Matrix 
 as  if  making  money  wasn't  part  of  The 
 Matrix
[83:03] hmm 
 once  you  take  a  step  out  of  this  circle
[83:08] you  know  obviously  I'm  speaking  very 
 openly  now  of  the  kind  of  influences  who 
 are  in  the  men's  space  but  once  you  take
[83:14] a  step  out  and  you  like  detach  away  from 
 technology  I  can't  help  but  look  at  like 
 every  male  influencer  these  days  and
[83:20] think  of  how  pathetic  it  is  that  like 
 they're  all  at  level  one  they're  all 
 just  chasing  toys  fight  like  you  know
[83:26] fancy  cars  and  nice  handshakes  from  each 
 other  taking  pictures  in  shirts  and 
 thinking  Yep  this  is  the  life  you  know  I
[83:32] you  know  this  is  it  haha  just  more 
 materialistic  successes  if  that  was
[83:37] going  to  change  anything  now  we  need  to 
 integrate  more  of  our  soul  and 
 spirituality  into  our  lives  otherwise  we
[83:42] will  live  shallow  empty  lives  because 
 the  pursuit  for  more  success 
 makes  you  weak  greed  constantly  moves
[83:49] the  goal  post  the  goal  used  to  be  to 
 make  a  a  comfortable  living  then  it  went
[83:54] to  5K  a  month  then  it  went  to  10K  a 
 month  then  it's  at  100K  a  month  and  it's 
 still  not  enough  now  we  don't  need  to
[83:59] get  to  2  million  subscribers  in  three 
 and  four  and  five  when  does  it  stop 
 when  do  you  look  inwards  and  you  realize
[84:05] that  everything  that  you've  been  chasing 
 isn't  gonna  change  anything  because
[84:10] all  you  can  actually  change  with  your 
 life  is  in  the  internal  no  one  is  less
[84:15] free  than  these  businessmen  who  are  on 
 the  hedonic  treadmill  constantly  needing
[84:20] more  and  more  and  more 
 they  may  speak  about  Freedom  they  may
[84:25] tell  you  that  they  are  so  free 
 they're  not  they  have  to  be  in  Dubai  for
[84:30] six  months  a  year  and  they  don't  even 
 like  being  there  so  how  are  they  free 
 when  they're  literally  in  like  a  desert
[84:35] prison  which  they're  not  allowed  to 
 leave 
 they're  not  as  free  as  you  think  they
[84:41] are  their  lives  aren't  as  good  as  they 
 make  you  believe  it's  only  because 
 they're  trying  to  sell  you  their
[84:47] lifestyle  and  you  know  they've  got  a 
 nice  course  or  program  that  you  can  buy 
 to  have  the  nice  you  know  like  oh  I  look 
 at  me  I  I've  got  money  and  Status  I've
[84:53] got  a  shirt  and  look  here's  a  picture  of 
 me  and  a  girl  see  oh
[84:59] these  men  are  not  free 
 now  this  isn't  to  say  that  you  shouldn't
[85:05] make  money 
 that's  not  what  I'm  saying  it's  all  I 
 think  you  should  work  super  hard
[85:10] I  think  you  should  contribute  a  lot  to 
 the  marketing  to  help  people  and 
 naturally  the  market  will  pay  you  back
[85:17] for  that  and  you'll  make  a  lot  of  money 
 but  focusing  on  materialism
[85:23] focusing  on  on  these  like  high  level 
 desires  needing  to  make  more  money  more 
 validation  more  success
[85:31] that's  weakness 
 the  less  you  desire 
 the  stronger  you  become  this  book
[85:37] explains  the  way  that 
 we  could  live  our  lives
[85:47] this  is  a  complete  guide  to  masculinity
[85:53] and  inside  of  this  book  you  hear  about 
 the  concept  of  purpose  that  often  is 
 spoke  about  a  lot  these  days  a  lot  of
[85:59] our  influencers  are  talking  about  you 
 know  purpose  purpose  purpose  if  they're 
 not  spiritual  they  don't  understand  what 
 purpose  is
[86:05] your  purpose  is  your  Soul's  reason  for 
 being  on  this  Earth
[86:11] it  is  the  core  desire  that  you  have  so 
 imagine  inside  of  you  deep  inside  of  you
[86:16] there  is  a  core  desire  something  that 
 you  want  to  fulfill  to  be  able  to  live
[86:21] like  the  most  magical  best  life  possible 
 only  you  don't  actually  know  what  that
[86:28] core  desire  is  if  you  think  you  do 
 you're  probably  delusional  you  don't 
 know  what  it  is 
 we're  not  at  that  stage  just  yet
[86:35] so  we  don't  know  what  the  core  desire  is 
 but  we  generally  need  to  know  we  need  to 
 fulfill  this  core  desire  to  feel  like
[86:40] we're  living  right  in  our  lives  the 
 reason  why  is  because  all  the  desires 
 get  placed  on  top  of  you  you  are  born
[86:47] with  this  core  desire  and  then  your 
 parents  look  at  you  and  say  oh  I  really 
 hope  you  get  good  grades  in  school 
 really  hope  you  get  a  high  status  job
[86:53] that  makes  me  feel  good 
 because  I  worked  a  shitty  job  and  so  my
[86:58] son  you  will  work  a  high  status  job  so  I 
 can  live  vicariously  through  you  here  is
[87:03] a  desire  to  put  over  your  core  desire 
 then  your  teachers  has  more  desires  than 
 the  news  than  the  TV  shows  has  more
[87:09] desires  has  more  desires  put  that  over 
 your  your  one  that  you  were  meant  to 
 fulfill
[87:14] by  the  time  you're  10  years  old  you've 
 got  hundreds  of  desires  these  concentric
[87:19] circles  yours  is  right  in  the  middle 
 right  there  at  the  core  but  there's
[87:25] hundreds  that  have  been  placed  on  top  of 
 you  gotta  act  like  this  gotta  be  friends 
 with  this  guy  need  that  shirt  need  that
[87:30] like  earphone  thing  that  everyone  else 
 has  got  high  status  parents  want  you  to
[87:35] act  like  this  need  the  grades 
 of  the  movie
[87:40] more  desires  more  desires  more  desires 
 and  then  you  wake  up 
 then  you're  like  yeah  you  know  like
[87:45] watching  these  guys  on  YouTube's  really 
 good  you  know  watching  the  influencers 
 okay  men's  issues  yeah  yeah  yeah  I  feel
[87:51] free  now 
 and  the  people  who  you  think  are  helping
[87:56] you  right  now  probably  including  me 
 all  of  these  male  influences  they're
[88:01] putting  more  desires  onto  you 
 well  you  should  be  making  this  much 
 money  a  month  and  you  know  this  is  a
[88:06] Better  Business  the  top  seven  ways  to 
 make  money  online  the  top  three  ways  to 
 make  ten  thousand  a  month  they're  just
[88:11] putting  more  desires  more  desires  more 
 desires 
 so  you've  got  hundreds  of  desires  over
[88:17] your  core  heart  desire  right  now 
 this  is  why  I  don't  even  go  to  the  gym
[88:22] anymore 
 because  I  was  in  the  gym  one  day
[88:27] you  know  feeling  kind  of  like  purposeful 
 I'm  journaling  and  everything  and  then  I 
 go  up  I'm  on  the  assault  bike
[88:33] and  a  guy  walks  past 
 and  he's  bigger  than  me
[88:38] he's  more  muscular  than  me 
 he's  got  more  veins  than  I  do
[88:44] and  instantly  my  brain  and  my  heart 
 started  to  form  a  new  desire  maybe  I 
 should  bulk  and  make  more  muscle
[88:50] or  maybe  I  should  get  back  into  martial 
 arts  because  in  cases  me  and  this  guy 
 had  a  fight  then  I'd  be  able  to  whoop
[88:56] his  ass  and  I  start  actually  daydreaming 
 this  and  adding  it  to  like  my  perception 
 of  my  goals  the  direction  I  should  go  to
[89:01] in  life  it  takes  me  like  minutes  to 
 realize  wait
[89:06] I  just  set  like  a  plan  for  the  rest  of 
 my  life 
 you  have  to  take  martial  out  so
[89:11] seriously 
 based  on  some  guy  just  walking  past  me
[89:16] who  had  biceps  extra  centimeter  bigger 
 than  mine 
 and  then  I'm  looking  around  at  the
[89:22] entire  gym  thinking  about  how  many 
 random  desires  goals  get  formed  inside
[89:27] of  me  just  because  of  what  I'm  seeing  in 
 this  environment
[89:32] and  then  I  go  on  YouTube  and  it's  the 
 exact  same  thing  there  maybe  I  should
[89:37] move  to  Dubai  maybe  I  should  make  more 
 money  maybe  it's  this  business  model 
 maybe  it's  this  one  if  this  one  is  this
[89:42] one  it's  this  one 
 and  before  you  know  it  you've  got  so 
 many  desires  over  the  thing  that  you
[89:48] were  genuinely  supposed  to  do  in  life 
 you  have  a  core  desire  and  it  is  your
[89:54] duty  as  a  man  that  is  your  purpose 
 that's  that's  your  duty  as  a  man  to  try 
 and  fulfill  that  and  that  should  give
[89:59] you  apparently  like  the  greatest  life 
 that  you  could  have  as  a  man  that's  what
[90:04] every  spiritual  teacher  that  I  read 
 seems  to  say 
 but  these  days  purpose  when  you  hear
[90:10] about  it  online  but  that  word  purpose 
 has  been  bastardized  by  these  male  role
[90:15] models  including  myself  for  so  long 
 to  just  kind  of  mean  like  yeah  just  just
[90:20] work  hard  and  just  you  know  work  on  the 
 kind  of  business  that  I  recommend  you  to 
 do  do  you  see  why  what  we're  talking
[90:25] about  might  save  you  Decades  of  your 
 life  your  life  is  only  worthwhile  if
[90:30] you're  fulfilling  this  core  purpose  this 
 the  core  desire  inside  of  you  but
[90:35] there's  hundreds  maybe  even  thousands  of 
 extra  desires  put  on  top  of  that  which
[90:40] are  happening  because  of  like  the 
 external  influences  you  go  on  to 
 Instagram  and  Mike  thurston's  there  and
[90:46] he's  got  the  best  physique  in  the  entire 
 [ __ ]  world  you're  like  how  the  [ __ ] 
 can  I  compete  with  this  guy  bro 
 oh  maybe  I  should  do  it  his  quads  look
[90:52] really  big  maybe  I  should  do  some  leg 
 extensions  maybe  I  should  open  my  own 
 modeling  company  because  he's  he's  next
[90:57] to  some  high  level  people  right  now  and 
 before  you  know  it  there's  more  desires 
 more  desires  more  desires
[91:03] those  extra  desires  weren't  the  things 
 that  you  were  supposed  to  do  with  your 
 life  and  yet  you  will  pursue  them
[91:09] because  of  this  like  monkey  see  monkey 
 do  monkey  needs  status  life  that  we  live 
 in  these  days  so  imagine  spending  your
[91:15] life  your  valuable  time  chasing  and 
 fulfilling  desires
[91:20] that  someone  else  put  on  to  you  that 
 came  onto  you  in  such  stupid  ways  that
[91:26] there  was  a  guy  who  was  bigger  than  you 
 in  the  gym  and  he  walked  past  you  you 
 felt  insecure  and  you  felt  like  yep  I
[91:31] you  know  I'm  gonna  dedicate  myself  to  a 
 martial  art  then  just  in  case  as  if  he 
 said  anything  to  me  here  you  are  four
[91:37] years  later  you  know  you've  had  a  pretty 
 good  life  training  this  this  skill  fair 
 enough 
 but  that  wasn't  the  thing  that  you  were
[91:42] meant  to  do  that  wasn't  actually  totally 
 a  line  to  you  now  this  isn't  to  say 
 don't  do  martial  arts  because  it  might
[91:48] actually  be  the  the  core  real  desire 
 but  this  is  to  say  that  we  shouldn't  be 
 spending  our  life  in  our  time
[91:55] fulfilling  other  people's  desires 
 rather  we  should  look  inwards  and  figure
[92:00] out  like  what  is  authentic  to  us  and 
 Achieve  that
[92:06] that's  why  I've  included  this  section  in 
 this  willpower  guide  because  we  need  to 
 use  willpower  to  push  off  not  just  the
[92:13] low  level  desires  not  just  the  desire 
 for  video  games  and  for  porn  but  the
[92:18] seemingly  productive  desires  are  harder 
 to  restrain  from  the  seemingly 
 productive  desire  where  like  you  see  a
[92:24] tape  podcast  and  he's  talking  about 
 making  money  in  this  business  model 
 that's  forming  a  desire  in  your  heart
[92:29] which  wasn't  there  which  wasn't  supposed 
 to  be  there  that's  the  kind  of  Desire 
 that  you  need  to  strip  away  and  say  to
[92:36] yourself  that  didn't  form  from  my  own 
 hearts  or  my  own  mind  that  formed  from 
 social  media
[92:42] if  it  comes  from  social  media  it's 
 probably  not  a  good  thing 
 and  again  I'm  super  guilty  of  this
[92:48] because  not  only  have  I  you  know  this 
 happens  to  me  I  feel  the  desires  but 
 I've  put  these  desires  onto  you  with
[92:53] over  800  videos  where  I've  told  you  okay 
 be  like  this  act  like  this  do  this  thing 
 do  this  business  model  text  your  girl
[92:58] like  this  I've  put  all  these  extra 
 desires  onto  you 
 thinking  that  I've  been  helping  you  all
[93:04] this  time  and  rather  maybe  I've  been 
 wasting  your  life  that's  why  I've  been 
 making  these  full  guides  on  deeper  more
[93:10] mature  topics  rather  than  those  like 
 surface  level  top  seven  ways  to  message 
 girls  type  of  videos  which  they  get  a
[93:17] lot  of  views  those  videos  you  see  every 
 YouTuber  every  influencer  play  this  game
[93:22] where  they're  just  trying  to  get  as  many 
 views  as  possible  for  their  benefit  not 
 for  yours  and  so  every  [ __ ]  YouTuber
[93:27] is  making  these  top  seven  business 
 models  to  get  to  ten  thousand  dollars  a 
 month  is  [ __ ]  pathetic
[93:33] because  those  videos  they're  making  it 
 for  their  own  money  they  don't  give  a 
 [ __ ]  about  you  even  when  you're  watching
[93:38] it  with  full  intent  you're  not  learning 
 anything  real  from  these  [ __ ]  videos 
 these  listicles  these  random  little
[93:44] shallow  videos  but  worse  than  that  not 
 even  just  wasting  20  minutes  of  your 
 life  that's  bad  enough  but  like  worse
[93:50] than  that  is  like  that  this  influences 
 putting  on  desires  onto  you  you  should 
 live  like  this  you  should  be  like  this
[93:56] you  should  do  this  this  is  the  business 
 model  this  is  the  way  to  act
[94:02] when  they  don't  know  what  your  core 
 desire  is 
 worst  of  all  you  don't  even  know  what
[94:09] your  core  desire  is 
 perhaps  at  this  age  we  should  know  like 
 the  trajectory  ahead  and  actually  think
[94:15] to  ourselves  this  is  what  I  was 
 genuinely  born  to  do 
 but  we  can't  do  that  because  I  think
[94:22] there's  genuinely  thousands  of  desires 
 of  like  you  know  things  that  we  need  of
[94:28] We  crave  that  the  modern  world  has  told 
 us  that  it's  it's  needed  and  so  we  want
[94:33] a  nice  watch  we  want  that  oh  you  know 
 hamster  is  like  the  jumper  looks  good 
 hamster  where  did  you  get  that  little 
 necklace  from  Hamza  oh  you  know  oh  is
[94:39] that  the  whooping  did  you  use  the  whoop 
 or  the  the  aura  ring  and  before  you  know 
 it  here's  another  thing  that  you  need  to
[94:45] go  and  buy  here's  another  thing  you  know 
 that's  increasing  your  monthly  expenses 
 now  you  need  to  go  spend  your  time  like
[94:50] you  know  trading  time  for  money  wasting 
 part  of  your  life  just  to  afford  the 
 expenses  that  you  didn't  actually  need
[94:55] but  that  you  believe  that  you  do 
 when  really  like  you  should  be  doing 
 something  so  simple
[95:03] that  would  give  you  the  greatest  life 
 quality  that  there  is  which  is  pursuing
[95:08] your  purpose  how  do  you  find  your  core 
 desire  like  a  purpose  the  thing  you 
 should  be  doing
[95:14] first  of  all  you  need  to  limit  input  you 
 need  to  limit  the  things  all  of  this
[95:21] conditioning  that's  going  inside  of  your 
 brain  and  your  heart 
 means  no  TV  it  means  no  useless  garbage
[95:28] content  it  means  no  more  tape  podcasts 
 it  means  no  more  top  seven  ways  to  make
[95:33] money  online  type  of  videos 
 perhaps  it  means  not  watching  my  videos
[95:38] and  certainly  I  would  agree  with  you  for 
 most  of  the  videos  I've  ever  made  I  hope 
 that  the  new  videos  that  I'm  making
[95:43] would  actually  be  the  exception  because 
 they're  teaching  you  more  like  skills 
 and  mindsets  which  would  actually  use
[95:48] for  the  core  desire  for  example  the  this 
 video  and  the  previous  one  the
[95:53] discipline  full  guide  they'll  actually 
 help  you  find  your  authentic  self  and  to 
 fulfill  that  authentic  self
[96:00] but  I  promise  you 
 you  know  how  strange  this  is  I'm  a
[96:05] YouTuber 
 I  don't  watch  any  YouTube
[96:12] I  don't  watch  YouTube  videos 
 because  it's  garbage
[96:19] in  fact  you  know  what's  so  strange 
 for  a  lot  of  the  people  who  watch  my
[96:25] videos  and  who  are  coming  here  for 
 self-improvements  their  biggest  lever  of
[96:30] self-improvement  would  literally  be  to 
 stop  consuming  content
[96:37] think  about  how  crazy  that  is  my  entire 
 brand  my  entire  business  is  built  on  the 
 thing  that  you're  addicted  to
[96:43] I  do  believe  that  I've  been  able  to  have 
 more  of  a  positive  impact  on  the  world 
 than  a  negative  because  I  as  a  YouTuber
[96:49] don't  even  watch  YouTube  I  get  all  of  my 
 knowledge 
 from  books
[96:54] from  mentors  like  teachers 
 and  from  some  podcasts  long  unedited
[97:00] podcasts  Andrew  huberman  and  Alex  hamosi 
 Chris  Williamson  Ali  abdall  intelligent
[97:06] people  just  like  sort  of  brainwashing  me 
 for  an  hour  or  two  brainwashing  in  like 
 a  good  way  for  like  an  hour  or  two
[97:11] putting  their  words  and  thoughts  into 
 mine  amazing 
 but  you  go  and  watch  these  basic
[97:17] self-improvement  videos  top  seven  ways 
 to  text  girls  that's  not  helping  you  at 
 all  it  might  seem  like  it  is  because
[97:22] you're  texting  this  random  degenerate 
 girl  slightly  better 
 but  that  like  destroyed  the  the  desire
[97:29] to  improve  text  in  this  random 
 degenerate  girl  anyway 
 and  just  skip  that  whole  step  of  your
[97:35] life 
 you  must  understand  this 
 you'll  pursue  as  a  man  it's  not  about
[97:41] fulfilling  every  desire  that  pops  up 
 okay  so  Tate  says  money  is  really 
 important  maybe  I  should  buy  that  watch
[97:46] maybe  I  should  do  this  maybe  I  should  do 
 that  it's  not  about  fulfilling  every 
 desire  because  that's  slow  and
[97:51] inefficient  the  faster  way 
 is  to  destroy  the  desires  to  desire  less
[97:57] to  strip  us  away  as  many  as  possible  so 
 every  time  you  find  yourself  wanting 
 something  whether  it's  something  small
[98:03] the  low  level  desire  the  sugar  or 
 something  high  like  you  want  to  get  the 
 car  or  something  to  keep  stripping  away
[98:08] as  many  desires  as  possible  till  you  get 
 to  one  where  you're  like  you  know  what 
 I  actually  don't  think  I  should  strip
[98:13] this  one  away  I  actually  think  I  should 
 fulfill  this  one  maybe  your  desire  you 
 know  through  the  last  hour  has  been  like
[98:18] yeah  you  know  what  willpower  seems  like 
 a  really  important  skill  that's 
 something  I'm  Desiring  maybe  you're
[98:23] thinking  like  yeah  I'll  scrutinize  it 
 but  I  can  imagine  willpower  like  this 
 skill  actually  helping  me  for  the  rest
[98:28] of  my  life  I'll  desire  this  and  I'll 
 look  more  into  this  hamza's  mentioned 
 which  book  it  is  okay  I'll  go  read  that
[98:34] but  then  when  you  see  like  the  the  guy 
 on  Instagram  who's  got  a  the  better 
 watch  or  he's  got  a  slightly  better 
 six-pack  than  you
[98:40] and  you  think  to  yourself  yeah  you  know 
 like  I  would  get  some  kind  of  benefits 
 more  girls  would  like  me  my  status  would
[98:45] go  up  that's  kind  of  nice  but  is  that 
 really  what  I  was  born  to  do 
 is  that  really  genuinely  gonna  like  like
[98:52] be  the  best  thing  that  I  could  spend  my 
 time  doing 
 to  try  and  take  a  picture  as  good  as  one
[98:57] of  these  Fitness  influences  probably  not
[99:02] you  limit  inputs 
 you  limit  like  these  people  talking  into
[99:07] your  brain  especially  if  they're  quite 
 unintelligent  like  nobody's  or  that  you 
 know  they're  not  there  for  your  best
[99:12] intentions 
 if  you've  found  that  you've  followed
[99:17] someone's  advice  and  listened  to  their 
 content  but  it  hasn't  really  helped  you 
 or  in  fact  it's  made  your  life  like  very
[99:22] much  worse  and  it's  been  a  distraction 
 and  a  waste  of  time 
 stop  consuming  it  if  you  found  genuine
[99:29] real  improvements  to  your  life 
 continue  that's  a  wise  teacher  that
[99:34] you've  got  stay  vigilant  for  when  you 
 catch  yourself  wanting  something 
 Desiring  something  setting  a  goal  and
[99:41] scrutinize  that  goal  and  really  ask 
 yourself  why  do  you  genuinely  want  to 
 you  might  find  that  the  desire  that  you
[99:47] have  is  actually  authentic  and  it  makes 
 a  lot  of  sense  like  for  example  you 
 might  say  one  of  my  goals  is  to  make  a
[99:52] thousand  dollars  a  month  in  business  why 
 do  I  want  it  because  right  now  I've  got
[99:57] absolutely  no  money  and  I  can't  even 
 afford  like  the  bills  that  I  have  one  of 
 my  goals  is  to  make  five  thousand 
 dollars  a  month  in  business  why  do  I
[100:03] want  that  because  if  I  could  give  a 
 thousand  or  two  thousand  a  month  to  my
[100:08] family  that  would  genuinely  Save  Our 
 Lives  awesome
[100:13] but  ask  yourself  where  that  desire  came 
 from  because  when  you  find  yourself 
 wanting  a  particular  car  particular
[100:18] lifestyle 
 and  if  you're  honest  with  yourself  and 
 you  say  okay  where  did  this  desire  come
[100:23] from  from  something  I  saw  on  social 
 media 
 probably  not  a  good  idea  to  go  dedicate
[100:29] your  life  to  fulfilling  that  desire 
 because  it's  not  going  to  do  anything 
 other  than  just  take  time  away  from  you
[100:34] living  out  your  actual  purpose  that  you 
 were  supposed  to  do  using  the  skill  of 
 willpower  which  we've  discussed  in  this
[100:40] full  guide  on  these  high  level  desires 
 will  save  you  Decades  of  your  life
[100:46] because  imagine  the  life  of  a  normal 
 person  born  as  a  baby  and  shirt  away 
 desires  put  onto  the  baby  be  like  this
[100:52] you're  such  a  good  boy  when  you  do  this 
 when  you  sit  in  behave  you're  such  a
[100:57] good  boy  has  a  desire  onto  you  parents 
 are  telling  them  how  to  act  he  watches 
 these  little  children's  cartoon  shows
[101:03] then  eventually  he's  watching  like  TV 
 shows  and  you  know  the  teachers  putting 
 a  desires  okay  good  grades  grades  doing
[101:09] well  in  school  becomes  this  this  high 
 level  desire  for  the  next
[101:14] 12  years  of  his  life  he  wasn't  born  to 
 think  to  himself  yep  need  to  get  good
[101:19] grades  it  was  placed  onto  him  by  other 
 people 
 honestly  not  very  intelligent  people
[101:26] and  so  he  spends  12  15  years  of  his  life 
 in  an  education  system  that  doesn't 
 actually  prepare  him  for  life
[101:33] to  pursue  the  desire  of  someone  else 
 who's  put  it  onto  him
[101:38] you  know  parents  are  telling  him  yeah 
 here's  an  extra  desire  have  a  high 
 status  job  he's  trying  to  fulfill  all 
 that  he's  just  wasting  his  life  now  he's
[101:44] 30  years  old  now  he's  Desiring  the  car 
 that  one  of  his  co-workers  has  got  he's 
 35  years  old  and  the  other  female
[101:50] co-worker  he's  Desiring  her  maybe  he'll 
 cheat  on  his  wife  soon 
 doesn't  get  laid  for  the  next  you  know
[101:56] years  and  years  and  years  eventually  the 
 desire  gets  fulfilled  he's  41  he  ends  up 
 getting  a  divorce
[102:02] he  desires  a  lot  of  alcohol 
 he  desires  seeing  his  children  but  he's
[102:08] not  allowed  to  see  them  anymore 
 he  desires  killing  himself
[102:16] and  he  does  it
[102:26] the  things  you  desire  will  shape  your 
 life 
 just  be  careful  what  it  is  that  you're
[102:32] pursuing  this  is  the  most  important 
 actionable  step  that  I've  ever  given  out
[102:37] and  perhaps  that  I  ever  will 
 think  about  the  high  level  things  that
[102:44] you  desire 
 scrutinize  every  single  thing  that  you
[102:49] desire 
 and  just  ask  yourself  where  did  it  come 
 from
[102:54] ask  yourself  if  it's  truly  authentic  to 
 you  as  a  quick  final  tip  for  this 
 section  if  you're  super  interested  in
[102:59] everything  that  we've  just  spoke  about 
 I  have  a  full  guide  to  discovering  your
[103:04] purpose  your  core  desire  that  is  um 
 that's  on  my  channel  you  can  go  find  it
[103:09] but  what  I  will  say  is  I  made  that  about 
 six  months  ago  so  my  understanding  has 
 changed  which  is  how  you  want  tip  here
[103:15] I  believe  that  your  core  desire  in  life 
 will  be  linked  to  the  things  that  put
[103:20] you  into  a  flow  state 
 by  now  when  you're  watching  this  video 
 my  flow  State  full  guide  will  already  be
[103:27] released  flow  state  is  kind  of  like  this 
 moment  of  intense  focus  when  you're 
 doing  a  specific  task  that  for  some
[103:33] reason  puts  you  not  other  people  but  you 
 into  this  like  super  focused  mode  where
[103:38] you  have  no  thoughts  for  me  it's 
 speaking  every  single  time  that  I've 
 done  kind  of  like  a  speaking  like  task
[103:44] like  this  I  have  no  thoughts  in  my  mind 
 and  it's  inherently  like  pleasurable  to
[103:49] be  here 
 I  believe  that  your  core  desire  in  life 
 is  probably  related  to  the  thing  that
[103:55] gets  you  into  a  flow  State  and  so  that's 
 something  you  can  consider  my  flow 
 stateful  guide  you  can  go  and  watch  that
[104:01] you  can  discover  what  things  put  you 
 into  a  flow  State  and  how  to  be  more 
 likely  to  achieve  this  Flow  State  and
[104:08] produce  your  best  work  and  discover 
 yourself  one  last  point  about  this 
 section  of  high  level  desires  I  am  not
[104:14] saying  that  you  shouldn't  desire  things 
 like  money  your  work  or  success  or
[104:19] accomplishments  but  rather  those  things 
 like  let's  say  the  money  the  validation 
 the  the  YouTube  subscribers  these  things
[104:25] should  be  a  nice  reward  when  you're 
 actually  Desiring  the  right  thing  when 
 you  desire  the  wrong  thing  which  is  like
[104:31] you  know  Instagram  validation  YouTube 
 subscribers  even  money 
 you're  you're  off  center  you  know  you're
[104:37] not  you're  not  living  out  your  life  as 
 you're  supposed  to  but  for  example 
 if  you  desire  the  right  thing  which
[104:42] could  be  could  be  contribute  into 
 Humanity 
 for  me  for  example  think  about  think
[104:47] about  it  like  my  right  thing  is  like  I 
 love  to  speak  this  feels  totally  right
[104:52] for  me  this  is  like  a  core  desire  to 
 just  speak  out  and  explain  things  in  my 
 mind
[104:57] and  the  result  of  that  has  been 
 incredible  levels  of  of  money  of  wealth
[105:03] of  status  of  validation  so  that's  also 
 maybe  that's  the  better  way  that  we 
 pursue  our  work  and  our  goals  we  set  the
[105:10] goal  for  actually  the  task  that  we 
 desire  so  so  much 
 and  the  rewards  that  come  along  with  it
[105:16] is  just  extra  bonuses  this  way  you're 
 pursuing  the  thing  that  you  should 
 pursue  and  you're  super  happy  to  get  any
[105:22] level  of  reward  as  an  extra  rather  than 
 the  immature  people  who  were  pursuing
[105:27] just  the  reward  and  they  don't  even  like 
 the  task  that  they  are  doing  and  they
[105:32] don't  even  realize  that  the  reward 
 they're  Desiring  was  put  onto  them  it 
 wasn't  even  an  authentic  desire  anyway
[105:37] money  isn't  a  bad  thing 
 but  if  you're  trading  your  life  and  your
[105:42] purpose  if  you're  sacrificing  your 
 purpose  for  it  of  course  it  is  and  I 
 think  this  is  where  unfortunately  most
[105:48] young  men  including  like  the  influencers 
 the  leaders  of  young  men  I  think  they're
[105:53] in  the  states  where  they're  literally 
 sacrificing  purpose  for  money  and 
 validation  and  status  and  I  think  hordes
[105:59] of  young  men  are  looking  up  at  that 
 thinking  that  that's  the  right  way  to 
 live 
 start  with  purpose  start  with  your  why
[106:05] start  with  your  core  desire  and  then 
 enjoy  any  level  of  success  that  comes
[106:10] along  with  that  because  when  you  are 
 chasing  your  purpose  and  you're  working 
 super  hard  on  this  core  desire  you  know
[106:16] let's  say  the  core  desire  could  be  for 
 you  martial  arts  Muay  Thai  or  something 
 and  you  really  get  really  really  good  at
[106:22] it  well  then  you're  going  to  make  some 
 money  in  validation  from  it  courtesy  for 
 me  was  speaking  and  I  just  did  that  in  a
[106:27] high  leverage  format  of  YouTube  videos 
 and  so  it  made  like  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  money
[106:32] extra 
 but  I  wouldn't  be  happy  with  this 
 subscribers  and  money  if  I  wasn't
[106:38] fulfilling  my  core  desire  if  I  was 
 sacrificing  my  purpose  I'd  be  depressed 
 this  in  my  opinion
[106:43] is  the  higher  level  of  ambition  every 
 other  person  is  there  just  thinking  yep
[106:48] I  just  wanna  you  know  just  make  the 
 money  and  you  know  oh  yeah  be  on  your 
 purpose  guys  you  want  to  be  saying  the 
 word  but  they  don't  understand  it  make
[106:53] money  you  know  money  is  super  important 
 sure  sure 
 but  we're  more  ambitious  than  these
[106:59] people  that  you  see  online  even  though 
 they  seem  ambitious  we're  up  here
[107:04] let's  fulfill  our  purpose  our  core 
 desire  but  let's  also  get  the  external 
 material  Success  With  It
[107:11] I'm  not  sacrificing  my  purpose  for  money 
 like  most  people  are  doing  these  days  I
[107:16] want  both 
 start  with  purpose  start  with  your  real
[107:21] core  desire  the  way  you  find  that  is  by 
 limiting  input
[107:26] stare  at  your  wall  turn  everything  off 
 and  stare  at  your  wall  I'm  I'm  actually 
 speaking  literally  when  I  say  that  turn
[107:32] everything  off  and  stare  at  your  wall 
 perhaps  you  won't  do  this  practice  for
[107:37] the  next  six  months  when  I  keep 
 mentioning  it  perhaps  you'll  do  it  today 
 maybe  after  watching  this  video  if  you
[107:43] spend  some  time  staring  at  your  wall 
 with  no  distractions 
 and  you  limit  inputs  you  will  begin  to
[107:50] discover  who  you  are  and  you'll  realize 
 that  your  views  and  values  are  starting 
 to  differentiate  away  from  the
[107:57] influences  that  you've  been  watching 
 every  single  day 
 that's  a  good  thing  step  seven  a  quick
[108:02] 30  boost  in  willpower  I  found  this 
 experiment  so  interesting  so  I  wanted  to
[108:07] share  it  with  you  imagine  participants 
 are  put  into  a  brain  scanner 
 normal  people  are  asked  to  think  about
[108:14] their  future  self 
 and  their  brain  lights  up  as  if  they're
[108:19] thinking  about  a  stranger 
 people  on  self-improvement  people  who
[108:25] have  got  good  willpower  are  put  in  the 
 same  brain  scanner  and  they're  asked  to 
 think  about  their  future  selves  and  the
[108:31] part  of  their  brain  that  Lit  Up 
 shows  that  they're  actually  thinking 
 about  themselves  people  who  aren't  on
[108:36] self-improvements  can't  even  comprehend 
 that  their  future  self  is  them
[108:42] when  you  start  to  delay  gratification 
 everything  we  do  in  self-improvement  is 
 literally  just  delaying  gratification 
 for  our  future  self  that's  literally
[108:48] just  self-improvement  is  literally  just 
 like  making  life  better  for  your  future 
 self  you  start  to  like  integrate  and
[108:54] realize  that  you're  still  gonna  be  alive 
 and  you're  going  to  be  looking  back  and 
 hoping  that  you're  doing  the  right 
 things
[109:00] like  right  here  right  now  do  you  look 
 back  to  your  younger  self  and  kind  of 
 feel  like  yeah  you  did  kind  of  nice  in 
 that  thing  but  I  kind  of  wish  you  did
[109:06] some  more  good  things  maybe  you're 
 thinking  back  to  your  younger  self 
 thinking  I  wish  you  studied  harder  I
[109:11] wish  you  train  in  the  gym  more  I  wish 
 you  started  in  the  gym  early  I  wish  you 
 started  a  business  and  self-improvement
[109:16] and  productivity  when  you  were  younger 
 you  know  most  people  live  their  entire
[109:21] lives  like  that 
 most  people  in  my  opinion 
 are  rightly  so  and  they  deserve  to  be
[109:29] depressed  and  unhappy 
 because  they're  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  to
[109:35] their  future  selves 
 most  people  are  literally  cruel  to  their
[109:40] future  selves  they  know  that  if  they  do 
 something  bad  today  their  future  self
[109:45] tomorrow  or  a  week  or  a  month  from  now 
 is  gonna  dislike  it  and  they'll  keep 
 doing  it  they'll  keep  eating  the  junk
[109:51] food  playing  the  video  games  watching 
 porn  fapping  not  studying  not  working 
 hard  knowing  that  they're  literally
[109:57] hurting  their  future  self  and  then 
 surprised  when  it's  months  later  they're 
 taking  antidepressants  thinking  like
[110:02] yeah  but  you  know  you're  like  yeah  but 
 just  you  know  like  oh  but  you  being  mean 
 Hamza
[110:08] just  being  nice  to  your  future  self  and 
 you'll  live  a  good  life  because  you're 
 going  to  become  your  future  self  soon
[110:13] and  there  was  another  study  which  was 
 very  interesting  and  I've  set  it  up  on 
 my  own  phone  on  my  lock  screen
[110:20] can  you  recognize  who  this  is
[110:30] this  is  future  me 
 this  is  me  when  I'm  old  I  just  use  like 
 some  um  some  app  and  just  put  it  as  like
[110:37] old  age 
 the  idea  is
[110:42] if  you  keep  in  mind  your  future  self  you 
 will  be  30  more  likely  to  delay
[110:48] gratification  so  this  was  the  study  they 
 brought  in  participants  and  told  them 
 about  investing  for  their  future  you
[110:54] know  investing  money  so  they  could 
 retire  later  and  they  kind  of  asked  like 
 with  a  slider  to  you  know  okay  where  on
[111:00] the  slider  how  much  money  do  you  want 
 now  or  how  much  money  do  you  want  to 
 invest  for  your  future  self  one  group  of
[111:05] participants  are  shown  this  slider  and 
 it  just  shows  a  picture  of  them  as  they
[111:10] are  right  now 
 the  other  group  of  participants  are 
 showing  the  same  slider  but  it  shows  a
[111:16] picture  like  a  Photoshop  picture  of  them 
 looking  old  and  they  just  ask  how  much 
 money  do  you  want  to  save  for  retirement
[111:21] just  simple  as  that 
 and  what  do  you  think  would  happen  when 
 you  see  your  future  self  or  when  you
[111:27] think  about  your  future  self  you're 
 going  to  be  more  likely  to  delay 
 gratification  by  30  percent
[111:33] 30  increase  in  willpower  and  your 
 ability  to  delay  gratification  so  this 
 is  such  an  easy  actionable  step  like  a
[111:40] proactive  thing  that  you  can  start  doing 
 keep  your  future  self  in  mind  now  you 
 might  be  wondering  okay  what's  the  app  I
[111:46] just  searched  old  on  App  Store  I 
 actually  don't  think  you  need  a  picture 
 as  your  lock  screen  or  anything  I  like
[111:51] to  be  a  little  bit  obsessive  but  what 
 you  really  just  need  to  do  is  just  think 
 about  your  future  self  just  let's  do
[111:56] this  together  close  your  eyes 
 and  just  see  your  future  self  living  the
[112:02] kind  of  life  that  you  think  would  be 
 good  for  him  see  him  in  fantastic  shape 
 see  him  and  like  he  looks  so  like  aware
[112:10] and  and  free  in  his  body 
 what  are  the  things  that  he's  doing
[112:18] what  is  he  most  proud  and  grateful  of 
 you  doing  today
[112:24] what  are  the  actions  that  you  could  do 
 today  this  week  this  month  that  would 
 benefit  him  the  most
[112:31] open  your  eyes 
 this  is  the  better  way  to  live  it's  to
[112:37] keep  your  future  self  in  mind  and  to 
 constantly  make  their  life  better  most
[112:42] people  do  the  exact  opposite  they  try 
 they  over  indulge  in  pleasure  and  little 
 happiness  feeling  warm  feelings  today
[112:49] they  eat  the  cookie  the  junk  food  they 
 watch  the  porn  they  you  know  um  they 
 take  the  drugs  they  go  out  they  stay  up
[112:55] late  and  everything  to  try  and  maximize 
 happiness  and  pleasure  today
[113:00] but  then  before  they  know  it  they  become 
 their  future  selves  looking  back  at  them 
 thinking  like  why  didn't  you  just  like
[113:05] go  to  bed  on  time  now  I'm  waking  up 
 sleep  deprived
[113:11] it's  hard  not  to  like  yourself  when 
 you've  been  dedicating  your  actions  for
[113:16] your  future  self  and  then  you  become 
 your  future  self  you're  far  more  likely 
 to  become  a  man  of  character  of  good
[113:22] virtues  and  values  and  morals  if  you 
 think  about  your  future  self  rather  than
[113:27] today's  greed  so  this  is  your  actionable 
 step  which  you  can  actually  do  every  day 
 think  about  your  future  self  in  any  way
[113:33] that  you  want  you  can  visualize  him  you 
 can  even  do  like  coaching  or  journaling
[113:38] with  your  future  self  and  you  don't  have 
 a  name  for  him  wise  Grandpa  Hamza  and 
 it's  like  you  write  one  sentence  each
[113:43] Alexa  Mosey  says  he  does  this  you  write 
 one  sentence  as  you  you're  asking  like 
 your  future  self  for  advice  and  you  can
[113:48] just  reply  back  as  if  you  are  him  just 
 pretend  you  are  and  just  like  you 
 probably  be  more  wise  giving  yourself
[113:53] advice  if  you  put  yourself  in  that  frame 
 you  can  go  online  and  just  search  for 
 like  an  old  picture  editor  like  a
[113:58] middle-aged  women  on  Facebook  love  to  do 
 like  this  type  of  stuff  where  they'll
[114:03] use  like  little  photo  editors  and 
 they'll  be  like  whoa  look  has  you  with 
 red  hair  and  stuff  so  that's  why  I'm  not 
 gonna  like  say  yeah  you  absolutely  need
[114:09] to  do  that  I  can  I'm  certain  I  know  that 
 this  is  a  side  point  I  know  for  a  fact 
 that  like  25  of  the  viewers  have
[114:15] literally  just  gotten  distracted  and  now 
 they're  trying  out  like  apps  and  apps 
 and  different  apps  and  stuff  the  point
[114:20] is  you  don't  need  to  go  and  get  the 
 perfect  app  or  anything  or  the  perfect 
 picture  just  keeping  in  mind  your  future
[114:25] self  is  going  to  help  you  and  especially 
 for  important  decisions  if  you  can  just 
 ask  yourself  what  would  wise  Grandpa  me
[114:31] suggest  that  I  do  what  would  he  what 
 advice  would  he  give  to  me  and  just  like
[114:36] you  know  try  to  give  yourself  advice 
 from  that  frame 
 you'll  find  that  you'll  actually  give 
 yourself  very  good  advice
[114:42] when  you're  making  decisions  even  micro 
 ones  like  whether  you  should  you  know  ah 
 maybe  I'll  skip  the  the  workout  today
[114:48] just  look  at  your  future  self  just  think 
 about  him  and  think 
 what  would  make  his  life  better
[114:56] align  your  activities  your  decisions 
 your  relationships  to  that  because  this
[115:01] is  just  a  proactive  way  to  think  long 
 term  step  eight  willpower  fatigue
[115:06] participants  are  brought  into  a  study 
 and  there's  cookies  like  delicious
[115:12] cookies  there  and  also  radishes  like 
 these  disgusting  vegetables  and  one 
 group  of  participants  are  told  nope
[115:18] ignore  the  cookies  eat  the  radishes  the 
 other  group  of  participants  are  told  oh 
 yeah  just  eat  whatever  you  want  eat  the
[115:23] cookies  if  you  want  then  they're  brought 
 in  to  do  a  puzzle  which  is  like 
 impossible  to  do  the  researchers  are
[115:29] timing  how  long  they'll  try  to  do  the 
 puzzle  for  before  they  give  up
[115:34] what  they  found  which  is  went  viral  is 
 that  the  people  who  came  in  and  had  the
[115:40] radishes  and  essentially  you  know  they 
 had  to  use  their  willpower  not  to  eat 
 the  cookies  I  actually  gave  up  earlier
[115:46] the  conclusion  of  this  which  everyone 
 has  spoke  about  is  that  willpower  is
[115:51] something  that  fatigues  it's  something 
 that  is  limited  and  it  drains  and  so  we 
 shouldn't  use  it
[115:57] think  about  how  stupid  everyone  is  can 
 you  see  what's  wrong  with  this  study
[116:03] the  puzzle  is  stupid  the  task  that  they 
 did  was  stupid  this  was  one  study  that
[116:08] all  these  little  little  nerds  online 
 started  to  speak  about  saying  yep 
 willpower  is  limited  make  sure  you  don't
[116:13] use  your  willpower  you  can  go  search  up 
 and  it's  unfortunate  because  he's  very 
 smart  as  well  but  you  can  go  search  up  a 
 YouTube  video  called  willpower  is  for
[116:19] losers  and  it's  made  by  this  YouTuber 
 called  what  I've  learned  and  he's 
 actually  a  really  intelligent  guy  but  I 
 just  thought  the  video  was  stupid  as
[116:25] [ __ ]  because  you  take  this  one  study 
 which  essentially  put  participants  to  do 
 a  stupid  task  which  they  had  no
[116:31] incentive  for  and  then  we  just  conclude 
 yep  see  willpower's  you  know  limited  and 
 stuff 
 actually  when  you  really  think  about  it
[116:38] the  puzzle  was  impossible  to  do  right 
 so  the  participants  who  gave  up  earlier
[116:44] were  actually  smarter  because  it  was  a 
 stupid  waste  of  their  time  and  yet
[116:49] everyone  online  in  the  self-improvement 
 space  has  been  saying  this  for  years 
 that  willpower  is  not  something  you 
 should  rely  on  because  it  drains
[116:56] coming  from  a  weightlifting  background 
 I  knew  how  stupid  that  mindset  was  and
[117:01] you  probably  do  as  well  when  you  go  to 
 the  gym  you  know  this  right  people  are 
 saying  oh  but  if  you  use  willpower  it
[117:06] drains 
 when  you've  got  experience  of  the  gym 
 you  know  what  happens  when  you  use  your 
 muscles  it  fatigues
[117:12] but  then  we  go  to  sleep  and  it's  bigger 
 and  stronger  tomorrow  that's  exactly  how
[117:17] willpower  works  the  idea  is  that  we  need 
 to  use  our  willpower  like  a  muscle  and 
 understand  that  the  muscles  of  course
[117:23] their  fatigue  and  get  tired  but  when  you 
 sleep  and  recover  it  comes  back  stronger 
 and  stronger  and  stronger
[117:29] you  shouldn't  be  avoiding  fatiguing  your 
 willpower  muscle  you  should  be  training
[117:34] it  every  single  day  so  that  you're  able 
 to  resist  bigger  and  bigger  desires  and 
 plus  your  mindset  is  very  important  so
[117:40] Carol  dweck  is  a  very  famous  researcher 
 she  did  the  book  called  mindset  and  this
[117:45] study  had  the  exact  same  findings  as 
 another  study  on  stress  which  is 
 essentially  like  what  whatever  your
[117:51] mindset  of  something  is  that  is  what 
 will  happen  people  who  believed  that
[117:57] willpower  was  a  skill  like  a  muscle  that 
 they  wanted  to  level  up  and  it  was  good 
 for  them  to  use  actually  got
[118:03] consistently  better  at  using  willpower 
 people  who  believe  that  willpower  was
[118:08] something  that  they  shouldn't  use  and 
 that  it  was  something  that  drained  their 
 energy  got  more  and  more  tired  when  they
[118:14] used  it  so  it's  why  not  just  delude 
 yourself  into  having  the  more  empowering 
 mindset  and  think  to  yourself  yep
[118:19] willpower  is  a  muscle  just  like  muscles 
 are  in  the  gym  and  you  know  I'll  go 
 train  it  I'll  do  some  sets  today  and
[118:25] then  I'll  come  home  I'll  rest  and  it'll 
 be  bigger  and  better  tomorrow  in  this 
 mindset  study  those  students  who  believe 
 that  that  will  Powers  a  skill  that  they
[118:31] could  level  up  and  it  was  kind  of  like  a 
 muscle  they  performed  better  at  the  end 
 of  year  exams  than  the  students  who 
 didn't  want  to  use  their  willpower
[118:37] because  they  were  scared  of  draining  it 
 and  so  we  have  one  final  question  to  ask 
 when  do  you  reward  yourself
[118:43] you've  been  super  dedicated  on  your  diet 
 you've  been  resisting  the  desire  of  the
[118:48] sugar  of  the  junk  food  you've  not  been 
 watching  porn  you've  not  been  playing 
 video  games  when  do  you  enjoy  yourself 
 when  do  you  have  the  reward  when  do  you
[118:54] take  time  off 
 what  do  you  think  I'm  going  to  say  to 
 this
[118:59] do  I  seem  like  a  [ __ ]  who's  going  to 
 tell  you  the  same  thing  as  everyone  else 
 like  yeah  go  have  your  cheat  day  bro
[119:05] yeah  you  deserved  it 
 because  I  just  want  you  to  have  the  same 
 mindset  as  me
[119:10] cheat  days 
 rewarding  yourself
[119:15] is  actually  a  punishment  the  thing  that 
 you  think  is  rewarding  yourself  which
[119:20] you  know  that  everyone  else  would  think 
 you  know  oh  yeah  I'm  just  going  to 
 reward  myself 
 it's  a  punishment  when  you  really  think
[119:25] about  it  eating  sugar  is  a  punishment 
 it's  not  a  tree  it's  not  a  reward  it's
[119:30] our  punishment 
 playing  video  games  for  an  hour  and 
 worsening  your  mental  health  is  a
[119:36] punishment  we  need  to  destroy  this  idea 
 that  the  bad  habit  equals  reward  and  we
[119:43] need  to  just  stop  coping  and  just  say  to 
 ourselves  the  bad  habit  is  a  punishment 
 it's  something  we  do  when  we  don't  like
[119:49] ourselves  why  do  we  need  to  take  time 
 off  doing  things  that  are  good  for  us  we
[119:54] don't  know  certainly  for  example  you 
 know  we're  doing  so  many  sets  in  the  gym 
 so  we're  going  to  take  a  rest  day  sure 
 but  that's  like  that's  not  a  bad  thing
[120:01] to  do  but  to  eat  something  that  is 
 literally  poisonous  for  us  how  far  are 
 you  willing  to  go  should  we  reward
[120:07] ourselves  with  some  Pawn  then 
 alcohol  sugar  poison  how  far  are  you
[120:13] willing  to  go  because  everyone  who's 
 watching  this  will  understand  well  you 
 know  we're  not  going  to  reward  ourselves 
 with  porn  then  why  the  [ __ ]  would  you
[120:19] reward  yourself  with  sugar  or  with  video 
 games  or  with  little  snackies
[120:24] if  you  wouldn't  reward  yourself  with 
 some  porn  imagine  saying  that  bro 
 imagine  saying  that  go  comment  that
[120:30] below  my  video  imagine  you've  never  seen 
 someone  comment  that  because  of  how  how 
 absurd  it  would  be  I've  been  working  so
[120:36] hard  I've  been  doing  so  well  on  nofap  so 
 yeah  I've  scheduled  in  a  nice  fap 
 fapathon  on  yeah  yeah  I  have  a  fapathon
[120:42] on  Sundays  you  know  yeah  you  know  the 
 rest  days  are 
 it  would  seem  absurd  right  having  a
[120:48] cheat  day  from  nofap 
 unless  obviously  we  understand  that  you 
 might  still  mess  up  you  know  that  you're
[120:53] not  perfect  at  being  on  the  good  habits 
 of  course  you  might  mess  up  but  to 
 delude  yourself  into  thinking  it's  good
[120:59] for  you 
 remember  how  [ __ ]  our  lives  have  been 
 because  of  porn  and  masturbation  and
[121:04] like  like  those  like  I  don't  know 
 researchers  teachers  whatever  it  was  try 
 to  convince  us  that  porn  and
[121:09] masturbation  were  actually  good  for  you 
 because  they'll  lower  your  risk  of 
 prostate  cancer  or  some  [ __ ]
[121:14] it's  the  same  thing 
 and  the  worst  part  is  I  don't  even
[121:20] expect  you  to  believe  me  when  I  say  this 
 because  of  how  many  like  Fitness 
 influences  these  days  will  disagree  with
[121:26] this  and  say  like  oh  but  you  know  cheat 
 days  are  healthy  haha  like  you  know  you 
 gotta  have  some  sugar
[121:31] yeah  that's  the  most  disappointed  I've 
 ever  been  in  my  in  my  own  mother 
 one  day  when  I  was telling  her  about
[121:37] improving  her  diet  and  I  did  say  to  her 
 like  you  have  like  a  sugary  treat  every
[121:42] single  day  at  2PM  it's  kind  of  like  her 
 routine 
 and  I  said  oh  you  know  it's  probably  not 
 good  your  sugar  is  not  good  for  you  and
[121:48] she  looked  at  me  as  if  I  was  stupid  and 
 she  went 
 it  in  order  to  do  but  it  translates  it
[121:53] to  English  she  went  oh  but  you've  got  to 
 eat  some  sugar  no  you  just  have  to
[122:00] you've  just  got  to  you've  got  to  eat 
 some  sugar  you've  got  to  poison  yourself 
 guys
[122:05] oh  just  yeah  10  minutes  of  fapping 
 you've  got  to  watch  a  little  bit  of  of 
 dungeon  porn  why  do  we  have  a  belief  in
[122:12] our  minds  that  those  things  are  Rewards 
 because  when  you  think  about  it  a  reward
[122:18] is  something  that  should  be  good  for  you 
 right 
 so  the  reward  is
[122:24] the  workout  the  reward  is  the  Clean  Diet
[122:31] the  reward  is  the  good  habits  that 
 you're  doing  it  is  the  meditation  the 
 journaling  the  coal  showers  that  is  the
[122:37] reward  that's  those  are  gifts  that 
 you're  giving  to  yourself  to  your  future 
 self
[122:45] reframe  this  mindset  that  these  good 
 habits  are  the  good  things  we  still  have
[122:50] beliefs  inside  of  our  mind  from  normal 
 people  from  normal  life  before  we  got  on 
 to  self-improvement  that  are  deluding  us
[122:56] to  think  that  these  habits  are  like  the 
 hard  bad  things  that  we're  doing  and 
 that  you  know  but  you  know  you've  got  to
[123:02] reward  yourself  you've  got  to  have  some 
 time  off  certainly  you  can  have  some 
 time  off  you  know  you  don't  want  to  just 
 be  like  working  10  hours  straight
[123:07] certainly  you're  going  to  go  look  at 
 some  sun  and  go  out  for  a  war  and  you're 
 not  going  to  exercise  for  four  hours
[123:12] every  single  day  of  course  you're  gonna 
 have  rest  breaks  but  to  specifically  do 
 something  that  you  know  is  bad  for  you
[123:17] why  do  we  need  to  add  that  into  our 
 schedule  at  all
[123:24] why  don't  we  this  is  the  mindset  I  have 
 which  I  just  want  to  leave  you  with  why 
 don't  you  just  start  to  see  those  bad
[123:30] habits 
 as  self-harm
[123:36] the  porn  the  video  games  the  junk  food 
 that's  how  I  see  them 
 I  think  that  almost  everyone's
[123:42] self-harms  to  a  certain  level  when 
 there's  the  extreme  level  people  are 
 literally  like  suicidal  and  they're
[123:47] doing  crazy  things  and  you  know  to  a  to 
 a  moderate  level  they're  literally  like 
 hurting  themselves  physically  mentally
[123:52] but  to  the  mild  level  where  billions  of 
 people  are  at 
 that  play  in  video  games
[123:58] they're  eating  sugar  watching  porn  how 
 is  that  not  self-harm  when  we  know  it's 
 bad  for  us
[124:04] it's  just  like  a  mild  form  and  it's  not 
 as  like  brutal  and  gory  is  like  you  know 
 like  other  forms  of  it
[124:11] it's  all  self-harm 
 so  let's  rephrase  the  question  because 
 this  is  a  question  I'm  asked  Hamza  but
[124:18] when  do  when  do  we  get  to  self-harm 
 Hamza 
 once  a  week  you  know  can  I  can  I
[124:23] self-harm  once  a  week  I'm  sir  see  how 
 stupid  it  sounds  now 
 you  don't  need  to  you  should  view  those
[124:30] those  bad  habits  when  they  do  happen  you 
 should  view  that  as  like  [ __ ]  my  mental 
 health  was  so  bad  that  and  I  I  disliked
[124:35] myself  so  much  today  that  I  just 
 self-harmed  with  video  games  with  porn 
 with  good  because  that's  not  good  for
[124:41] you  right  like  that's  like  literally 
 harm  for  your  future  self 
 but  you  shouldn't  be  thinking  like  oh
[124:46] yeah  let's  you  know  okay  um Saturday  the 
 26th  let's  schedule  some  self-harm  in 
 the  okay  two  hours  there  we  go  or  maybe
[124:52] I'll  do  some  self-harm  with  my  friends 
 actually  yeah  you  know  at  9  00 p.m  till 
 3am  will  go  out  we'll  all  self-harm
[124:58] together  in  in  the  club  it's  gonna  be  a 
 really  nice  party  we'll  go  self-harm 
 there
[125:04] how  stupid  does  that  sound  if 
 something's  going  to  harm  yourself  if 
 it's  going  to  hurt  you  if  it's  going  to
[125:10] sacrifice  your  future  self's  happiness 
 and  health
[125:15] don't  schedule  it  in  don't  like  just  we 
 need  to  stop  believing  that  those  things
[125:21] need  to  stay  in  our  lives  we've  got  to 
 do  a  little  bit  don't  be  like  my  mother
[125:26] bro  she's  a  she's  a  beautiful  awesome 
 amazing  woman  but  like  they  don't  have 
 that  mindset  from  her  but  you've  you've
[125:31] got  to  self-harm  a  little  bit  you've  got 
 to  eat  some  sugar  you've  got  to  watch 
 some  porn  you've  got  to  take  some  crack
[125:37] right  so  last  and  final  actionable  step 
 destroy  the  idea  that  the  bad  habits  are
[125:43] the  reward  and  just  started  like  you 
 know  just  like  update  your  belief  system 
 and  just  think  yourself  yeah  I'm  not
[125:48] like  a  average  person  the  good  habits 
 are  the  reward  I  have  gave  a  five  part 
 series  it's  five  hours  long  I  gave  it

 mwah
"
IuFMesHkBdA,"[00:00] jeffrey  is  like  the  bottom  80  of  men  who 
 don't  even  try  he  doesn't  exercise  he 
 doesn't  meditate  he  doesn't  practice
[00:05] gratitude  he  doesn't  read  he  doesn't 
 learn  he  doesn't  do  anything  productive 
 but  he  thinks  that  playing  video  games
[00:11] is  productive  he  thinks  that  practicing 
 to  be  an  esports  player  is  productive 
 what  a  dumbass  adonis  on  the  other  hand
[00:16] well  he's  the  best  of  us  he's  the 
 ultimate  man  that  we  aspire  to  be  like 
 he's  the  tribe  leader  the  one  who  gives
[00:22] back  the  most  he  delays  gratification 
 for  the  sake  of  other  people  because 
 adonis  understands  manhood  he
[00:27] understands  what  it  takes  to  feel 
 fulfilled  to  work  on  yourself  to  make 
 sacrifices  to  delay  gratification
[00:32] instead  of  pursuing  pleasure  to  fill 
 your  cup  to  the  brim  so  that  you  can 
 start  filling  up  the  cups  of  the  people
[00:37] that  you  love  two  very  different  lives 
 think  back  to  the  choices  that  you've 
 made  over  the  last  month  which  one  does
[00:43] it  sound  like  a  couple  of  weeks  ago  i 
 messaged  a  guy  on  instagram  his  name  is 
 iman  gadzi  and  you  might  have  seen  a
[00:48] previous  video  where  i  mentioned  him  and 
 how  he  retired  his  mother  at  such  a 
 young  age  i  messaged  him  and  said  that
[00:53] we  should  do  a  podcast  and  he  was  down 
 and  he  said  that  he'd  pay  for  the 
 travels  and  everything  for  me  to  come  to 
 him  and  so  i  was  thinking  oh  like  you
[00:59] know  it'd  be  nice  to  come  to  london  for 
 a  night  or  something  this  muff  calls  me 
 to  be  like  oh  yeah  we'll  we'll  fly  you 
 out  to  business  class  huh  so  he's  in
[01:05] dubai  at  the  moment  slide  me  out 
 business  class  nice  and  fancy  trip  this 
 was  actually  the  first  experience  i've
[01:10] had  of  being  surrounded  by  like  wealth 
 and  like  ultra  successful  young  people
[01:15] so  it's  a  very  eye  opening  experience 
 for  me  and  so  i  lived  with  iman  in  his 
 apartment  for  like  four  days  we  slept  in
[01:20] the  same  bed 
 and  i  gave  me  a  separate  bed  they  slept 
 in  that  one  with  me
[01:26] um  and  i  got  to  see  what  kind  of  person 
 he  was  what  his  lifestyle  was  and  i 
 think  it's  very  interesting  because  we
[01:32] talk  a  lot  on  my  channel  in  like  the  red 
 pill  self-improvement  spaces  of  like 
 getting  into  the  certain  percentage  of
[01:37] men  who  are  like  very  successful 
 attractive  confident 
 i  would  go  as  far  to  say  that  this  right
[01:43] here  is  a  0.1  percent  man  that  isn't  me 
 like  you  know  trying  to  suck  his  dick  or 
 anything  the  truth  is  that  80  percent  of
[01:48] men  are  total  [ __ ]  losers  and  in 
 terms  of  his  wealth  i  believe  he'd  be 
 like  0.0001
[01:53] or  something  especially  for  young  people 
 but  even  in  his  physique  something  that 
 he  doesn't  necessarily  show  off  but  this
[01:58] is  a  well-rounded  man  who  built  up  like 
 a  fantastic  physique  i'm  bigger  than  him
[02:04] and  the  life  set  up  that  he  has  living 
 in  a  fancy  place  that's  very  central  in 
 dubai  he  has  like  popping  social  circles
[02:10] who  goes  on  trips  with  like  supermodels 
 and  does  almost  like  a  mini  done 
 berserian  lifestyle  it's  very 
 interesting  he's  like  a  successful
[02:16] focused  guy  who  does  focus  periods  of 
 monk  mode  for  like  six  months  and  then 
 also  does  like  the  partying  so  he  does
[02:22] the  iconic  work  hard  play  hard  and  since 
 i  got  to  know  him  i  saw  like  a  softer 
 side  to  him  where  we're  talking  about
[02:28] childhood  trauma  and  the  reason  why  it 
 does  all  this  and  so  much  of  his  work 
 and  the  sacrifices  that  he's  made  the
[02:33] dedication  that  he  put  in  revolved 
 around  just  helping  his  mother  because 
 he  saw  her  work  minimum  wage  and  being
[02:39] unemployed  sometimes  being  on  benefits 
 and  that  to  me  is  like  a  very  ambitious 
 like  beautiful  goal  to  have  i  do
[02:45] consider  iman  as  like  a  very 
 well-rounded  young  man  and  also  as  my 
 friend  now  so  i  wanted  to  do  almost  like
[02:50] an  autistic  case  study  to  kind  of 
 explain  to  you  what  i  saw  there  it's 
 specifically  in  terms  of  things  like
[02:55] sexual  market  value  and  i  think  this  is 
 going  to  be  beneficial  to  the  ambitious 
 guys  who  see  this  guy  and  think  yeah  i
[03:02] could  probably  accomplish  the  same 
 things  as  him  so  he  made  most  of  his 
 money  through  a  social  media  marketing
[03:07] agency  and  through  like  investments  like 
 crypto  and  he  is  worth  i  believe  around
[03:12] 10  million  right  now  at  the  age  of  22. 
 when  he  was  around  16  or  17  that's  when 
 he  started  making  like  50  to  100k  profit
[03:18] per  month  and  i  believe  now  he  makes 
 like  a  few  hundred  thousand  profit  per 
 month  from  the  business  plus  investments
[03:24] so  that  already  is  like  a  huge  level  of 
 income  and  what  it  equals  to  in  terms  of 
 sexual  market  value  is  the  life  setup
[03:30] that  he  gets  to  have  from  this  a 
 youtuber  i  really  like  first  man  spoke 
 about  this  where  he  said  that  just 
 numbers  in  your  bank  account  they're  not
[03:36] sexy  it  doesn't  mean  anything  to  be  rich 
 there's  lots  of  like  rich  guys  who  are 
 just  [ __ ]  disgusting  it  doesn't 
 matter  what  the  numbers  are  in  your  bank
[03:42] account  in  terms  of  sexual  market  value 
 in  terms  of  attracting  women  what  truly 
 matters  is  how  that  money  is  used  he-man
[03:47] uses  his  money  by  living  in  like  a  very 
 central  beautiful  like  up-level  place  in
[03:52] dubai  i  remember  when  i  went  to  the  show 
 first  service  that  he  organized  for  me 
 to  get  like  a  chauffeur  ride  and  they
[03:57] asked  me  which  address  i  was  going  to  i 
 told  them  the  place  that  i  was  going  to 
 where  he  lives  and  they  actually  looked 
 like  very  almost  stunned  and  impressed  i
[04:03] get  into  the  show  for  like  the  taxi  tell 
 the  same  guy  he  looks  back  at  me 
 impressed  that's  the  best  place  that's 
 one  of  the  newest  buildings  and  i  ended
[04:09] up  telling  a 
 escort  it's  a  long  story  i ended  up 
 telling  an  escort  where  we  were  staying
[04:15] and  again  as  i  saw  our  eyes  can  light  up 
 i  know  i  didn't  escort  bro  relax  i  think
[04:20] what  i  liked  most  about  the  level  of 
 wealth  that  he  had  was  that  he  used  it 
 in  very  like  sophisticated  like  posh
[04:26] ways  where  for  example  he  had  like  good 
 whiskey  and  vodka  always  ready  for  us  he 
 smoked  cigars  he  was  getting  like  you
[04:32] know  the  fancy  wine  and  he  knew  how  to 
 do  like  the  wine  tasting  thing  where  the 
 waiter  will  bring  you  the  bottle  and  you 
 have  to  like  you  have  to  nod  and  be  like
[04:38] yes  that  that  is  the  bottle  that  i 
 ordered  then  the  waiter  will  pour  like 
 one  sip  into  the  glass  and  you've  got  to
[04:44] do  this  [ __ ]  like 
 swirl  it 
 smell  it  drink  it  and  be  like
[04:49] yes  it  seems  to  be  wine  to  me 
 and  then  on  the  second  night  that  i  was
[04:54] staying  over  in  dubai  and  we  end  up 
 going  to  a  club  with  like  he  knows  like 
 a  bunch  of  people  there  we  walk  in  and 
 he  introduces  me  it's  like  a  couple  of
[05:00] girls  they've  got  like  table  service  and 
 he  is  the  guy  who  like  orders  like  the 
 bottles  you  know  like  the  champagne  and
[05:05] stuff  and  i'm  not  gonna  lie  i  always  and 
 still  somewhat  do  have  that  feeling  of 
 like  oh  what  a  [ __ ]  like  he  just
[05:10] spent  like  two  thousand  dollars  on  like 
 a  couple  bottles  of  champagne  but  it's 
 all  relevant  to  how  much  money  that  you
[05:15] make  so  there  was  a  point  when  he 
 casually  said  something  which  i  think  a 
 lot  of  people  would  see  it  as  like 
 arrogance  and  everything  but  to  me  i  saw
[05:21] it  as  inspiring  he  said  something  like 
 yeah  but  that's  like  20  pounds  to  me 
 when  you  make  so  much  your  barrier  to
[05:26] how  much  you  spend  of  course  increases 
 you  can  live  the  full  on  like  lifestyle 
 deflation  you  know  the  don't  buy  coffee
[05:32] type  of  financial  advice  but  the  truth 
 is  like  if  you're  a  young  guy  and  you've 
 been  financially  free  for  [ __ ]  years
[05:38] and  you're  just  railing  in  money  like 
 why  wouldn't  you  [ __ ]  you  like  i  i 
 think  it's  easy  for  me  and  you  right  now
[05:45] to  be  sat  here  be  like  but  we  i  wouldn't 
 spend  it  on  money  like  that  when  you 
 have  every  need  checked  off  when  you've 
 secured  financial  freedom  years  ago  and
[05:51] your  business  and  your  investments  are 
 just  making  more  and  more  and  more  and 
 more 
 why  not  and  you  know  it's  not  so  much
[05:57] related  to  smv  but  i  think  one  of  the 
 most  beautiful  things  that  iman  has  done
[06:02] is  that  he's  actually  gave  back  so  he 
 retired  his  mother  which  is  a  beautiful 
 story  but  he's  literally  paid  for
[06:08] schools  to  be  built  in  like  less 
 fortunate  countries  you  know  i  didn't 
 even  [ __ ]  like  this  guy  i'm  going  to
[06:13] be  completely  honest  i  told  this  to  to 
 his  face  the  first  time  that  i  actually 
 saw  his  videos  about  two  and  a  half
[06:18] years  ago  i've  told  you  the  same  story 
 previously  that  i  was  down  bad  i  was 
 smoking  weed  all  day  just  before  i  moved 
 back  home  and  when  i  discovered  online
[06:24] income  and  you  know i  was  trying  to  like 
 build  money  online  and  drop  shipping  and 
 all  this 
 his  adverts  would  play  on  youtube  and  i
[06:29] hated  this  [ __ ]  because  i  was  so 
 certain  that  he  was  lying  i  was  so 
 certain  that  it  was  all  bullsh  that
[06:35] there's  no  way  that  this  guy's  made  made 
 so  much  money  when  he's  younger  than  me 
 and  once  i  got  to  know  him  and  i've  seen 
 like  the  random  stuff  he's  done  which  is
[06:41] like  he's  literally  paid  for  [ __ ] 
 schools  there's  more  than  what  meets  the 
 eye  and  so  how  does  this  all  relate  to
[06:47] women  dating  and  having  sex  the  truth  is 
 that  i  went  to  dubai  and  it's  probably 
 what  you  would  have  expected  i  was
[06:52] surrounded  by  definitely  the  most 
 beautiful  like  instagram  model  but  not 
 really  like  the  trashy  instagram  model
[06:58] as  in  like  the  the  model  model  type  of 
 girls  very  interesting  dynamic  that  i 
 saw  which  again  is  kind  of  like  common
[07:04] sense  but  when  you  see  it  it  just  kind 
 of  like  you  know  makes  you  think 
 something  was  that  we  went  to  like  some 
 parties  and  everything  and  it  was  that
[07:09] same  dynamic  that  i  kept  on  scene  which 
 was  like  an  older  guy  with  a  young 
 beautiful  woman  kind  of like  stuff  that 
 chris  from  the  youtube  channel  first  man
[07:15] talks  about  the  male  advantage  but  in 
 terms  of  e-man  and  the  women  that  were 
 around  him  they  looked  beautiful  and 
 they  seemed  like  nice  sophisticated
[07:21] girls  and  he  had  like  an  aura  around  him 
 like  this  magnet  around  him  of  this  like 
 attention  and  like  everyone's  focus  is
[07:26] going  there  and  so  when  i  asked  him  some 
 autistic  questions  like  how  attractive 
 are  the  girls  that  you  get  you  know  what
[07:32] is  dating  like  for  you  and  he's  showing 
 me  like  some  girls  on  like  instagram  i'm 
 not  gonna  lie  like  they  were  like  fully
[07:38] fully  like  the  [ __ ]  like  nines  and 
 tens  like  the  real  nines  and  tons  it  was 
 funniest  he  literally  showed  me  that
[07:43] he's  been  with  like  the  same  girls  that 
 like  famous  rappers  have  been  with  like 
 showing  me  like  that  guy  like  some
[07:49] famous  rapper  like  i  won't  say  his  name 
 or  anything  just  in  cases  but  like 
 famous  rappers  are  following  the  same 
 girl  that  he's  been  with  i  think  one  of
[07:54] the  most  important  parts  of  all  this  was 
 the  level  of  confidence  that  he  gained 
 through  these  experiences  so  there  was  a
[08:00] moment  we  were  speaking  about  like 
 hooking  up  and  you  know  being  a 
 degenerate  and  he  was  saying  that  he
[08:05] doesn't  like  the  idea  of  chasing  women 
 and  being  in  a  club  and  you  know  going 
 out  the  specific  word  to  use  was  that
[08:11] before  he  goes  out  to  like  a  club  or  a 
 party  he  already  knows  which  girl  is 
 going  to  come  back  with  him  here  we  have
[08:16] a  young  man  who's  built  a  certain 
 lifestyle  that  i  think  an  overwhelming 
 majority  of  young  men  actually  somewhat
[08:21] aspire  to  be  like 
 [Music] 
 i  don't  know if  this  video  is  making  him
[08:26] to 
 be  seen  as  a  degenerate 
 you  know  what  i  was  just  kind  of  saying
[08:32] underneath  my  breath  just  then  i  like 
 wasn't  really  expecting  to  put  that  in 
 the  video  where  i  just  thought  to  myself
[08:37] wait  is  this  it's  like  i  like  this  guy 
 what  kind  of  friends  like  is  this  video 
 making  him  seem  like  a  degenerate  like
[08:42] is  it  making  him  seem  like  he's  too  much 
 into  casual  sex  i  think  it's  important 
 that  we  talk  about  that  like  let's  let's 
 be  unfiltered  for  a little  bit  because
[08:48] whilst  i  don't  want  to  offend  him  and 
 say  like  oh  yeah  maybe  he's  doing  like 
 you  know  too  much  casual  the  thing  is
[08:53] yeah  like  if  i'll  be  completely 
 truthfully  honest  like  yeah  i  do  like 
 [ __ ]
[08:58] [ __ ]  light  but  i'm  being  truthfully 
 honest  then  yes  he  is  living  like  a  bit 
 of  like  the  degenerate  casual  sex
[09:03] lifestyle  he  does  say  this  stuff  himself 
 he  made  a  video  where  he  talked  about 
 his  top  life  lessons  and  he  said  that
[09:08] hedonism  does  not  equal  happiness 
 hedonism  is  kind  of  like  the  chase  of 
 pleasure  i  personally  relate  to  that  i
[09:13] think  you  might  be  able  to  but  i  can 
 understand  and  somewhat  relate  that  it 
 would  be  very  difficult  to  abstain  from
[09:20] like  you  know  cashing  in  and  being  able 
 to  sleep  with  girls  when  like  you've 
 reached  that  point  when  a  lot  of 
 attractive  women  do  want  to  be  with  you
[09:27] it's  something  that  i  i'm  not  i  sound 
 like  a  dick  a  lot  of  girls  not  even  me 
 but  it's  something  that  i  have  struggled 
 with  and  i've  spoke  about  on  my  channel
[09:33] over  the  last  few  months  that  i've 
 struggled  with  restraining  from  casual 
 sex  because  as  my  value  goes  up  as  i'm
[09:38] getting  more  confident  and  successful 
 and  wealthy  i'm  getting  more  and  more 
 women  who  are  attracted  to  me  who  are 
 putting  in  the  work  like  they  seem  to  be
[09:44] like  chasing  me  they  watch  me  on  youtube 
 and  everything  and 
 it's  hard  to
[09:49] not 
 indulge  when  you  have  the  capability  to 
 enjoy  a  part  of  life  that  for  me
[09:55] probably  many  years  you  never  really  got 
 to  experience  and  you  know  it's  like  a 
 rare  experience  for  a  guy  to  have  i
[10:00] think  as  young  men  who  are  on 
 self-improvement  and  young  men  of  faith 
 especially  we  have  this  idea  that  the
[10:06] best  case  scenario  is  to  you  know  not  be 
 a  total  degenerate  to  not  be  like  you 
 know  into  rampant  casual  sex  scene  that
[10:11] kind  of  destroys  your  soul  but  the  truth 
 is  that  the  related  unfiltered  truth  is 
 that  the  majority  of  us  don't  really
[10:16] have  the  opportunity  to  do  that  so  it's 
 easy  for  us  to  you  know  say  like  oh  i'm 
 not  going  to  sleep  around  because  i'm
[10:21] christian  but  the  real  truth  is  would 
 women  want  to  sleep  with  you  because 
 once  you  have  that  offer  in  front  of  you
[10:27] i  think  a  man  does  change  and  i  think 
 that's  when  your  values  truly  get  tested 
 and  i'll  be  completely  totally  honest
[10:32] like 
 when  my  values  are  tested  like  that  bro 
 i  often  fail  100  it  does  sometimes  feel
[10:37] like  an  addiction  or  something  that  i 
 feel  somewhat  powerless  to  that  i've 
 expressed  that  i  don't  want  to  be  in
[10:42] like  a  casual  sex  scene  anymore  i  don't 
 want  to  hook  up  with  girls  because  it 
 just  like  it  hurts  my  soul  when  i've
[10:48] somewhat  connected  to  like  girls  that  i 
 don't  want  to  be  with  or  that  i've  just 
 got  an  intimate  with  a  girl  that  like
[10:53] whose  name  i  don't  even  know  and  yet 
 when  the  offer  is  in  front  of  me  when 
 that  girl  is  i'm  looking  up  at  me  bro
[10:58] it's  so  [ __ ]  hard  to  like  not  pursue 
 that  and  i  think  it's  especially  hard 
 when  you  have  experienced  the  yearning
[11:04] for  that  for  so  long  it's  a  very 
 interesting  point  that  being  said  i  have 
 nothing  but  respect  and  gratitude  for
[11:09] iman  he  invited  me  over  to  his  home 
 she'll  be  nothing  but  great  hospitality 
 and  i  got  to  witness  a  side  of  life  that
[11:15] i  might  not  have  experienced  for  a  while 
 the  video  where  he  talks  about  his  life 
 lessons  it's  like  50  minutes  long  i've
[11:20] linked  in  the  description  scroll  down  to 
 the  description  right  now  and  click  on 
 that  top  link  and  you  can  see  his 
 channel  also  share  this  video  to  a
[11:26] friend  who  might  be  interested  in  this 
 topic  do  the  hard  work  especially  when 
 you  don't  feel  like  it
"
6xF0mQbJpig,"[00:00] dopamine  detoxing  changed  my  life 
 forever  but  not  in  the  way  that  you 
 might  think  around  two  years  ago  I  saw
[00:06] the  videos  on  YouTube  popping  off  with 
 all  the  big  YouTubers  making  videos  like 
 a  dopamine  detox  how  to  reset  your  brain
[00:11] in  24  hours 
 and  instantly  I  knew  that  that  wasn't
[00:16] right  I  knew  that  they  were  kind  of 
 lying  I  don't  know  if you  had  the  same 
 feeling  when  you  saw  those  videos  like
[00:21] how  to  reset  your  mind  in  24  hours  I 
 knew  that  it  was  just  click  bait  that 
 these  guys  were  just  titling  this  to  get
[00:26] more  views  and 
 really  you're  not  going  to  reset  your 
 brain  in  24  hours  it's  just  unreasonable
[00:33] but  what  I  knew  for  a  fact  would  work 
 would  be  a  long-term  sustainable
[00:40] reduction  in  bad  dopamines  now  I'm  not  a 
 scientist  and  I'm  sure  there's  someone
[00:45] who  can  critique  this  video  and  make  you 
 know  like  the  phrases  I've  used  on  very 
 scientific  but  the  act  of  dopamine
[00:51] detoxing  is  just  about  stopping  the  bad 
 dopamines  the  bad  habits  that  seem  to
[00:56] give  us  a  bit  of  a  spike  in  enjoyment 
 and  pleasure  today  like  right  now
[01:01] but  make  our  life  worse  in  the  long  run 
 so  this  is  called  like  instant 
 gratification  so  this  comes  from  the  bad
[01:07] things  that  we  do  that  we  know  are 
 pretty  bad  like  for  example  eating  junk 
 food  we  eat  ice  cream  today  we  we  eat
[01:14] ice  cream  and  it  tastes  good  it  makes  us 
 feel  good 
 but  we  kind  of  know  that  later  on  once
[01:21] that  the  pleasure  is  gone  from  our 
 tongue  the  consequences  remain 
 so  ice  cream  feels  good  right  now  but  in
[01:29] the  long  run 
 [ __ ]  up  our  insulin  gives  us  extra  body 
 fat  gives  us  brain  frog  we  know  that
[01:35] it's  not  good  for  us  especially  I  mean 
 unless  if  you're  a  fitness  influencer
[01:40] trying  to  sell  people  programs  and  you 
 tell  them  that  they  can  eat  anything 
 they  want  calories  and  calories  out 
 that's  [ __ ]  as  well  but  that's  a
[01:45] separate  note  I  do  want  to  expand  on 
 that  though  calories  and  calories  out  is 
 absolute  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  and  when  I  got
[01:51] onto  dopamine  detoxing  it  was  the  first 
 time  where  I  actually  took  back  control 
 of  my  diet  that  I  realized  that  the
[01:57] fitness  influencers  kind  of  hijacked  I 
 saw  all  these  like  diseased  sick  like
[02:02] sick  as  in  like  the  illness  sick  Fitness 
 influences  who've  all  got  bingy  in
[02:07] problems  mental  health  problems 
 recommending  Their  audience  to  follow 
 their  diets  whether  you  see  them  eating 
 at  Krispy  Kremes  and  10  000  calorie
[02:13] diets  and  everything  like  you  know  10 
 000 calorie  challenges  where  oh  I  can't 
 wait  to  eat  Krispy  creams  that  they're 
 eating  like  oh  dinner  today  I  just
[02:19] picked  up  like  this  uh  this  Wendy's 
 McNugget  chicken  burger  like  they're 
 just  eating  like  children  bro  and  I  used
[02:24] to  eat  like  that  too 
 that's  a  little  bit  of  a  weird  rant  but
[02:29] it  really  does  fit  in  with  the  topic  of 
 the  the  video  with  dopamine  detoxing 
 because  when  you  eat  the  ice  cream  today
[02:34] or  you  eat  like  a  fitness  influencer  you 
 eat  the  Krispy  Kreme  donuts  and  the  10 
 000  calorie  challenge  like
[02:40] when  you  do  that  stuff  it  feels  good 
 right  now  but  it  makes  your  life  worse 
 in  the  long  run  and  something  that's
[02:45] hard  to  swallow  pill  for  many  young  men 
 this  is  the  case  with  video  games  and
[02:50] anime 
 a  lot  of  the  very  enjoyable  things  that 
 a  lot  of  young  men  are  you  know  very
[02:55] addicted  to  they  feel  awesome  right  now 
 it  feels  nice  it  feels  so  desirable
[03:00] right  now  but  you  have  this  thought  in 
 the  back  of  your  mind  which  kind  of  says 
 like  uh
[03:05] I'm  gonna  miss  my  deadline  because  of 
 this  or  oh  you  know  this  is  two  hours 
 that  I'm  not  gonna  be  studying  for  the
[03:10] exam  that's  coming  up  you  kind  of  know 
 like  we  all  inherently  know  that  video
[03:15] games  anime  and  stuff  is  somewhat  bad 
 for  us  now  we  can  cope  and  say  oh  no  no
[03:20] it's  actually  good  for  us  because  you 
 know  it's  a  story  that  you're  following 
 along  to  or  your  handbag  coordination
[03:26] gets  better  your  memory  skills  get 
 better  and  those  things  are  true 
 but  we're  not  we're  not  playing  video
[03:31] games  so  that  we  can  improve  our  memory 
 we're  playing  it  to  indulge  we're  not 
 watching  anime  for  the  sake  of  like  you
[03:38] know  this  philosophical  mindset  change 
 we're  watching  it  just  because  it  feels 
 good  right  now
[03:44] the  issue  is  that  when  you  do  too  many 
 of  these  habits  that  feel  good  right  now 
 but  make  your  life  worse  in  the  long  run
[03:50] eventually  your  Baseline  happiness  just 
 goes  down  and  down  and  down  and  this  is
[03:55] why  dopamine  detoxing  got  so  popular 
 because  so  many  people's  happiness 
 Baseline  is  just  totally  tanked  and  so
[04:02] when  this  is  you  for  example  if  you  want 
 to  know  some  of  these  symptoms  so  you 
 know  you're  one  of  these  people  with
[04:07] like  a  lowered  happiness  Baseline 
 things  that  used  to  give  you  pleasure
[04:12] and  enjoyment  don't  anymore 
 so  if  you  found  yourself  still  you  know 
 playing  video  games  still  doing  whatever
[04:17] habit  maybe  maybe  watching  porn  and 
 stuff  maybe  in  junk  food  maybe  taking 
 drugs  but  they  don't  give  you  like  the
[04:22] same  high  as  they  used  to 
 video  games  aren't  as  fun  anymore  you 
 need  to  smoke  a  lot  more  weed  to
[04:28] actually  get  like  high  and  when  you  do 
 get  high  it's  not  even  that  nice  anymore 
 the  same  with  really  any  drug  the  first
[04:34] time  you  used  to  start  drinking  alcohol 
 it  was  so  lit  it  was  so  exciting  now 
 it's  like  you  drink  just  to  get  like  to
[04:39] the  old  Baseline  and  you  drink  it's  like 
 it's  not  even  as  fun  it  makes  you  like 
 just  weird  and  groggy  and  angry  and  you
[04:44] get  way  more  of  the  negatives 
 the  Baseline  just  seems  to  decrease  and
[04:51] you're  just  not  as  happy  as  you  used  to 
 be 
 it's  a  very  very  sad  place  to  be  in  and
[04:58] I  fear  that  a  large  part  of  the 
 population  especially  the  young  people 
 are  struggling  with  this  without  really
[05:04] identifying  the  issue  which  is  just 
 instant  gratification  overload  dopamine
[05:09] overload  and  again  this  probably  isn't 
 like  real  scientific  right  maybe  there's 
 someone  who  can  correct  me  with  the 
 science  here
[05:16] the  act  of  dopamine  detoxing  the  way 
 that  I  did  it  I  am  sure  and  I  promise
[05:22] you  it's  better  than  any  other  person 
 who's  ever  spoke  about  the  term  dopamine 
 detoxing  before  because  every  other
[05:27] video  that  I  saw  quite  frankly  I'm  just 
 gonna  be  honest  every  YouTuber  that  I 
 saw  who  made  a  video  on  dopamine
[05:32] detoxing  was  making  one  to  get  views  I 
 could  see  right  through  them  and  maybe 
 you  could  too  but  I  could  see  right
[05:37] through  all  of  the  guys  you've  seen 
 their  YouTube  channels  I  won't  really 
 name  them  [ __ ]  it  you  know  I  will  Andrew
[05:42] Kirby  Nicholas 
 um there  was  a  somewhat  recent  one  where 
 he  got  like  10  million  views  you
[05:47] probably  saw  that  it's  really  nice  like 
 a  camera  photography  and  everything 
 Nicholas 
 um  project  Master  like  there's  another
[05:54] one  there's  another  self-improvement 
 YouTuber  who's  got  400k  nice  videos 
 beautifully  made  videos  amazing
[05:59] storytelling  amazing  editing  quite  a  lot 
 of  dopamine  in  the  the  you  know  like 
 dopamine  in  the  editing  the  fast-paced
[06:06] action  music  and  stuff  yeah  it's  a  it's 
 a  weird  kind  of  way  to  edit  your  video 
 when  you're  talking  about  dopamine 
 detoxing  isn't  it  but  at  least  for  me  I
[06:13] watch  those  videos  and  I  didn't  see  any 
 of  any  authenticity  in  the  creators  of 
 those  videos  and  it  was  clear  to  me  that
[06:18] they  were  making  videos  for  views  and 
 not  actually  to  educate  their  followings 
 and  to  like  actually  help  people  out
[06:24] there  when  I  first  started  making  my 
 videos  or  in  fact  when  I  first  started
[06:29] going  onto  my  own  door  because  I  I  went 
 on  a  dopamine  detox  weeks  before  I 
 actually  ever  spoke  about  it  so  I  didn't
[06:34] like  you  know  see  the  trend  make  a  video 
 and  say  like  oh  I  tried  opening  detoxing 
 for  Thursday  night  I  didn't  do  that  what
[06:39] I  did  was  I  saw  those  videos  I  saw  the 
 trend  I  went  on  a  dopamine  detox  the 
 best  way  possible  I  did  it  myself  I  went
[06:45] on  to  it  in  the  silence  didn't  tell 
 anyone  I  didn't  have  any  subscribers  at 
 the  time  I  had  like  maybe  40  subscribers
[06:51] and  they  were  all  my  family  in  Pakistan 
 and  you  know  my  family  here  in  the  UK 
 I  went  on  dopamine  detox  for  two  weeks
[06:57] two  weeks  and  then  I  made  a  video  about 
 it
[07:03] I  made  a  video  because  it  changed  my 
 life  in  just  two  weeks  literally  in  two 
 weeks  bro  I  went  from  being  just  a
[07:09] normal  guy  who  used  to  watch  porn  and 
 masturbate  I  went  from  being  a  normal 
 guy  who  used  to  smoke  weed  very  often
[07:15] and  you  know  eat  junk  food  and  just 
 waste  time  on  Instagram  and  everything  I 
 decided  I  was  gonna  go  on  a  dopamine
[07:20] detox  with  certain  rules  that  I've  not 
 seen  anyone  else  speak  about  and 
 literally  almost  instantly  it
[07:26] transformed  my  life  and  since  that 
 moment 
 I've  been  more  productive  than  I've  ever
[07:31] been  in  my  entire  life  I've  become  wild 
 like  wildly  successful  I  have  a  company 
 I  have  employees
[07:38] I  can't  believe  how  successful  I've 
 become  and  it  is  largely  due  to  the  fact
[07:43] that  I  went  on  this  dopamine  detox  but 
 that  I  didn't  Follow  The  Click  bait 
 advice  the  thing  is  this  video  is  not
[07:48] going  to get  anywhere  near  the  amount  of 
 views  as  the  other  guys  who've  got 
 fast-mix  edited  and  you  know  like  it's  a 
 video  on  Doppler  come  on  like  I  had  the
[07:54] respect  to  not  put  any  editing  in  this 
 or  in  this  video  because  if  you  want  to 
 go  on  a  dopamine  detox  I'm  not  going  to
[07:59] fry  your  brain  but  like  when  you  see  a 
 video  about  dopamine  detoxing  and  it's 
 these  guys  with  Fast  Cuts  and  everything
[08:04] it's  like  they  clearly  don't  give  a  [ __ ] 
 about  you  do  that  but  I  digress
[08:11] the  way  that  I  did  my  dopamine  detox  was 
 very  different  because  I  did  not  believe
[08:16] the  lies  that  were  being  told  by 
 everyone  else  that  you  could  reset  your 
 brain  in  24  hours  and  all  you  had  to  do
[08:21] was  this  clickbait  challenge  of  like  24 
 hours  of  just  sitting  in  a  room  he  he 
 like  you  know  it  sounds  awesome  it
[08:26] sounds  like  so  exciting  I  knew  that 
 wasn't  going  to  change  anything 
 when  I  went  on  my  dopamine  detox  I  kind
[08:32] of  changed  it  from  dopamine  detox  so 
 almost  like  dopamine  like  reduction
[08:37] what  I  thought  to  myself  okay  I'm  not 
 just  going  to  do  one  day  to  reset  my 
 mind  and  then  just  go  back  to  my  normal
[08:42] [ __ ]  life  because  that  would  be 
 horrible  I  just  suddenly  realized  that 
 doing  those  instant  gratification
[08:47] activities  porn  video  games  junk  food 
 scrolling  on  Instagram  and  everything
[08:53] I  realized  that  I  had  to  just 
 drastically  reduce  them  if  not  cut  them 
 out  completely  for  the  rest  of  my  life
[09:00] I  didn't  see  this  as  a  24  hour  challenge 
 or  a  one  week  little  Adventure 
 I  saw  this  as  literally  the  next  chapter
[09:06] of  my  life  where  I'm  no  longer  the  kind 
 of  person  who  is  still  in  chains  by  the
[09:11] modern  overstimulation  that  we  see  today 
 by  the  short  form  content  on  tick  tock
[09:17] this  is  when  I  discovered  another  term 
 very  similar  to  instant  gratification 
 but  it  was  called  delayed  gratification
[09:24] delayed  gratification 
 comes  from  the  things  that  we  do  that
[09:29] feel  kind  of  hard  and  uncomfortable 
 right  now  but  eventually  they  go  on  to
[09:34] make  our  lives  better  in  the  future 
 and  this  is  the  key  to  self-improvement
[09:39] this  is  the  key  to  happiness  that's  a 
 success  money  whatever  you  want  bro 
 chances  are  whatever  you  want  in  life  I
[09:45] promise  you  it  comes  from  delayed 
 gratification 
 whatever  you  want  to  avoid  in  life  like
[09:50] being  broke  being  like  an  [ __ ]  to 
 your  family  or  to  to  your  partner
[09:56] being  fat  being  unhealthy 
 all  those  things  you  want  to  avoid  bro 
 they're  happening  because  of  instant
[10:02] classification  and  all  of  the  things 
 that  you  want  would  happen  if  you 
 dedicate  yourself  to  delayed
[10:07] gratification  delayed  gratification  is 
 activities  like  for  example  exercising 
 for  a  lot  of  people  you  know  once  you
[10:13] get  to  a  certain  point  fair  enough  but 
 like  for  a  lot  of  people  exercising 
 isn't  actually  fun 
 you  know  like  I'm  90  years  into  the
[10:19] Journey  of  exercising  consistently  of 
 like  going  to  the  gym  and  building  a 
 body  so  it's  fun  for  me  now  but  for  a
[10:24] long  time  it  wasn't  for  a  lot  of  people 
 exercising  actually  not  fun  it's 
 actually  something  that  requires 
 discipline
[10:30] how  interesting  is  that 
 it  doesn't  feel  good  right  now  it  feels 
 bad  right  now
[10:35] and  yet  we  do  it  because  we  know  that  it 
 makes  our  life  better  in  the  long  term
[10:41] we  sacrifice  the  short  term  for  the  long 
 term  and  if  there  is  one  phrase  that
[10:47] defines  successful  people  rich  people 
 athletes 
 it  is  that  they  sacrifice  the  short  term
[10:52] for  the  long  term 
 if  there's  one  phrase  that  defines
[10:58] overweight  people  broke  people  angry 
 emotional  people  [ __ ]
[11:03] it's  that  they  sacrifice  the  long  term 
 for  the  short  term
[11:08] now  you  understand  this  and  you  you 
 probably  agree  with  the  concept  here  but 
 there  will  be  something  in  the  instant
[11:14] gratification  activity  like  bucket  that 
 you  don't  want  to  give  up  that  you  will
[11:19] fight  tooth  and  nail  for  that  you  will 
 save  with  Souls 
 certainty  is  not  instant  gratification
[11:25] you  will  say  perhaps  this  video  games 
 maybe  it's  anime  it's  one  of  those 
 usually  for  young  men  nope  no  no no
[11:30] video  games  is  absolutely  fine  one  hour 
 at  the  end  of  the  day  is  still  fine  you 
 it's  absolutely  fine  the  thing  is  a  lot
[11:37] of  guys  say  that 
 I  at  least  for  me  I  personally  wasn't 
 able  to  live  like  that
[11:42] if  you  enjoy  video  games  as  much  as  I 
 did  I  don't  believe  that  you  could  ever 
 play  it  when  I  was  a  lot  of  people  have
[11:48] told  me  they  only  play  one  hour  a  day  at 
 the  end  of  the  hard  day  and  it's  not 
 like  that  bad  because  they've  done  all 
 their  work  and  stuff  and  I  just  think
[11:53] either  maybe  they're  mistaken  maybe  it's 
 not  one  hour  maybe  it's  more  like  two  to 
 three  and  if  it  is  genuinely  one  hour
[11:59] they're  probably  not  enjoying  it  that 
 much  because  I  really  enjoyed  video 
 games  a  lot  I  have  over  10  000  hours  on
[12:05] RuneScape  3  000  hours  on  like  other 
 games 
 there's  no  way  I  was  playing  one  hour  a
[12:10] day  bro  it's  just  not  gonna  happen  for 
 me  video  games  it  was  a  very  like  zero 
 or  a  hundred  and  there's  a  lot  of  other
[12:16] guys  who  feel  the  exact  same  way  so  we 
 had  to  cut  it  out  completely  maybe 
 you're  someone  who  can  manage  it
[12:21] absolutely  perfectly  fine 
 maybe  still  even  then  just  consider 
 cutting  it  out  just  because  it  is
[12:28] inherently  something  that's  bad  for  you 
 that's  addictive  that's  time  consuming 
 and  you  might  say  well  you  know  oh  well
[12:34] you  know  like  but  what  if  I  just  want  to 
 have  balance  in  my  life 
 and  you  could  but  then  this  isn't  really
[12:40] the  video  for  that  this  dopamine 
 detoxing  is  a  very  extreme  thing  to  do 
 it's  like  you  want  to  change  you  want  to
[12:45] have  a  new  chapter  of  your  life  you're 
 tired  of  being  just  like  a  normal  person 
 and  you  want  to  become  the  one  percent
[12:50] you  want  to  get  to  the  point  of  your 
 success  and  your  wealth  and  your 
 richness  that  you're  making  so  much
[12:55] money  that  you  can  help  your  family 
 through  these  hard  financial  times 
 because  that's  not  coming  when  you're 
 playing  one  hour  of  video  games  a  day
[13:00] that's  probably  not  gonna  happen
[13:06] if  you  have  that  level  of 
 need
[13:11] of  burning  desire  to  like  really  be 
 productive 
 you  need  to  be  extreme
[13:18] dopamine  detoxing  is  Extreme  and  it 
 seems  to 
 offend  and  insult  the  people  who  prefer
[13:25] to  have  a  balanced  lifestyle 
 and  I  don't  say  this  to  be  insulting  but 
 I  don't  I  know  a  couple  of  quite  a  fair
[13:32] amount  of  like  successful  people  now  you 
 see  how  many  subscribers  I've  got  like 
 and  obviously  I've  done  networking  with 
 other  people  and  everything  I  don't  know
[13:39] really 
 that  many  successful  people 
 who  aren't  extreme
[13:45] the  people  who  want  to  live  a  balanced 
 lifestyle  often  have  like  balanced 
 results  as  well  and  they  they  make
[13:50] enough  to  like  live  but  to  still 
 struggle  in  these  times
[13:56] they've  got  like 
 and  okay  physique  they're  not  muscular 
 they're  not  really  in  in  great  shape
[14:01] they're  just  kind  of  in  shape  they're 
 not  they're  not  out  of  shape  so  yeah 
 they  could  be  nice  to  live  a  Monday  in
[14:06] life 
 you  can  see  I'm  not  a  fan  of  that  maybe 
 someone  else's  and  maybe  they'll  be  like 
 yeah  you  know  like  balance  is  amazing
[14:11] I'd  rather  be  balanced  than  just  have 
 like  you  know  17  body  fat  and  and  not
[14:17] that  much  muscle  because  that  sounds 
 amazing  but 
 I  don't  know  maybe  I'm  just  being 
 offensive  but
[14:23] so  the  way  that  I  did  my  dopamine  detox 
 them  was  that  I
[14:28] thought  to  myself  I'm  not  going  to  cut 
 out  all  of  the  instant  gratification 
 because  if  I  do  eventually  I'll  go  back
[14:33] to  it  so  what  I  said  to  myself  was  that 
 I  would  do  a  drastic  reduction  in  the 
 instant  gratification  activities
[14:40] junk  food  you  know  porn  and  everything 
 and  I  would  you  know  somewhat  try  to  cut 
 it  out  completely  but  I  wouldn't  force
[14:46] that  I  wouldn't  see  myself  as  a  failure 
 if  I  couldn't  cut  it  out  completely  I 
 would  just  drastically  try  to  reduce  it
[14:52] and  likewise  very  very  importantly  which 
 a  lot  of  these  other  guys  that  when  I 
 was  watching  all  these  videos  it  just
[14:57] like  you  can  see  I'm  still  kind  of 
 pissed  off  about  the  the  dopamine  detox 
 videos  because  I  don't  think  they  really
[15:02] helped  me  or  anyone  else  maybe  I'm  I'm 
 wrong  here  but  they  they  were  literally
[15:07] just  entertaining  videos  to  watch  which 
 kind  of  defeats  the  points  of  dopamine 
 detoxing  I  didn't  find  any  good
[15:12] education  from  them  what  I  realized  was 
 that  dopamine  detoxing  is  not  just  about 
 you  know  reducing  or  eliminating  the  bad
[15:19] dopamines  or  the  instant  gratification 
 activities  put  on  video  games  and 
 everything  it's  also  likewise  equally  as
[15:25] important  if  not  more  important  of 
 drastically  increasing  the  delayed 
 gratification  activities
[15:31] because  the  reason  like  we  don't  we're 
 not  just  cutting  out  pleasure  for  the 
 sake  of  it  that  might  be  a  good  practice
[15:36] to  do  for  you  know  a  sense  of  stoicism 
 but  we're  cutting  our  pleasure  for 
 purpose
[15:41] there  needs  to  be  a  purpose  for  this 
 dopamine  detox  so  what  is  the  purpose 
 for  me 
 it  was  to  level  up  in  this  in  this
[15:46] business  at  first  when  I  first  started 
 this  channel  two  years  ago  it  was  solely 
 just  a  business  it's  become  a  global
[15:51] movement  of  young  men  who  have  taken 
 back  control  of  their  lives  now  but  at 
 the  time  in  May  2020  when  I  really
[15:56] started  uploading  to  this  channel  I 
 literally  just  did  it  just  because  I 
 just  wanted  some  money  because  I  was 
 broke  and  I  just  moved  back  home  to  my
[16:01] parents  house  and  I  just  wanted  to  make 
 like  1  000  pounds  a  month  online  and  um 
 that  was  what  I  began  to  spend  my  time
[16:08] with  what  I  did  which  I'm  still 
 impressed  by  having  been  like  literally 
 just  a  procrastinator  for  all  of  my  life
[16:14] you  know  not  a  productive  person  when  I 
 got  onto  this  dopamine  detox  what  I  did 
 which  absolutely  blew  my  mind  was  I
[16:20] wrote  down  a  timetable  like  a  schedule 
 for  when  I  would  do  things  and  I  still
[16:26] have  a  variation  of  that  on  my  phone 
 which  I'll  just  briefly  show  you  you 
 don't  need  to  like  see  it  exactly  and 
 you  know  like  pause  the  video  to  just
[16:32] because  I'll  explain  it  to  you  so  it's 
 not  like  um  that  important  of  what  I've 
 wrote  down  it's  just  the  concept  of  it
[16:37] let  me  just  find  it  for  you  here 
 so  this  is  this  is  what  it  looks  like
[16:42] I'll  I'll  read  it  out  to  you  what  I  have 
 on  there  doesn't  matter  do  you  literally 
 just  need  to  see  a  glimpse  of  how  the
[16:48] structure  is  right  so  what  what's  on 
 there  doesn't  matter  all  the  structure 
 that  matters  like  all  you  need  to  pay 
 attention  to  is  on  the  left  hand  side
[16:53] there's  the  time  and  on  the  uh  the  right 
 hand  side  there's  like  the  tasks  that 
 I'll  do
[16:58] that's  it  you  don't  need  to  see  what 
 I've  put  there  because  it's  very 
 individual  for  each  each  person  but  what
[17:03] it  was  that  every  single  day 
 I  just  follow  as  best  as  I  could  this 
 timetable  5  a.m  wake  up  5  30  morning
[17:10] routine  6  a.m  gym  9  A.M  post  workout 
 meal  9  30  record  like  every  single  day
[17:15] following  the  exact  same  thing  and  of 
 course  you  know  your  day  changes  and  you 
 know  life  gets  in  the  way  that's  fine 
 but  my  idea  was  that  if  I  write  down  my
[17:21] absolute  ideal  10  out  of  10  productive 
 crazy  productive  day
[17:26] and  I  try  and  follow  it  as  best  as  I  can 
 and  I  end  up  following  it 
 for  50  of  the  day
[17:32] that's  still  incredibly  better  than  my 
 usual  days  when  I  would  just  wake  up  and
[17:37] smoke  weed  isn't  it 
 if  this  was  my  perfect  day  and  I  only 
 followed  it  for  30  of  the  day  you  know
[17:43] it's  hard  to  quantify  but  let's  just 
 take  it  30  of  the  day  that  would  still 
 be  better  than  the  normal  days  I  was
[17:48] having  before  my  dopamine  detox  but  now 
 I've  kind  of  made  the  rule  that  you  know 
 I'm  gonna  try  my  best  to  stay  away  from
[17:53] the  instant  gratification  activities 
 that  were  taking  so  much  of  my  time 
 I  suddenly  had  nothing  else  to  do  than
[17:59] to  just  follow  this  timetable  now  again 
 of  course  there  was  times  when  like  I 
 just  did  the  bad  things  you  know  I  spent
[18:04] an  extra  like  hour  by  accident  just 
 watching  stupid  YouTube  videos  or  you 
 know  some  back  then  two  years  ago  like  I
[18:10] was  I  was  on  tindered  like  trying  to  get 
 laid  and  stuff  so  I'd  be  on  Tinder  just 
 spending  time  on  Tinder  messaging  a 
 bunch  of  girls  and  going  on  to  like
[18:16] um  text  messages  and  everything 
 but  largely  like  I  followed  it  as  best
[18:21] as  I  could  and  I  started  to  see  insane 
 progress  not  even  in  the  business  and
[18:26] you  know  the  work  I  was  doing  here  and 
 the  money  that  I  was  making  but  also  in 
 my  physique  but  best  of  all  in  my  mental
[18:32] health 
 I  didn't  realize  just  how  much  the 
 instant  gratification  activities  like
[18:37] video  games  this  is  why  I'm  so  heavily 
 against  video  games  even  though  I  know 
 how  fun  they  can  be  I  didn't  realize  how
[18:43] much  it  was  negatively  affecting  my 
 mental  health  up  until  I  fully  stopped 
 it  was  like  once  I  fully  stopped  and  I
[18:48] stopped  coping  and  saying  oh  you  know 
 what  if  I  just  like  play  a  little  bit 
 what  if  I  just  make  a  new  account  on 
 RuneScape  and  I  start  like  killing  other
[18:53] people  you  know  like  I  go  do  PVP  and 
 what  if  I  try  this  and  this  and  this 
 once  I  fully  stopped  coping
[18:59] I  had  such  a  boost  to  my  mental  health 
 because  something's  just  clicked  you
[19:04] might  not  be  able  to  relate  to  this  if 
 you  still  play  video  games  but  a  lot  of 
 the  guys  who  have  quit  will  relate 
 something  clicked  I  was  like  oh
[19:11] real  life  is  really  like  a  video  game 
 why  have  I  been  leveling  up  for
[19:16] thousands  of  hours  in  the  virtual  world 
 when  I  can  go  level  up  in  real  life
[19:21] suddenly  I  became  so  much  happier  just 
 from  this  realization  of  just  saving
[19:26] time  and  actually  wanting  to  improve  in 
 real  life  instead  of  just  putting  all  my 
 focus  into  improving  in  a  video  game
[19:31] what  I  realized  was  that  even  playing 
 one  hour  a  day  wasn't  okay  playing  one
[19:36] hour  a  day  wasn't  fine  because  with  just 
 one  hour  a  day  it's  like  I  would 
 displace  some  of  my  masculine  urge  to
[19:42] improve  and  level  up  into  the  game 
 instead  I  didn't  want  that  to  sap  my 
 urge  to  level  up  so  when  I  completely
[19:48] stopped  playing  video  games  it's  like  I 
 still  had  this  urge  on  this  mask  if 
 you're  a  man  you  have  this  there's
[19:53] masculine  desire  to  like  progress  to 
 make  to  level  up  when  that's  not  being 
 stolen  from  you  from  video  games  it's
[19:58] like  suddenly  just  automatically  you 
 start  making  progress  in  real  life  it's 
 just  how  it  works  being  a  man  if  you
[20:03] have  no  distractions  as  a  man  you 
 literally  will  just  stop  making  progress 
 but  when  you  have  distractions  when  you
[20:09] have  video  games  when  you  have  anime 
 when  you  have  porn  your  focus  is  just 
 diverse  everywhere  and  suddenly  your
[20:14] real  life  just  goes  to  shambles
[20:20] another  thing  which  was  a  huge  one  which 
 is  relevant  right  now  was  my  diet  for  a
[20:25] long  time  I  was  a  binge  eater  for 
 literally  most  of  my  life  Benji  incomes 
 from  like  poor  mental  health  I  had  a
[20:32] very  like  traumatic  abusive  childhood 
 and  even  more  sort  of  like  traumatic 
 experiences  as  an  adult  which  um
[20:38] you  know  kind  of  like  [ __ ]  up  my 
 mental  space  and  I  had  like  extreme 
 anxiety  and  this  isn't  one  of  those
[20:44] cases  of  you  know  like  someone  telling 
 you  they've  got  mental  health  issues 
 yeah  like  I  wasn't  taking  medications 
 for  it  but  like  I  did  because  I  didn't
[20:49] even  know  like  I  wasn't  like  identifying 
 as  someone  with  mental  health  issues  at 
 the  time  it  was  only  afterwards  when  I
[20:55] realized  what  it  was  but  yeah  like  I  had 
 extreme  anxiety  I  had  like  you  know  um
[21:00] like  intrusive  violent  thoughts  so 
 imagine  I'd  be  going  about  my  day  and 
 just  suddenly  get  a  violent  thought 
 about  hurting  someone  and  I'd  visually
[21:06] see  myself  like  hurting  like  someone 
 who's  being  racist  to  me 
 that  was  what  happened  to  me  like  the
[21:12] traumatic  incident  when  I  was  um  19 
 years  old  I  had  like  two  racist  guys 
 like  fully  like  followed  me  onto  like  a
[21:19] train  and  try  and  hurt  me  and  um maybe 
 you  can  relate  us  not  that  story  exactly
[21:24] but  like  maybe  you  can  relate  to  this 
 feeling  of  just  getting  random  thoughts 
 which  are  very  negative  very  violent
[21:30] very  aggressive  very  self 
 uh  deprecating
[21:35] that  was  happening  to  me  so  often  for 
 most  of  my  life 
 and  it  was  just  you  know  I  was  just
[21:40] living  like  it  I  didn't  realize  that  you 
 know  that  was  it  was  never  a  I  was  never 
 aware  that  I  was  like  a  real  mental
[21:46] health  problem  because  I  was  just  always 
 lived  like  that  and  it  was  only  when  I 
 went  on  this  dopamine  detox  and  I  had  so
[21:51] much  free  time  and  energy  in  my  mind 
 wasn't  going  on  so  you  know  these 
 platforms  and  video  games  and  and  um
[21:56] Instagram  and  everything  suddenly  I  then 
 had  the  awareness  to  just  ask  myself 
 again  like  yeah  like  why  is  that
[22:02] happening 
 and  so  I  started  researching  it 
 I  started  learning  online  about  mental
[22:08] health  and  suddenly  like  I  actually 
 gained  like  a  very  good  understanding  of 
 depression  and  anxiety  and  you  know 
 these  Concepts  which  I  talk  about  today
[22:13] like  dopamine  detox  and 
 instagramification  delayed  gratification 
 I  got  like  a  pretty  good  understanding
[22:18] of  it  and  suddenly  I  just  realized  like 
 oh  mental  health  is  a  skill  that  I  can 
 level  up  and  now  that  I  have  time  and
[22:24] energy  and  you  know  my  dopamine  levels 
 are  like  getting  back  to  normal  I 
 actually  had  the  desire  to  literally
[22:30] spend  time  meditating  and  journaling  and 
 just  learning  about  mental  health  I 
 remember  this  like  I  literally  just  went
[22:36] on  Google  and  started  searching  for  like 
 mental  health  lectures  and  everything 
 and  I  learned  quite  a  lot  like  that  and
[22:41] to  think  that  20  I'm  25  but  like  23  year 
 old  me  was  spending  time  watching  Mental
[22:47] Health  University  lectures 
 just  blows  my  mind  because  for  most  of 
 my  life  like  I  wasn't  into  education  I
[22:53] always  thought  that  that  was  a  gay  I 
 always  thought  I  was  like  weird 
 I  didn't  even  plan  to  show  you  this  but
[22:58] bro  right  next  to  me  I  have  I  have  a 
 book  How  to  Win  Friends  and  Influence 
 People  like  I  literally  didn't  I  didn't 
 think  I'd  show  you  and  I  just  had  it
[23:03] next  to  me  like  I  love  learning  now 
 one  of  the  best  parts  of  being  on  the
[23:08] dopamine  detox  is  that  you  you  just  like 
 to  do  the  good  habits  because  you  aren't
[23:14] doing  the  bad  ones 
 the  reason  why  I  enjoy  learning  so  much 
 and  reading  books  so  much  is  because
[23:19] it's  one  of  the  most  fun  things  that  I 
 do  if  suddenly  I  played  one  hour  of 
 video  games  a  day  if  suddenly  I  went  on
[23:25] Tick  Tock  or  Instagram  or  watch  porn 
 those  things  would  be  so  so  fun  and
[23:30] enjoyable  even  though  you  know  we  say 
 those  things  about  the  thing  is  like 
 they  are  [ __ ]  enjoyable  they  are 
 extremely  addictive  aren't  they  they're
[23:35] so  pleasurable  to  like  our  sort  of 
 animal  brain  that  then  you  can't  even
[23:40] enjoy  the  the  smaller  things  in  life 
 like  just  reading  a  book 
 that's  exactly  what  happened  with  my
[23:46] diet  I  fried  like  my  if  that's  the 
 scientific  term  of  like  my  dopamine 
 receptors  in  terms  of  my  diet
[23:52] for  a  long  time  I  was  just  eating  like  a 
 child  like  junk  food  snacks  sweet
[23:57] Pizza  you  know  just  quick  stuff  that  you 
 you  could  just  like  throw  in  quickly 
 because  you  were  like  being  lazy  that's
[24:02] all  I  really  ate  for  most  of  my  life 
 and  suddenly  you  know  I  wasn't
[24:07] technically  allowed  to  eat  that  anymore 
 because  I  was  on  this  dopamine  detox  I 
 can't  really  eat  like  you  know  junk  food
[24:12] so  I've  got  to  start  eating  clean 
 again  I  had  the  desire  to  learn  and  so
[24:17] for  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  started 
 to  research  nutrition 
 so  I  started  to  what's  like  nutritional
[24:22] lectures  and  I  realized  what  food 
 actually  does  to  you  and  this  literally 
 blew  my  mind  because  I  had  been  into
[24:28] fitness  you  know  weightlifting  building 
 muscle  for  years  and  I'd  always  followed 
 the  fitness  influencers  like  the
[24:33] YouTubers  I  saw  and  it  always  listened 
 to  them  and  they  told  me  yeah  you  know 
 calories  in  calories  out  just  eat 
 whatever  you  want  better  protein  carbs
[24:38] and  fats  and  stuff  so  I've  did  that  you 
 know  If  It  Fits  your  Macros  I  did  that 
 way  you  like  you  just  track  the  macros
[24:43] on  this  app  called  MyFitnessPal  I  always 
 did  that  and  thought  yeah  well  that's 
 what  everyone's  saying
[24:48] then  when  I  started  to  actually  research 
 nutrition  and  I'm  not  gonna  lie  I  only 
 need  to  research  there  for  a  couple  of 
 hours
[24:53] I  realize  that  none  of  these  Fitness 
 influencers  actually  knew  anything  what 
 they  were  talking  about  because  this
[24:58] idea  that  like  oh  calories  in  calories 
 are  all  calories  are  the  same  like
[25:03] once  you  do  20  minutes  of  research  onto 
 nutrition 
 and  you  hear  the  same  phrase  like  oh
[25:09] calories  in  calories  out  you'll  just 
 think  yeah  they're  actually  stupid  I 
 don't  say  that  to  be  horribly  offensive
[25:14] like  they're  actually  like  you  know  I'm 
 gonna  be  a  little  bit  insulting  they're 
 actually  brain  dead  some  of  these
[25:19] Fitness  influences  they've  got  to  be 
 stupid  to  believe  calories  in  calories 
 out
[25:24] they  are  but  it's  physics  the  the  laws 
 the  human  body  does  not  work  with 
 physics
[25:29] it's  biology  it's  biochemistry 
 what  actually  matters  is  what  this
[25:34] nutrition  is  doing  to  our  hormones  none 
 of  the  fitness  influencers  know  anything 
 more  than  just  our  calories  and  like  736
[25:41] grams  of  protein 
 so  I  started  researching  this  and  I 
 realized  that  all  my  life  I  was  eating 
 the  stuff  that  like  these  guys  promoted
[25:47] to  me  you  know  Krispy  Kreme  donuts  and 
 everything  and  I  realized  that  oh  that
[25:52] stuff's  not  actually  healthy  for  you 
 just  because  these  Fitness  influences 
 with  muscle  who  are  lean  are  showing  it
[25:57] doesn't  mean  that  it's  healthy  I 
 realized 
 whatever  you  eat  just  has  an  effect  on
[26:02] your  hormones  and  when  you  eat  shitty 
 junk  food 
 your  hormones  get  [ __ ]
[26:08] and  your  intelligence  literally  drops 
 you  you  literally  like  become  less  smart
[26:13] the  worst  junk  food  that  you  eat 
 I  was  watching  all  this  nutritional  like
[26:19] data  and  you  know  this  research  and 
 lectures  and  stuff  just  thinking  like  I 
 wish  someone  told  me  this  message  after
[26:25] I've  just  I've  suffered  from  years  of 
 binge  eating  when  I  turned  into  like  a 
 weight  lifter  going  to  the  gym  trying  to
[26:30] get  protein  and  just  like  eating  carbs 
 and  cereal  because  that's  what  all  these 
 Fitness  YouTubers  were  telling  me  to  do 
 eat  cereal  before  my  workout  and  stuff
[26:36] then  I've  learned  that  oh  yeah  sugar 
 skyrockets  your  insulin
[26:41] insulin  is  a  hormone  that  we  don't  want 
 that  high  and  when  your  insulin  goes  up 
 your  leptin  hormone  goes  down  and  when
[26:47] your  left  and  hormone  goes  down 
 you  don't  feel  as  full  like  leptiness 
 like  the  hormone  that
[26:53] that  is  created  in  your  body  to  signal 
 that  you're  done  eating  and  you're  full 
 when  you  eat  sugar  your  insulin  goes  up
[27:00] your  leptin  goes  down  when  you  eat  sugar 
 that  literally  means  that  you  literally 
 feel  less  full  and  that  causes  you  to 
 overeat
[27:06] there's  no  Fitness  YouTuber  out  there 
 who  knew  this  show  like  they're  just 
 eating  [ __ ]  cereal  and  stuff  and
[27:11] wondering  why  they  keep  binge  eating 
 after  all  of  their  like  Fitness 
 competitions  and  stuff
[27:16] the  the  one  like  you  know  they  get  a  lot 
 of  views  so  you  know  you  can  say  it's  a 
 business  Advantage  but  you  see  these
[27:21] Fitness  YouTubers  do  a  10  000  calorie 
 challenge  every  month  they're  not  doing 
 it  because  of  like  oh  it's  a  good  thing
[27:26] to  do  they're  not  doing  it  because  of 
 like  science  or  some  [ __ ]  they're  doing 
 it  because  they  can't  control  themselves 
 and  so  they  cope  and  they're  like  oh
[27:31] well  yeah  I  really  want  to  binge  eat 
 because  I've  got  bad  mental  health  and 
 they're  eating  [ __ ]  food  oh  well  I  may
[27:36] as  well  do  a  10  000  calorie  challenge 
 so  along  the  same  time 
 not  only  did  I  drastically  improve  my  my
[27:43] diets  my  physique  just  transformed  in 
 front  of  my  eyes  I  had  like  somewhat  of
[27:48] a  like  a  fairly  okay  physique  for 
 someone  who  had  been  training  for  a 
 while 
 but  it  was  around  this  time  in  my
[27:54] dopamine  detox  days  where  I  fully  just 
 got  shredded  for  the  first  time  ever  and
[27:59] it  was  hard  for  me  to  gain  extra  fat 
 with  the  diet  that  I  went  on  bro  the 
 diet  that  I  went  on  and  the  workout
[28:05] routine  that  I  went  on  it  became  so  hard 
 for  me  like  it  literally  was  hard  for  me
[28:10] to  gain  weight  I  shredded  all  the  fat 
 that  I  had  packed  on  lean  muscle  mass 
 which  all  these  Fitness  YouTubers  said
[28:16] it  was  impossible  to  gain  leading  muscle 
 mouth  that's  exactly  what  happened 
 why 
 because  I  started  eating  clean
[28:24] shouldn't  blow  your  mind  but  literally 
 for  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  started 
 eating  clean  I  literally  just  ate  meat
[28:30] and  vegetables  and  like  the  most  like 
 unhealthy  thing  that  I  ate  was  like  oats
[28:35] oh  it's  not  even  like  you  know  they're 
 quite  heavily  processed  because  they're 
 like  obviously  not  natural  ingredients 
 but  they're  not  really  that  unhealthy
[28:41] that  was  it 
 just  meat  and  vegetables  that's  pretty 
 much  all  I  was  just  eating
[28:47] no  longer  eating  cereal  no  longer 
 ordering  fast  food  like  all  these 
 YouTubers  who  say  oh  you  know  I  just
[28:52] ordered  from  like  KFC  or  some  [ __ ]  not 
 no  longer  doing  that  lean  meat 
 vegetables  got  shredded  got  strong
[29:00] my  athleticism  kicked  up  into  overdrive 
 for  the  first  time  my  life  actually  was 
 able  to  like  run  control  my  breathing
[29:06] whilst  running 
 do  like  a  whole  new  style  of  exercise 
 called  the  gymnastic  rings  and  I  did
[29:11] those  workouts  disciplined  skyrocketed 
 alongside  that  but  switching  over  to
[29:16] this  diet  had  such  a  huge  impact  onto  my 
 brain 
 I  have  a  slight  fear  that  I'll  get
[29:22] canceled  I  probably  won't  because  we're 
 29  minutes  into  this  video  probably 
 won't 
 maybe  it's  a  bit  of  a  conspiracy  theory
[29:28] but  like 
 the  modern  diets  is  extremely  extremely
[29:34] silly  the  modern  diet  that  we  have  the 
 average  person  eats
[29:40] what  they  think  isn't  that  bad 
 you  don't  and  you  know  the  thing  is  most
[29:45] people  with  diets  they  only  think  about 
 what  it  does  to  their  body  don't  they  of 
 how  they  look  how  much  fat  they've
[29:51] gained  that's  it  that's  most  people 
 thinking 
 you  realize  that  what  you  eat  has  a  huge
[29:56] impact  on  your  brain  and  perhaps  the 
 single  greatest  reason  why  you  feel 
 tired  while  you  feel  like  you  don't  have
[30:02] energy  while  you  feel  like  a  struggle 
 with  you  know  learning  something  in  your 
 studies  or  doing  some  work  and  you  while
[30:08] you  procrastinate  you've  always  been 
 thinking  it's  about  like  productivity 
 tips  that  you  need  to  try  and  do  the 
 Pomodoro  Technique  that  it's  about  like
[30:14] you  need  to  incentivize  yourself  to  like 
 um  sit  down  and  do  25  minutes  of  work
[30:19] it's  not  that  bro 
 the  reason  why  most  people  can't  do  any 
 good  work  the  reason  why  most  people's
[30:24] brains  are  just  not  that  good  is  because 
 of  their  diets  because  they're  just 
 eating  shitty  Western  food  like
[30:29] processed  junk  food  high  sugar 
 refined  food  trans  fats  fast  food
[30:34] McDonald's  and  [ __ ] 
 I  switched  over  to  just  a  clean  diet  of
[30:40] literally  just  meat  and  vegetables  and 
 for  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  stopped 
 procrastinating  I  built  a  successful
[30:46] business  I  went  from  being  on  benefits 
 of  government  welfare  you  don't  realize 
 how  low  down  like  how  much  of  a  rut  I
[30:51] was  in  when  I  first  discovered  the 
 dopamine  detox  Pro  I  was  on  government 
 welfare
[30:57] I  switched  over  to  the  dopamine  detox 
 Lifestyle  the  diet  the  hard  work  one 
 year  later  I  started  making  10  000
[31:03] pounds  per  month 
 a  year  after  that  now  we're  on  about
[31:08] 50  and  it's  drastically  going  to 
 increase  and  I  will  say  that  again 
 that's  per  month
[31:24] My  Hope  with  this  video  is  that  it 
 spreads  out 
 and  as  someone  who  needs  to  hear  it
[31:29] watches  it  the  entire  way  through 
 because  dopamine  detoxing  changed  my
[31:34] life  forever  and  I  didn't  realize  it  was 
 as  simple  as  just  stopping  the  bad
[31:39] habits  the  instant  gratification  and 
 just  doing  the  good  habits  you  know  you 
 always  have  that  desire  through  your
[31:44] life  to  like  yeah  you  know  stop  eating 
 as  much  junk  food  maybe  yeah  go  and 
 exercise  maybe  read  some  books  you've 
 always  kind  of  got  it  but  you  never
[31:50] really  take  it  like  that  seriously  you 
 always  kind  of  skip  it  and  I  mean  you're 
 always  just  like  it's  just  someone  in
[31:55] everyone's  mind  to  you  know  maybe  I'll 
 go  to  the  gym  once  a  week  or  so  you  know 
 everyone  kind  of  knows  what  they  should
[32:00] do  what  they  shouldn't  do  but  you  never 
 really  take  it  that  seriously  most 
 people  say  like  they're  gonna  go  on  a
[32:05] diet  and  then  they  don't  stick  to  it  and 
 then  they  just  go  back  to  eating 
 whatever  most  people  do  the  exact  same
[32:10] with  like  just  content  consumption  just 
 watching  over  stimulating  content  shorts
[32:15] tick  tocks  and  everything
[32:20] but  the  point  that  it  got  me  to 
 from  just  a  simple  Act  of  stopping  the
[32:27] bad  habits  and  starting  the  good 
 I  can't  believe  that  I've  got  to  this
[32:32] position  in  life  and  I'm  certainly  not 
 the  end  I'm  not  as  like  successful  as  I 
 want  to  be  this  people  who  are  so  much 
 more  successful  and  Wealthy  than  I  am
[32:37] and  I've  become  like  friends  with  some 
 guys  who  are  very  very  wealthy  and  so
[32:42] that  you  know  they're  impressing  me  and 
 I  want  to  get  to  their  level 
 but  the  fact  I  think  that  like  I've  only 
 been  like  this  for  two  years  I've  only
[32:48] been  productive  like  I  wasn't  productive 
 for  all  of  my  life  out  like  even  I  went 
 to  University  but  I  never  studied  I  was
[32:53] like  I  always  just  like  wouldn't  mind 
 one  day  you  know  the  teacher  the 
 professor  is  saying  something  I'm  not 
 even  focusing  imagine  being  in  class  the
[32:59] teachers  you  know  telling  you  to  do  [ __ ] 
 or  the  teachers  like  teaching  you  about 
 something  and  your  brain's  just  like
[33:04] talking  over  them  in  your  mind  you  can't 
 even  listen  to  them  properly  like  I 
 wanted  to  listen  join  me  through  all  my
[33:09] time  I  wanted  to  like  through  my 
 childhood  my  teenage  years  my  early 
 adult  years  like  I  wanted  to  be 
 productive  I  wanted  to  be  successful  I
[33:14] wanted  to  be  able  to  get  good  grades  in 
 schools  I  just  was  never  able  to  because 
 my  brain  was  always  fried  and  yeah  the
[33:20] other  scientific  term  doesn't  make  sense 
 but  bro  I  started  playing  video  games 
 when  I  was  like  five  years  old  I  was
[33:26] playing  video  games  in  primary  school  I 
 was  in  primary  school  when  I  was  six 
 seven  years  nine  years  old
[33:32] unable  to  listen  to  the  primary  school 
 teacher  because  I  was  playing  video 
 games  in  high  school  I  was  unable  to
[33:38] listen  to  the  teacher  because  I  was 
 playing  video  games  and  my  mind  was 
 obsessed  with  it  I  would  be  in  class
[33:43] thinking  about  video  games 
 the  rest  of  the  kids  around  me 
 especially  the  girls  that  had  hit  in
[33:48] puberty  they're  all  growing  up  a  little 
 bit  I'm  just  like  still  this  little  boy 
 who's  still  stuck  in  the  virtual  world
[33:53] unable  to  even  focus  on  his  studies  and 
 like  yeah  you  know  pursuing  like  the 
 your  studies  in  terms  of  the  education
[33:59] system  I  don't  think  it's  a  really  good 
 idea  I  think  University  is  like  a  scam 
 and  everything  but  even  then  I  wanted  to
[34:04] still  get  good  grades  because  I  knew 
 that  that  was  like  a  good  thing  to  do 
 and  I  wouldn't  study  I  wouldn't  do  my
[34:09] homework  I  wasn't  able  to  concentrate  in 
 school 
 because  in  my  mind  I  was  just  elsewhere 
 I  was  thinking  about  what  I'd  do  next  in
[34:14] Runescape 
 a  dopamine  receptors  were  fried  I  was 
 eating  [ __ ]  food
[34:20] I  wish  I  could  go  back  pass  a  message 
 like  this  to  younger  Hamza  and  just  tell
[34:25] them  to  con  just  potentially  to  consider 
 something  like  this  consider  a  new
[34:30] chapter  of  your  life  a  new  identity 
 where  you  drastically  reduce  how  much  of
[34:35] the  instant  gratification  that  you  do  do 
 drastically  reduce  all  of  the  bad  habits 
 and  suddenly  just  start  doing  all  of  the
[34:41] good  habits  no  matter  how  it  makes  you 
 feel  you  discipline  yourself  to  just 
 literally  do  all  the  good  habits  and
[34:46] just  drastically  try  your  absolute  best 
 to  drastically  reduce  all  of  the  bad 
 habits  it  must  be  all  of  them  and
[34:52] there's  going  to  be  a  certain  one  that 
 you  really  don't  want  to  give  up  and 
 that's  the  exact  one  that  if  you  gave  up
[34:57] your  new  your  new  life  would  just  be 
 Unleashed 
 the  reason  why  I'm  saying  this  so  much
[35:03] in  this  video  you  know  that  that  one 
 there's  something  that  you  don't  want  to 
 give  up  just  right  now 
 because  whatever  it  is  whatever  is  in
[35:09] your  mind  of  the  instant  gratification 
 activities  whether  it's  video  games  or 
 something 
 it's  that  one  that's  going  to  unleash
[35:15] this  new  chapter  of  your  life  you  don't 
 realize  how  much  you're  missing  out  on 
 up  until  you  go  two  three  weeks  without
[35:20] like  your  main  crutch  because  when  you 
 do  that  and  you  also  have  the  you  know 
 the  the  sort  of  focus  to  go  and  do  some
[35:26] of  the  good  habits  you  realize  just  how 
 good  life  can  be
[35:33] 12  p.m  right  now 
 12  P.M 
 I've  been  awake  since  five  so  it's  been
[35:39] seven  hours  I've  not  ate  anything 
 I've  just  been  drinking  water  I've  just
[35:44] been  recording  videos  I've  recorded 
 seven  videos  this  morning  seven  videos 
 that's  a  week's  worth  of  content  in  one
[35:49] morning  in  one  morning  it's  not  even 
 like  it's  just  about  lunch  time  by 
 lunchtime  I've  done  a  week's  worth  of
[35:55] work 
 this  is  the  dopamine  detox  lifestyle
[36:00] I  will  say  that  again  and  this  I'm  not 
 even  saying  it  to  you  anymore 
 this  is  a  message  to  my  younger  self
[36:05] that  by  lunchtime  I  have  done  a  week's 
 worth  of  work
[36:10] whereas  for  most  of  my  life  I  didn't 
 even  do  like  a  day's  worth  of  work
[36:16] for  a  in  a  week's  time
[36:22] I  can't  explain  like  how  much  this 
 transformation  means  to  me  like  I  was 
 literally  just  like  you  know  just  a
[36:28] normal  guy  just  struggling  with  life  and 
 everything  and  now  I've  I've  become 
 successful
[36:35] I've  become  like  the  man  of  my  house 
 I've  retired  my  father  I've  been  I've 
 gotten  my  family's  respect
[36:45] foreign
[37:03] do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it

"
bt_ZQpDFL2s,"[00:01] EVE to me is basically freedom, 
it’s a giant open universe where you can do 
whatever you want.
[00:09] You can have really relaxed slow
paced stuff where you can take it easy.
[00:15] Or you could be on the edge of your seat, shaking, making split second decisions.
[00:24] This is EVE. You know it’s a crazy universe 
where anything can happen, and however you want to do it, go for it.
[00:33] I would describe myself
as a kind of a freedom fighter. My very first character was 
a Minmatar character
[00:39] because they just seemed like the coolest,
you know, most brutal people, and I was like, I want to be that guy.
[00:47] I started out doing the missions in hi-sec, and I wanted to be 
on the side of the people
[00:52] who were fighting against 
the oppression, against the bad guys, and once I learned that
you can basically help them
[00:58] and fight the other factions, that’s all I wanted to do.
[01:06] It’s a very satisfying feeling you know, starting out at the bottom 
and working my way up,
[01:12] getting to more, you know,
advanced situations, bigger ships, bigger enemies 
and all that kinda cool stuff.
[01:33] The ship that I wanted to sit in
more than anything was the Paladin, which is the Amarrian marauder.
[01:40] It was red and gold and it had the lasers, and you know, massive firepower, 
incredible capabilities.
[01:48] I wanted to sit in that thing, 
I wanted to fly, I wanted to undock.
[01:53] It’s like a project and you’re kind of 
putting the pieces together by getting the skills ready for 
the ship and all the modules.
[01:59] You’ve got to get
the money to afford it. You’ve got a dream that you want
and that ship basically is the dream.
[02:08] And once you finally get into
it there’s no greater feeling. I was lovestruck when I sat
in that thing and undocked.
[02:15] You know, with that ship 
I could take on anything.
[02:27] There’s so many
different forms on PvE, trying to wrap your head
around it, you’ve got a ton to do.
[02:35] All the options are there, it’s just a matter of going out 
and whatever fits your play style,
[02:40] whatever you feel
is the best thing to go after.
[02:50] Basically just jump into
whatever catches your attention.
[02:55] It’s a huge universe, there’s a
lot in it, get out there and try it.
"
fKnyYHGYf5A,"[00:00] in  cases  you  needed  someone  to  tell  you 
 this 
 they're  not  your  friends
[00:05] when  I  was  in  your  position  I  wish 
 someone  just  looked  at  me  and  said  How's 
 it  take  a  look  around
[00:10] look  at  them  really 
 look  at  their  interests  and  hobbies 
 compared  to  yours
[00:16] because  I  went  through  my  entire  years 
 at  high  school  with  the  same  group  of
[00:21] guys  around  me  who  I  considered  my  best 
 friends 
 you  know  every  single  day  we're  talking
[00:26] we'd  even  laugh  we'd  even  have  like  good 
 times  in  school 
 you  know  oftentimes  that  that  come  into
[00:33] school  in  the  morning  and  and  they'd  be 
 telling  stories  of  like  the  stuff  they 
 had  all  done  last  night  like  they  had
[00:38] all  made  plans  without  me  and  like  you 
 know  slept  around  each  other's  houses 
 and  stuff 
 I  wasn't  invited
[00:44] but  inside  of  school 
 would  still  be  laughing  together
[00:53] but  things  started  to  separate  when  I 
 actually  got  onto  self-improvements
[00:58] and  especially  when  I  started  to  go  to 
 the  gym 
 and  they  bullied  me  for  it
[01:04] and  I  bet  you  can  relate  to  this 
 the  person  or  the  people  that  you
[01:09] thought  of  when  you  clicked  on  this 
 video 
 they  actually  insults  you  and  bully  you
[01:16] and  harass  you  when  you're  doing  good 
 habits 
 they  don't  want  what's  best  for  you  they
[01:23] don't  want  to  see  you  grow 
 at  that  point  what  are  they  because 
 that's  not  friendship
[01:29] I'd  invite  you  now  to  do  something  that 
 you've  probably  never  done  before  feel 
 ready
[01:34] Define  friendship 
 what  do  you  want  think  about  how
[01:39] important  this  is  what  do  you  want 
 friendship  to  mean  to  you  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life
[01:45] because  you  know  we  we  went  through 
 school  for  years  and  so  we  were 
 conditioned  to  think  that  friendship  is
[01:51] sitting  in  the  same  class  as  someone  and 
 every  now  and  then  telling  a  joke  and
[01:56] laughing  together  that's  what  we  thought 
 friendship  was 
 but  it's  only  really  when  you  get  onto 
 self-improvement  and  especially  when  you
[02:02] improve  your  mental  health 
 that's  when  you  realize  that  friendship 
 like  we  want  we're  gonna  set  high
[02:08] standards  than  that  it's  no  longer  that 
 I  can  just  laugh  about  this  meme  that
[02:13] all  of  us  saw  together 
 or  that  we  can  maybe  go  home  and  play 
 some  video  games  so  that  when  you  grow
[02:18] up  a  little  bit  more  and  you  know  you 
 start  going  out  and  taking  drugs  and 
 getting  girls  together  it's  it's  past 
 all  of  these  bad  habits  these  instant
[02:24] gratification  you  know  that  this 
 pleasurable  dopamine-seeking  hedonistic 
 stuff
[02:29] and  you  start  to  realize  that  maybe  as  a 
 man  what  we  should  consider  friendship 
 is  Brotherhood  and  growth
[02:35] it's  men  who  actually  want  something 
 good  for  you 
 it's  men  who  are  around  you  who  have  got
[02:40] similar 
 not  exactly  the  same  but  similar  hobbies
[02:45] and  interests  but 
 probably  the  same  values
[02:50] it's  men  who  have  the  values  of 
 discipline  respect  politeness  positivity
[02:57] gratitude  meditate  like  mindfulness 
 these  are  the  values  that  you'd  want  in
[03:03] good  people  around  you  these  are  the 
 values  that  you'll  cultivating  yourself 
 and  so
[03:09] maybe  no  one  said  it  to  you 
 but  you  deserve  to  be  with  someone  like 
 that
[03:14] you  deserve  to  have  friends  who  have  got 
 these  good  values 
 you  deserve  to  have  friends  who  are
[03:20] better  than  those  guys  from  high  school 
 who  are  still  doing  all  of  the  bad 
 habits  who  you're  still  in  a  weird  way
[03:25] attached  to  even  though  that  you  know 
 it's  not  right  for  you  to  be  there
[03:30] because  it's  hard  to  detach  away  isn't 
 it  it's  hard  to  consider  thinking  to 
 leave  this  environment  it's  hard  to
[03:36] think 
 how  you  would  even  go  about  it  it  feels 
 so  awkward  because  you  know  not  only 
 does  it  feel  awkward  of  what  they  would
[03:41] say  for  some  reason  we  stay  stuck  in 
 these  situations  in  relationships  that
[03:46] aren't  good  for  us  because  there's 
 something  you  know  Primal  inside  of  us 
 isn't  that  is  you  know  it's  like 
 Evolution  that  if  you  imagine  like
[03:52] cavemen 
 how  many  cavemen  would  have  left  their 
 tribes  probably  not  that  many  because  it
[03:57] would  have  symbolized  death  you  don't 
 leave  your  tribe  because  you  usually 
 would  die  if  that  happened  to  you  know
[04:02] the  Lone  Wolf  is  a  myth  there  there  are 
 no  lone  wolfs  because  they  all  die  off 
 we  would  no  animal  like  really  survives
[04:08] by  itself  no  human  survives  by  himself 
 and  so  to  consider
[04:13] to  leave  the  tribe  leave  the  Friendship 
 group  leave  the  resources  and  the  social
[04:18] inclusion  and  you're  the  body  what  heat 
 of  other  people  to  go  out  there  and 
 Venture  alone  seems  so  scary
[04:25] but  I  promise  you  right  now 
 I  have  not  seen  it  any  other  way
[04:30] I  wish  that  I  could  tell  you  the  you 
 know  the  most  wholesome  answer  I  could 
 tell  you  is  bro  try  and  get  them  onto
[04:36] self-improvement  as  well  try  and  you 
 know  try  and  get  them  into  the  gym  and 
 there's  probably  one  friend  that  you 
 know  it's  a  little  bit  close  to  getting
[04:42] on  to  self-improvement  with  you  that's 
 awesome  but  for  most  of  the  friends 
 they're  simply  not  going  to
[04:48] I  hope  that  you  can  kind  of  trust  in  my 
 expertise  here  being  like  you  know  the 
 self-improvement  guy  for  a  lot  of  like
[04:54] young  men  who  who  have  watched  my  videos 
 trust  me  when  I  say  I've  tried  to  get 
 thousands  or  at  least  hundreds  of  guys
[05:00] to  get  their  friends  onto 
 self-improvement  and  it  usually  never 
 works
[05:05] because  I  can  help  you  I  think  because 
 of  the  fact  of  how  much  you  want  to
[05:10] improve  but  even  then  think  about  it  you 
 have  this  burning  desire  to  improve  your
[05:15] life  you  don't  feel  like  complacent  you 
 really  want  to  improve  you  really  don't 
 want  to  be  average  right 
 and  self-improvement  still  hard  isn't  it
[05:21] it's  still  really  really  hard  and  you 
 have  the  burning  desire  to  do  it  but 
 it's  still  difficult  so  imagine  the  guy
[05:26] who  doesn't  even  care  about  it  that  much 
 imagine  like  the  friend  of  yours  who 
 doesn't  even  like  think  about
[05:31] self-improvements  if  he  doesn't  even 
 have  that  burning  desire  it's  gonna  be 
 technically  impossible  for  him  it's  hard
[05:36] enough  for  us  and  when  we  rarely  value 
 growth  you  know  that's  our  values  we 
 value  growth  and  progress
[05:43] to  date  I've  never  seen  like  of  someone 
 convince  their  friend  to  get  onto
[05:49] self-improvement  when  that  friend 
 specifically  didn't  care  about  improving 
 I've  never  seen  that  before  when  you've
[05:54] got  maybe  the  one  friend  who  actually 
 was  a  little  bit  more  inclined  to 
 self-improvement  save  him  save  him  from
[05:59] the  modern  times  save  him  from 
 degeneracy  but  most  of  your  friends  you 
 will  not  be  able  to  save  now  you  can
[06:04] choose 
 you  can  choose 
 you  can  abandon  these  friends
[06:12] or  you  can  abandon  yourself
[06:17] which  one  is  it  going  to  be 
 because  you  see  the  pathway  that  these
[06:23] men  are  on 
 you  see  the  decisions  that  they're 
 making
[06:28] and  you  know  you  know  where  these 
 decisions  lead  you  felt  the  pain  of  the
[06:34] bad  habits  yourself  haven't  you  be 
 honest 
 you  know  how  bad  it  feels  to  be  addicted
[06:40] to  porn  you  don't  have  to  tell  anyone 
 else  but  like  I  know  that  you  know  that 
 and  you  know  that  I  know  that  because  of
[06:46] the  way  that  I'm  talking  right  now 
 friends  know  this  and  they  refuse  to
[06:51] change 
 that  means  that  they're  actually  nothing 
 like  you  that  means  that
[06:56] they're  not  even  your  friends 
 you  want  my  help  you  want
[07:02] you  know  what  I  would  say  to  you 
 for  that  question  I  asked  you  earlier  of 
 you  know  would  you  define  friendship
[07:07] what  does  a  friend  mean 
 friends  of  people
[07:12] who actually  want  you  to  grow  and  be 
 happy 
 friends  are  not  those  people  that  you
[07:18] just  indulge  in  bad  habits  with  those 
 are  not  friends 
 those  are  drug  taking  Partners  those  are
[07:26] instant  gratification  Partners  those  are 
 crabs  those  are  crabs  that  will  snip 
 your  legs  when  you  try  and  climb  out  of
[07:31] the  bucket 
 you've  heard  of  that  that  quote  to  the 
 analogy  having  your  crabs  in  a  bucket
[07:38] and  you've  also  heard  of  heard  of  the 
 very  powerful  quotes 
 you  know  the  average  of  the  five  people
[07:43] that  you  spend  time  with 
 you  want  to  know  something  absolutely
[07:48] beautiful  that's  so  overpowered 
 that  quotes
[07:53] also  includes 
 the  content  that  you  consume  and  the
[07:58] books  that  you  read 
 I  Have  Become 
 a  lot  like  my  my  role  models  by  just
[08:05] simply  consuming  their  content  you've 
 probably  become  a  lot  more  like  me  by 
 simply  consuming  my  content  these  days
[08:12] you  don't  actually  have  to  be  around 
 someone  to  be  influenced  by  him  which  is 
 like  that's  mind-blowing  you  know  we've
[08:18] grown  up  now  with  this  concept  of  the 
 internet  and  everything  but  think  about 
 that  if  the  average  of  the  five  people
[08:23] that  you  surround  yourself  with 
 but  now  if  you  consume  the  content  of 
 smart  intelligent  people  of  of  people
[08:29] who  are  doing  good  habits  of  people  who 
 have  got  good  values  of  discipline  and 
 and  progress  and  humility  and  gratitude
[08:35] and  you  know  peacefulness 
 you'll  become  more  like  them  this  is  our 
 superpower  and  it's  such  a  shame  that
[08:40] other  men  don't  want  to  wield  the 
 superpower  because  they  just  want  to 
 play  video  games
[08:45] but  you  can't  surround  yourself  with  men 
 like  that  because  you  will  be  more 
 likely  and  you  know  this  you  know  when  I
[08:51] have  this  discussion  with  a  bunch  of 
 young  men  who  ask  me  about  this  you  know 
 young  guys  in  high  school  and  they  ask 
 me  like  how  should  they  go  about  this
[08:56] situation  when  they're  friends  with 
 these  people  or  you  know  the  guys  who've 
 just  gotten  out  of  high  school  they 
 Wonder  this
[09:02] and  I  always  say  to  them  what's  the 
 benefit  that  you  get  how  do  you  actually 
 interact  with  these  people 
 and  they  always  say  something  like  oh
[09:08] yeah  sometimes  we  hop  onto  a  Discord 
 call  together 
 and  then  what
[09:13] and  then  I  just  I  just  watch  him  play 
 video  games  sometimes  or  sometimes  I'll 
 join  him  as  well  so  you're  telling  me
[09:19] that  the  only  time  that  you  spend  time 
 with  these  friends 
 are  when  you're  worsening  your  life
[09:26] when  you're  doing  bad  habits 
 that  doesn't  sound  like  good  friendship 
 to  me
[09:33] I  will  hope  and  and  wish  and  pray  for 
 you 
 to  find  the  kind  of  friendship  where  you
[09:38] surround  yourself  with  men 
 who  want  to  grow  alongside  you
[09:43] you  can  find  them  in  the  comments 
 underneath  this  very  video  you  could  go 
 and  write  down  like  a  paragraph  of  your
[09:48] life  story  where  you  are  how  old  you  are 
 how  much  money  you're  making  maybe
[09:53] you're  in  school  and  you  could  write 
 down  and  say  like  you  know  if  anyone 
 wants  to  connect  you  can  do  that  you 
 know  the  fastest  ways  if  you  want  some
[09:58] practical  advice  right  this  video  you 
 know  all  these  kinds  of  videos  sound 
 really  nice  and  stuff  and  then  you're 
 like  oh  yeah  this  is  cool  and  then
[10:03] you're  just  gonna  go  click  on  another 
 video  and  not  change  your  life  do  you 
 know  about  the  the  fastest  way  to  ditch
[10:08] these  old  friends  is  to  make  some  new 
 ones 
 so  how  about  you  try  and  make  some  new 
 ones  right  now  how  about  you  actually
[10:14] actively  think  to  yourself  okay  I'm 
 gonna  go  spend 
 five  hours  over  the  next  week  trying  to
[10:20] connect  with  people  if  you  write  a 
 comment  on  this  video  there's  someone 
 who's  already  wrote  a  comment  and  you 
 find  a  way  to  contact  them  you've
[10:25] comment  underneath  and  you  tell  them 
 your  Discord  username  or  you  tell  him 
 you  know  like  telegram  or  whatever  like
[10:30] the  kids  use  these  days  and  just

tUqXzYw4HGo,"[00:00] Jeffrey  looks  down  at  his  weak  frail 
 body  my  genetics  are  terrible  I  could
[00:05] never  get  jacked  genetics  Jeffrey  look 
 around
[00:11] that's  not  because  of  your  genetics  but 
 because  of  your  actions  but  it  hurts  you
[00:16] to  admit  this  you  need  to  follow  just 
 five  crucial  steps  to  go  from  skinny  to 
 jacked  just  like  Adonis  Adonis  is  the
[00:24] embodiments  of  physical  Perfection  his 
 broad  shoulders  and  defined  muscles  are 
 the  result  of  years  of  dedication  to  his
[00:30] fitness  and  health  but  Adonis  wasn't 
 born  like  this  he  didn't  have  the 
 perfect  genetics  there  was  a  time  when
[00:35] Adonis  was  skimming  in  weak  just  like 
 Jeffrey  but  he  did  not  complain  about 
 this  he  put  in  the  hard  work
[00:43] please  believe  me  when  I  tell  you  this 
 that  everything  that  I  have  achieved  in 
 my  life  every  good  thing  that  has 
 happened  to  me  whether  it's  the
[00:49] attraction  from  women  or  money  or  status 
 or  fame  or  any  of  like  the  positive 
 things  that  I've  had  in  the  last  few
[00:54] years  has  started  because  of  my  fitness 
 journey  when  I  started  to  pack  on  more 
 muscle  I  disciplined  myself  to  get  into
[00:59] the  gym  and  also  whilst  remaining  lean 
 at  a  low  body  fat  percentage  you  don't 
 realize  just  how  much  your  life  gets
[01:04] better  by  building  an  aesthetic  body  now 
 you've  probably  had  the  goal  to  build 
 like  a  muscular  good-looking  Tick-Tock
[01:09] boy  boy  aesthetic  body  before  and  you 
 may  have  struggled  because  you  haven't 
 followed  some  of  these  crucial  steps
[01:14] that  we're  gonna  go  over  today  number 
 one  eat  clean  and  eat  a  lot  in  other 
 words  clean  bulking  when  you  search  for
[01:20] fitness  videos  on  YouTube  you  can  see 
 who  the  sellouts  are  because  they're 
 going  to  try  and  sell  you  this  clickbait 
 idea  which  doesn't  even  work  but  it
[01:26] sounds  really  awesome  and  it's  called 
 maintaining  game-taining  this  idea  that 
 you  don't  need  to  eat  a  lot  you  don't 
 need  to  bulk  you  don't  need  to  increase
[01:31] your  body  weight  and  you  can  just  stay 
 lean  the  title  that  all  these  guys  use 
 for  their  videos  that  get  so  many  views
[01:36] is  how  to  build  a  muscle  and  lose  fat  at 
 the  same  time  which  isn't  an  effective 
 way  of  building  your  dream  body  you  have
[01:41] to  bulk  and  then  you  have  to  cut  after 
 that  bulky  means  you  eat  more  food  than 
 how  many  calories  you  needed  so  that
[01:46] you're  in  a  surplus  and  that  Surplus  is 
 used  to  build  the  muscle  this  is  common 
 sense  for  guys  who've  been  into 
 bodybuilding  they  understand  that  you
[01:51] need  to  bulk  to  gain  muscle  but  a  lot  of 
 guys  don't  believe  this  and  they  think 
 that  they  can  just  stay  lean  and  not  eat
[01:56] any  differently  and  they'll  pack  on  good 
 amount  of  muscle  size  which  just  simply 
 isn't  the  case  so  what  you  need  to  do  is
[02:01] to  start  eating  more  but  specifically  to 
 eat  clean  because  there's  an  extreme 
 version  of  this  which  is  called  Dirty
[02:06] bulking  where  guys  will  eat  pizza  every 
 day  and  milkshakes  and  you  know  they'll 
 just  say  oh  well  I  need  to  get  the 
 calories  we  don't  want  to  do  it  like
[02:12] that  what  we  want  to  do  is  eat  as  clean 
 as  we  can  and  also  try  to  eat  above  our 
 calorie  maintenance  for  you  that  might
[02:18] be  2  700  calories  a  day  3  000  calories  a 
 day  if  you  can  hit  that  whilst  eating 
 clean  food  I'm  talking  vegetables  meat
[02:25] nuts  eggs  your  physique  is  going  to  look 
 very  different  compared  to  the  version 
 of  you  that  dirty  bulks  and  just  has
[02:30] milkshakes  and  sugar  and  pizza  every  day 
 number  two  and  most  interesting  for 
 young  men  optimize  your  testosterone
[02:36] levels  the  truth  is  that  you've  probably 
 been  walking  around  with  testosterone 
 levels  that  it's  maybe  a  third  of  what
[02:41] your  great  grandfather  had  I'm  gonna  say 
 that  again  bro  you  probably  have  one 
 third  of  the  testosterone  levels  that
[02:47] your  great-grandfather  did  the  average 
 man  over  100  years  ago  had  a  four  digit 
 testosterone  level  one  thousand
[02:53] nanograms  per  deciliter  the  average 
 range  of  today  is  270  all  the  way  up  to
[02:58] around  700.  if  you  have  270  nanograms 
 per  deciliter  of  testosterone  you  are
[03:03] considered  normal  and  healthy  which  is  a 
 disgrace  now  if  you're  watching  this 
 video  chances  are  you've  already  seen  a 
 bunch  of  the  testosterone  videos  out
[03:09] there  and  it's  kind  of  boring  to  hear 
 the  exact  same  video  where  the  guy  says 
 yeah  make  sure  you  sleep  and  make  sure 
 you  eat  and  make  sure  you  don't  overdrin
[03:14] and  you  know  when  someone  isn't  educated 
 on  testosterone  and  they're  just  like 
 literally  just  a  parrot  when  the  first 
 thing  that  they  say  when  they're  talking
[03:19] about  testosterone  is  they  lift  heavy 
 weights  when  there's  no  research  that 
 actually  shows  lifting  heavy  weights 
 increases  your  testosterone  literally
[03:24] just  doesn't  and  all  these  Bros  online 
 it's  the  first  and  only  thing  they  can 
 say  is  lift  heavy  weights  and  make  sure
[03:29] you  sleep  in  all  of  those  things 
 actually  result  in  not  even  that  high  of 
 a  testosterone  boost  I've  looked  at  the
[03:34] research  and  there's  a  few  practices 
 that  can  double  triple  or  quadruple  your 
 testosterone  and  I  speak  about  them  for
[03:39] free  and  a  couple  of  the  testosterone 
 videos  I've  made  over  the  last  few 
 months  go  and  have  a  look  at  those  I 
 guarantee  that  those  tactics  that  you've
[03:45] never  even  heard  of  before  and  they'll 
 actually  work  and  they're  actually  like 
 so  exciting  because  no  one  has  ever  said 
 this  to  you  before  you'll  give  it  a  try
[03:50] and  you'll  actually  feel  it  work  way 
 more  than  oh  yeah  lifting  heavy  weighted 
 oh  it's  sleep  eight  hours  like  those 
 things  are  nice  but  those  things  can  get
[03:56] you  a  20  increase  in  your  testosterone 
 I'm  talking  400  click  and  watch  that 
 video  right  now  the  third  step  to  go
[04:01] from  skinny  to  Jack  is  to  understand  the 
 concept  of  building  an  aesthetic  body 
 this  is  a  term  aesthetic  body  that  I
[04:06] think  I  have  personally  popularized 
 because  I  made  a  video  that's  now  got 
 like  three  million  views  but  I  talk
[04:11] about  exactly  what  an  aesthetic  body  is 
 and  finally  I  give  you  a  younger  man 
 permission  to  go  to  the  gym  to
[04:16] specifically  build  a  body  that's 
 attractive  that  will  get  you  more 
 results  in  your  dating  life  and  more
[04:21] confidence  when  you  look  at  yourself 
 before  this  video  was  made  you  can  go 
 have  a  look  at  this  three  million  views 
 before  this  video  was  made  all  these
[04:26] guys  online  were  in  this  circle  jerk  to 
 pretend  like  they  didn't  get  you  know 
 like  Sigma  male  stuff  like  I  don't  care 
 about  girls  I  don't  care  about  looking
[04:31] good  like  if  you  think  about  looking 
 good  then  that's  just  shallow  and  I  go 
 to  the  gym  just  because  I  just  want  to 
 feel  the  muscle  and  the  iron  I  came  onto
[04:37] the  scene  with  that  video  from  like 
 three  years  ago  looked  into  the  camera 
 and  said  I  want  to  get  more  girls  this 
 is  how  specifically  going  to  the  gym  to
[04:43] build  an  aesthetic  bodies  what  changed 
 it  all  for  me  I  highly  recommend  you  go 
 and  watch  that  video  because  I  break  it 
 down  in  a  very  interesting  video  format
[04:49] it's  almost  like  a  PowerPoint 
 presentation  I'm  showing  to  you  and  it's 
 helped  a  lot  of  guys  start  their  Journey 
 the  fourth  rule  of  going  from  skinny  to
[04:55] jacked  is  to  do  the  right  kind  of 
 training  now  in  the  previous  step  I  just 
 told  you  you  know  to  build  an  aesthetic 
 body  and  I'll  link  you  to  that  video  the
[05:01] reason  why  is  because  most  guys  who 
 actually  want  to  look  good  who  want  to 
 build  like  you  know  visible  packed  on
[05:06] muscles  so  that  they  look  muscular  most 
 guys  are  actually  doing  the  wrong  kind 
 of  workouts  for  that  goal  you  see  online
[05:11] there's  this  narrative  that  you 
 shouldn't  be  pursuing  bodybuilding  and 
 instead  you  should  pursue  power  lifting
[05:16] this  is  why  every  young  man  who  wants  to 
 look  good  goes  online  to  try  and  find 
 some  advice  and  he's  told  the  exact  same
[05:21] things  that  he  should  get  onto  a 
 strength  training  program  and  he  should 
 lift  heavy  compound  lifts  no  no  you  want 
 to  look  hot  like  you  want  to  look  sexy
[05:27] you  want  to  look  like  the  kind  of  guy 
 the  girls  are  screenshotting  and  you 
 know  like  on  Tick  Tock  there's  all  those 
 boys  who  like  look  really  nice  on
[05:32] Instagram  there's  those  Chad  looking 
 guys  if  you  want  to  look  like  one  of 
 them  you  need  to  train  in  a  different 
 way  than  what  you're  seeing  all  these
[05:37] like  fat  redditors  and  YouTubers  telling 
 you  for  strong  lifts  five  times  five 
 heavy  compound  left  you  don't  need  to  do 
 that  if  anything  actually  going  on  so
[05:42] strength  training  program  will  reduce 
 your  hypertrophic  gains  it  will  reduce 
 your  gains  because  strength  and  muscle
[05:47] are  two  different  things  even  though 
 they  are  quite  heavily  correlated 
 because  of  aggressive  overload  they  are
[05:52] not  the  same  training  for  strength  with 
 some  heavy  compound  left  three  reps  of 
 bench  press  five  reps  of  bench  press 
 will  not  make  you  anywhere  near  the  same
[05:58] amount  of  muscle  as  if  you  did  15  rep 
 incline  dumbbell  bench  press  so  this  is
[06:03] exactly  what  you  need  to  do  you  need  to 
 get  onto  a  workout  routine  that  will 
 actually  build  the  aesthetic  attractive
[06:08] kind  of  muscle  that  will  make  you  look 
 Jack  and  it  is  not  those  strength 
 training  programs  I  made  my  own  routines
[06:13] for  myself  and  I  followed  them  and  I  saw 
 pretty  good  results  and  I've  linked 
 those  workout  routines  for  free  in  the
[06:18] description  of  this  video  finally 
 there's  one  last  rule  that  you  need  to 
 follow  to  go  from  skinny  to  Jack  and 
 that  is  the  trust  the  process  and  to  be
[06:24] patient  you  must  understand  that  if 
 you've  watched  any  of  those  body 
 transformation  videos  that  you've  seen 
 online  if  you've  seen  any  like  progress
[06:29] pictures  usually  the  guys  are  lying 
 honestly  usually  all  the  YouTubers  that 
 you  can  go  in  like  you  know  if  you  go
[06:34] literally  go  into  YouTube  and  search 
 body  transformation  and  just  have  a  look 
 at  the  thumbnail  most  of  those  guys  are 
 actually  lying  to  you  they're  literally
[06:39] messing  up  your  mental  health  because 
 they  want  to  just  perceive  themselves  to 
 be  better  people  trust  me  I  say  that 
 that  three-year  body  transformation
[06:44] video  that  you  saw  on  YouTube  Took  the 
 guy  more  like  five  years  and  he 
 specifically  took  a  bad  picture  to  begin
[06:49] with  yeah  like  chocolate  milk  or 
 something  before  and  so  he  looked  worse 
 took  it  with  like  really  bad  lighting 
 then  afterwards  took  like  the  best
[06:54] picture  Photoshop  did  a  little  bit  and 
 then  she  presented  it  to  you  so  that 
 hopefully  you'll  click  on  it  and  you'll 
 like  it  more  the  truth  is  that  as  a
[07:00] natural  a  guy  who's  not  taking  steroids 
 your  progress  month  to  month  year  to 
 year  it's  not  gonna  be  like  any  of  these
[07:05] guys  you  see  online  you  can  look  through 
 my  own  progress  pictures  which  have  not 
 been  altered  or  photoshopped  or  anything
[07:10] like  that  which  has  been  totally  natural 
 and  you  can  see  that  I  made  quite  a  lot 
 of  gains  in  my  first  like  one  to  two  to 
 three  years  of  training  and  since  then
[07:15] it's  like  yeah  I  look  a  lot  better  and 
 I've  gained  a  good  amount  of  muscle  but 
 you've  got  anything  I've  been  on  this 
 journey  for  around  eight  to  nine  years
[07:20] from  age  17  to  25  I've  been  on  this 
 journey  and  there's  guys  who  are  saying 
 that  they've  built  a  bigger  physique
[07:25] they  meet  in  like  six  months  when  you 
 see  these  guys  like  progress  pictures 
 online  and  they'll  say  oh  yeah  it's 
 natural  by  the  way  and  go  buy  my  program
[07:31] huh  probably  not  there  was  one  mindset 
 one  thought  that  I  kept  in  Mind  through 
 my  early  days  of  going  to  the  gym  that
[07:37] helped  me  and  it's  probably  the  most 
 valuable  part  of  this  video  and  that  was 
 the  mindset  to  understand  that  time  was 
 gonna  pass  anyway  the  month  the  year  was
[07:44] gonna  pass  anyway  and  even  though  this 
 is  such  a  slow  goal  to  make  progress 
 towards  you  know  to  build  that  like 
 jacked  physique  the  time  was  gonna  pass
[07:50] by  anyway  and  so  all  you  were  going  to 
 be  left  with  was  whether  or  not  you  put 
 in  the  work  to  build  that  physique  I
[07:55] specifically  remember  a  few  of  my  old 
 friends  like  I  would  speak  to  them  about 
 this  journey  I  was  going  on  and  I  really
[08:00] wanted  them  to  start  going  to  the  gym 
 with  me  I  literally  remember  one  friend 
 who  looked  me  in  the  eyes  and  said  wait
[08:05] it's  just  gonna  take  too  long  to  see 
 results  and  if  that  baffled  me  because  I 
 literally  tried  to  explain  to  it  but 
 like  the  month  is  going  to  pass  by
[08:10] anyway  and  so  yeah  it's  gonna  take  some 
 time  but  the  month  is  going  to  pass  by 
 so  all  you're  left  with  is  the  gains  if 
 you've  made  them  or  not  and  guess  what
[08:15] happened  the  time  did  pass  by  I  went 
 from  looking  like  a  little  skinny  fat  17 
 year  old  brown  kid  to  the  physique  of  a
[08:20] Chad  if  you  want  to  call  it  that  and  my 
 friend  has  the  physique  of  Jeffrey 
 skinny  fat  drinks  beer  we're  not  even
[08:26] friends  the  time  is  gonna  pass  by  anyway 
 the  month  of  the  years  are  going  to  pass 
 all  that's  going  to  be  left  is  whether
[08:31] or  not  you  built  this  jacked  physique 
 this  aesthetic  physique  for  your  future 
 self  go  get  those  free  workout  routines

 through  his  time  in  school  his  teachers 
 demonized  masculine  traits  and  rewarded

 majority  of  men  of  his  generation 
 struggle  with  masculinity  when  he  grows
[00:12] up  Jeffrey  finds  himself  focused  on  love 
 and  relationships  around  the  girl  that 
 he  has  a  crush  on  while  she's  focused  on

 been  a  little  bit  envious  of  those  alpha 
 male  personality  types  you  see  those
[02:26] guys  that  guy  you  know  who  I'm  talking 
 about  you  have  one  particularly  in  your 
 mind  you  see  that  guy  attracting  the
[02:31] girl  that  you  want  you  see  that  guy 
 doing  well  in  his  business  and  his 
 studies  and  you  wish  you  could  become  a
[02:36] little  bit  more  like  him  driven  focus  on 
 his  goals  disciplined  and  yet  you  spend 
 most  of  your  time  with  your  feminine
[02:41] energy  Obsession  about  girls  who  don't 
 even  think  about  you  back  and  that's 
 exactly  what  being  more  masculine  and 
 following  this  guide  will  get  you  you'll
[02:47] start  focusing  more  on  your  work  your 
 mission  and  your  goals  and  with  that  you 
 will  become  the  most  successful  of  your 
 entire  life  you'll  make  more  money  in
[02:53] your  business  or  your  career  or  you'll 
 start  getting  higher  grades  in  school 
 because  your  masculine  Drive  is  finally 
 being  harnessed  you'll  feel  accomplished
[02:58] because  of  all  these  good  things  things 
 that  you're  doing  you  will  notice  a 
 significant  increase  in  how  much  girls
[03:03] are  attracted  to  you  after  you  follow 
 this  guide  and  the  interesting  thing  is 
 that  it  will  feel  nice  but  you  just
[03:08] won't  care  anywhere  near  as  much  as  you 
 thought  you  would  and  that's  a  powerful 
 place  to  be  that's  abundance  that's  what
[03:14] we  want  it's  time  to  begin  this  guide 
 and  your  journey  to  becoming  a  man  and 
 we  need  to  First  find  out  how  masculine
[03:19] you  are  right  now  I  must  tell  you  that 
 this  is  an  actionable  video  do  not 
 half-ass  this  video  there's  going  to  be 
 times  when  I'm  gonna  ask  you  to  pause
[03:25] the  video  and  do  something  in  real  life 
 to  follow  along  if  you  really  want  this 
 guide  to  help  you  follow  along  to  every
[03:31] step  that  I  say  because  if  you  don't  if 
 you  have  this  [ __ ]  little  [ __ ] 
 excuse  of  like  oh  well  you  know  they'll
[03:36] do  it  in  a  few  minutes  oh  you  know  he's 
 telling  me  to  do  something  but  I'm  a 
 little  bit  tired  I  can't  find  that  thing 
 or  I  can't  do  that  thing  just  yet  so  you
[03:41] know  I'll  keep  watching  the  rest  of  the 
 video  then  maybe  I'll  come  back  no  this 
 video  will  only  change  your  life  if  you
[03:46] follow  along  with  me  with  every  step 
 possible  so  do  this  right  now  go  get  a 
 piece  of  paper  and  a  pen  if  you  don't
[03:52] have  those  things  in  your  house  I  will 
 link  a  whiteboard  service  you  need 
 something  that  you  can  draw  on  so  I  will
[03:57] link  like  a  whiteboard  website  that  you 
 can  like  draw  you  know  on  the  screen  on 
 your  computer  but  best  case  scenario
[04:02] just  go  get  a  piece  of  paper  and  a  pen 
 pause  this  video  up  until  you  go  get 
 that  right  in  front  of  you  right  here 
 right  now  should  be  a  piece  of  paper  and
[04:07] a  pen  or  something  that  you  can  draw  on 
 or  like  some  whiteboard  online  website 
 that  I  will  link  in  the  description  if
[04:12] you  want  to  use  that  now  draw  a  long 
 rectangle  bar  write  the  letter  F  on  the 
 left  side  of  this  bar  and  then  write  the
[04:18] letter  M  on  the  right  side  of  this  bar  F 
 stands  for  feminine  m  stands  for
[04:23] masculine  now  in  a  second  I'm  going  to 
 ask  you  to  draw  a  line  on  where  you 
 think  you  are  in  this  spectrum  between
[04:29] feminine  and  masculine  energy  but  first 
 let  me  just  explain  what  they  are  the 
 more  you  push  over  to  the  F  the  feminine
[04:34] side  the  more  that  you're  obsessed  with 
 love  you'll  be  submissive  thinking  about 
 relationships  or  the  girl  that  you're  in
[04:39] love  with  you'll  fall  in  love  really 
 quickly  you'll  feel  quite  anxious  and 
 almost  neurotically  like  thinking  and
[04:44] checking  up  on  the  person  that  you're 
 currently  in  love  with  and  you'll  have  a 
 desire  to  feel  fulfilled  now  the  more  we
[04:49] push  onto  the  M  side  the  masculine  side 
 the  more  that  you'll  be  obsessed  with 
 work  goals  Mission  purpose  don't  be
[04:55] thinking  about  your  career  or  your 
 studies  what  tasks  to  do  next  you'll 
 literally  be  going  about  your  day 
 whether  you're  having  a  shower  you've
[05:00] just  woken  up  and  you'll  be  thinking 
 about  work  and  studies  you'll  be 
 dominant  and  stoic  and  you'll  have  a
[05:05] desire  to  feel  free  now  first  what  I 
 want  you  to  do  is  look  at  this  bar  on 
 the  left  side  is  feminine  on  the  right
[05:10] side  is  masculine  and  of  course  the  more 
 that  you  push  out  to  the  extreme  ends 
 means  the  more  you  are  that  thing  and
[05:15] the  more  that  you  come  into  the  middle 
 means  that  you're  more  of  like  a  mix  in 
 between  masculine  and  feminine  energy  I
[05:20] want  you  first  to  draw  like  a  little 
 star  on  where  you  want  to  be  in  this
[05:25] spectrum  what  is  your  goal  energy  draw  a 
 star  there  and  then  draw  a  line  of  where
[05:30] you  think  you  are  right  now  it's  very 
 interesting  if  you  imagine  the  results 
 of  this  little  practice  that  we've  just
[05:36] done  with  everyone  who's  watched  this 
 video  on  YouTube  and  all  of  the  young 
 men  who  have  taken  this  practice  imagine 
 you  could  like  fly  up  into  the  air  and
[05:42] see  every  young  man  who's  done  this 
 practice  and  you  could  see  their  pieces 
 of  paper  what  do  you  think  the  results
[05:47] would  be  of  this  you  would  see  an  entire 
 generation  of  men  wishing  that  they 
 could  be  more  masculine  their  style
[05:53] would  be  more  on  the  masculine  side  than 
 their  line  it's  very  interesting  isn't 
 it  it's  almost  a  universal  desire  for
[05:59] God  eyes  to  want  to  become  men  this  is  a 
 huge  problem  but  we're  here  today  to  fix
[06:04] that  first  let  me  tell  you  my  story  with 
 my  own  masculine  and  feminine  energy  now 
 you  can  skip  this  section  if  you  don't
[06:10] want  to  hear  my  story  and  you  want  to  go 
 straight  to  the  practices  and  the 
 education  you  can  do  that  but  I  think  it 
 might  be  valuable  to  just  sit  through
[06:15] hear  my  story  it'll  probably  be  like  a 
 little  bit  enjoyable  and  relatable  and 
 chances  off  you  can  relate  to  my  story 
 you'll  be  able  to  take  the  advice  that  I
[06:21] give  you  later  on  far  more  than  if  you 
 don't  even  know  me  or  trust  me  so  if  we 
 rewind  10  years  I'm  25  right  now  let's
[06:28] say  when  I'm  14  15  years  old  I  now 
 realize  how  feminine  I  was  I  didn't  at 
 the  time  you  know  when  you're  14  years
[06:34] old  it's  not  really  something  you're  sat 
 there  thinking  am  I  masculine  or 
 feminine  but  I  realize  a  lot  of  the 
 issues  that  I  had  came  down  to  me  being
[06:40] so  totally  my  feminine  energy  one  of  the 
 the  huge  problems  which  was  quite 
 chaotic  in  my  household  was  that  I
[06:46] wasn't  performing  well  in  school  I 
 couldn't  focus  and  I  barely  even  wanted 
 to  now  of  course  again  I  want  to  get
[06:51] good  grades  and  everything  but  like  I 
 didn't  even  want  to  do  work  I  wasn't 
 waking  up  thinking  oh  let  me  study  let 
 me  get  good  grades  I  was  waking  up  and
[06:57] what  do  you think  I  was  thinking  about  I 
 was  waking  up  and  the  first  thing  that  I 
 would  think  about  was  the  girl  that  I
[07:02] currently  had  a  crush  on  and  of  course 
 you  know  you  go  through  a  bunch  of 
 crushes  when  you're  young  and  stuff  so 
 I'd  be  obsessing  over  this  one  girl  I'd
[07:07] wake  up  and  think  about  her  straight 
 away  I'd  be  brushing  my  teeth  almost 
 thinking  about  her  or  you  know  every  now 
 and  then  thinking  about  something  else
[07:12] go  to  school  and  if  I  was  in  the  same 
 class  as  her  I'd  just  be  like  awkwardly 
 just  got  in  my  eyes  towards  thinking
[07:17] about  her  instead  of  thinking  about  the 
 lesson  and  what  we're  supposed  to  be 
 studying  right  now  I  was  almost  never  in
[07:22] my  masculine  energy  which  meant  that  I 
 was  never  focused  on  work  and  alongside 
 that  being  in  your  feminine  especially
[07:27] for  guides  it's  deeply  unattractive  here 
 I  am  obsessing  over  this  girl  who 
 doesn't  even  know  that  I  have  a  crush  on
[07:33] her  and  I'm  like  anxiously  just  thinking 
 about  her  checking  her  Facebook  status 
 this  is  when  people  actually  use 
 Facebook  it's  not  attractive  now  a
[07:39] feminine  woman's  anxiousness  you  know 
 she  always  thinks  about  the  guy  that 
 she's  into  that's  quite  attractive  as  a
[07:44] guy  if  you  imagine  this  as  a  man  it  feel 
 kind  of  nice  to  think  that  the  girl  that 
 you're  into  is  thinking  about  you  quite
[07:50] often  that's  kind  of  attractive  but  on 
 the  other  way  around  it's  not  most  women 
 don't  want  to  know  that  you're  thinking
[07:55] about  them  all  day  it's  unattractive  to 
 women  and  so  of  course  when  I'm  in  my 
 feminine  energy  when  I  was  younger  and
[08:00] I'm  like  totally  obsessed  with  this  girl 
 do  you  think  I  ever  attracted  the  girl 
 that  I  had  a  crush  on  and  this  happened
[08:05] Crush  after  Crush  after  Crush  I  remember 
 this  one  particular  girl  in  college  and 
 um I  saw  her  recently  actually  and  um
[08:12] she's  a  nice  girl  and  everything  but  I 
 had  a  crush  on  a  like  a  major  crush  or 
 maybe  I'm  16  17  years  old  and  you  know
[08:18] I'm  thinking  about  her  doing  the  usual 
 ship  checking  on  Facebook  and  everything 
 and  for  months  just  trying  to  like  level
[08:23] things  up  with  her  so  I'd  see  her  in 
 class  and  would  be  sat  next  to  each 
 other  and  you  know  like  she'd  be 
 focusing  on  the  work  we  were  supposed  to
[08:28] be  doing  I'd  be  like  just  kind  of  like 
 looking  at  her  with  my  peripheral  vision 
 thinking  about  her  daydreaming  imagining
[08:34] scenarios  of  me  and  her  together  and 
 everything  and  go  to  sleep  thinking 
 about  her  it's  just  [ __ ]  cringe  and
[08:40] then  one  day 
 I  checked  Facebook  and  all  I  see  is  like
[08:45] her  name  is  in  a  relationship  with  this 
 guy  some  guy  do  you  know  it  was  actually
[08:50] that  moment  where  something  clicked  for 
 me  and  I  thought  okay  clearly  you  know 
 I've  been  doing  this  for  years  of  like
[08:55] having  a  crush  on  a  girl  and  never 
 really  speaking  to  them  and  being  really 
 shy  something  clicked  and  I  was  like  you 
 know  what  this  it's  clearly  not  working
[09:00] it's  never  worked  for  my  entire  life 
 this  this  sort  of  method  that  I  have  to
[09:05] try  and  attract  the  girl  that  I  want 
 which  is  going  to  stay  silent  and 
 silently  observe  them  and  just  be 
 [ __ ]  nervous  around  it  and  anxiously
[09:10] think  about  them  and  so  I  started  taking 
 other  things  more  seriously  instead  of 
 obsessing  over  girls  I  went  through  you
[09:15] know  a  bit  of  that  sort  of  not  hateful 
 energy  but  the  more  of  like  yeah  yeah 
 you  know  [ __ ]  girls  I  don't  even  care
[09:20] about  girls  anyway  I'm  just  gonna  like 
 focus  on  going  to  the  gym  and 
 interestingly  that's  exactly  what  worked
[09:25] when  I  had  other  things  to  focus  on  like 
 for  example  the  gym  making  new  friends 
 partying  I  automatically  started  to
[09:31] attract  more  girls  but  things  weren't 
 better  like  straight  away  so  as  I'm 
 getting  older  term  18  19  20  21  years  old
[09:36] and  I'm  having  sex  and  getting  into 
 relationships  pretty  much  most  of  the 
 relationships  that  I  got  into  two  were
[09:42] quite  depolarized  now  you're  going  to 
 learn  what  the  term  depolarization 
 depolarized  means  but  I'll  give  you  a
[09:47] very  brief  explanation  depolarized  just 
 kind  of  means  that  we  aren't  on  either
[09:52] end  of  the  spectrum  and  instead  we're  in 
 this  like  gray  androgynous  Zone  in  the 
 middle  so  what  we'd  like  to  be  or  at
[09:58] least  for  me  personally  maybe  for  you 
 I'd  like  to  be  way  more  on  the  masculine 
 side  and  then  meet  a  girl  who's  way  more 
 on  the  feminine  side  but  when  you're  way
[10:04] more  near  the  middle  you  bring  some 
 masculine  traits  and  some  feminine 
 traits  and  she's  way  more  near  the 
 middle  you're  depolarized  and  I'll
[10:10] explain  the  very  dire  consequences  of 
 being  in  a  relationship  where  you're 
 both  closer  to  the  middle  rather  than
[10:15] the  extreme  ends  and  trust  me  when  I  say 
 I  would  probably  guess  that  about  1995
[10:20] 99  of  relationships  at  least  in  my 
 country  are  depolarized  chances  are  if
[10:25] you're  in  a  relationship  right  now  it's 
 depolarized  even  though  you  know  it 
 sounds  hateful  chances  are  the  next 
 relationship  you  get  into  will  be
[10:31] depolarized  it  will  be  with  a  woman  who 
 brings  so  much  more  masculine  energy 
 that  she's  closest  to  the  middle  and  you
[10:36] bring  so  much  more  feminine  energy  that 
 you're  closer  to  the  middle  we'll  go 
 over  that  a  lot  more  but  one  of  the  very 
 interesting  things  I  learned  about  this
[10:41] which  it's  got  to  kind  of  upset  you  and 
 make  you  feel  a  little bit  insecure  is 
 that  people  who  are  depolarized  will
[10:47] never  have  an  extremely  feisty  sex  life 
 these  will  never  be  the  couples  who  will
[10:53] for  example  argue  and  then  just  fall  to 
 the  floor  just  [ __ ]  straight  away 
 these  will  never  be  the  couples  who  will
[10:58] [ __ ]  for  literally  an  hour  two  hours 
 straight  absolute  dominance  all  across
[11:03] the  room  that  the  Lampshades  just 
 [ __ ]  falling  off  the  lamp  whilst  You 
 could  argue  well  you  know  this  is  where 
 I  am  and  it's  authentic  for  me  to  be
[11:09] here  chances  are  you  probably  want  a 
 life  that's  more  on  this  side  and  you 
 probably  want  a  woman  who's  more  on  this
[11:15] side  and  so  at  least  for  me  when  I  was 
 18  19  20  years  old  and  getting  into 
 relationships  I  was  just  always  near 
 here  I  had  some  masculine  traits  and  I
[11:22] was  going  to  the  gym  and  eventually  I 
 started  boxing  and  I  was  thinking  about 
 more  of  my  you  know  my  male  friends  and 
 partying  so  I  had  like  some  kind  of
[11:27] mission  objective  but  I  was  bringing  a 
 lot  of  feminine  traits  I  was  also  just 
 obsessively  thinking  about  girls  really
[11:32] valuing  love  and  the  girls  that  I  was 
 with  naturally  because  I  was  in 
 university  for  this  time  were  quite 
 masculine  they  were  quite  like  gold  and
[11:38] study  orientated  now  that  can  of  course 
 be  a  good  thing  but  there's  a  variety  of 
 issues  that  stem  from  this  kind  of
[11:44] depolarized  relationship  but  what's  very 
 interesting  and  this  is  [ __ ]  okay  I  want 
 to  tell  you  something  about  me  I've
[11:50] dated  two  girls  who  have  brought  a  lot 
 of  masculine  energy  so  you  know
[11:56] depolarization  is  like  okay  where  the 
 man  was  supposed  to  be  masculine  but 
 we're  about  here  you  know  still  got  some
[12:01] you  know  masculine  traits  and  stuff  but 
 we're  here  like  we've  got  a  lot  of 
 feminine  traits  as  well  and  you  know  the 
 woman  she's  supposed  to  be  feminine  but
[12:06] she's  about  here  so  you're  here  right 
 I've  been  in  two  sort  of  not  really 
 relationships  you  know  dating  situations
[12:11] where  it's  been  more  like  this  where 
 I've  genuinely  felt  like  she's  actually 
 more  masculine  than  me  she's  actually
[12:17] thinking  more  about  work  and  goals  and 
 everything  than  I  am  and  I'm  thinking 
 more  about  her  and  I'm  like  the  little
[12:22] [ __ ]  at  home  no  you  can  see  I'm  not 
 happy  about  this  situation  and  again  a 
 lot  of  people  can  tell  you  oh  but  it's
[12:27] authentic  no  it's  not  bro  the  majority 
 of  men  don't  want  to  be  in  this 
 situation  let  me  tell  you  from  my
[12:32] personal  experience  the  first  girl  that 
 I  was  in  this  situation  with  who  was 
 more  masculine  than  I  was  she  was  very
[12:37] beautiful  I  hooked  up  with  her  in 
 University  like  I  went  on  a  night  out 
 then  saw  her  and  everything  she  was  so
[12:42] attractive  that  I  had  so  much  like 
 social  validation  for  being  the  guy  that 
 I  was  sleeping  with  literally  if  I  was
[12:47] with  her  the  club  guys  would  come  oh  my 
 God  bro  she's  so  fit  and  everything  it's 
 a  little  bit  disrespectful  of  a  guy
[12:52] coming  to  say  that  but  even  my  friends 
 as  well  will  be  messy  oh  my  God  you  know 
 she's  so  she's  so  attractive  and 
 everything  and  so  I  had  that  level  of
[12:57] social  validation  okay  she  was  by  then 
 the  most  attractive  girl  that  I  had  been 
 with  I'm  just  gonna  tell  you  the  [ __ ]
[13:02] truth  all  right 
 I  struggle  to  get  hard  with  her 
 honestly  imagine  being  with  the  most
[13:09] attractive  girl  of  your  life  by  this 
 point  so  maybe  I'm  20  years  old  and 
 imagine  not  being  able  to  get  hard  with
[13:14] her  and  you  know  at  the  time  I  thought 
 oh  yeah  because  you  know  I  just  feel 
 really  shy  and  stuff  because  she's  so 
 attractive  and  when  I  look  back  now  it's
[13:21] so  weird  that  she  was  a  very  attractive 
 girl  but  after  spending  some  time  with
[13:26] her  and  you  know  the  time  I  would  spend 
 with  her  I  wasn't  attracted  to  her  how 
 interesting  is  that  she  was  the  most
[13:31] attractive  girl  like  you  know  out  of  ten 
 a  7.5  or  an  eight  which  of  course  isn't 
 extremely  high  at  the  time  but  like  when
[13:36] you're  [ __ ]  20  years  old  and  you  know 
 I  mean  it's  pretty  nice  imagine  a  girl 
 who's  like  very  attractive  and  you  just
[13:41] aren't  attracted  to  her  why  because  our 
 energy  was  just  so  [ __ ]  off  and  so
[13:46] there  was  so  many  times  where  I'd  be 
 like  you  know  getting  ready  to  have  sex 
 with  her  and  my  dick  bro  would  be 
 literally  just  [ __ ]  just  pure  soft
[13:53] like  not  even  you  know  like  it's  soft 
 but  it's  got  a  bit  of  length  right  now 
 it's  kind  of  like  it  was  soft  and  it  was
[13:58] just  cold  like  that  kind  of  like  [ __ ] 
 size  bro  I'm  actually  getting  the  most 
 attractive  girl  of  your  life  and  your
[14:03] dick  not  even  getting  hard  for  her  and 
 it  wasn't  because  you  were  just  a  little 
 bit  you  know  insecure  or  shy  and 
 intimidated  it  was  more  that  you  just
[14:09] weren't  attracted  to  her  what's  very 
 interesting  was  that  I  was  never  like 
 truly  you  know  in  a  relationship  with
[14:14] her  we  were  never  exclusive  we  were  just 
 kind  of  like  somewhat  going  on  dates  but 
 mostly  just  hooking  up  until  we  were 
 never  exclusive  and  so  I  was  sleeping
[14:20] with  other  girls  and  I  specifically 
 remember  this  that  there  was  two  other 
 girls  so  I  was  sleeping  with  three  girls 
 like  at  the  same  time  and  there  was  two
[14:26] other  girls  that  I  would  be  sleeping 
 with  who  I  remember  you  know  they  would 
 come  up  to  my  university  flat  my  room
[14:31] and  I  remember  that  by  the  time  they  had 
 walked  into  my  room  and  we  had  maybe 
 just  you  know  just  seen  eye  contact  you
[14:36] know  I'm  standing  up  to  go  like  say 
 hello  to  her  you  know  stop  [ __ ] 
 before  we  had  done  anything  sexual  these
[14:41] two  other  girls  you  know  at  separate 
 times  you  know  I'm  horny  I'm  texting  one 
 bill  then  she  comes  up  on  Friday  you
[14:46] know  I mean  like  I  sound  like  oh  he's  a 
 [ __ ]  boy  and  stuff  like  if  you've 
 watched  my  videos  you  know  like  my  life
[14:51] is  very  different  now  compared  to  how  it 
 was  two  of  the  girls  would  come  up  and 
 quite  literally  bro  just  upon  making  eye 
 contact  with  them  and  also  you  know  the
[14:56] psychological  belief  of  Yahoo  yeah 
 they're  coming  up  to  have  sex  my  dick 
 would  be  rock  hard  and  with  girls  who
[15:01] were  like  weren't  as  attractive  they 
 were  still  you  know  pretty  attractive 
 but  just  not  to  that  same  level  as  the
[15:06] other  the  girl  so  how  interesting  is 
 that  that  with  the  most  attractive  girl 
 of  My  Life  by  then  I  didn't  really  feel 
 a  level  of  attraction  to  her  whereas
[15:12] with  other  girls  I  was  so  attracted  to 
 them  where  like  there  was  such  a  night 
 and  day  difference  between  my  like
[15:18] sexual  capability  and  I  didn't  really 
 know  this  back  then  you  know  I  kind  of 
 thought  oh  yeah  well  you  know  she's
[15:23] really  hot  and  so  I'm  insecure  I'm  you 
 know  that  I'm  a  little  bit  shy  and  stuff 
 but  I  wasn't  actually  shy  when  I  looked
[15:28] back  at  it  I  wasn't  shy  about  this  other 
 girl  I  just  wasn't  attracted  to  that 
 energy  and  so  what  happened  with  that
[15:33] that  you  know  the  the  main  bill  that 
 we're  talking  about  who  was  more 
 masculine  I  can  tell  you  one  night  for 
 example  like  we  stayed  over  we  went  to  a
[15:39] club  or  something  we  stay  over  and  like 
 so  many  times  this  would  happen  we're 
 like  I'd  wake  up  and  she'd  already  be
[15:44] awake  like  working  on  her  little  project 
 like  she  was  doing  some  like  art  class 
 or  some  [ __ ]  she  was  like  working  on  her
[15:49] project  already  and  almost  like  looking 
 at  me  almost  like  I  was  a  little  bit 
 like  lazy  and  you  know  come  on  like 
 she's  busy  like  can  you  go  now  I  was
[15:55] like  that  little  weak  guy  who's  waking 
 up  late  and  almost  disturbing  her  work 
 and  so  you  know  I'd  wake  up  and  you  know
[16:00] she  needs  to  focus  and  stuff  okay  fair 
 enough  so  I'd  go  back  to  my  place  and 
 just  kind  of  like  think  about  her  it's
[16:05] not  a  good  Dynamics  have  been  and  it's 
 not  at  least  in  my  perception  it's  not 
 like  an  attractive  like  relationship
[16:11] with  a  woman  to  have  so  that  was  a  few 
 years  ago  when  I  was  in  university  and 
 when  I  got  a  little  bit  older  age  23  24
[16:17] I  started  dating  you  know  other  girls  I 
 remember  another  girl  who  for  example  I 
 dated  she  wasn't  so  much  in  her
[16:23] masculine  energy  but  I  was  still  quite 
 in  my  feminine  I  was  still  quite  like 
 obsessively  thinking  about  her
[16:28] especially  when  there  was  like  problems 
 in  the  relationship  so  you  might  be  able 
 to  relate  to  this  if  there's  any  kind  of 
 like  problem  in  the  relationship  you've
[16:33] just  had  like  an  argument  or  something 
 you  can't  help  but  to  like  not  focus  on 
 anything  else  you're  in  the  gym  thinking
[16:38] about  her  you're  trying  to  do  work  study 
 whatever  and  you're  thinking  about  her 
 instead  and  like  your  mind's  just  like 
 elsewhere  and  you  know  that's  kind  of
[16:44] normal  it's  the  way  it  thinks  but  it's 
 not  ideal  at  all  when  you  think  about  it 
 so  about  one  year  ago  I  was  pretty
[16:49] successful  already  I  had  about  100  000 
 subscribers  I  was  a  very  fast  growing 
 Channel  at  this  point  what's  interesting
[16:54] is  that  I  had  this  level  of  success  and 
 yeah  I  was  still  obsessing  over  other 
 things  I  was  still  thinking  about  girls
[16:59] and  love  and  it  was  at  this  point  that  I 
 started  putting  in  a  lot  more  intention 
 into  learning  about  masculinity  and
[17:05] feminine  and  I've  spent  about  a  year 
 learning  this  stuff  before  I've  made 
 this  video  so  I  hope  that  there's  going
[17:10] to  be  like  some  life-changing  value  and 
 I  do  believe  that  I  have  a  very  good 
 level  of  understanding  of  this  one  thing
[17:15] which  I  think  is  the  single  best  reward 
 like  you  know  the  benefit  of  this
[17:20] journey  at  least  for  me  was  that  for 
 most  of  my  life  up  until  about  a  year 
 ago  I  was  just  not  really  motivated  to
[17:26] like  do  work  or  be  productive  I  didn't 
 want  to  study  I  didn't  want  to  even  like 
 you  know  business  work  even  on  my
[17:31] YouTube  channel  like  I  didn't  want  to  do 
 the  work  I  was  always  focused  on  other 
 things  and  so  I  always  wanted  to  work  as
[17:36] little  as  possible  now  if  you're 
 watching  this  video  and  you  kind  of  know 
 my  story  already  you'll  know  this 
 already  like  I've  placed  a  big  emphasis
[17:41] on  working  as  little  as  possible  through 
 most  of  my  journey  and  now  when  I  tell 
 you  the  things  are  the  exact  opposite
[17:47] and  I  feel  so  happy  about  it  it's 
 incredible  so  one  year  after  fully
[17:52] committing  myself  into  learning 
 masculine  and  feminine  energy  I  can't 
 work  enough  and  I  know  that  in  the
[17:58] modern  day  a  lot  of  people  you  know  like 
 depolarized  feminine  men  think  that's  a 
 bad  thing  like  oh  well  you  know  working 
 is  not  good  for  you  you  should  like  take
[18:04] time  off  to  enjoy  yourself  and  stop 
 broke  imagine  you  wake  up  up  and  the 
 first  thing  you  think  about  is  creative
[18:09] ideas  for  your  goal  imagine  that  you 
 literally  feel  motivated  every  single
[18:14] day  to  do  your  work  I  can't  wait  this  is 
 the  most  productive  I  have  ever  been  in
[18:20] my  entire  life  the  most  disciplined  I 
 have  ever  been  in  my  entire  life  this  is 
 the  most  like  my  success  in  everything
[18:26] I'm  doing  is  compounding  and  it  feels 
 [ __ ]  incredible  finally  I  feel  proud
[18:31] of  myself  finally  I  feel  like  I  can 
 actually  say  to  myself  to  you  I'm 
 working  very  hard  I  wake  up  at  4  45
[18:38] every  single  morning  and  I  start  writing 
 my  book  so  I'm  writing  a  book  I'm  going 
 to  be  publishing  it  soon  within  one  to
[18:43] two  months  and  I  wake  up  at  4  45  and 
 start  writing  straight  away  straight  to 
 it  I  write  about  a  thousand  words  every
[18:48] single  morning  I  wish  you  could  almost 
 observe  the  life  that  I'm  living  now 
 compared  to  the  life  that  I  was  living
[18:53] just  a  year  ago  two  years  ago  because 
 it's  so  [ __ ]  different  I'm  focused  on 
 my  work  for  95  of  the  day  and  what's
[19:00] very  beautiful  about  this  which  we'll 
 speak  more  about  is  that  my  girl  to  95 
 of  the  day  she's  thinking  about  me  I'm
[19:05] masculine  I'm  focused  from  my  work  she's 
 feminine  she's  focused  on  me  and  that 
 feels  [ __ ]  awesome  I  feel  like  I'm
[19:11] masculine  dominance  I'm  a  leader  I'm 
 guiding  her  it's  so  so  good  honestly  we
[19:17] have  to  discuss  something  now  and  I'm 
 gonna  get  into  a  little  bit  of  a  rant  so 
 maybe  you  can  skip  this  section  if  you 
 want  or  if  you  enjoy  my  run  so  if  you
[19:23] just  want  to  hear  this  guy  like  you  know 
 hate  Society  then  you  can  listen  if  you 
 want  we  have  to  explain  why  you  are  not
[19:28] masculine  already  because  this  is  a  New 
 Concept  for  men  to  be  raised  and  not
[19:33] turn  into  men  legally  you  might  be  a  man 
 but  you're  not  the  majority  of  men  are 
 not  men  that  the  guys  this  isn't  manhood
[19:40] this  is  Guy  hood  for  some  reason  I 
 always  have  this  level  of  hatred  yeah 
 yeah  you  know  guys  are  weak  but  then  I 
 started  to  ask  myself  why  and  I  realize
[19:46] it's  not  necessarily  a  guy's  fault  that 
 he's  weak  and  he's  feminine  now  of 
 course  you  know  as  men  we  should  take
[19:51] responsibility  for  our  actions  but  if 
 you've  been  raised  in  a  certain  way 
 which  has  led  you  to  this  point  is  it
[19:56] really  your  fault  or  is  there  an  enemy 
 at  hand  and  forgive  me  for  sounding 
 crazy  but  there  is  an  enemy  and  there  is
[20:01] a  war  on  masculinity  there  absolutely  is 
 a  war  on  masculinity  and  testosterone
[20:06] from  the  moment  of  birth  you  are 
 conditioned  you  are  conditioned  to  be 
 weak  and  feminine  and  submissive  you
[20:12] enter  the  school  system  as  a  legal 
 requirement  and  what's  very  interesting 
 is  our  perception  of  school  you  know  it
[20:17] has  to  be  a  little  bit  positive  because 
 yeah  education  is  really  important  but 
 you  don't  really  learn  that  much  in
[20:22] school  you  aren't  taught  important 
 things  that  you  actually  need  to  be  a 
 good  functioning  human  being  all  of
[20:28] school  is  just  a  big  Act  of  conditioning 
 for  you  to  be  submissive  and  to  follow
[20:33] the  instructions  of  the  authority  figure 
 so  that  as  soon  as  you  turn  18  or 
 whatever  age  it  is  in  your  country
[20:38] you're  ready  to  enter  the  workforce  as  a 
 submissive  Pawn  in  the  game  of  like  some 
 big  Corporation  you've  got  to  either
[20:44] love  or  hate  what  I'm  saying  here  and 
 whether  you  agree  with  it  or  not  you 
 feel  the  consequences  of  it  you  are  not
[20:50] even  a  quarter  of  the  man  that  your 
 great-grandfather  was  you  have  less  than 
 a  third  of  this  testosterone  when  you
[20:57] want  to  have  children  you  will  struggle 
 your  sperm  count  is  at  an  all-time  low 
 your  testosterone  is  at  an  all-time  low
[21:02] so  many  random  [ __ ]  you  know  the  studies 
 which  literally  show  that  a  man's  hand 
 grip  for  a  handshake  is  at  the  weakest
[21:08] they've  ever  found  through  the  history 
 of  like  them  like  I  don't  know  like  this 
 has  been  like  a  longitudinal  study
[21:13] researchers  have  literally  been  studying 
 the  strength  of  a  man's  like  handshake 
 grip  for  a  long  time  and  this  is  the
[21:19] weakest  handshake  grip  that  we  have 
 little  [ __ ]  limp  limp  handshake 
 [ __ ]  this  is  this  is  what  where
[21:25] we've  been  reduced  to  men  aren't  really 
 needed  anymore  strong  men  aren't  needed 
 we  live  in  times  of  of  abundance  and
[21:31] resource  and  even  in  developing 
 countries  you're  somewhat  relatively 
 safe  now  on  the  other  hand  at  times  of
[21:37] chaos  at  times  of  necessity  strong  men 
 rise  everyone  needs  them  everyone  looks 
 to  them  day  to  day  let's  say  we  go  to
[21:42] like  some  big  Metropolitan  like  liberal 
 I  don't  know  these  words  right  I'm  not 
 into  politics  or  some  [ __ ]  but  you  can
[21:47] imagine  the  kind  of  person  like  the 
 people  I'm  talking  about  who  are  like 
 they've  dyed  their  hair  color  they  say
[21:52] you're  using  the  wrong  pronouns  and 
 stuff  I  mean  if  you  go  to  like  a 
 university  that's  filled  with  these 
 kinds  of  people  and  you're  a  strong  man
[21:58] a  man  with  high  levels  of  testosterone 
 more  like  you  know  like  an  alpha  male 
 kind  of  character  they're  not  gonna 
 respect  you  yeah  yeah  he's  a  misogynist
[22:04] you  know  they'll  say  these  things  about 
 you  like  he's 
 like  let's  cancel  him  and  [ __ ]  right
[22:09] you're  not  needed  let's  just  imagine  a 
 scenario  in  which  you  are  needed  you're 
 in  the  same  situation  the  same 
 environment  an  enemy  walks  in  a  gunman
[22:16] walks  in  a  threat  occurs  who's 
 everyone's  eyes  gonna  dot  to  to  solve 
 the  problem  the  big  strong  man  you  see
[22:22] you  aren't  needed  until  you  are  and  at 
 that  point  well  people  are  expecting  you
[22:27] to  like  do  the  work  and  this  isn't  even 
 to  say  the  raw  subconscious  attraction 
 from  women  now  women  generally  in  like
[22:33] in  Western  countries  they  are  quite 
 depolarized  now  they  bring  in  quite  a 
 lot  of  like  masculine  traits  and  we'll 
 discuss  this  in  detail  soon  they're
[22:38] bringing  muscle  and  traits  because  they 
 have  to  they  push  into  the  education 
 system  just  like  you  are  they  fed  this 
 sort  of  narrative  of  like  you  know  the
[22:44] you  go  girl  boss  girl  mentality  and  so 
 they're  quite  masculine  but  even  then  a 
 woman's  raw  subconscious  Primal  sexual
[22:50] attraction  will  always  be  for  the 
 masculine  man  and  so  whilst  you've  been 
 conditioned  to  be  you  know  not  don't  be
[22:55] masculine  don't  be  strong  don't  be  a 
 misogynist  don't  be  dominant  don't  be 
 you  know  patriarchal  you've  been 
 conditioned  to  be  more  and  more  feminine
[23:01] and  you've  been  told  yeah  this  is  good 
 be  it  be  a  good  boy  be  a  good  boy  the 
 women  that  you  once  a  [ __ ]  a  guy
[23:06] who's  way  over  here  you  failed  this  test 
 do  you  understand  that  this  was  all  a 
 test  do  you  understand
[23:11] that  the  little  boys  who  were  raised 
 with  good  strong  father  figures  these 
 little  boys  who  naturally  just  had
[23:16] higher  levels  of  testosterone  they  were 
 amused  by  this  test  you  could  probably 
 imagine  one  of  those  boys  right  now 
 imagine  a  boy  in  primary  school  or  high
[23:22] school  that  you  know  the  teacher  told 
 them  to  be  more  feminine  you'll  sit  down 
 and  be  quiet  he  almost  like  laughed  at 
 her  and  he  was  quite  disruptive  now  of
[23:28] course  this  boy  is  probably  a  little  bit 
 stupid  and  he's  probably  broke  in  jail 
 or  something  right  now  but  that  was  a
[23:33] boy  a  male  a  man  who  didn't  fail  this 
 test  you  almost  had  to  be  like  this 
 disruptive  boy  who  probably  had  like
[23:38] autism  or  ADHD  you  know  one  of  those 
 like  disruptive  boys  who  always  got  into 
 trouble  and  always  like  laughed  and
[23:43] swore  at  the  teacher  and  stuff  he  didn't 
 succumb  to  the  pressure  of  acting  more 
 feminine  he  found  that  silly  we  listened
[23:49] to  those  words  of  advice  from  perhaps 
 well-meaning  authority  figures  teachers 
 the  media  and  we  fell  for  that  test  we
[23:55] fell  for  the  test  of  giving  up  our 
 masculinity  for  thinking  Yeah  well  yeah 
 everyone's  telling  me  to  be  more
[24:00] feminine  think  about  the  media  think 
 about  the  conditioning  the  brainwashing 
 that  you've  been  into  if  you  think  about
[24:05] the  shows  that  you  used  to  watch  or  the 
 movies  that  you  see  nowadays  what  do  you 
 see  generally  if  it's  like  a  show  or
[24:11] movie  about  like  a  family  generally  the 
 wife  is  like  the  strong  really  strong 
 resourceful  woman  she  not  only  looks
[24:17] after  the  kids  but  she  also  like  works 
 and  she  even  looked  after  the  husband 
 and  the  husband  the  father  is  a  bumbling
[24:23] idiot  this  is  how  men  and  fathers  are 
 portrayed  in  the  media  the  husband  and 
 the  father  is  always  like  an  idiot  he's
[24:28] always  just  feminine  he's  thinking  about 
 the  woman  and  stuff  he  always  keeps 
 making  these  mistakes  and  then  the  super 
 mom  comes  in  and  she'll  fix  the  day  and
[24:34] then  sometimes  just  sometimes  you  could 
 probably  visualize  this  right  now 
 sometimes  the  media  in  movies  and  TV
[24:39] shows  and  cartoons  and  all  this  [ __ ] 
 that's  literally  conditioning  your  brain 
 sometimes  they  will  show  a  strong
[24:44] masculine  father  figure  but  under  what 
 light  will  they  show  him  well  he's 
 patriarchal  and  he's  he's  gross  and  he's
[24:51] too  disciplined  and  he's  too  aggressive 
 and  he's  made  out  to  be  a  bad  guy  who 
 eventually  like  messes  up  and  somewhat
[24:56] embarrasses  himself  so  this  is  that 
 Dynamic  you  see  in  a  movie  where  there's 
 a  strong  man  and  he  messes  up  and  he 
 gets  like  dethroned  by  the  Little  Nerd
[25:02] with  the  skinny  neck  who  ends  up 
 becoming  like  a  superhero  and  like  looks 
 up  to  his  dad  and  says  this  is  the
[25:07] conditioning  that  you've  been  through 
 and  you  may  think  right  now  oh  well 
 that's  just  movies  that's  just  you  know 
 TV  shows  but  everything  that  you  see
[25:13] especially  at  a  young  age  deeply 
 influences  the  kind  of  man  or  guy  that
[25:18] you  become  and  if  you  followed  along 
 with  me  through  this  video  so  far  and 
 you  drew  that  little  bar  that  we  spoke
[25:23] about  and  you  put  your  line  of  where  you 
 are  right  now  closer  to  the  middle  then 
 you  can  see  that  the  results  of
[25:28] everything  that  you  were  raised  for  has 
 led  you  to  a  point  that  you  are  quite 
 depolarizing  you're  not  as  masculine  as
[25:34] you  should  be  because  you  totally 
 understand  this  and  everyone  understands 
 this  we  should  be  far  more  on  the  the 
 right  side  of  the  spectrum  we  should  be
[25:40] far  more  masculine  than  we  actually  are 
 we  haven't  even  spoke  about  the  war  on 
 testosterone  yet  do  you  know  the  average
[25:45] healthy  levels  of  testosterone  in 
 Western  countries  is  from  around  250
[25:51] nanograms  per  deciliter  to  around  950. 
 if  you  are  in  this  range  doctors  will
[25:56] hesitate  heavily  to  prescribe  you 
 testosterone  this  range  is  inherently
[26:02] and  blatantly  sexist  a  young  man  who's 
 22  years  old  and  his  dick  doesn't  work
[26:08] and  he  can't  focus  and  he's  depressed 
 and  he's  lethargic  and  he's  got  brain 
 fog  he  gets  out  of  bed  in  the  morning
[26:13] and  he's  literally  tired  straight  away 
 living  like  the  shell  of  a  life  that  he 
 should  be  with  no  Vitality  inside  of  him
[26:18] that  young  man  has  a  testosterone  score 
 of  260  nanograms  per  deciliter  and  his
[26:23] doctor  looks  to  him  and  said  oh  you're 
 in  the  healthy  range  imagine  having 
 symptoms  of  low  tests  you  don't  you
[26:28] don't  even  need  to  imagine  it  you're 
 living  that  reality  right  now  I  can  say 
 with  certainty  that  the  man  watching
[26:34] this  right  now  like  you  have  low 
 testosterone  now  you  might  fit  into  this 
 healthy  range  this  average  range  but  if
[26:41] you  fit  into  the  average  levels  of  today 
 that  means  that  your  testosterone  levels 
 are  actually  below  average  of  what  they
[26:47] should  be  in  the  history  of  mankind  I 
 said  this  before  and  people  scrutinize 
 me  these  [ __ ]  nerds  oh  well  oh  if
[26:53] you're  in  average  range  then  you're 
 average  no  because  the  average  range  is 
 like  a  modern  day  societal  construct  if
[26:59] you're  in  the  average  that's  in  the 
 right  middle  500  nanograms  per  deciliter 
 your  great-grandfather  had  two  to  three
[27:04] times  that  if  we  put  you  alongside  one 
 of  those  men  they  would  look  like  a 
 different  species  so  by  now  after  just
[27:10] watching  me  around  for  a  few  minutes  you 
 either  think  I'm  totally  crazy  and  I'm 
 delusional  and  I'm  dangerous  to  society
[27:16] or  maybe  just  maybe  you're  starting  to 
 realize  that  oh  yeah  it  does  sound 
 really  crazy  it  does  sound  kind  of 
 dangerous  and  you  know  he's  kind  of
[27:21] weird  but  he's  got  a  nice  beard  and  he's 
 wearing  a  bathrobe  so  I  can  trust  it 
 you're  probably  by  now  thinking  like 
 [ __ ]  there  seems  to  be  some  truth  into
[27:27] what  this  guy  on  YouTube  is  saying  you 
 already  knew  okay  you  know  my 
 testosterone  is  going  to  be  lower  than
[27:32] what  it  should  be  you  already  knew  like 
 yeah  I'm  not  that  extremely  masculine 
 and  stuff  but  when  we  ask  the  question 
 why  which  is  always  important  ask  why  it
[27:38] starts  to  sound  quite  like  a  conspiracy 
 theory  like  a  crazy  guy  would  be  talking 
 about  you  know  there's  a  war  on
[27:43] testosterone  you  know  like  the  [ __ ] 
 Dooms  there  with  like  the  big  billboard 
 like  oh  you  know  they're  trying  to  kill 
 our  sperm  cells  it  sounds  [ __ ]  crazy
[27:50] what  I'm  saying  can  you  think  of  it 
 another  explanation  honestly  like  if  you 
 can  think  of  another  explanation  please
[27:55] like  I'm  not  saying  this  at  all  like  uh 
 Farm  the  algorithm  or  something  but 
 leave  a  comment  and  like  start  a 
 discussion  because  I'd  love  to  hear  it
[28:01] I'm  quite  open  to  this  maybe  I'm  wrong 
 but  I  can't  think  of  a  better 
 explanation  of  why  men  are  so
[28:06] depolarized  lacking  masculinity  lacking 
 testosterone  than  just  a  war  on 
 masculinity  conditioning  from  a  very
[28:12] early  age  that  men  the  fathers  the 
 masculinity  the  strong  men  that
[28:18] testosterone  is  bad  for  us  that's  bad 
 for  society  and  this  is  even  again  to 
 talk  about  the  issue  of  a  lack  of  Father
[28:24] figures  in  the  home  fatherlessness  is  a 
 huge  huge  problem  in  the  modern  day 
 especially  in  Western  countries  honestly
[28:30] I'd  seen  like  some  crazy  misogynist  if  I 
 went  into  this  run  and  so  [ __ ]  it  I'm 
 gonna  do  it  there  is  an  incredible  level
[28:36] of  support  for  a  woman  who  does  not  want 
 to  stay  with  the  father  of  her  children 
 it's  a  smart  financial  decision  for  a
[28:42] woman  to  divorce  it's  actually  a  smart 
 financial  decision  think  about  that  it's 
 so  rewarded  in  my  country  in  the  UK  for
[28:50] a  woman  to  just  think  oh  well  you  know 
 he's  not  really  uh  he's  a  he's  kind  of 
 lazy  now  and  he  doesn't  treat  me  right
[28:55] and  stuff  so  I  can  just  leave  and  I'll 
 handle  the  kids  because  all  she's  grown 
 up  with  or  for  the  last  20  years  is  the
[29:00] you  go  girl  Super  Mom  you  can  do  it  all 
 yourself  you  know  women  can  do  anything 
 to  me  you  can  be  a  single  mom  you  career
[29:06] Mom  you  can  do  it  sounds  horrible  but 
 like  honestly  just  because  you  can 
 manage  it  doesn't  mean  that  you  can  or
[29:12] you  should  90  over  90  of  teenage 
 suicides  are  in  a  fatherless  home  over
[29:17] ninety  percent  of  teenage  criminality  of 
 asbos  anti-social  Behavior  orders  are  in 
 Father's  homes  over  90  of  drug  abuse  of
[29:24] teenagers  is  in  fatherless  homes  over  90 
 of  teenagers  who  go  on  to  be  homeless  or 
 from  fatherless  homes  if  you  can  think
[29:30] of  some  random  problem  that  teenagers 
 will  have  I  guarantee  they  are  multitude
[29:36] times  more  likely  to  happen  in  a 
 fatherless  home  you  can  literally  just 
 go  and  Google  this  [ __ ]  and  it's  [ __ ]
[29:41] where  I've  learned  everything  from  I'll 
 excite  it  if  you  want  but  where  I've 
 learned  all  these  like  facts  obviously
[29:46] I'm  not  totally  accurate  it's  not  19 
 maybe  it's  89  or  maybe  it's  not  you  know 
 I  mean  there's  a  book  called  The  Boy
[29:51] crisis  and  it  goes  over  this  issue  of 
 just  boys  being  raised  in  fatherless
[29:56] homes  by  single  mothers  and  you  know 
 with  this  attitude  like  oh  well  a  single 
 mom  is  a  superherence  you  can  do 
 anything  no  no  she  can't  she  cannot  a
[30:02] single  mom  cannot  raise  you  in  the  same 
 way  that  a  mother  and  a  father  who  are 
 loving  can  now  of  course  then  you  know
[30:08] there's  other  arguments  oh  well  what  if 
 the  father  is  abusive  and  you  know 
 should  he  be  taken  out  this  gets
[30:13] complicated  but  it's  not  that  caveat 
 that  you  really  see  in  modern 
 conditioning  is  it  when  you  think  about 
 the  movies  and  TV  shows  and  the  general
[30:19] belief  of  your  Society  chances  are  like 
 there's  this  empowering  thing  for  like 
 women  well  you  don't  need  a  man  you  go
[30:25] girl  fathers  are  being  taken  out  of  the 
 home  it's  been  supported  by  the 
 government  and  so  what  happens  to  a
[30:30] little  boy  who  grows  up  in  a  fatherless 
 home  chances  are  that  his  mother  his 
 single  mother  will  reward  and  praise  him
[30:37] and  positively  reinforce  him  when  he 
 acts  in  a  feminine  way  think  about  this 
 a  boy
[30:42] is  raised  in  a  household  with  a  single 
 mother  perhaps  just  perhaps  there's  a 
 small  amount  of  single  mothers  out  there
[30:48] in  the  world  that  can  take  a  step  back 
 from  their  own  shoes  and  understand  that 
 they  need  to  reward  this  boy  when  he
[30:54] does  things  that  actually  is  unnatural 
 for  her  perhaps  that's  a  small  caveat 
 right  but  for  the  majority  of  this  this
[31:00] household  Dynamic  of  a  boy  without  a 
 father  figure  with  a  single  mother  she's 
 gonna  have  her  own  biases  and  opinions
[31:05] and  feelings  and  beliefs  of  course 
 you're  right  and  so  she  is  going  to 
 respond  to  this  boy  with  those  biases
[31:10] opinions  and  beliefs  and  so  she's  going 
 to  positively  reinforce  and  praise  him
[31:15] for  the  times  that  he  acts  in  accordance 
 to  her  beliefs  and  emotions  and  feelings
[31:20] if  this  boy  acts  in  quite  a  masculine 
 adventurous  way  well  that's  not  very 
 natural  for  her  is  it  and  so  she'll  be
[31:26] like  no  no  come  back  you're  going  too 
 far  but  then  if  he  sits  quietly  and 
 Crosses  his  legs  and  plays  silently  and
[31:32] he  shares  well  well  you  know  she's  gonna 
 like  that  she's  gonna  like  those 
 feminine  traits  and  so  she's  gonna
[31:37] praise  him  for  oh  you're  such  a 
 well-behaved  boy  and  you've  got  to 
 understand  that  a  parent's  praise  is  is
[31:43] that's  how  you  became  the  person  you  are 
 today  so  if  you  think  back  to  that  that 
 bar  and  the  line  that  you  drew  and  you
[31:49] see  where  that  line  is  that  line  is 
 exactly  where  you  put  it  because  you 
 were  praised  to  act  like  this  you  were
[31:55] praised  to  act  more  feminine  if  you  had 
 a  strong  father  figure  in  the  house  he
[32:00] would  have  praised  you  only  when  you 
 acted  strong  and  masculine  so  you  go  out 
 on  your  on  your  bikes  and  you're  being
[32:05] competitive  with  your  friends  and  you 
 fall  over  your  dad  would  have  said  like 
 oh  that  you  know  you  went  too  fast 
 what's  your  mom  gonna  say  what's  your
[32:10] single  mom  she's  gonna  run  oh  my  God 
 you're  bleeding  never  do  that  again 
 never  go  that  fast  again  and  that's  just 
 a  very  simple  fast  example  that  a  guy  in
[32:16] a  bathroom  can  come  up  with  and  I  want 
 you  to  imagine  that  the  very  vast  huge
[32:21] amount  of  opportunities  for  praising  or 
 punishing  behaviors  that  would  go  on  in
[32:26] in  a  child's  life  over  years  and  years 
 and  years  and  then  imagine  well  he's 
 raising  a  single  mother  household  he's
[32:32] going  to  be  punished  when  he  acts  in  a 
 way  that  she  doesn't  like  which 
 potentially  would  be  in  masculine  ways
[32:37] and  he's  going  to  be  praised  and 
 rewarded  when  he  does  act  in  ways  that 
 she  likes  which  probably  would  be  in
[32:42] feminine  ways  you've  been  conditioned  in 
 your  own  home  you've  been  conditioned  in 
 school  you've  been  conditioned  when  you 
 watch  movies  and  TV  shows  you've  been
[32:47] conditioned  everywhere  to  be  more 
 feminine  than  you  should  be  am  I  crazy 
 maybe  but  again  if  there  is  someone  with
[32:54] a  better  argument  than  this  I  would  love 
 to  hear  it  but  I  I  can't  think  of  any 
 other  reason  why  we  are  struggling  with
[32:59] masculinity  today  so  we  understand  what 
 we  are  at  an  uphill  battle  you  and  I 
 because  we're  going  up  against  what  20
[33:05] years  30  years  or  however  old  you  are 
 conditioning  that's  a  lot  what's 
 interesting  and  what  gives  us  hope  is
[33:11] that  aligning  yourself  to  the  Natural 
 Energy  that  you  should  have  and  being 
 more  authentic  you  know  you're  just
[33:17] you're  supposed  to  be  all  masculine  so 
 we're  gonna  make  you  more  masculine  it 
 actually  counteracts  years  of  the
[33:23] inauthentic  living  that  you've  had  so 
 far  how  interesting  is  that  let's  say 
 you  could  be  feminine  little  little 
 [ __ ]  boy  for  20  years  of  your  life
[33:29] we're  just  about  one  year  maybe  six 
 months  of  training  to  be  more  masculine 
 you'll  counteract  most  of  that  think
[33:35] about  that  just  for  a  second  of  how 
 could  this  work  how  could  you  counteract 
 so  many  years  of  your  life  with  such  a
[33:41] short  period  of  self-improvement  or 
 focusing  not  being  more  masculine 
 because  this  is  how  you're  supposed  to
[33:46] be  for  all  of  your  life  you've  been 
 swimming  Upstream  being  pushed  but  just 
 constantly  swimming  Upstream  with  so
[33:51] much  friction  but  finally  I'm  gonna  turn 
 you  around  and  make  you  swim  alongside 
 the  stream  and  you're  gonna  find  that  it
[33:56] just  feels  so  natural  so  right  the  fact 
 that  you  sat  through  and  listened  to  all 
 of  this  demonstrates  you're  at  least
[34:01] your  interest  in  the  things  that  I'm 
 saying  and  you're  probably  relating  to  a 
 lot  of  the  things  that  we  spoke  about  so 
 far  inside  of  you  right  now  if  there  is
[34:07] a  feeling  of  Injustice  if  there  is  a 
 feeling  of  like  this  gut  pain  that 
 you've  been  wrong  that  your  life  would
[34:12] should  have  been  so  different  than  what 
 it  is  today  then  you  know  that  you've 
 clicked  on  the  Right  video  so  let's  now
[34:17] discuss  how  you  can  become  more 
 masculine  and  the  most  practical  no  BS 
 way  to  do  this  is  to  First  find  and
[34:23] discover  your  purpose  and  Mission  and 
 then  set  goals  and  obsess  over  those 
 goals  and  we're  going  to  break  this  down
[34:29] I'm  going  to  walk  you  along  the  process 
 with  me  and  there's  going  to  be  an 
 actionable  step  in  this  section  of  this 
 guide  so  do  this  right  now  in  the
[34:35] description  of  this  video  on  YouTube 
 I've  linked  a  notion  template  which  you 
 can  use  to  set  your  goals  scroll  down  to
[34:41] that  link  and  click  on  it  right  now  and 
 then  come  to  this  video  when  you  click 
 on  that  link  you  should  see  a  page  just
[34:46] like  this  and  I'm  going  to  walk  you 
 through  the  exact  process  that  I 
 personally  use  to  set  and  obsess  over
[34:51] gold  and  this  process  not  only  has  it 
 created  massive  amounts  of  success  for 
 me  personally  in  my  own  life  but  it's
[34:57] also  just  made  me  so  much  more  masculine 
 I'm  just  going  to  explain  to  you  why 
 goal  setting  makes  you  more  masculine
[35:02] it's  the  single  most  practical  thing 
 that  you  have  complete  control  over  that 
 will  make  you  more  masculine  why  because
[35:08] like  we  said  the  masculine  energy  is  all 
 about  making  progress  inside  of  you  is 
 this  natural  desire  to  make  progress
[35:15] either  to  ejaculation  to  impregnate  a 
 woman  or  to  develop  yourself  to  get  to
[35:20] the  point  where  you  can  do  that  we  have 
 inside  of  us  a  core  desire  which  is  to 
 make  progress  to  some  kind  of  meaningful
[35:27] work  and  so  you  need  to  figure  out  what 
 is  this  meaningful  work  this  Mission 
 this  purpose  for  yourself  and  so  I  have
[35:33] some  journaling  prompts  that  you  can  do 
 right  now  as  an  actionable  step  that 
 will  help  you  to  discover  things  like 
 your  mission  your  purpose  and  then  your
[35:39] goals  and  then  very  shortly  we'll 
 actually  go  through  the  goal  setting 
 procedure  okay  so  here  are  three 
 journaling  prompts  that  you  should  do
[35:45] right  away  so  you  should  ask  yourself 
 these  questions  and  journal  the  answer 
 either  on  a  piece  of  paper  or  on  some
[35:50] document  on  your  computer  number  one 
 what  stage  of  the  Maslow's  hierarchy  of
[35:55] needs  do  I  need  to  fulfill  the  hierarchy 
 of  needs  is  a  pyramid  it's  a  concept 
 made  by  the  psychologist  Abraham  Maslow
[36:02] and  it's  all  about  the  fundamental 
 desires  that  we  have  as  humans  and  I 
 think  it's  incredibly  important  to
[36:08] figuring  out  where  you  are  in  life  the 
 bottom  level  of  this  pyramid  are  all  the 
 essential  things  that  we  need  to  survive
[36:13] like  breathing  drinking  water  eating 
 food  excreting  every  level  above  that  is 
 another  desire  that  creates  a  well
[36:20] meaningful  fulfilling  life  for  us  what's 
 very  interesting  that  I've  noticed  which 
 might  help  you  with  your  answer  to  this
[36:25] question  is  that  your  mind  will  ruminate 
 on  the  need  that  you're  currently  stuck
[36:30] on  so  let's  say  for  example  you're 
 extremely  thirsty  your  thoughts  are 
 going  to  be  based  on  drinking  water  but
[36:36] of  course  let's  say  if  all  your 
 essential  survival  Necessities  are  taken 
 care  of  for  the  majority  of  men  even
[36:41] though  the  majority  of  guys  don't  want 
 to  admit  this  the  need  the  desire  that 
 they're  stuck  on  is  that  of  sex  and  love
[36:48] their  mind  ruminates  on  sex  and  love 
 that's  the  desire  that  they  need  right 
 now  it's  very  important  for  you  to  be 
 totally  authentic  and  honest  with  this
[36:54] journaling  prompt  that  you  should  do 
 right  now  which  stage  of  Maslow's 
 hierarchy  of  need  do  I  currently  need  to
[36:59] fulfill  what  does  your  mind  ruminate  on 
 and  just  write  down  the  answer  and  it 
 just  be  very  interesting  because  I  think
[37:04] the  majority  of  guys  who  answer  this 
 question  truthfully  would  say  sex  and  I
[37:09] think  a  fair  amount  of  guys  would  also 
 say  social  connection  these  are 
 fundamental  desires  and  sure  you  can 
 with  a  sense  of  motivation  and
[37:15] discipline  look  past  them  to  you  know 
 focus  on  something  else  and  you  know 
 this  sort  of  modern  day  oh  I  don't  need 
 girls  oh  you  focused  on  yourself  King
[37:21] you  feel  a  lot  more  free  when  you've 
 fulfilled  a  desire  a  need  on  this
[37:26] pyramid  and  so  it's  just  very 
 interesting  to  figure  out  where  you  are 
 because  this  will  really  help  you  with 
 your  goal  setting  because  I  could  rant
[37:32] about  this  separately  man  but  like  I  I 
 am  a  big  advocate  of  just  being  totally
[37:37] open  and  authentic  and  just  saying  like 
 yep  I  want  a  girlfriend  yep  I'm  going  to 
 set  some  goals  based  on  being  able  to
[37:42] have  sex  because  something  that  my  mind 
 is  ruminating  on  and  it's  something  that 
 would  fulfill  me  a  lot  of  people
[37:47] disagree  with  this  and  there's  a  whole 
 modern  Narrative  of  like  oh  yeah  we 
 don't  need  women  or  women  uh  and  then
[37:53] women  say  this  as  well  we  don't  need  men 
 both  groups  are  just  lonely  as  [ __ ]  so 
 you  can  choose  but  I  personally  think
[37:58] that  if  your  mind  is  ruminating  on  a 
 need  in  this  pyramid  it  would  be  of  your 
 best  interest  to  fulfill  that  need  and
[38:04] to  set  a  goal  based  on  that  the  second 
 journaling  prompts  to  ask  yourself  and 
 to  answer  right  now  is  what  is  some  work
[38:09] that  I  can  do  that  will  help  my  tribe  an 
 answer  to  this  question  may  help  you 
 find  your  purpose  what  is  some  work  that
[38:15] you  can  do  to  help  other  people  that  you 
 care  about  a  group  that  you  care  about 
 first  you  need  to  kind  of  figure  out  who
[38:21] is  even  in  your  tribe  is  it  just  your 
 family  and  your  friends  is  it  some  kind 
 of  community  that  you're  a  part  of  have 
 you  created  almost  like  a  social
[38:27] movement  like  you  see  before  you  right 
 now  who  is  in  your  tribe  and  what  can 
 you  do  to  help  them  you've  seen  the
[38:32] modern  day  so  many  men  are  lacking 
 masculinity  in  this  sense  of  like  being 
 connected  with  our  tribe  that  we  only
[38:37] think  about  ourselves  one  of  the  best 
 things  that  you  can  do  is  to  have  a 
 self-transcending  purpose  and  that
[38:42] simply  just  means  to  have  like  a  reason 
 why  you're  doing  something  which  is 
 bigger  than  you  self-transcending  means
[38:48] bigger  than  you  and  purpose  is  kind  of 
 like  the  reason  that  because  of  the 
 action  that  you're  taking  what  is  the
[38:54] purpose  of  your  life  why  do  you  do  what 
 you  do  why  is  your  life  important  how 
 can  your  life  how  can  the  work  that  you
[39:00] do  help  someone  that  you  care  about 
 because  in  the  end  that's  really  the 
 only  important  thing  it's  not  even  about
[39:05] the  money  the  rewards  the  girls  anything 
 like  this  in  the  end  it  all  just  comes 
 down  to  were  you  a  good  member  in  your
[39:11] tribe  it's  very  important  for  you  to 
 just  take  a  minute  right  now  and  first 
 answer  the  initial  question  who  is  in  my
[39:16] tribe  what  is  my  tribe  and  then  to  ask 
 yourself  okay  what  is  work  that  I  could 
 do  to  help  them  for  me  My  Tribe  even  in
[39:22] high  school  it  always  felt  like  my  tribe 
 was  other  guys  who  were  struggling  with 
 the  same  problems  as  me  my  mind  would
[39:28] almost  automatically  teach  what  I  had 
 just  learned  to  like  an  imaginary  young
[39:33] man  in  my  own  mind  does  that  make  sense 
 so  I  would  learn  something  let's  say 
 about  Fitness  or  about  dieting  and  it's 
 like  my  mind  would  just  be  like  teaching
[39:39] it  to  itself  pretending  itself  was  like 
 a  separate  guy  and  so  you  can  see  that 
 YouTube  like  the  perfect  work  for  me  to
[39:45] get  into  and  now  my  tribe  that  I'm 
 trying  to  help  with  the 
 self-transcending  purpose  is  young  men 
 around  the  world  who  are  tuning  in  who
[39:51] want  to  improve  themselves  a  purpose  is 
 so  so  important  purpose  I  want  to
[39:56] explain  this  so  clearly  because  for  so 
 long  I  didn't  understand  what  purpose 
 meant  you  know  so  many  people  talk  about
[40:01] it  online  purpose  is  just  the  reason  why 
 it's  that  because  of  your  action  of  your 
 mission  my  mission  is  to  help  young  men
[40:07] improve  themselves  and  my  purpose  the 
 why  that  because  of  that  mission  why  do 
 I  want  to  help  young  men  improve
[40:13] themselves  because  I've  done  it  for 
 myself  because  I've  lived  that  life  I've 
 lived  the  life  of  like  total  Indulgence 
 and  pleasure  of  that  modern  day  like  bad
[40:19] habits  and  I  hated  my  life  then  I  was  so 
 depressed  and  I  feel  like  I  have  the 
 answers  in  my  brain  and  so  I  work
[40:25] relentlessly  to  try  and  just  help  people 
 around  the  world  because  I  think  that  I 
 counted  some  good  work  that  I  can  do  and
[40:32] the  third  journaling  prompt  to  ask  right 
 now  is  what  do  I  want  my  life  to  be  like 
 in  10  years  time  to  help  you  with  this
[40:38] question  I  want  to  just  give  you  one 
 piece  of  advice  think  big  there  is  Magic 
 in  thinking  big  don't  settle  for  me  T
[40:44] ambition  especially  thinking  big  and 
 setting  a  very  very  authentic  desirable
[40:50] future  for  yourself  is  an  incredible 
 thing  and  if  you  work  hard  and  obsess 
 over  a  goal  like  that  you  know  you
[40:55] really  think  yourself  okay  I'm  22  right 
 now  what  would  be  the  best  life  that  I
[41:00] could  have  at  32  years  old  and  you  start 
 to  write  that  down  and  you  start  to 
 visualize  it  and  you  start  to  like  work
[41:06] towards  it  and  you  know  we'll  set  some 
 goals  regarding  this  together  you  make 
 some  incredible  progress  and  it's  all
[41:11] about  where  you  set  that  goal  you  know 
 for  the  majority  of  goals  that  I've  set 
 I've  had  people  say  nope  that's  crazy
[41:16] it's  impossible  and  yet  I'm  here  it's  so 
 easy  for  your  own  brain  to  be  like  the 
 naysayer  in  this  and  so  this  is  a  very
[41:22] important  question  to  ask  yourself  how 
 far  does  your  own  mind  think  that  you 
 can  go  how  big  is  your  brain  thinking
[41:27] when  it  thought  about  this  journaling 
 prompt  of  like  where  do  you  want  to  be 
 in  10  years  from  now  and  also  take  some
[41:32] time  to  really  consider  some  very 
 important  things  do  you  want  to  be  a 
 father  10  years  from  now  chances  are  if
[41:37] you're  watching  this  10  years  from  now 
 you  probably  will  be  and  so  what  do  you 
 want  life  to  be  like  then  I  can't  really
[41:42] give  you  advice  on  this  because  this  is 
 all  based  on  you  know  your  own  desires 
 the  kind  of  life  that  you  want  the  life
[41:47] that  you  think  is  best  for  your  future 
 children  and  your  family  but  the 
 majority  of  men  don't  really  think  about
[41:52] a  question  like  this  they  just  kind  of 
 think  what  they're  going  to  eat  for 
 dinner  today  that's  as  far  as  their 
 thinking  really  goes  but  a  man  who
[41:58] thinks  in  decades  is  dangerous  and 
 that's  a  quote  from  a  man  that  I  really 
 respect  Chris  stermsley  otherwise  known
[42:03] as  first  man  men  who  think  in  decades 
 are  dangerous  so  those  three  journaling 
 prompts  should  give  you  some  kind  of
[42:08] idea  on  the  goals  that  you  should  set  so 
 now  if  you  look  back  to  that  goal 
 setting  template  that  I  got  you  to  click
[42:13] on  start  to  fill  out  some  of  those  boxes 
 what  is  a  goal  that  you  want  to  achieve 
 10  years  from  now  I've  already  put  some
[42:19] templates  and  examples  of  the  kind  of 
 goals  that  I  set  for  myself  so  you  can 
 just  kind  of  alter  them  to  fit  your  own
[42:24] desires  a  very  important  thing  that  you 
 should  do  right  now  is  to  start  off  with 
 the  longer  term  goals  the  10-year
[42:29] five-year  and  one  year  goals  and  then 
 the  monthly  Milestones  so  you  see  that
[42:34] there's  a  column  for  every  month  going 
 toward  the  next  year  those  goals  for  the 
 month  you  should  see  more  like
[42:40] Milestones  to  achieve  the  big  goals  once 
 you  have  a  document  like  this  and  your 
 goals  are  really  organized  that  becomes
[42:46] so  helpful  and  the  way  to  use  this 
 practically  in  your  normal  day-to-day 
 life  is  to  base  all  decisions  of  the
[42:52] long  term  the  one  five  ten  year  goals 
 that  you've  set  visualize  and  make 
 decisions  based  on  these  big  long-term
[42:58] goals  but  then  obsessively  focus  and 
 work  on  the  short-term  Milestones
[43:03] because  it's  these  short-term  monthly 
 Milestones  that  cause  you  to  kind  of 
 push  forward  a  bit  but  the  monthly
[43:08] milestone  for  me  kind  of  reminded  me  of 
 like  setting  a  rep  or  a  weight  goal  in 
 the  gym  it's  something  okay  I'm  focused
[43:14] on  right  here  right  now  but  the  bigger 
 thing  to  kind  of  you  know  wake  up  and 
 sort  of  make  big  decisions  about  and  to 
 visualize  is  like  the  end  of  your  goal
[43:20] five  years  from  now  so  it's  very 
 important  that  you  have  this  divide 
 between  monthly  Milestone  goals  which
[43:25] you  obsessively  work  towards  and  then 
 these  long-term  yearly  goals  which  you 
 make  decisions  based  on  once  you  finish
[43:30] this  goal  page  and  you've  added  in  all 
 the  details  that  you  want  and  you  feel 
 like  you  need  obsess  over  it  this  is  one
[43:36] of  the  most  important  things  that  I  do 
 and  if  you  want  to  take  something  from 
 me  make  it  this  obsess  over  this
[43:41] singular  practical  page  that  you  have 
 here  is  the  first  thing  that's  open  on 
 my  laptop  I  look  at  it  on  my  phone 
 anytime  you  know  you're  like  you're
[43:47] wasting  time  five  minutes  here  10 
 minutes  there  you're  waiting  in  line  for 
 something  you're  walking  somewhere  and 
 you  know  you're  just  flicking  on  your
[43:52] phone  and  of  course  you  should  try  and 
 be  more  Mindful  and  stuff  but  like 
 anytime  I'm  just  randomly  on  my  phone  I 
 don't  have  social  media  anymore  because
[43:57] I  literally  just  look  at  this  one  page 
 and  it  just  the  amount  of  intention  that 
 and  ideas  that  you  get  from  just
[44:03] obsessing  over  this  one  page  that 
 reminds  you  constantly  okay  this  is  what 
 you  said  you  would  achieve  this  month
[44:08] it's  so  valuable  because  goal  setting 
 and  goal  obsessing  is  the  single
[44:13] greatest  way  to  become  more  masculine 
 because  it  just  makes  you  so  aligned 
 with  your  work  and  your  desires  and  this
[44:19] this  feeling  this  crave  of  progress 
 because  you  see  these  goals  that  you've 
 set  out  what  they  symbolize  is  progress
[44:26] to  your  mission  and  to  your  purpose  so 
 the  total  level  the  thing  that  you  know 
 really  fulfills  men  is  having  this  huge
[44:31] Mission  this  huge  purpose  but  the  way  to 
 make  the  most  progress  to  these  things
[44:36] is  by  obsessing  over  the  goals  but  then 
 to  actually  make  progress  in  these  goals
[44:41] you  need  discipline  and  mental  health  so 
 you  want  to  be  more  masculine  and 
 relentlessly  work  towards  your  goals  and
[44:47] your  purpose  that's  where  discipline  and 
 mental  health  come  from  discipline  and 
 good  mental  health  determine  your  work
[44:52] rate  and  your  productivity  mental  health 
 especially  is  overlooked  for  a  lot  of 
 men  it's  something  that  you  know  we're
[44:57] beginning  to  talk  a  lot  about  I've 
 personally  found  that  improving  your 
 mental  health  is  the  single  best  thing 
 that  you  can  do  to  increase  your
[45:02] productive  work  output  you  know  all 
 those  productivity  tactics  you've  ever 
 heard  of  the  Pomodoro  Technique  and  all
[45:08] of  these  things  improving  your  mental 
 health  through  things  like  journaling 
 and  meditation  actually  increases  your
[45:13] output  your  productivity  more  than  all 
 of  those  things  I  made  a  two  hour  full 
 guide  that  you  can  watch  for  free  on
[45:19] improving  your  mental  health  I'll  have 
 like  a  little  card  pop  up  on  screen  and 
 I'll  have  it  linked  in  the  description 
 as  well  I  highly  recommend  you  have  a
[45:25] look  at  that  I  know  mental  health 
 doesn't  seem  like  a  very  fun  video  or 
 concept  to  like  learn  about  but  I
[45:30] promise  you  that  it  will  have  some  of 
 the  highest  return  on  investment  that 
 you  can  find  your  ability  to  just  keep 
 your  brain  operating  well  well  that's
[45:37] how  you  accomplish  anything  else 
 discipline  is  a  mindset  just  like  good 
 mental  health  it  drastically  improves
[45:43] your  work  rates  and  improving  your  work 
 rates  improves  the  progress  that  you 
 make  to  your  goals  improving  the 
 progress  that  you  make  to  your  goals
[45:49] fulfills  your  mission  and  purpose  which 
 makes  you  more  masculine  so  you  see  how 
 all  this  links  up  and  so  discipline  is 
 an  absolute  Cornerstone  virtue  and  treat
[45:57] in  masculinity  discipline  is  the  skill 
 of  doing  the  hard  work  especially  when
[46:02] you  don't  feel  like  it  I'm  gonna  say 
 something  controversial  but  in  the 
 modern  day  you've  been  conditioned  to  be
[46:07] so  in  touch  with  your  emotions  you  are 
 the  most  emotional  guy  in  touch  with 
 your  feelings  than  any  man  in  your
[46:13] bloodline  before  this  now  I  think  it's 
 fantastic  to  be  aware  of  your  emotions
[46:18] because  that's  a  practice  of  mindfulness 
 that  comes  from  like  meditation  and 
 everything  but  to  be  emotional  to  be  in
[46:23] your  feelings  well  feelings  are  fickle 
 and  this  is  why  you  see  so  many  guys 
 that  aren't  disciplined  because  they
[46:28] don't  feel  like  doing  the  hard  work 
 right  now  and  you  can  probably  relate  to 
 this  you  know  we're  not  talking  about
[46:33] any  other  guys  we're  talking  about  you 
 you  don't  feel  like  doing  some 
 productive  tasks  right  now  so  you  don't 
 do  it  you  procrastinate  you  know  that's
[46:39] kind  of  like  a  new  invention 
 procrastination  do  you  really  think  the 
 men  in  your  blood  procrastinated  they
[46:45] couldn't  there  was  a  necessity  for  them 
 to  go  to  work  into  the  factories  out  on
[46:50] the  hunt  even  when  they  didn't  feel  like 
 it  because  they  had  to  there  was  no  one 
 telling  them  oh  you  know  we'll  just  be
[46:55] in  touch  with  your  emotions  take  a 
 self-care  day  what  I'm  saying  seems  kind 
 of  backwards  it  seems  against  all  the 
 mental  health  kind  of  advice  that  you've
[47:01] heard  but  the  thing  is  it's  absolutely 
 important  to  prioritize  your  mental 
 health  but  you  need  to  learn  to  just  go
[47:07] and  do  hard  work  even  when  your  brain 
 says  like  oh  but  I  don't  feel  like  it 
 I'm  not  ready  for  it  this  is  what  my
[47:12] physique  looks  like  after  years  and 
 years  of  going  to  the  gym  and  please 
 believe  me  like  bro  going  to  the  gym  is
[47:17] one  of  the  most  fun  things  that  I  do  I 
 honestly  love  it  but  I  would  have  missed 
 more  than  half  of  my  workouts  over  the
[47:23] years  that  I've  been  training  if  I  only 
 went  to  the  gym  when  I  really  felt  like 
 it  some  days  it's  a  total  slog  I  really
[47:29] don't  want  to  go  but  you  know  what  I  do 
 I  convince  myself  that  all  I  need  to  do 
 is  just  take  the  next  step  I  don't  need
[47:34] to  think  about  the  height  of  the 
 discomfort  you  know  the  the  challenge 
 the  pain  the  fear  of  the  top  set  of
[47:39] squats  which  are  gonna  exhaust  my  body  I 
 don't  need  to  think  about  that  right  now 
 I'm  sat  here  with  my  bathrobe  all  I  have 
 to  do  is  just  change  right  now  all  I
[47:45] have  to  do  is  just  put  my  shoes  on  right 
 now  all  I  have  to  do  is  just  fill  up  my 
 water  bottle  all  I  have  to  do  is  just 
 walk  out  with  the  door  that's  all  I  tell
[47:50] myself  okay  come  on  just  walk  out  the 
 door  that's  all  you  can  do  you  you  can 
 walk  out  your  door  right  now  can't  you 
 okay  come  on  let's  walk  downstairs  you
[47:55] can  do  that  right  now  can't  you  okay 
 good  put  your  music  in  okay  let's  walk 
 to  the  gym  you  can  do  that  yeah  of 
 course  you  can  just  step  by  step  by  step
[48:00] by  step  by  step  and  suddenly  I'm  warming 
 up  I  feel  good  [ __ ]  it  let  me  attempt 
 that  PR  on  squats  this  is  discipline
[48:05] discipline  is  the  skill  of  just 
 overlooking  your  emotions  because  there 
 is  some  important  valuable  work  that  you
[48:11] said  you  would  do  you  made  a  promise  to 
 yourself  that  you  would  do  some 
 important  work  and  so  it  is  of  utmost
[48:16] importance  for  the  sake  of  your 
 masculinity  that  you  do  that  work  the 
 reason  why  I'm  getting  quite  vexed  right
[48:21] now  is  because  discipline  it's  such  an 
 important  skill  and  trait  that  I  see 
 lacking  in  so  many  young  men  so  many
[48:27] young  men  because  we  spoke  so  far  that 
 if  you  want  to  be  more  masculine  you 
 need  you  know  a  big  mission  to  work 
 towards  the  progress  towards  and  to  note
[48:33] your  progress  to  this  Mission  we  set 
 goals  and  Milestones  and  to  make 
 progress  to  them  well  you  need  to  work
[48:38] hard  and  you  need  to  especially  work 
 hard  even  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 because  that's  really  when  we  show  the
[48:43] greatest  level  of  progress  if  you  only 
 work  hard  when  you  kind  of  feel 
 motivated  to  do  so  then  you  haven't
[48:48] really  developed  yourself  as  a  man  have 
 you  so  this  is  how  you  level  up  your 
 discipline  skill  and  interestingly  it's
[48:53] the  exact  same  way  that  you  level  up  in 
 weightlifting  it's  all  about  the  concept 
 of  progressive  overload  Progressive
[49:00] overload  is  this  concept  this  kind  of 
 training  method  in  weightlifting  which 
 is  that  we  start  off  at  like  a  light
[49:05] weight  and  over  weeks  and  months  and 
 years  we  just  slowly  incrementally  add
[49:10] on  a  little  bit  of  weight  every  single 
 time  when  a  beginner  goes  to  the  gym  he 
 doesn't  think  oh  I'm  gonna  go  bench
[49:15] press  seven  plates  the  clever 
 intelligent  beginner  says  okay  I'm  gonna 
 go  and  just  start  with  the  empty  bar  and
[49:20] just  see  how  that  is  and  two  weeks  from 
 now  I  might  add  on  5kg  either  side  of 
 the  bar  maybe  10  kg  six  months  from  now
[49:26] a  year  from  now  I  might  even  have  20  kg 
 either  side  of  the  bar  and  three  years 
 from  now  it  might  even  be  40  kg  either
[49:33] side  of  the  bar  that's  100  kg  for  the 
 total  weight  we  increase  whatever  we  do 
 incrementally  that's  Progressive
[49:38] overload  and  discipline  is  the  exact 
 same  thing  you  need  to  progressively 
 overload  your  discipline  what's  very 
 interesting  about  discipline  is  that
[49:43] discipline  actually  cures  and  this  is 
 controversial  as  [ __ ]  but  discipline 
 cures  depression  depression  is  simply
[49:48] just  a  reduction  in  your  Progressive 
 overload  of  Life  you've  just  reduced  how 
 much  you're  able  to  do  of  life  you  used
[49:54] to  be  able  to  you  know  go  out  and  go  to 
 work  and  study  and  just  be  a  normal 
 person  and  now  you  fuel  like  that's  just
[49:59] too  hard  to  do  you  just  reset  your 
 Progressive  overload  and  also  all  you've 
 got  to  do  is  just  progressively  overload
[50:04] back  up  so  it's  a  struggle  doing 
 anything  more  than  just  you  know  lying 
 on  your  bed  watching  some  [ __ ] 
 YouTube  on  your  phone  so  progressively
[50:10] overload  today  get  out  of  your  bed  and 
 brush  your  teeth  that's  a  big  jump  for 
 some  people  what  are  you  up  to  in  life
[50:15] right  now  especially  in  terms  of  the 
 work  and  the  progress  that  you're  making 
 to  your  goals  and  then  figure  out  the 
 next  Progressive  overload  step  to  that
[50:21] what  is  one  step  further  that  you  can 
 take  today  tomorrow  next  week  and  then
[50:26] ask  yourself  this  every  single  day  you 
 just  constantly  want  to  be  progressively 
 overloading  your  discipline  the
[50:31] sacrifices  that  you  make  the  hard 
 choices  that  you  make  just  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  and  you  know  what  that's
[50:38] that's  really  bringing  something  that 
 you  know  a  lot  of  people  don't  really 
 talk  about  and  you  know  we  speak  about
[50:43] discipline  and  masculinity  and  goals  and 
 everything  or  you  know  online  and  you've 
 seen  this  before  you  know  like  oh  yeah 
 making  money  you  know  all  these
[50:48] productive  things  that  you've  seen 
 online  one  of  the  things  that  many  other 
 creators  don't  really  talk  about  I'm
[50:53] kind  of  going  on  around  here  but  I  think 
 this  might  be  available  for  you  it's 
 that  you  really  have  to  sacrifice  you
[50:58] have  to  sacrifice  if  you  want  to  become 
 more  masculine  you  have  to  sacrifice  a 
 lot  of  things  if  you  want  to  become  more 
 disciplined  think  about  what  you  have  to
[51:03] sacrifice  discipline  is  inherently  a 
 sacrifice  of  comfort  and  you've  been
[51:08] bred  to  stay  in  Comfort  to  just  keep 
 sucking  on  like  mommy's  nipple  I  know 
 that  sounds  weird  but  that's  literally
[51:13] the  life  of  the  majority  of  males  and  I 
 won't  even  say  men  the  majority  of  guys 
 are  males  not  men  you've  been  bred  to
[51:19] just  stay  in  a  state  of  comfort  because 
 you're  not  used  to  making  sacrifices 
 everything  that  I've  discussed  in  this
[51:24] guide  and  pretty  much  everything  I 
 discuss  on  my  Channel  all  the  work  that 
 I  do  is  based  on  sacrificing  these
[51:29] momentary  small  short  Pleasures  that 
 don't  fulfill  us  that  don't  free  us  they 
 don't  actually  just  give  us  anything
[51:34] more  than  a  fleeting  sense  of  comfort 
 but  will  always  have  that  thought  in  our 
 minds  that  we  Jeffries  you  need  to
[51:40] sacrifice  comfort  you  need  a  sacrifice 
 to  become  more  masculine  to  become 
 successful  to  become  healthy  and  you
[51:45] know  I  just  spoke  about  the  concept  of 
 progressive  overload  there  is  a  phrase 
 that  I've  said  before  that  really  helped
[51:50] me  and  the  phrase  was  sacrifice  must  be 
 progressively  overloaded  whatever  you've 
 sacrificed  so  far  to  make  progress  in
[51:57] some  disciplined  goal  like  Fitness  or 
 work  fantastic  but  you  need  to  keep 
 sacrificing  so  you  know  at  first  for
[52:02] example  for  a  beginner  to  make  progress 
 in  the  gym  he's  feeling  really 
 disciplined  yeah  he's  gonna  go  to  the 
 gym  you  know  I  don't  feel  like  going  to
[52:07] the  gym  but  [ __ ]  it  I'm  gonna  go  anyway 
 the  sacrifice  you  need  to  make  is  like 
 two  hours  per  week  three  hours  per  week
[52:12] for  the  workout  and  he's  gonna  make  some 
 gains  but  a  year  from  then  his  gains 
 slow  down  and  now  he's  gonna  need  to 
 sacrifice  for  five  hours  per  week  and
[52:19] now  he's  gonna  actually  need  to  really 
 change  up  some  of  his  meals  if  he  still 
 wants  to  continue  making  progress  now 
 two  years  from  then  five  years  from  then
[52:25] he  needs  to  sacrifice  so  much  more  he 
 needs  to  sacrifice  late  nights  alcohol 
 shitty  food  he  needs  to  be  on  an
[52:31] optimized  workout  routine  the  sacrifices 
 that  you  make  to  progress  to  your  goals 
 must  be  progressively  overloaded  over
[52:37] time  if  you  haven't  recently  Lee  added 
 more  sacrifice  to  your  life  in  the  last 
 month  I  guarantee  your  complacent  and  so
[52:43] I  have  another  journaling  prompt  for  you 
 to  do  right  now  as  another  actionable 
 step  of  this  full  guide  answer  this
[52:48] question  right  now  what  is  another 
 sacrifice  that  I  can  make  to  make  even 
 more  progress  to  my  goals  upon  thinking
[52:54] about  the  answer  to  this  question 
 there's  something  very  interesting 
 that's  going  to  happen  to  you  and  this 
 is  going  to  be  so  like  literally  10  out
[53:00] of  10  interesting  for  you  to  follow 
 along  to  right  now  be  extremely  aware  of 
 your  mind  trying  to  [ __ ]  you  there
[53:06] will  be  a  potential  sacrifice  that  you 
 could  make  to  be  more  disciplined  to 
 make  more  progress  in  your  goals  which
[53:11] will  then  make  you  more  masculine  and 
 your  brain  will  not  want  to  acknowledge 
 it  because  you're  asking  your  brain  to
[53:16] come  up  with  ideas  to  sacrifice  comfort 
 your  brain  will  not  want  to  acknowledge 
 it  but  you're  just  about  if  you  really
[53:21] pay  attention  and  you  stay  authentic  and 
 honest  you'll  just  about  know  what  it  is 
 you'll  just  about  think  of  a  sacrifice
[53:27] that  you  could  make  and  the  Jeffrey  part 
 of  your  brain  will  want  to  push  it  away 
 stay  so  aware  of  this  right  now  you  know
[53:32] what  I'm  gonna  do  in  front  of  you  right 
 now  what  is  another  sacrifice  that  I 
 could  make  to  make  even  more  progress  to
[53:37] my  goals  the  goal  goals  that  I'm  talking 
 about  I'll  make  it  based  on  on  YouTube 
 specifically  like  work  what  is  another
[53:43] sacrifice  that  I  can  make 
 I  need  to  record  more  I  don't  record
[53:48] that  often  and  that's  actually  slowing 
 down  the  growth  of  like  our  output  and 
 the  growth  of  the  channel  and  the  video
[53:53] editor  who's  editing  this  video  right 
 now  will  even  tell  you  he's  been  waiting 
 like  a  day  two  days  for  me  to  send  him
[53:58] over  this  clip  I  don't  prioritize 
 recording  because  honestly  it's  just 
 it's  so  much  friction  it's  so  stressful 
 having  to  sit  here  it's  exhausting  to
[54:04] sit  here  and  talk  for  like  an  hour  and 
 to  think  of  things  to  say  you  know  of 
 course  I've  got  like  bullet  points  here
[54:09] on  my  laptop  but  it's  it's  the  hardest 
 part  of  my  job  is  literally  recording 
 the  videos  another  sacrifice  that  I  can
[54:14] make  to  level  up  in  my  goals  even  more 
 is  to  just  record  more  I  didn't  even
[54:19] want  to  answer  that  question  honest  I 
 didn't  want  to  like  say  to  you  you  know 
 my  brains  like  [ __ ]  and  it  was  like 
 honorable  you  know
[54:25] um  if  you  record  less  the  quality  might 
 be  higher  if  you  if  you  don't  answer 
 this  question  with  you  know  the  answer
[54:31] of  recording  then  you  can  just  not 
 record  as  often  and  focus  on  other 
 things  the  real  answer  to  this  question
[54:36] was  me  telling  you  yeah  what's  a 
 sacrifice  I  can  make  I  can  just  shut  the 
 [ __ ]  up  and  record  more  often  the 
 Forefront  of  my  mind  the  answer  that  my
[54:43] Jeffrey  brain  wanted  me  to  answer  with 
 interestingly  it  was  like  oh  yeah  do 
 more  podcast  us  and  do  more  like  easy 
 work  spend  more  time  doing  that  kind  of
[54:49] like  laptop  kind  of  work  but  the  real 
 sacrifice  would  be  for  me  to  do 
 something  that  I  don't  actually  want  to
[54:54] do  which  there's  more  friction  to  which 
 requires  more  discipline  which  is 
 recording  it's  the  harder  thing  to  do
[54:59] what  is  your  answer  to  this  question 
 okay  so  so  far  of  this  full  guide  you've 
 learned  a  lot  about  masculine  traits  how
[55:05] to  become  more  masculine  you've  learned 
 about  polarization  you've  heard  my  story 
 we've  even  talked  about  discipline  and
[55:10] goal  setting  now  for  the  rest  of  this 
 full  guide  I  want  to  just  fire  off  a 
 bunch  of  random  things  that  I  think  will
[55:15] help  you  in  your  journey  to  become  more 
 masculine  and  these  are  going  to  be 
 really  interesting  and  really  practical 
 and  the  first  part  of  this  section  which
[55:20] I  think  is  very  very  valuable  is  semen 
 retention  I  thought  for  a  long  time  I
[55:26] thought  things  like  nofap  and  human 
 retention  were  kind  of  overrated  because 
 I've  been  on  nofap  since  age  18  and  you
[55:32] know  it  did  change  my  life  quite 
 practically  because  I  just  wasn't 
 spending  hours  watching  porn  you  know  I
[55:37] used  to  be  like  a  normal  15  year  old 
 like  masturbating  three  times  a  day  and 
 it's  been  a  while  since  I've  been  a
[55:42] wanker  so  I  can't  really  relate  anymore 
 so  nofap  is  okay  just  no  masturbation  no
[55:47] porn  right  but  then  I've  always  done 
 nofap  but  while  still  having  sex  semen
[55:52] retention  is  the  next  level  where  of 
 course  you're  on  nofap  but  you  also 
 either  don't  have  sex  or  if  you  do  have
[55:57] sex  this  is  the  hardest  thing  right  the 
 hardest  thing  is  having  sex  but  then  not
[56:02] busting  I  don't  want  to  make  this  like 
 too  graphically  detailed  and  you  know  to 
 get  demonetized  on  YouTube  or  anything  I
[56:08] am  gonna  release  a  sex  course  sometime 
 in  the  future  which  I  think  you  might 
 find  very  interesting  where  I'm  gonna
[56:13] speak  totally  unfiltered  and  like  in 
 Practical  details  of  how  I've  been  able 
 to  like  use  self-improvements  and  you
[56:18] know  improve  my  sex  life  and  a  big  part 
 of  that  is  SEMA  retention  and  the  act  of 
 like  having  sex  but  not  coming  and  like
[56:24] being  able  to  last  way  longer  being  able 
 to  have  sex  way  way  more  times  per  day 
 something  that  I've  been  practicing  more
[56:29] recently  and  it's  amazing  how  much  more 
 masculine  energy  I  feel  when  it's  been
[56:34] days  or  a  week  since  I've  ejaculated 
 there  was  an  article  I  read  and  it  was
[56:39] sent  to  me  by  another  YouTuber  his 
 YouTube  name  is  masculine  Theory  his 
 name  is  Joseph  and  he's  very  clued  up
[56:44] and  very  intelligent  about  things  like 
 retention  and  speaks  about  it  a  lot  on 
 his  channel  and  this  article  that  I'll 
 link  in  the  description  said  that  your
[56:50] masculine  seed  is  like  an  extremely 
 valuable  Life  Source  that  you  don't  want
[56:55] to  waste  it  was  quoted  in  this  article 
 I'm  not  sure  if  this  is  really 
 scientifically  you  know  correct  but  it
[57:00] does  make  for  a  really  good  example  that 
 one  drop  of  semen  is  the  equivalent  of
[57:05] 40  drops  of  blood  now  I  want  to  speak  in 
 a  very  practical  terms  about  retention 
 when  I'm  on  retention  even  when  having
[57:11] sex  my  level  of  masculinity  goes  through 
 the  roof  it  seems  very  normal  to  you 
 know  be  on  nofap  and  then  when  you're
[57:16] having  sex  to  just  have  sex  and  you  know 
 like  just  you  know  try  and  Edge  a  little 
 bit  they're  trying  to  last  as  long  as
[57:21] you  can  and  then  eventually  like  not 
 yeah  that's  normal  right  what  I've  found 
 is  that  if  you  have  sex  and  you  don't
[57:26] finish  or  just  in  general  if  you're  not 
 having  sex  if  you're  not  busting  any 
 nuts  you're  literally  just  retaining 
 completely  your  ability  to  focus  your
[57:32] ability  to  work  hard  goes  through  the 
 roof  and  I  think  why  this  is  is  because 
 your  brain  kind  of  understands  that  one
[57:38] he's  not  ejaculating  so  he  doesn't  you 
 know  there's  no  woman  that  he's  sleeping 
 with  and  so  two  since  he's  not  doing
[57:43] what's  essentially  a  very  important  part 
 of  of  manhood  we  need  to  pump  him  full
[57:48] of  drive  and  masculinity  and  motivation 
 and  desire  so  that  he  can  improve
[57:53] himself  to  level  up  the  the  social 
 hierarchy  so  that  then  he  can  become 
 eligible  to  mates  what  I  found  is  that
[57:58] after  just  three  to  five  days  of  not 
 busting  any  nuts  my  drive  my  masculinity
[58:03] goes  through  the  [ __ ]  roof  my  work 
 rate  goes  through  the  roof  perhaps 
 you're  watching  this  video  the  full
[58:08] guide  to  masculinity  sometime  in  the 
 future  and  I  already  have  a  full  sex 
 course  released  this  thing  there's  more
[58:14] like  details  that  I  want  to  go  into  but 
 you  don't  know  who's  going  to  be 
 watching  this  video  and  everything  and 
 so  you  can't  say  too  many  details  about
[58:19] like  sexual  stuff  on  YouTube  that's  why 
 I'm  gonna  have  like  a  full  sex  course 
 released  perhaps  I'll  have  a  card  pop-up
[58:24] or  a  link  in  the  description  that  you 
 can  go  and  look  for  right  now  if  you're 
 interested  in  that  let's  now  talk  about
[58:29] achieving  Freedom  which  is  a  masculine 
 man's  biggest  desire  masculine  men 
 desire  Freedom  feminine  women  desire
[58:35] fulfillment  We  crave  freedom  from 
 constraints  even  the  way  that  we  have 
 sex  is  all  about  freeing  ourselves
[58:40] whereas  for  a  woman  it's  all  about  being 
 filled  up  but  even  in  the  rest  of  our 
 lives  you  can  only  feel  totally  happy
[58:46] and  content  if  you  have  a  great  level  of 
 freedom  in  which  you  aren't  placed  on 
 the  constraints  by  someone  like  your
[58:52] boss  or  Society  there's  three  kinds  of 
 Freedom  which  we're  going  to  practically 
 discuss  and  you  need  to  make  progress  to
[58:58] these  three  kinds  and  every  step  that 
 you  take  in  the  right  direction  you  will 
 literally  feel  good  the  three  kinds  of
[59:05] Freedom  are  Financial  Freedom  time 
 freedom  and  location  Freedom  each  one  of
[59:10] these  could  be  a  whole  video  by  itself 
 of  how  to  achieve  Financial  Freedom  how 
 to  beat  location  Independence  and  so  I'm 
 just  going  to  give  you  some  practical  no
[59:16] BS  advice  and  I'm  gonna  try  and  make  it 
 the  kind  of  advice  that  you  might  not 
 have  heard  of  anywhere  else  for 
 Financial  Freedom  the  only  way  that  you
[59:22] can  achieve  this  when  you're  young  is 
 with  some  kind  of  business  you  can't  get 
 financially  free  in  even  the  most  high
[59:27] level  careers  which  take  20  years  to  get 
 to  and  so  it  has  to  be  with  a  business
[59:32] any  20  year  old  millionaire  that  you  do 
 see  or  hear  off  on  YouTube  it's  always 
 through  business  and  then  mediums  are
[59:38] high  risk  Investments  and  so  you  can  go 
 down  the  entire  rabbit  hole  if  you  want 
 to  but  the  two-step  process  to  achieving
[59:43] Financial  Freedom  when  you're  still 
 young  is  one  create  a  success  successful 
 business  and  this  in  itself  can  take
[59:48] years  and  you  need  to  work  extremely 
 hard  you  need  to  sacrifice  there's  an 
 element  of  luck  involved  and  number  two
[59:53] invest  the  income  that  you  make  from 
 that  business  into  things  like  crypto 
 which  are  a  lot  higher  yielding  like
[59:58] they  give  you  more  money  in  return  than 
 things  like  index  funds  and  all  the  soft 
 passive  stuff  one  thing  to  know  about
[60:03] achieving  Financial  Freedom  that  your 
 parents  are  wrong  with  that  any  of  these 
 Financial  gurus  that  write  like
[60:08] Financial  books  they'll  always  tell  you 
 that  saving  and  investing  is  like  the 
 best  route  to  Financial  Freedom  that's
[60:13] the  old  script  anyone  who  tells  you  that 
 saving  money  like  oh  yeah  go  and  get  a 
 really  good  job  and  then  save  as  much 
 money  as  possible  and  then  put  that
[60:19] money  into  the  index  funds  and  they  want 
 to  give  you  that  advice  as  following  the 
 old  script  the  new  script  is  all  about 
 business  time  Freedom  means  that  you
[60:25] have  control  and  power  over  your  own 
 time  and  you  can't  really  say  that  you 
 have  this  if  you  can't  choose  exactly
[60:31] what  time  you  want  to  work  go  to  the  gym 
 or  do  anything  else  with  your  day  the 
 majority  of  people  who  work  nine  to  five
[60:36] or  who  are  still  in  the  education  system 
 don't  have  this  and  this  is  why  you 
 quite  frequently  get  this  like
[60:41] irritation  feeling  when  you  need  to  go 
 to  work  or  you  need  to  go  to  school  when 
 you  don't  really  want  to  to  to  achieve
[60:47] time  Freedom  you  should  read  the  book 
 the  four  hour  work  week  and  also 
 implement  the  principles  from  the  book
[60:52] deep  work  I  have  a  full  guide  explaining 
 the  Deep  workbook  and  I'll  have  like  a 
 card  pop  up  on  screen  or  a  link  in  the
[60:58] description  so  you  can  go  and  find  that 
 and  finally  location  Freedom  means  that 
 you  can  go  anywhere  in  the  world  that
[61:03] you  want  and  still  be  okay  for  location 
 Freedom  it's  all  about  making  online 
 income  and  there's  a  famous  young
[61:08] entrepreneur  named  Iman  gazi  and  he  held 
 this  like  YouTube  event  where  he  taught 
 people  how  to  achieve  location  Freedom
[61:14] through  making  online  businesses  if  you 
 can  cultivate  all  three  freedoms  into 
 your  life  you  get  to  live  like  the  top
[61:21] one  percent  I've  just  mentioned  Eman 
 that  online  entrepreneur  that  we  spoke 
 about  he  has  a  free  event  coming  up
[61:26] where  he's  going  to  teach  people 
 together  three  freedoms  and  I'm  gonna 
 appear  as  a  guest  speaker  I'm  gonna  like 
 teach  my  own  section  in  this  to  learn
[61:32] more  scroll  down  to  the  description  of 
 this  video  and  click  on  the  Iman  Gotti 
 link  and  you'll  be  able  to  sign  up  in
[61:37] advance  and  you'll  learn  so  much  more 
 about  Financial  Freedom  time  freedom  and 
 location  Freedom  men  need  tribes
[61:43] especially  masculine  men  and  I'm  gonna 
 go  into  another  Ransom  kill  your  seat 
 belts  bro  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a
[61:48] conspiracy  theory  or  not  but  male  spaces 
 are  being  abolished  male  locker  room 
 talk  is  demonized  and  any  space  that  men
[61:54] gather  is  now  seen  as  like  potentially 
 dangerous  or  hostile  or  full  of  incels 
 you  single  a  man  away  from  his  tribe  he
[62:01] loses  most  of  his  strength  what's  very 
 interesting  is  that  you've  lived  your 
 life  as  kind  of  like  an  individual  man
[62:06] you've  probably  never  had  like  a  full-on 
 real  kind  of  tribe  that  your  ancestors 
 would  have  had  and  so  any  level  of
[62:12] success  and  strength  that  you  feel  like 
 you  have  think  about  this  you've 
 literally  not  even  experienced  the  life
[62:17] that  like  your  ancestors  would  have 
 imagine  your  ancestors  like  the  tribes 
 men  would  have  lived  in  tribes  of  150
[62:22] and  there's  like  20  30  men  of  like 
 Warrior  Hunter  age  all  keeping  each
[62:27] other  accountable  you  can't  be  a  little 
 [ __ ]  you  can't  skip  out  on  the  hunt 
 today  because  you'll  get  called  out  so 
 that  now  come  with  us  the  village  Elders
[62:33] the  male  Elders  would  have  put  you 
 through  a  rite  of  passage  that  would 
 have  turned  you  officially  into  a  man
[62:38] you  don't  even  grasp  how  important  this 
 is  for  male  life  because  we've  never
[62:43] experienced  it  before  [ __ ]  man  I  hope 
 you  can  take  a  few  seconds  to  just  kind 
 of  think  about  how  much  we're  missing
[62:48] out  on  because  we  don't  have  like  a  real 
 real  tribe  of  men  around  us  we're  just
[62:53] also  individual  and  you're  being 
 convinced  that  like  oh  yeah  be  friends 
 with  girls  men  can  be
[62:59] that's  sad  man  and  I  think  you  know  one 
 of  the  reasons  why  my  channel  has  become 
 so  successful  is  because  this  has  been
[63:05] and  is  and  will  always  be  a  space  for 
 men  you  know  how  easy  it  would  have  been 
 for  me  to  sell  out  and  start  like
[63:11] becoming  more  modern  and  accepting  of 
 women  and  like  oh  you  know  I  like  oh  I 
 don't  know  you  know  like  to  be  more
[63:16] androgynous  and  to  start  making  more 
 videos  for  women  because  they  need 
 self-improvement  too  and  all  this  [ __ ] 
 you  know  I  could  have  done  that  and
[63:21] maybe  increased  our  audience  count  by  50 
 but  I  won't  this  is  a  space  for  men
[63:26] because  we  desperately  need  it  because 
 male  spaces  are  being  taken  away  from  us 
 what  you  see  on  this  channel  in  the
[63:32] comments  below  and  especially  in  our 
 Discord  server  is  a  space  for  men  where
[63:37] you  can  cultivate  a  tribe  of  your  own  I 
 have  my  Discord  server  Linked  In  the 
 description  I  think  there's  like  60  70
[63:42] 000  young  men  who  are  in  that  server 
 we've  seen  so  many  pictures  you  know 
 people  will  literally  meet  up  other
[63:47] people  in  the  Discord  server  of  my 
 Discord  server  they'll  meet  each  other 
 you  know  oh  like  I'm  in  I'm  in
[63:52] Netherlands  it's  all  someone  else  is  in 
 Netherlands  oh  bro  let's  go  do  a  gym 
 workout  and  we've  seen  so  many  pictures
[63:57] of  people  like  yo  like  we  literally  met 
 from  this  so  over  there's  now  another 
 website  that  a  mod  and  like  his  group
[64:03] have  made  from  my  server  which  makes  it 
 very  easy  for  you  to  actually  find 
 people  in  your  country  so  that  you  can
[64:08] organize  meetups  I'll  have  that  Linked 
 In  the  description  of  this  video  but 
 there's  no  like  money  to  be  made  or 
 anything  like  this  you  literally  just
[64:13] click  on  the  link  and  it  finds  out  what 
 country  you're  in  and  then  it  invites 
 you  to  join  a  Discord  server  that's
[64:18] based  on  your  country  and  also  like 
 self-improvement  mixed  together  so 
 you'll  literally  find  like  a  like-minded 
 guys  who  want  to  become  more  masculine
[64:24] more  successful  more  disciplined  all 
 congregating  in  this  one  Discord  server 
 where  you  can  then  utilize  that  to  meet
[64:30] people  online  and  this  is  all  totally 
 for  free  I'll  have  all  this  stuff  Linked 
 In  the  description  below  under  like  make 
 friends  on  self-improvements  because
[64:35] this  is  so  important  I  would  not  be  half 
 the  man  that  I  am  today  if  I  did  not
[64:40] have  other  men  in  my  life  and  it  saddens 
 me  to  see  young  men  who  don't  have  that 
 perhaps  you're  new  to  this  Channel  and
[64:46] discovering  me  but  these  videos  that  I 
 produce  here  and  like  me  teaching  you 
 what  I  know  and  I've  learned  myself  it
[64:52] could  potentially  change  your  life  what 
 you  see  on  this  YouTube  channel  is  kind 
 of  like  a  movement  of  younger  men  who
[64:57] are  all  trying  to  improve  ourselves  and 
 this  can  be  a  part  of  your  tribe  you  and 
 I  let's  be  honest  we're  not  technically
[65:02] friends  you  know  a  lot  of  YouTubers  will 
 try  and  manipulate  you  and  say  like  oh 
 yeah  we're  friends  hey  hey  friends  like 
 you  know  they'll  try  and  do  that  [ __ ]
[65:07] I'll  never  look  at  you  like  through  the 
 camera  like  oh  me  and  you  are  best 
 friends  or  something  but  the  truth  is 
 you  know  that  quote  like  you  are  the
[65:13] average  of  The  Five  People  You  spend 
 time  with  which  is  very  very  true  well 
 it's  more  accurate  now  to  say  that  you 
 are  the  average  of  the  five  people  whose
[65:20] content  you  consume  if  you  consume  my 
 content  you'll  become  more  like  me  it 
 sounds  cringe  as  [ __ ]  but  for  that
[65:25] reason  make  sure  like  you  subscribe  to 
 this  Channel  and  click  on  the  post 
 notifications  and  click  the  like  button
[65:30] and  you  know  support  the  videos  and 
 stuff  and  like  you  know  be  active  in 
 this  community  because  the  amount  of 
 guys  who  have  told  me  that  this  stuff
[65:35] has  changed  their  life  is  amazing  we've 
 just  spoke  about  cultivating  a  tribe  of
[65:40] masculine  men  that  you  can  grow 
 alongside  but  there  is  a  part  of  having 
 other  men  in  your  life  that  you  probably
[65:46] aren't  really  just  capable  of  right  now 
 and  that  is  to  enjoy  your  friend's
[65:51] criticism  masculine  men  criticize  each 
 other  this  is  so  interesting  you're 
 gonna  find  this  interesting  as  [ __ ]
[65:56] masculine  men  criticize  each  other  to 
 each  other's  pieces  if  me  and  my  friend 
 Sam  are  here  and  I  spot  some  kind  of
[66:02] weakness  in  him  I'll  look  at  him  and 
 tell  him  imagine  why  we  do  that  it's 
 kind  of  like  okay  well  he's  in  my  tribe
[66:07] I  can  see  this  weakness  I'm  gonna  tell 
 him  and  hopefully  he  can  take  it  well  so 
 that  he  can  improve  on  that  weakness  so 
 that  the  tribe  strengthens  and  my  chance
[66:13] of  survival  increases  you  know  what's 
 really  interesting  feminine  women  don't 
 do  this  they  criticize  but  not  to  each
[66:18] other's  faces  because  for  them  their 
 survival  mechanism  is  not  based  on  this 
 other  woman  being  healthy  and  you  know
[66:25] improving  her  weaknesses  if  anything  a 
 feminine  woman's  survival  comes  from 
 other  women  not  doing  so  well  it's  a
[66:31] very  interesting  Dynamic  and  of  course 
 you  know  people  say  oh  this  is  sexist 
 girls  don't  gossip  and  you  know  whatever 
 but  generally  you've  always  heard  that
[66:36] kind  of  stereotype  maybe  you've  seen  it 
 in  your  own  life  with  the  women  in  your 
 family  or  your  friends  and  the  male 
 friends  there's  a  chance  that  some  of
[66:41] your  male  friends  that  you  thought  were 
 like  bullies  or  some  of  your  male  family 
 members  perhaps  your  father  have
[66:46] criticized  you  to  your  face  and  said 
 like  no  no  you  don't  look  good  in  that 
 why  so  weak  why  are  you  such  a  pushover 
 why  you  so  lazy  you  know  they've  said
[66:52] this  to  you  and  all  this  time  because 
 we've  been  raised  in  this  like  little 
 [ __ ]  feminine  way  we've  been  thinking 
 like  oh  well  that's  so  offensive  and  for
[66:58] me  personally  holy  [ __ ]  bro  oh  my  dad 
 has  done  this  since  I  was  a  child  and  I 
 always  hated  him  for  it  where  he  would
[67:03] point  out  my  weaknesses  he  would 
 criticize  my  weaknesses  and  I  thought 
 that  was  a  bad  trait  in  him  I  was  so
[67:08] certain  it  was  a  bad  trait  well  I  think 
 about  it  it  seems  weird  that  I'm  kind  of 
 insinuating  that  it's  not  about  trait  it
[67:13] might  even  be  in  your  mind  right  now  no 
 it  is  a  back  trade  it  is  like  why  would 
 someone  criticize  that's  not  nice  we
[67:18] have  such  a  deep  rooted  feminine 
 upbringing  that  we  don't  even  understand 
 a  core  component  of  masculinity  is
[67:24] criticizing  and  highlighting  the 
 weaknesses  of  the  men  in  your  tribe 
 because  since  school  you've  been  raised
[67:29] to  like  be  nice  and  not  say  anything 
 like  negative  towards  the  other  person 
 because  if  you  do  call  out  someone  else
[67:34] for  their  weakness  in  this  modern  day 
 it's  extremely  offensive  and  they'll 
 start  crying  and  they'll  be  you  know 
 you'll  offend  them  and  they'll  hurt
[67:39] their  feelings  and  so  if  you  hurt 
 someone's  feelings  in  this  modern  day 
 then  you're  wrong  right  if  you  start  to 
 make  friends  with  more  masculine  men
[67:45] understand  and  be  ready  for  this  concept 
 that  they  will  begin  to  criticize  you
[67:50] like  the  real  men  who  actually  really 
 really  love  you  and  who  are  masculine 
 will  criticize  you  they'll  just  bring  up
[67:55] something  like  oh  bro  that  doesn't  look 
 so  good  on  you  or  like  Yay  push  harder 
 like  why  are  you  doing  that  thing 
 they'll  bring  help  stuff  like  this  and
[68:00] you  really  want  to  cultivate  a 
 Brotherhood  of  men  a  couple  of  guys  who
[68:05] can  speak  to  you  so  openly  they'll  just 
 look  you  in  the  eyes  and  tell  you  here's 
 something  that's  wrong  with  you  with  the
[68:10] attempt  to  help  you  to  improve  it  and  so 
 when  you  do  experience  some  kind  of 
 masculine  criticism  from  like  a  man  in
[68:15] your  tribe  don't  be  offended  don't  get 
 emotional  get  to  work  now  if  you  want  to 
 level  this  up  you  will  get  my  respect
[68:20] for  this  because  this  is  difficult 
 actively  seek  out  that  criticism  go 
 where  you  can  get  criticized  start  a
[68:27] YouTube  channel  and  talk  about  your 
 self-improvement  journey  like  I've  done 
 bro  you  don't  even  realize  the  amount  of 
 criticism  that  I've  received  over  the
[68:33] last  two  years  it's  [ __ ]  incredible 
 imagine  the  audience  size  that  I  have 
 brought  I'm  one  man  look  how  many  people
[68:39] watch  my  videos  of  course  like  you  know 
 my  team  of  help  but  in  terms  of  like 
 just  you  know  be  getting  criticism  it's 
 me  on  the  camera  right  imagine  how  many
[68:45] negative  comments  I've  had  and  not  just 
 from  trolls  who  are  just  swearing  or 
 something  but  from  like  intelligent
[68:50] people  who  have  pointed  out  a  weakness 
 and  means  I  know  Hamza  you've  done 
 something  wrong  here  and  of  course  it 
 hurts  of  course  I  feel  bad  about  it  but
[68:55] I've  tried  my  absolute  best  to  hear  that 
 criticism  and  to  take  it  on  board  and 
 you  can  see  if  you've  been  a  fan  of  mine
[69:01] for  a  long  time  you  can  see  the  times 
 where  I've  like  I've  received  quite  a 
 lot  of  criticism  for  something  and  I've
[69:06] corrected  course  each  and  every  time  to 
 the  point  that  my  journey  is  extremely 
 extremely  special  the  amount  of
[69:12] development  that  I've  been  through  and 
 this  could  be  the  same  for  you  if  you 
 put  yourself  in  an  area  where  you  can 
 get  criticized  you  will  grow  so  much
[69:18] snigo  said  this  to  me  on  a  live  stream 
 that  live  streaming  for  him  was  a  place 
 that  he  was  getting  so  much  criticism
[69:23] but  that  after  a  little  while  it  kind  of 
 mentally  fortituded  him  it  makes  you 
 strong  by  pointing  out  your  weaknesses
[69:29] we  as  modern  young  men  we  don't  really 
 have  this  in  our  lives  I  didn't  for  so 
 long  I  would  we  stay  like  sheltered  and
[69:36] safe  safe  from  criticism  safe  from  being 
 offended  that  just  leaves  you  blind  you 
 need  the  kind  of  men  who  confidently  but
[69:43] in  more  of  a  loving  way  will  call  you 
 out  on  your  [ __ ]  now  and  only  now
[69:48] after  we've  covered  every  other  part  of 
 masculinity  and  friendship  and 
 self-improvement  do  I  want  to  speak
[69:53] about  being  masculine  in  a  relationship 
 because  it's  in  my  belief  that  you 
 should  probably  wait  to  get  into  like  a
[69:58] real  serious  relationship  up  until 
 you're  truly  ready  and  I  think  you'll 
 only  really  be  ready  when  you've  already
[70:03] cultivated  a  bunch  of  male  friends 
 you've  worked  on  your  purpose  your  goals 
 your  self-improvements  there  are  two
[70:08] dynamics  that  you  could  have  in  a 
 relationship  with  a  woman  the  first 
 Dynamic  is  the  incorrect  Dynamic  and  it
[70:14] might  be  the  one  that  you've  already  had 
 previously  this  is  the  mother  son 
 Dynamic  where  she  acts  and  thinks  and
[70:20] behaves  like  the  mother  and  you  act  and 
 think  and  behave  like  the  sun  the  second 
 Dynamic  that  you  can  have  in  a
[70:25] relationship  is  in  my  opinion  the  right 
 one  and  that  is  the  father-daughter 
 dynamic  that's  where  you  act  think  and
[70:30] behave  like  the  father  and  she  acts 
 thinks  and  behaves  like  the  daughter  the 
 overwhelming  majority  of  couples  that  I
[70:37] see  have  the  wrong  Dynamic  she's  more  of 
 the  Mummy  he's  more  of  the  sun  she  walks 
 in  through  the  door  and  she  goes  to  the
[70:42] waiter  and  she  orders  the  meal  and  then 
 he  kind  of  stands  behind  her  like  really 
 really  like  you  know  just  like  a  little
[70:47] chump  and  it's  almost  like  she  she  kind 
 of  tells  us  like  come  on  come  on  Timmy 
 or  order  your  lunch  Timmy  don't  worry
[70:52] I'll  pay  once  you  keep  these  two 
 Dynamics  in  mind  it  is  so  much  easier  to
[70:57] navigate  the  right  kind  of  Sexual  Energy 
 Mass  clean  feminine  polarized 
 relationship  than  just  how  the  majority
[71:02] of  people  do  where  they  just  kind  of 
 like  get  into  a  relationship  without 
 thinking  about  these  things  think  back 
 to  the  relationships  that  you've  had  or
[71:07] the  girls  that  you've  had  a  crush  on  has 
 it  been  the  father-daughter  dynamic 
 where  you  kind  of  act  like  more  like  the
[71:12] Father  the  leader  the  strong  person  and 
 she's  the  daughter  who  you're  kind  of 
 bringing  and  showing  to  the  world  that
[71:17] you  take  care  of  her  you  are  responsible 
 for  her  or  is  it  the  other  way  around  is 
 it  that  she's  kind  of  looking  after  you
[71:22] and  she  plans  things  and  she  tells  you 
 what  to  do  and  you're  just  a  good  little 
 boy  who  you  know  gets  loud  every  now  and
[71:27] then  and  pretends  he's  in  charge  but 
 really  it's  her  be  totally  honest 
 because  it  is  uncomfortable  as  [ __ ]  to 
 admit  this  and  I  don't  think  the
[71:32] majority  of  men  could  admit  this  but  you 
 know  what  I've  had  the  wrong  dynamic  in 
 multiple  relationships  I've  had  the
[71:37] mother-son  dynamic  in  multiple 
 relationships  and  [ __ ]  me  is  it  wrong
[71:42] bro  holy  so  how  does  the  father  behave 
 well  he's  the  leader  he  makes  the
[71:47] decisions  and  the  choices  that  doesn't 
 mean  that  he'll  never  ask  his  girl  what 
 she  wants  to  do  he'll  he'll  ask  for  her
[71:52] inputs  but  in  the  end  it's  gonna  be  him 
 that  makes  the  decision  the  father 
 provides  you  should  have  this  it's  kind
[71:57] of  cringe  but  you  should  have  just  like 
 Daddy  the  energy  you  should  have  this 
 father  kind  of  energy  where  you're  the
[72:02] leader  you're  the  one  who's  taking 
 charge  you  don't  say  to  her  like  oh 
 Mommy  what  do  you  want  to  eat  or
[72:07] whatever  you  want  you  just  say  come  on 
 get  ready  we're  going  to  this  place  a 
 lot  of  women  who  are  watching  this  right 
 now  may  say  that  what  I'm  saying  is  like
[72:13] weird  and  they'll  be  like  oh  no  I  don't 
 want  like  a  father  a  daughter  thing  but 
 the  overwhelming  majority  of  women  would
[72:18] prefer  to  be  led  in  a  relationship  and 
 the  women  who  don't  want  to  be  led  who 
 want  to  lead  chances  are  you  probably
[72:24] don't  want  to  date  them  anyway  whenever 
 you  find  yourself  getting  closer  and 
 closer  to  a  girl  just  ask  yourself  that 
 question  is  this  the  father-daughter
[72:30] dynamic  I  don't  think  I  need  to  explain 
 it  much  more  than  that  for  some  reason 
 just  those  two  words  father  daughter
[72:35] just  instantly  it's  like  we  all  know 
 what  that  kind  of  would  look  like  in  a 
 male  female  relationship  it's  got  that
[72:41] kind  of  polarized  relationship  where 
 she's  thinking  about  you  all  the  time 
 and  you're  the  most  important  person  in
[72:46] her  life  you  know  that's  the  kind  of 
 dynamic  that  it  always  has  for  all  of 
 humanity  up  until  the  last  50  years  if
[72:51] you  want  that  kind  of  relationship 
 there's  some  other  things  you're  gonna 
 have  to  do  which  a  lot  of  guys  now  when
[72:57] there's  more  requirements  of  you  we'll 
 disagree  with  this  video  you're  gonna 
 have  to  provide  and  you've  always  heard
[73:02] that  mild  masculinity  is  about  providing 
 you  always  heard  that  but  you  want  to 
 know  the  real  practical  explanation  of
[73:07] providing  it  means  that  you  work  so  hard 
 and  you  become  so  successful  and  Wealthy 
 that  she  doesn't  need  to  work  that  you
[73:12] pay  for  everything  I'm  not  talking  50 
 50.  I'm  talking  you  pay  for  everything 
 she  doesn't  make  her  own  money  this  is
[73:19] where  all  the  little  fakers  who've  been 
 maybe  watching  this  far  of  the  video 
 thinking  oh  yeah  masculinity  sounds
[73:24] amazing  this  is  the  sacrifice  that  you 
 have  to  make  and  so  many  guys  will  now 
 say  oh  well  that's  the  other  that's
[73:29] disgusting  that's  something  this  is  how 
 relationships  have  always  been  and  for 
 the  modern  man  with  his  low  testosterone
[73:35] in  his  [ __ ]  weak  limp  handshake  to 
 say  that  this  is  simping  if  you  imagine 
 like  a  hundred  years  ago  of  a  man
[73:40] wearing  like  a  suit  and  a  top  hat  taking 
 his  lady  out  for  dinner  do  you  think 
 he's  simping  when  he  pays  for  her  now
[73:45] you  may  say  oh  well  actually  you  know  he 
 had  to  back  then  because  she  couldn't 
 work  because  you  know  girls  weren't
[73:50] getting  jobs  but  like  now  they  can  work 
 okay  fine  but  if  you  wanted  to  date  like 
 a  modern  masculine  woman  you  wouldn't  be
[73:55] watching  this  video  if  you  want  to  be 
 more  masculine  you  want  to  date  a  truly 
 feminine  woman  well  then  you  don't  want 
 to  go  out  and  working  for  someone  else
[74:01] I'm  going  to  say  something  right  now 
 that  you  may  have  never  heard  of  before 
 a  woman  is  always  submitting  to  a  man
[74:07] she  is  always  submitting  to  a  man  and 
 guess  what  this  great  movement  of 
 feminism  has  done  that  even  some  a  lot
[74:12] of  guys  are  now  backing  you  know  saying 
 like  oh  well  she  makes  her  own  money  so 
 I'm  not  going  to  pay  for  everything 
 she's  always  submitting  to  a  man  it  used
[74:18] to  be  that  your  woman  would  submit  to 
 you  100  now  guess  what  for  the  majority 
 of  women  in  these  little  weak  men  who
[74:23] who  say  that  they  won't  pay  for  their 
 woman  well  now  she's  submitting  to  her 
 boss  so  I  know  that  this  seems
[74:28] incredibly  ambitious  for  me  to  say  like 
 you  should  pay  for  everything  and  she 
 should  pay  for  nothing  and  this  is  going
[74:33] to  be  so  controversial  and  this  is  not 
 an  easy  goal  to  like  you  know  achieve 
 for  yourself  Perhaps  it  is  a  goal  that
[74:38] you  should  set  like  a  big  ideal  for  you 
 to  reach  to  so  think  you  know  what  the 
 best  case  scenario  is  that  I  am  so
[74:44] successful  that  I  don't  need  her  to  work 
 that  I  don't  need  her  to  bring  her  own 
 money  because  if  she  does  if  she  does
[74:49] work  if  she  does  bring  her  own  money  for 
 eight  hours  of  the  day  she's  submitting 
 to  a  different  male  unacceptable  you've
[74:54] watched  this  far  of  this  video  of 
 wanting  to  become  more  masculine  you're 
 on  self-improvement  you're  working  hard 
 set  your  goal  high  and  think  [ __ ]  it
[75:00] yeah  I  want  to  be  so  successful  and  so 
 wealthy  that  like  paying  for  her  for 
 dinner  or  for  lunch  or  something  an
[75:06] extra  20  a  day  or  something  I  want  to  be 
 able  to  afford  that  this  is  like  the 
 secret  sauce  to  a  polarized  relationship
[75:11] perhaps  you've  never  really  experienced 
 real  feminine  energy  in  women  before  you
[75:16] know  you're  like  the  women  I've 
 described  and  you  don't  really  relate  to 
 the  girls  that  you've  had  in  your  life 
 are  always  really  focused  on  their
[75:21] studies  and  their  work  and  stuff  and 
 like  you  know  but  at  least  they  pay  for 
 half  the  bill  perhaps  you've  only  ever 
 had  them  because  you  just  aren't  the
[75:26] level  of  man  just  yet  where  you  can  pay 
 for  everything  bro  you  will  experience 
 the  true  feminine  energy  inside  of  women
[75:31] when  they  just  know  that  you  could 
 essentially  retire  them  that  they  don't 
 need  to  work  think  about  it  a  woman  only
[75:36] gets  into  a  masculine  energy  out  of 
 necessity  because  it  is  unnatural  for 
 her  to  be  masculine  so  she  becomes
[75:41] masculine  because  she  needs  to  go  out 
 into  the  workforce  but  if  she  kind  of 
 sees  like  oh  [ __ ]  you  are  so  productive
[75:46] you  are  so  successful  you  are  so  wealthy 
 she  can  start  to  cultivate  way  more  of  a 
 feminine  energy  and  give  up  the
[75:51] masculine  energy  that  she's  had  to 
 develop  through  the  modern  conditioning 
 with  my  woman  I  see  such  beautiful
[75:57] feminine  energy  inside  of  her  because 
 she  no  longer  longer  needs  to  be 
 masculine  and  that's  really  what  I  hope 
 for  you  and  I  know  this  part  of  the
[76:02] video  is  going  to  piss  off  so  many  guys 
 because  I'm  literally  saying  yeah  become 
 successful  become  so  rich  that  you  don't
[76:08] need  to  like  get  your  girl  to  make  money 
 alongside  you  you  know  it  is  hard  of 
 course  it  is  it's  not  easy  you  have  to
[76:13] dedicate  your  life  to  this  [ __ ]  you  have 
 to  wake  up  thinking  about  like  work  and 
 productivity  of  course  but  this  is  the
[76:18] better  life  overall  let's  conclude  this 
 full  guide  to  masculinity  you've  been 
 with  me  now  this  video  is  probably  what
[76:23] an  hour  and  a  half  one  hour  and  57 
 minutes  am  I  closer  you've  learned  that

iQQyFWtD0n8,"[00:00] i'm  a  failure  i  fail 
 all  the  time  and  i  love  failing
[00:07] do  you  know  how  many  pr  attempts  i've 
 failed  how  many  business  ideas  i  tried
[00:12] and  failed 
 how  many  diets  i  went  on  how  many  times 
 i  tried  to  stop 
 binge  eating  i  failed  more  times  than
[00:19] the  lazy  version  of  me  has  even  tried 
 i  even  tried  to  be  a  rapper  at  one  point
[00:24] who  gonna  have  my  back  i'm  out  here  by 
 myself 
 [Laughter]
[00:31] i  tried  learning  to  code  i  tried  joining 
 the  air  force  i  technically  failed  in 
 university
[00:36] i  tried  game  developing  i  made  my  own 
 little  pc  game  when  i  was  14  years  old
[00:41] i  tried  to  become  a  writer  a  dropshipper 
 a  fitness  influencer 
 i  tried  and  gave  up  many  different
[00:47] sports  and  habits 
 and  because  of  these  failures  i  have 
 succeeded  in  many  areas  of  life
[01:06] [Music]
[01:12] [Music]
[01:20] it  took  me  more  than  three  months  and 
 hundreds  of  failures  to  hit  my  first 
 gymnastic  rings  muscle  up
[01:55] you  in  the  danger  zone  you  shouldn't  be 
 alone  hold  hands  and  say  it  like  me
[02:00] the  most  shady  frankie  baby  fantastic 
 graphic  trying  to  make  dough  like
[02:05] jurassic  park
[02:10] and  i  had  so  many  shitty  workouts  but  i 
 never  quit 
 i  kept  on  failing  and  now  look  at  me
[02:24] i  was  never  able  to  stay  consistent  in 
 my  productivity  i  kept  on  failing  the 
 goals  i  set  for  myself
[02:30] and  now  look  at  this  six-month 
 comparison  i  don't  even  have  exercise  as 
 a  header  here
[02:35] because  i  haven't  missed  a  workout  in 
 around  four  months 
 show  me  a  man  who  hasn't  failed  and
[02:41] you'll  be  showing  me  a  man  who  hasn't 
 tried 
 failure  is  progress  and  that  means
[02:46] failure 
 is  success  don't  be  afraid  to  admit 
 i  failed  future  growth  relies  on
[02:53] accepting  failures 
 and  learning  from  them  if  you  want  to  be 
 like  me  and  start  enjoying  failures
[02:59] there's  just  one  thing  you  need  to  do 
 one  skill  you  need  accountability
[03:06] you  cannot  fail  if  you  don't  hold 
 yourself  accountable  to  that  failure 
 you  must  admit  the  failure  you  must  say
[03:13] out  loud  you  must  write  it  down  this  is 
 the  biggest 
 ego  crushing  activity  i  have  ever  done
[03:20] nothing  knocks  you  down  a  peg  more  than 
 writing  the  words  on  paper
[03:25] i  have  failed 
 and  nothing  creates  you  into  a  man  with
[03:31] purpose 
 more  than  writing  the  words  on  paper  but 
 i  will  try  again  tomorrow

-GiuPDA8EAg,"[00:00] jeffrey  thinks  all  women  are  [ __ ]  i 
 hate  them  all  they're  all  [ __ ]  they're 
 all  stupid  why  won't  they  be  my  [ __ ]
[00:05] jeffrey  spends  40  days  and  40  nights 
 trying  to  learn  how  to  approach  women 
 but  he  does  it  all  in  the  wrong  way  he
[00:10] sees  them  as  the  enemy  he  doesn't  even 
 see  them  as  a  human  being  and  so  what 
 you  think  happens  when  jeffrey  goes  out
[00:16] and  tries  to  approach  women  nothing  he 
 never  even  takes  action  he  never  even 
 leaves  his  crusty  computer  chair  but  he
[00:21] just  continuously  watches  videos  on  how 
 to  approach  women  the  right  way  that's 
 not  you  is  it  i  first  learned  about  cold
[00:27] approaching  women  a  few  years  ago  and  i 
 was  hooked  straight  away  me  and  my 
 friend  levi  would  go  to  clubs  and  we'd
[00:32] be  speaking  to  girls  and  we'd  just  be 
 like 
 and  we  actually  did  pretty  well  very 
 often  in  the  middle  of  the  club
[00:37] everyone's  drinking  we'd  end  up  kissing 
 loads  of  girls  and  every  now  and  then 
 every  couple  of  nights  would  bring  a 
 girl  back  to  sleep  with  but  that  was  at
[00:43] night  time  what  about  in  the  daytime 
 what  about  day  game  and  you  know  i'm 
 pretty  blessed  to  say  that  for  me
[00:48] personally  day  game  has  always  pretty 
 much  been  relatively  successful  it's 
 just  that  i've  always  had  the  wrong
[00:53] mindset  so  i  was  never  able  to  do  it 
 properly  i  would  watch  too  many  videos 
 and  start  overthinking  i'd  see  the  girl
[00:58] that  i  wanted  to  talk  to  and  i  would 
 just  not  really  do  it  when  i  would  build 
 up  the  courage  to  go  speak  to  that  girl
[01:03] oftentimes  it  would  go  really  well  i 
 remember  that  i  got  some  of  the  best 
 experiences  of  my  life  in  terms  of 
 getting  girls  with  cold  approaching  and
[01:09] just  going  up  to  a  girl  and  just  asking 
 her  a  random  question  like  hey  excuse  me 
 do  you  know  what  time  this  gym  closes 
 and  she'll  say  something  like  uh  i  think
[01:15] it's  like  10  p.m  i'm  still  there  looking 
 at  her  i  go  to  this  gym  every  single  day 
 i  know  that  the  gym  is  24  hours  and  i'm
[01:20] like  oh  like  yeah 
 thank  you  so  what's  your  name  my  name's 
 samson  you  dumbass  it's  not  10  pm  stupid
[01:25] [ __ ] 
 adonis  isn't  afraid  to  go  speak  to  a 
 woman  why  would  he  he's  7  foot  3  376
[01:32] pounds  what  is  this  puny  human  going  to 
 do  to  him  adonis  hasn't  felt  approach 
 anxiety  since  he  was  a  teenager  and
[01:38] although  things  were  pretty  difficult 
 when  he  would  go  up  and  try  and  speak  to 
 girls  when  he  was  younger  he  overcame 
 the  trials  and  tribulations  and  learnt
[01:44] the  skills  and  the  right  mindset  and  now 
 adonis  feels  comfortable  around  new 
 women  the  best  mindset  that  you  can  have
[01:50] when  you're  going  out  to  approach  women 
 is  simply  success  equals  approaching
[01:55] instantly  focus  entirely  on  that  the 
 reason  why  approaching  seems  so  hard  the
[02:00] reason  why  sometimes  when  you  get  the 
 thought  okay  i  should  speak  to  her  and 
 you  start  overthinking  and  you  don't 
 want  to  do  it  is  because  we  play  out  the
[02:05] conversation  in  our  mind  and  we're 
 trying  to  think  okay  what  should  i  say 
 how  do  i  get  her  into  bed  with  the 
 highest  percentage  conversion  rate  of
[02:10] the  thing  that  i  can  say  but  there's 
 people  looking  and  we  overthink  things 
 too  much  we  simply  need  to  build  up  the
[02:15] habit  of  literally  just  going  up  to  a 
 girl  as  fast  as  possible  and  saying 
 anything  with  the  mindset  and  the
[02:21] humility  to  understand  that  the  first 
 tens  if  not  hundreds  of  times  that  we  go
[02:26] up  to  speak  to  girls  it's  gonna  be 
 pretty  trash  you  can't  expect  to  walk 
 into  the  gym  and  have  the  perfect  gym 
 workout  on  your  first  ever  session  can
[02:32] you  but  that's  what  a  lot  of  people  do 
 that's  what  a  lot  of  people  who  have 
 waited  for  the  new  year's  resolutions
[02:37] and  everything  they  think  of  the 
 ultimate  hardcore  workout  and  that's 
 exactly  why  they  don't  go  to  the  gym
[02:42] consistently  because  they've  set  the  bar 
 of  success  too  damn  high  when  you  go  out 
 to  approach  girls  or  when  you've  had  the
[02:47] thought  to  do  it  you've  set  the  bar  of 
 success  too  high  for  you  the  bar  of 
 successes  oh  like  the  the  number  closed
[02:52] and  she's  gonna  fall  in  love  with  me 
 maybe  we  can  have  a  sex  straight  away 
 and  maybe  we'll  go  on  a  date  straight 
 away  and  i've  got  to  be  able  to  be
[02:58] really  good  at  no  you  can't  expect  any 
 of  those  other  things  like  the  more 
 advanced  things  just  yet  that's  like
[03:03] hitting  a  pr  that's  like  hitting  three 
 plate  bench  press  it  takes  time  to 
 practice  to  get  to  those  results  right
[03:08] now  we  need  you  to  just  show  up  and  just 
 go  speak  and  say  anything  to  a  girl  just 
 like  for  the  beginner  we  need  this
[03:13] beginner  to  literally  just  show  up  to 
 the  gym  forget  the  best  workout  forget 
 like  you  know  overthinking  about  so  many
[03:18] uh  strength  training  or  hypertrophic 
 traits  before  rapper  two  second  he  said 
 forget  about  everything  else  bro  just
[03:23] come  to  the  gym  come  to  the  gym  for  20 
 minutes  you'll  make  progress  go  outside 
 speak  to  a  girl  stutter  mess  up  your
[03:29] words  slow  your  words  save  some  random 
 [ __ ]  doesn't  matter  specifically 
 training  that  habit  of  walking  up  and
[03:34] just  saying  something  is  the  most 
 important  part  that's  like  the 
 bottleneck  that  you  need  to  be  focused
[03:39] on  right  now  and  imagine  that  imagine 
 training  the  habit  that  would  allow  you 
 to  literally  just  go  up  smoothly
[03:44] instantly  and  go  speak  to  a  girl 
 hey  yo  you're  disturbing  her  she  doesn't
[03:49] want  to  speak  to  straight  shut  up  bro 
 she  doesn't  want  to  speak  the  strange 
 shut  up  it's  always  guys  who  say  this 
 like  i  don't  want  to  disturb  a  girl's
[03:54] work  bro  trust  me  when  i  say  and  anyone 
 who's  like  done  a  fair  amount  of 
 approaching  can  back  me  up  in  the 
 comments  the  overwhelming  pretty  much
[04:01] all  the  time  when  you  go  up  and  you 
 speak  in  like  a  nice  friendly  way  she  is 
 pleasant  she  actually  speaks  to  you  with
[04:06] a  massive  smile  on  your  face  there's 
 barely  ever  any  times  of  the 
 stereotypical  time  of  like  you'll  go  up 
 to  speak  to  a  girl  she'll  be  scared  and
[04:12] she'll  be  like  getting  ready  to  fight 
 you  some  it  doesn't  happen  in  real  life 
 bro  almost  every  time  i  go  to  speak  to  a
[04:17] girl  afterwards  i  just  think  like  why 
 was  i  overthinking  so  much  you  might 
 overthink  so  what  are  these  people  gonna
[04:22] say  okay  what's  the  best  sentence  to  use 
 i'd  go  up  say  something  silly  like  say 
 anything  and  it  ends  we  end  up  having  a
[04:27] pleasant  conversation  and  even  if  i 
 don't  get  her  number  even  if  i  don't  end 
 up  dating  her  or  sleeping  with  her  it's
[04:32] always  quite  a  pleasant  interaction  and 
 i  always  think  to  myself  why  did  my 
 brain  overthink  beforehand  it's  because
[04:37] i  have  set  the  intention  that  the 
 success  in  this  interaction  is  like  me 
 getting  the  number  close  success  simply
[04:43] equals  you  going  up  and  speaking  to  us 
 saying  anything  you  need  to  do  that  like 
 a  hundred  times  first  before  you  can
[04:48] actually  get  into  the  groove  and  get 
 used  to  this  then  you  can  start  having 
 the  better  intellectual  attractive
[04:53] conversations  but  first  we  need  you  to 
 at  least  enter  those  conversations  i 
 could  make  this  video  longer  and  i  could
[04:58] tell  you  that  the  best  uh  sentence  is  to 
 say  the  eye  contact  body  language  and 
 all  of  that  stuff  bro  but  get  everything
[05:04] because  that's  what's  making  you 
 overthink  and  that's  what's  stopping  you 
 from  actually  going  out  there  and  at 
 least  starting  the  initial  process  i
[05:11] love  my  mindset  more  than  everyone 
 else's  i've  seen  on  youtube  get  into  a 
 hundred  conversations  even  if  the
[05:16] conversation  is  trashed  you've  made 
 progress  you've  shown  up  to  the  gym  even 
 if  the  workout  is  trash  if  you've  shown
[05:21] up  as  a  beginner  you're  making  progress 
 do  not  be  like  that  fat  43  year  old 
 susan  who's  waiting  for  the  new  years
[05:26] because  she  had  one  workout  of  like  the 
 body  power  class  where  they  do  like  a 
 bunch  of  [ __ ]  cardio  and  like  50  reps
[05:31] and  she  never  comes  to  the  gym  again 
 because  it's  too  hard  because  success 
 equals  going  to  that  class  in  her  mind
[05:36] for  you  success  equals  having  the  best 
 conversation  and  too  often  when  i  speak 
 about  approaching  and  going  up  to  speak
[05:41] to  girls  a  lot  of  guys  will  come  to 
 comment  about  hamsa  tell  us  what  to  say 
 tell  me  what  to  say  hamza  if  that's  what 
 your  mindset  is  like  right  now  i  see  you
[05:47] scrolling  down  looking  for  those 
 comments  and  also  ready  to  like  type  one 
 if  no  one  else  don't  want  if  that  is 
 your  mindset  i  have  full  confidence  that
[05:52] you're  not  gonna  do  this  because  you're 
 overthinking  you're  like  the  guy  who 
 writes  a  [ __ ]  script  before  he  calls
[05:57] like  his  local  takeaway  before  you  call 
 someone  you've  already  prepared  the 
 script  you  don't  need  to  know  what  to 
 say  because  even  if  you  prepare  the
[06:03] script  even  if  you  know  what  to  say  or 
 you  don't  know  what  to  say  the  first  few 
 conversations  are  gonna  be  awkward
[06:08] they're  gonna  be  trash  but  the  guy  who's 
 prepared  the  script  will  overthink  so 
 much  more  that  he'll  miss  the
[06:13] opportunity  of  the  first  few 
 interactions  whereas  the  guy  who  has 
 like  the  lean  startup  like  you  know  hit
[06:18] the  ground  running  type  of  mindset  he'll 
 go  up  and  breeze  through  that  progress 
 forget  about  everything  else  literally
[06:24] just  focus  on  approaching  as  fast  as 
 possible  do  the hard  work  especially 
 when  you  don't  feel  like  it

[00:21] on  people  you  can't  help  but  just  like 
 him  instantly  why  is  this  you  look  at
[00:27] Adonis  from  head  to  toe  and  that's  when 
 you  realize  I  remember  being  a  bit 
 younger  maybe  age  17  and  getting
[00:34] introduced  to  this  girl  in  this  party 
 she  was  polite  for  like  you  know  a 
 minute
[00:39] what  do  you  study  and  then  just  Slumber 
 shoulders  seemed  bored  by  my  answers  to
[00:45] her  questions  and  you  know  my  questions 
 to  her  just  kind  of  turn  around  and 
 pretty  much  ignored  me  for  the  rest  of 
 the  night  and  you  know  didn't  really
[00:50] look  at  me  for  a  long  time  I  felt  like  I 
 never  really  got  a  fair  chance  with 
 people  it  felt  like  perhaps  my  first
[00:55] impression  that  was  coming  across  wasn't 
 very  positive  for  some  reason  I  couldn't
[01:00] figure  out  why  I  was  like  well  you  know 
 I'm  really  funny  and  I've  been  going  to 
 the  gym  now  like  oh  why  aren't  people
[01:05] taking  me  seriously  that  was  the  kind  of 
 problem  I  was  experiencing  a  while  ago 
 and  now  now  it  feels  like  I  get  the
[01:10] benefit  of  the  doubt  now  it  feels  like 
 people  like  me  without  really  knowing  me 
 where  I'm  in  right  now  is  an  Airbnb  in
[01:16] London  and  when  I  booked  this  place  the 
 woman  who  you  know  her  profile  it  shows 
 like  she  owns  this  place  she  messaged  me
[01:22] saying  oh  like  her  brother  will  come 
 like  let  me  in  and  show  me  around  and  I 
 was  with  my  girl  as  well  we  got  the  Uber 
 to  the  building  you  know  with  the  law
[01:27] suitcases  we're  stood  outside  and  I  see 
 this  guy  walk  up  and  he  just  instantly 
 knows  it  was  me  even  though  there  was
[01:32] other  people  around  and  literally  the 
 first  thing  that  he  said  to  me  was  he  he 
 said  his  sister's  name  I  won't  say  the
[01:37] name  but  he  said  like  oh  yeah  my  sister 
 said  that  you're  really  attractive  come 
 on  come  on  I'll  show  you  in  one  of  the 
 first  things  he  said  to  me  just  randomly
[01:42] with  a  massive  smile  on  his  face  and 
 already  seeming  like  warm  and  receptive 
 to  me  was  like  his  sister  had  told  him
[01:48] that  I  was  attractive  because  I  had  his 
 sister  the  Airbnb  host  on  WhatsApp  and 
 on  WhatsApp  I'll  show  you  my  my  WhatsApp
[01:54] picture  it's  like  a  picture  of  me  sure 
 that  stood  next  to  my  girl  it  gives  me  a 
 sense  of  like  pre-selection  there's 
 seven  key  reasons  why  people  dislike  you
[02:00] immediately  and  the  strategy  to  overcome 
 this  is  to  present  a  great  first 
 impression  the  first  reason  and  the
[02:06] worst  reason  why  someone  will  dislike 
 you  straight  away  bro  if  you're  a  victim 
 to  this  you  need  to  change  literally  you
[02:11] need  to  stop  watching  the  video  even  if 
 it's  bad  for  my  YouTube  AdSense  Revenue 
 whatever  retention  rate  or  some  [ __ ]  you
[02:16] need  to  stop  the  video  and  fix  this 
 problem  right  now  the  first  reason  why 
 people  dislike  you  immediately  is 
 because  of  poor  hygiene  if  you  have  long
[02:22] dirty  fingernails  bad  oh  [ __ ]  me  bro  you 
 can  be  as  ugly  as  you  want  bro  honestly 
 you  can  be  as  ugly  as  you  want  you  can
[02:27] be  fat  you  can  be  skinny  you  can  have 
 like  shitty  hair  whatever  bro  if  you 
 stink  that's  a  violation  that  is  a
[02:32] violation  of  everyone  else's  human 
 rights  next  to  you  if  you  stink  you  need 
 to  fix  that  [ __ ]  immediately  and  then 
 you  need  to  like  up  your  hygiene  and
[02:38] make  sure  like  your  hair  doesn't  look 
 greasy  and  then  put  in  some  extra  time 
 to  make  sure  that  your  hygiene  isn't 
 just  acceptable  but  actually  really  good
[02:44] bro  you  don't  want  a  girl  who's 
 attracted  to  up  until  she  smells  you  or 
 she  notices  something  about  you  which
[02:49] just  looks  unclean  and  that  turns  it  off 
 that's  like  the  worst  reason  to  ever 
 turn  a  girl  off  the  second  reason  why
[02:55] people  might  dislike  you  straight  away 
 and  this  one's  kind  of  harsh  but  it  is 
 it  is  true  it's  your  physique  it's  your
[03:00] aesthetic  it's  how  you  look  at  your  body 
 shape  if  you  have  the  body  of  a  man  who
[03:05] is  lazy  people  can't  help  but  not  to 
 respect  you  as  much  as  there's  this  fat 
 positive  everyone's  beautiful  movements
[03:12] the  thing  is  like  the  majority  of  people 
 don't  have  much  respect  for  a  fat  person 
 or  a  really  skinny  guy  because  it  just
[03:18] shows  that  you  lack  the  discipline  to 
 improve  that  part  of  yourself  the 
 specific  way  to  improve  this  is  to  build
[03:23] your  aesthetic  body  and  I've  got  a 
 program  Linked  In  the  description  for 
 that  if  you're  interested  the  third
[03:28] reason  why  people  dislike  you 
 immediately  which  is  somewhat  similar  to 
 the  first  two  reasons  is  your  clothes
[03:33] and  your  fashion  style  especially  if 
 those  clothes  are  dirty  stained  creased
[03:39] or  smell  you  can  see  a  lot  of  this  comes 
 back  to  that  Primal  [ __ ]  of  like  do  you 
 stink  bro  if  you  stink  we  need  to  fix
[03:45] that  I'm  not  trying  to  be  offensive  bro 
 we  need  to  fix  that  ASAP  take  a  moment 
 right  now  to  just  visualize  yourself  as
[03:50] a  girl  you  know  you're  just  a  normal 
 girl  you  get  100  matches  on  Tinder  a  day 
 you  get  500  DM  you  know  what  I  mean  and
[03:55] then  see  you  come  up  and  approach  her 
 and  just  notice  what  you're  wearing  is 
 it  attractive  is  it  unattractive  does  it
[04:01] look  fashionable  have  you  spent  some 
 time  improving  your  clothing  this  is 
 something  I'll  be  totally  honest  that
[04:06] that  I  haven't  spent  too  much  time  on 
 and  I've  never  really  cared  about 
 fashion  much  but  just  a  few  months  ago 
 for  one  of  the  first  times  of  my  life  I
[04:12] spent  like  a  lot  of  money  on  clothes  I 
 spent  500  pounds  literally  I  don't 
 usually  ever  spend  money  like  500  pounds
[04:17] it's  not  a  crazy  amount  for  a  lot  of 
 people  it  is  for  me  because  I'm  used  to 
 buying  stuff  pre-owned  I'm  not  gonna  lie
[04:22] to  you  like  I  literally  bought  like 
 trainers  and  shirts  and  hoodies  and  even 
 pants  and  [ __ ]  pre-owned  work  so  for  the
[04:28] first  time  just  a  few  months  ago  I 
 budgeted  500  pounds  that  I  would  spend 
 on  a  new  pair  of  trainers  that  didn't 
 have  a  hole  in  them  and  a  couple  of  like
[04:33] gym  outfits  wearing  that  has  gotten  me 
 so  many  more  compliments  from  other 
 people  the  fourth  reason  why  you  might
[04:38] feel  like  you're  not  really  getting  a 
 fair  chance  with  someone  and  you  know 
 they  seem  to  dislike  you  straight  away 
 is  weird  social  mannerisms  and  this
[04:45] one's  quite  a  hurtful  one  to  me  for  me 
 to  mention  and  especially  I'm  just  gonna 
 tell  you  the  truth  I'm  gonna  sound  like
[04:50] an  awful  person  for  this  I  do  meetups 
 with  my  boys  quite  often  so  I'll  you 
 know  I'll  announce  I'm  in  this  city  I'm
[04:55] in  this  country  come  and  meet  me  boys 
 let's  go  like  chill  and  you  know  go  in 
 the  park  or  like  do  some  push-ups  or 
 some  [ __ ]  for  a  while  usually  around  20
[05:01] of  the  guys  who  come  to  my  meetups  have 
 like  weird  social  mannerism  to  the  point
[05:06] that  it's  very  hard  to  connect  with  them 
 and  I  don't  say  this  to  be  offensive  I'd 
 say  this  because  we're  here  to  improve
[05:11] but  essentially  what  I  mean  by  weird 
 social  mannerisms  is  like  they  don't  act
[05:16] normal  perhaps  it's  like  fleeting  eye 
 contact  or  just  no  eye  contact  at  all 
 and  talking  to  you  whilst  like  looking
[05:22] away  or  you  know  just  constantly  like 
 touching  their  face  when  they  speak  to 
 you  and  like  hiding  that  their  mouth  or
[05:27] some  [ __ ]  of  course  that's  like  it's 
 kind  of  messed  up  why  we  have  these 
 things  generally  if  someone's  got  like 
 this  weird  social  mannerism  it's  because
[05:32] they've  been  conditioned  in  that  way 
 punished  or  rewarded  by  their  parents 
 but  it  is  something  that  you  will  be
[05:37] judged  on  do  you  seem  normal  in  social 
 situations  you  don't  have  to  be  like 
 this  amazingly  social  guy  who's  really
[05:43] loud  and  confident  and  extroverted  you 
 don't  have  to  be  like  that  you  can  still 
 maintain  your  your  style  but  do  you  just
[05:48] seem  weird  do  you  make  people  feel  like 
 a  little  bit  uncomfortable  just  ask 
 yourself  that  question  it  takes  a  lot  of
[05:54] humility  but  perhaps  this  could  be  what 
 you're  missing  out  on  right  now  and  I 
 don't  blame  you  honestly  if  this  is  what 
 you're  experiencing  you  feel  kind  of
[06:00] weird  next  to  other  people  I  don't  blame 
 you  because  of  the  modern  day  bro  like 
 the  social  skills  are  so  [ __ ]  up 
 aren't  they  everyone's  spending  all  all
[06:06] their  social  life  just  online  and  so 
 when  you  do  meet  in  person  it's  like 
 you're  not  really  used  to  that  when  I 
 meet  someone  who's  got  weird  social
[06:11] mannerisms  I  know  for  100  certainty  that 
 that  person  doesn't  play  any  kind  of 
 physical  sport  and  that  they  don't  have
[06:17] like  physical  friends  being  like  nerds 
 on  the  computer  and  even  if  you're 
 working  on  something  productive  it's
[06:22] like  that's  awesome  you  know  you're 
 working  on  something  nice  but  that  will 
 [ __ ]  up  your  social  mannerisms  you  need
[06:27] to  go  and  do  some  kind  of  physical 
 Sports  where  other  guys  like  wrestling 
 you  pushing  you  throwing  but  like  you 
 know  a  ball  at  you  or  something  and  that
[06:32] like  it  just  opens  up  your  body  so  much 
 more  anyone  who's  who  hasn't  done  some 
 kind  of  physical  training  just  appears
[06:38] like  odd  in  his  body  it's  like  he 
 doesn't  know  the  controls  on  like  how  to 
 move  properly  I  know  the  reason  why
[06:44] people  might  dislike  you  straight  away 
 when  you  might  not  even  realize  this  you 
 don't  seem  happy  and  you  don't  really
[06:49] smile  a  lot  of  guys  think  that  they're 
 supposed  to  be  this  kind  of  Sigma  male 
 who's  like  proper  serious  and  I  see
[06:54] these  cringe  videos  pop  up  on  YouTube 
 where  you're  supposed  to  like  be 
 rejecting  of  other  people  and  you're
[06:59] supposed  to  pretend  like  you  don't  care 
 about  them  bro  I  tried  this  I  tried  this 
 I'm  telling  you  right  now  right  this  is
[07:04] what  I  used  to  do  to  try  and  impress 
 women  if  there  was  a  all  that  I  wanted 
 to  hook  up  with  like  you  know  some  cute 
 girl  in  the  gym  or  some  [ __ ]  or  she'd  be 
 walking  past  instead  of  looking  at  her
[07:10] holding  eye  contacted  smiling  and  you're 
 not  going  to  speak  to  her  I  would 
 pretend  I  wasn't  looking  at  her  and  just
[07:15] pull  like  this  like  [ __ ]  boy  face  like 
 looking  away  like
[07:20] I  would  be  doing  [ __ ]  cringe 
 I  would  literally  like  in  the  club  I  see
[07:25] the  girl  that  I  really  want  to  get  I 
 just  walk  past  it
[07:31] well  just  look  at  people  bro  look  at 
 someone  acknowledge  their  existence  and
[07:36] smile  and  the  second  part  of  this  is 
 don't  restrain  your  laughter  it  is  so 
 sad  seeing  someone  in  a  social  situation
[07:42] hiding  their  laughter  behind  their  hand 
 or  like  you  know  trying  to  like  downplay 
 it  do  you  think  the  king  would  hide  his
[07:48] laughter  imagine  the  most  powerful  man 
 of  all  of  society  the  king  would  he  hide 
 his  laughter  behind  his  hand  would  he
[07:53] like  just  like  giggle  underneath  his 
 breath 
 no  the  king  would  literally  be  shut  back
[07:59] with  his  like  bulging  stomach  because 
 he's  just  ate  a  large  part  of  the  ball 
 and  he'd  be  laughing  with  like  fully
[08:05] he'd  be  laughing  with  like  a  stupid 
 laugh  they'd  be  laughing  with  like  full 
 intensity  you  wouldn't  be  like  hiding  it
[08:11] behind  his  hand  man  and  the  final  reason 
 why  I  can  think  off  why  someone  might 
 dislike  you  straight  away  you  might  be
[08:16] coming  across  as  fake  and  I'm  not  sure 
 if  this  is  applicable  to  a  lot  of  people 
 but  I  found  people  in  customer  service
[08:22] roles  really  have  this  when  I  checked  in 
 to  a  hotel  that  I  was  staying  in  a 
 couple  of  weeks  ago  the  receptionist
[08:28] there  like  I  couldn't  help  but  dislike 
 her  even  though  she  was  being  like 
 polite  to  me  I  couldn't  help  it  because
[08:33] she  just  had  like  this  fake  like  like 
 sneaker  would  call  them  Bots  like  she 
 had  this  like  bot  personality  where  like
[08:38] she  wasn't  even  a  real  person  she  was 
 just  following  the  script  of  like  her 
 her  employers  put  onto  her  she  wasn't  a
[08:44] bad  person  and  I  wasn't  rude  to  her  or 
 anything  but  I  just  I  couldn't  help  but 
 like  not  be  able  to  relate  or  respect
[08:50] her  because  of  that  kind  of  personality 
 that  she  had  with  you  have  to  like  hide 
 your  real  personality  because  you  don't
[08:55] really  think  it's  appropriate  we've  run 
 over  seven  reasons  why  people  might 
 dislike  you  straight  away  you  might  be
[09:00] sitting  here thinking  wait  wait  that's 
 too  much  I'm  not  gonna  change  myself  why 
 would  I  change  so  much  about  myself  just 
 to  make  people  like  me  is  it  really  a
[09:06] lot  to  tell  you  like  oh  yeah  by  the  way 
 bro  just  um  you  know  maybe  just  just
[09:11] smell  your  armpits  and  just  just  see  if 
 you  like  the  smell  like  is  there  so  much 
 to  tell  you  yeah  like  brush  your  teeth
[09:17] twice  twice  a  day  bro  like  you  know 
 where  where  clean  clothes  that  don't 
 have  stains  on  them  I  don't  want  to  be
[09:22] condescending  but  like  a  lot  of  like 
 other  guys  have  this  energy  where 
 they're  like  oh  well  I'm  not  gonna 
 change  anything  about  myself  oh  I  don't
[09:27] care  about  anyone  else  I  don't  care  if 
 people  uh  view  me  or  I  don't  care  what 
 people  think  about  me  ah  yeah  I  don't
[09:32] care  about  other  people's  opinions  I 
 hear  that  so  much  in  this  modern  day  so 
 many  guys  will  say  this  maybe  you've
[09:37] said  this  before  like  oh  well  I  don't 
 care  about  other  people's  opinions  that 
 doesn't  make  sense  that's  not  a  human
[09:42] thing  to  say  we  are  tribal  creatures  I 
 might  be  one  of  the  first  people  you've
[09:47] ever  heard  say  this  especially  of  like 
 influences  on  YouTube  say  this  I  might 
 be  the  first  person  to  say  this
[09:53] I  care  what  other  people  think  of  me  I 
 care  that  doesn't  mean  I'm  weak  that
[09:58] doesn't  mean  that  I'm  like  any  you  know 
 insult  it  means  that  I'm  human  and  I'm
[10:03] in  touch  with  this  natural  part  like 
 this  natural  evolutionary  trait  inside
[10:08] of  me  where  we  care  what  our  tribe 
 thinks  of  us  of  course  we  do  we  care 
 about  our  tribe  thinks  that's  how  we
[10:14] were  able  to  get  to  this  Advanced 
 civilization  stage  and  since  you 
 understand  this  since  you  understand 
 that  yeah  like  it  is  a  normal  thing  to
[10:20] care  what  people  think  about  us  it 
 should  be  an  area  of  your 
 self-improvement  something  like  [ __ ]
[10:25] like  why  am  I  not  getting  a  fair  chance 
 with  some  people  why  was  there  that  one 
 person  who  seems  to  just  dislike  me
[10:30] straight  away  and  you  know  if  there  was 
 just  one  person  maybe  it's  just  them  but 
 if  you're  consistently  meeting  people 
 who  don't  really  seem  happy  like  that
[10:36] happy  to  meet  you  perhaps  it's  you  and 
 we  should  take  the  responsibility  for
[10:41] this  instead  of  complaining  and  putting 
 the  responsibility  on  other  people  and 
 saying  oh  it's  them  I  don't  care  about 
 what  they  think  and  I  just  think  yeah
[10:46] [ __ ]  it  like  I  want  a  better  life  I  want 
 people  to  like  me  I  want  more  friends  I 
 want  more  girls  [ __ ]  it  I'll  improve
[10:51] this  part  of  me  there's  a  mindset  that 
 you  should  hold  which  is  very  empowering 
 and  I  gave  this  to  my  friend  Sam  who
[10:56] really  was  experiencing  some  of  these 
 things  that  we  talked  about  today  what  I 
 told  him  was  just  this  piece  of  advice
[11:01] present  your  best  self  to  the  world  when 
 you  step  foot  out  of  your  room  present
[11:06] your  best  self  to  the  world  take  two 
 minutes  to  look  at  yourself  in  the 
 mirror  do  your  hair  make  sure  there's
[11:11] nothing  in  your  teeth  or  in  your  nose 
 clean  up  your  face  make  sure  there's  no 
 like  random  like  just  [ __ ]  on  your  face
[11:16] present  your  best  self  to  the  world 
 because  you  never  know  who  you're  gonna 
 meet  imagine  if  the  one  day  you  go  out
[11:21] and  you  stink  it  was  the  day  you  were 
 gonna  meet  like  the  girl  that  you  were 
 gonna  end  up  dating  bro  imagine  bro
[11:26] imagine  the  day  that  you  were  like  you 
 know  fate  would  have  aligned  for  you  to 
 go  and  meet  the  girl  of  your  dreams  and
[11:32] you  just  stank  that  day  bro 
 oh  my  come  on  bro  do  it  for  you  bro
[11:39] click  and  watch  this  video  right  now  do 
 the  hard  work  especially  when  you  don't 
 feel  like  it
"
VXW7dpuxYzU,"[00:00] if  you  know  my  story  which  will  pop  up 
 on  screen  you  know  that 
 i've  struggled  with  diet  a  lot  and  the
[00:06] one  thing  that  has  really  helped  me 
 significantly  changed  everything  which  i 
 hope  to  give  you  today
[00:11] is  education  quality  education  that 
 makes  it  click 
 for  that  reason  it's  very  important  for
[00:16] me  to  explain  some  things  that  may  seem 
 like  common  sense 
 but  i  urge  you  if  you  really  want  this
[00:21] to  be  important  to  watch  it  in  order  and 
 don't  skip  around 
 i  know  i  personally  skip  on  youtube
[00:26] videos  especially  when  they've  got  an 
 introduction  like  this  and  if  you've 
 watched  my  videos  before 
 you  know  that  i'm  not  the  introduction
[00:32] type  of  guy  i  usually  jump  straight  in 
 with  the  practical  advice 
 you  can't  do  that  with  diets  you  have  to
[00:37] learn  about  diets  from  the  ground  up 
 so  that's  why  this  introduction  is  quite 
 long  even  though  i  usually  skip  over
[00:42] them  completely  you're  gonna 
 have  to  reframe  your  mind  we're  gonna 
 have  to  take  out  everything  you  know
[00:47] about  diets  because 
 everything  you  know  about  diet  has  been 
 ingrained  into  you  by  a  society  that  is
[00:53] unhealthy  no  matter  which  country  you're 
 in  apart  from 
 like  two  or  three  countries  pretty  much
[00:58] everyone  in  your  country  is  overweight 
 70  of  people  in  western  countries  are
[01:03] overweight  or  obese  that  means  that 
 whatever  we're  all  doing  as  a  majority 
 as  a  society 
 is  not  working  we're  doing  the  opposite
[01:10] in  self-improvement  we  always  follow 
 one  of  those  quotes  that  says  to  do  the 
 opposite  of  the  majority
[01:15] if  you  follow  the  diet  of  the  majority 
 which  is  not  thinking  about  diets  not 
 watching 
 diet  educational  videos  you  will  get  the
[01:21] result  of  the  majority 
 so  congratulations  you're  already  one 
 step  ahead  of  everyone  else
[01:26] let's  begin  with  the  biggest  problem  in 
 the  world  right  now  the  pandemic  that's 
 been  going  around  for  a  while  i'm  not
[01:32] talking  about  covid  it's  that's  a  very 
 very  small  pandemic  compared  to 
 the  obesity  pandemic  learning  about  the
[01:38] obesity  pandemic  is 
 so  important  even  if  you  are  not  obese 
 because
[01:43] lose  your  ego  a  little  bit  chances  are 
 you  will  become  overweight  or  obese  in 
 your  life 
 if  you  don't  learn  this  stuff  we  have  to
[01:49] ask  ourselves  why  has  fat  gain  become  so 
 common  why  are  people 
 getting  not  just  overweight  but  obese
[01:55] now 
 the  simpletons  in  the  fitness  industry 
 will  say  oh  because  people  eat  more
[02:00] and  that's  true  but  leaving  the  argument 
 there  is  the  reason  why
[02:05] nothing  has  been  done  it's  the  reason 
 why  the  obesity  rates  keep  climbing  up 
 because  for  so  long  we  have  told  obese
[02:10] people 
 to  eat  less  and  move  more  but  that  it 
 isn't  working 
 it  is  not  working  we  have  to  like  look
[02:16] at  this  in  a  deeper  level  than  just  what 
 the  simpletons  in  the  fitness  industry 
 say 
 we  need  to  go  past  that  base  question  of
[02:23] why  they're  gaining  weight  because  we 
 know  it's  a  calorie  surplus 
 people  are  eating  too  many  calories  what
[02:28] we  have  to  ask  is  the  further  question 
 why  are  people  eating  too  many  calories
[02:33] this  question  has  not  been  asked  much 
 because  we've  all  just  left  the 
 conversation  there  that  okay
[02:38] people  are  eating  too  much  they  need  to 
 eat  less  it's  a  whole  whole  raving  thing 
 we'll  talk  about  the  fitness  industry
[02:44] but  it's  like  the  groundbreaking  thing 
 that  oh 
 to  lose  weight  all  you  have  to  do  is  eat 
 less  but  we  should  be  asking
[02:50] why  why  do  so  many  people  have  to  lose 
 weight  in  the  first  place  why  do  we  have 
 to  tell  people
[02:55] to  eat  less  that  why  are  people  eating 
 more  we  understand  fat  gain  obesity 
 is  from  people  eating  more  but  why  are
[03:02] they  eating  more 
 and  that  is  because  of  the  types  of  food 
 now  this  is  going  to  hurt  all  those
[03:07] minimalist  youtubers  matt  diabeta  and 
 all 
 the  fitness  people  who've  done  the 
 videos  like  oh  there's  no  such  thing  as
[03:12] bad  food  yes  there  is 
 there's  no  such  thing  as  bad  calories 
 yes  there  is  all  calories  are  the  same
[03:18] no  they're  not  that  is  such  a  simpleton 
 view  of 
 nutrition  saying  all  calories  is  the
[03:23] same  is  like  saying  all 
 money  all  currency  is  the  same  like
[03:28] no  maybe  if  you're  like  a  dumb  child  you 
 could  kind  of  believe  that  all  currency 
 is  the  same  but  once  you  get  a  little
[03:34] bit  older 
 and  your  iq  gets  into  double  digits  you 
 start  realizing  that  currency 
 is  different  it  has  different  values  it
[03:40] has  different  uses  just  like  different 
 calories  and  macronutrients 
 are  different  obesity  is  getting  more
[03:45] common  and  now  hopefully  you  understand 
 that  we  we  know 
 that  it's  because  people  are  eating  in  a 
 calorie  surplus  but  the  real  question  is
[03:52] why  is  a  calorie  surplus  why  are  people 
 eating  so  much  why  is  that  so  common
[03:57] around  the  world  and  that  is  because  of 
 the  types  of  food 
 humans  have  not  just  evolved  in  the  last
[04:03] 100  years  evolution  some  some  kind  of 
 changes  to  our  biological  process 
 takes  millions  of  years  so  we  have  to
[04:10] think  that  this  is  an 
 outside  influence  this  is  something  that 
 we  as  as  man  as
[04:15] as  humans  have  created  and  put  into  our 
 bodies  that  are  now  making  it  so  that  we 
 eat  more
[04:20] so  therefore  it  is  the  type  of  food  it 
 is  the  foods 
 that  we're  eating  that  are  causing  this
[04:26] obesity  pandemic  so  now  we  have  to  do  a 
 comparison  of  the  foods  that  we're 
 eating 
 compared  to  the  times  when  obesity  was
[04:33] uncommon  non-existent  just  over  100 
 years  ago  200  years  ago  you
[04:38] wouldn't  have  seen  obese  people 
 everywhere  maybe  there  would  have  been 
 that 
 one  random  guy  who's  200  pounds  and
[04:44] everyone  would  have  thought  he's  like  oh 
 my  god  he's  an  elephant 
 or  some  now  a  man  being  200  pounds
[04:49] is 
 average  seriously  a  man  being  200  pounds 
 is  average  the  average  woman  now  weighs
[04:54] what  men  used  to  weigh 
 for  a  long  time  i  had  a  negative  view 
 towards
[04:59] overweight  and  obese  people  and  i  want 
 to  i  want  to  drill  this  in  right  now  if 
 you're  watching  this  whether  you  are 
 overweight  obese  or  if  you're  kind  of
[05:05] like  me  like  a  fit  person  obese  people 
 are  not  our  enemies 
 for  some  reason  when  we  talk  about  this
[05:10] stuff  it's  like  people  have 
 a  very  negative  view  towards  fat  people
[05:15] as  if  it's  like  an  us  verse  them 
 situation  it's  not 
 they  are  not  our  enemies  we  are  on  the
[05:21] same  team  it's  me 
 plus  the  obese  guy  versus  the  problem 
 we're  all  trying  to  just  be  healthy  and
[05:27] happy  people 
 i  am  ashamed  to  say  for  a  long  time  that 
 i  i  had  such  a  negative  view  to  fat
[05:33] people  because  i  thought  oh  you  know 
 they're  fat  and  they're  lazy  and  they're 
 causing  problems  for  the  the  maybe  the
[05:38] health  care  is 
 is  getting  worse  because  they're  a  drain 
 on  the  health  care  but  we  have  to  think 
 that  most  people  if  not  all  of  them
[05:44] do  not  want  to  be  obese  we  have  to  treat 
 obesity  overweight  fat  gain
[05:49] like  an  addiction  and  we  as  a  generation 
 of  dumbasses  of 
 people  in  the  government  system  and  the
[05:54] healthcare  system  have  failed  people 
 with  addictions  whether  it's  drugs 
 whether  it's  social  media  internet  porn
[06:00] whether  it's  food 
 we  are  horrible  to  people  with 
 addictions  we  we  see  them  as  the  enemy 
 for  some  reason
[06:05] we  have  to  strip  that  mindset  away  and 
 start  treating  these  people  with  love 
 and  actually  start
[06:10] questioning  why  would  a  normal  person 
 be  like  this  what  can  we  do  to  change
[06:16] this  person's  life  so  that  he  doesn't 
 need  that  addiction  anymore  and  the 
 answer  in  my  opinion  is  to
[06:21] increase  the  high  quality  food  intake 
 the  natural  foods  we'll  go  on  to  that
[06:26] later  i'm  going  to  tell  you  everything  i 
 know  about  natural  foods  about 
 unprocessed  foods 
 the  obesity  pandemic  is  caused  because
[06:32] we  are  eating  a  lot 
 less  of  the  high  quality  food  the  good 
 food  you're  gonna  hear  me  say  this  a  lot
[06:38] and  it's  probably  gonna  trigger  some 
 people  but  there  is  good  and  bad  food 
 but  this  isn't  a  safe  space  so  if  you 
 get  triggered  if  you  find  this  offensive
[06:44] then 
 it  sucks  to  be  you  if  you're  so 
 sensitive  but  this  is  true  there's  so 
 many  youtubers  i  see  who've  made  videos
[06:50] like  the  myth  of 
 the  myth  of  bad  food  there's  no  such 
 thing  as  bad  food  yes  there  is 
 ice  cream  is  bad  for  you  sugar  is  bad
[06:57] for  you  alcohol  is  bad  for  you  junk  food 
 heavily  processed  food  mcdonald's  is  bad 
 for  you
[07:02] there  is  food  that  is  good  for  you  this 
 fact  that  i'm  telling  you  right  now  it's 
 not  an  opinion  this  is  a  fact  that  i'm 
 telling  you  there  is  bad  in  good  foods
[07:08] it's  quite  insensitive  i'm  not  taking 
 anyone's  feelings 
 into  consideration  when  i  say  this  and
[07:14] so  straight  away  if  i  start  saying  okay 
 mcdonald's  is  bad  for  you 
 someone  who's  just  ate  mcdonald's  would
[07:19] would  feel  offended  by  that  i'm  hoping 
 that  you  can 
 agree  with  me  that  there  is  bad  and  good 
 foods  and  you  now  it  should  become  clear
[07:25] that 
 the  reason  why  there's  an  obesity 
 pandemic  is  because  we're  choosing  the 
 bad  foods
[07:30] so  to  cure  the  bcc  pandemic  even  though 
 it's  not  this  simple  but  to  cure  it  we 
 just  need  to  eat
[07:35] more  good  foods  i'm  not  even  saying  to 
 eat  less  bad  foods 
 the  reason  why  we're  eating  bad  foods  is
[07:40] because  we're  eating 
 less  good  foods  a  successful  diet  is  all 
 about  adding  things  in  not  taking  things
[07:46] out  when  we  take  things  away  from  a 
 human  who's  addicted  to  them 
 it  makes  it  worse  it  makes  him  obsessed
[07:51] with  that  substance  that  we  took  away  so 
 to  cure  the  obesity  pandemic  we  need  to 
 feed  people
[07:56] good  quality  food  when  you  fill  up  on 
 good  quality  food  you  are  so 
 full  and  satiated  that  the  smallest
[08:02] amount  of  chocolate  is  actually  a 
 reasonable  treat  my 
 my  treat  right  now  is  a  piece  of  dark
[08:07] chocolate  i  was  a  chronic  binge  eater 
 my  treat  is  a  piece  of  dark  chocolate 
 and  that  satisfies  me  because
[08:13] i  am  quite  sickly  full  throughout  my  day 
 of 
 the  foods  that  i  eat  in  a  good  way  so
[08:18] now  this  new  section  is  going  to  seem 
 like  common  sense  up  until  it  doesn't  so 
 don't  click  away 
 if  i  was  watching  this  personally  i
[08:23] would  think  what  an  idiot  we  don't  need 
 to  be 
 asked  this  question  but  i'm  gonna  ask 
 you  the  question  hopefully  you  can
[08:28] answer  it 
 is  fat  unhealthy  now  i  would  have  said 
 yes  absolutely  100
[08:34] and  that  would  have  been  wrong  it  is  not 
 100 
 unhealthy  there's  two  types  of  body  fat
[08:40] and  one 
 is  actually  surprisingly  not  unhealthy 
 one  type  actually  does  not  lead  to
[08:46] metabolic  syndrome  and  this  is  like  we 
 have  to  we  have  to  reframe  your  mind 
 how  is  fat  unhealthy  let's  ask  that
[08:52] question  how  is 
 fat  unhealthy  we  understand  okay  obese 
 people  are  unhealthy
[08:57] they're  sick  but  how  exactly  what  what 
 happens  is  it  like 
 the  fat  in  your  body  does  something  what
[09:03] exactly  happens 
 there's  two  things  now  having  a  large 
 amount  of  weight 
 can  be  unhealthy  in  the  sense  that  it
[09:08] can  you  know  it  can  weigh  you  down  it 
 can  ruin  your  posture 
 lack  of  exercise  because  you're  heavier
[09:13] but  that  is  quite 
 minuscule  compared  to  the  metabolic
[09:18] syndrome  metabolic  syndrome 
 is  the  reason  why  fat  is  so  unhealthy 
 but  metabolic  syndrome
[09:24] is  not  exactly  caused  by  fat  hopefully 
 you  didn't  click  away  when  i  started 
 talking  about  good  and  bad  food  you're
[09:29] gonna  learn  how  bad 
 food  gives  you  metabolic  syndrome  i  want 
 you  to  reframe  your  mind  that  fat
[09:35] is  just  a  symptom  of  eating  in  a  calorie 
 surplus  but 
 fat  does  not  equal  sickness  it  does  not
[09:42] equal  metabolic  syndrome  it  does  not 
 equal  diabetes 
 and  cardiovascular  disease  although  it
[09:48] is  heavily  correlated  this  is  where  it 
 gets  a  bit  of  like  mind  boggling  so 
 essentially 
 since  it's  heavily  correlated  we  may  as
[09:53] well  say  that  you  know  it's  caused  but 
 it  is  not  cause  and  effect  is  very  very
[09:58] different  metabolic  syndrome  is  like 
 diabetes  heart  disease  stroke  blood 
 pressure  it's  like  the  things  we
[10:03] correlate  with 
 fat  gain  so  we  think  that  metabolic 
 syndrome  is  caused  by 
 fat  gain  this  is  where  it  gets
[10:09] interesting  hopefully  i've  explained  it 
 in  a  way  that  you  can  understand  because 
 this  is  where 
 if  we  start  getting  to  like  the
[10:14] conspiracy  theories  and  we  start 
 thinking  that  everything  we  know  about 
 fat 
 is  actually  kind  of  wrong  metabolic
[10:20] syndrome  is  not 
 caused  by  fat  gain  about  20  percent  of 
 obese  people  are  actually  relatively
[10:26] healthy 
 because  they  don't  have  metabolic 
 syndrome  and  then  we've  got  to  think 
 okay 
 so  maybe  fat  gain  fat  in  your  body  does
[10:34] not  cause  metabolic  syndrome 
 so  what  does  and  now  we  can  start  to 
 disassociate  and
[10:39] this  sounds  weird  this  is  really  crazy  i 
 never  thought  i'd  be  one  of  those  like 
 um  healthy  every  size  fat  positive
[10:45] people  but  after  doing  so  much  research 
 they  they  are  wrong  that  fat  positive 
 thing  they  are  all  wrong  but
[10:51] fat  is  actually  not  unhealthy  by  itself
[10:56] not  very  unhealthy  like  the  the  effect 
 it  has  you  know  on  your  spine  and  you 
 weigh
[11:01] more  so  you  exercise  less  it's  still 
 quite  significant  but  it's  not  that 
 bad  the  the  huge  problem  the  health
[11:06] problem  that  comes  which  we  thought 
 was  due  to  fat  gain  it  it  comes  from
[11:11] something  else  we've  got  to  ask 
 what  is  causing  metabolic  syndrome 
 because  for  so  long  we've  essentially
[11:16] thought  metabolic  syndrome 
 was  just  caused  by  fat  it  was  caused  by 
 obesity  but  now  we  can  see  that
[11:21] metabolic  syndrome  diabetes  heart 
 disease  stroke 
 is  just  one  symptom  obesity  is  another
[11:26] symptom 
 so  what  are  these  symptoms  of  now  we 
 could  say  calorie  surplus
[11:31] maybe  that's  true  but  then  why  are  some 
 people  who  have  ate  at  a  huge  calorie 
 surplus
[11:36] still  healthy  it's  the  type  of  food  and 
 i'm  gonna  sound  like  a  conspiracy
[11:41] theorist  but  it  is  sugar 
 look  at  these  two  pictures
[11:46] which  one  is  unhealthy  the  one  at  the 
 top  has  got  significantly  more  fat  so
[11:51] he  is  unhealthy  no  i'm  lying  the  one  at 
 the  bottom  is  the  one  who  is  sick
[11:56] the  one  at  the  top  could  actually  be  a 
 relatively  healthy  person  but  the  one  in 
 the  bottom 
 could  die  within  the  next  year  he's  got
[12:03] visceral  fat 
 see  how  his  fat  isn't  on  the  outside 
 it's  on  the  inside  of  his  body 
 that's  the  fat  that  goes  around  our
[12:09] organs  that's  the  dangerous  types  of  fat 
 and  so  now  we're  actually  getting  so 
 deep  where  there's  actually  different
[12:15] types  of  fats 
 and  so  really  this  all  boils  down  to 
 what  is  causing 
 visceral  fat  which  is  the  dangerous  fats
[12:22] and 
 the  the  all-round  general  body  fat 
 we've  actually  got  to  start  to  think
[12:27] that  that  might  not  be 
 unhealthy  for  us  it's  not  ideal  i'd  say 
 the  most  healthiest  thing  is  to  be  about
[12:33] 15 
 body  fat  relatively  strong  and  muscular 
 but 
 it's  not  too  bad  visceral  fat  belly  fat
[12:39] is  the  dangerous  part  i  really  hope  i've 
 explained  this  in  a  way 
 that  you  could  understand  the  question
[12:44] then  is  what  is  causing 
 visceral  fat  visceral  fat  is  the  problem 
 that  is
[12:49] what  we  should  be  concentrating  on  when 
 we  think  about  diet  that  is  what  we 
 should  be  just  thinking  about  in  general
[12:54] to  cure  the  obesity  pandemic  it's  not 
 just  to  eat  less 
 because  eat  less  would  help  the  top  guy
[13:00] it  would  help  the  guy 
 whose  fat  is  just  body  fat  but  we're 
 learning  that  about  20  of  people  are 
 that  top  picture  where  they've  just  got
[13:06] body  fat 
 but  the  types  of  food  they're  eating 
 aren't  giving  them  much 
 visceral  fat  so  they're  relatively
[13:11] healthy  so  honestly  we  don't  really  need 
 to  help  them 
 aesthetically  you  know  they  could  look
[13:16] nicer  they  could  look  more  muscular  and 
 that's  why  they  get  a  personal  trainer 
 but  in  terms  of  health  care  they  don't
[13:22] need  our  help 
 it's  the  bottom  picture  and  these  people 
 this  is  what's  really  surprising
[13:27] this  is  how  skinny  people  get  diabetes 
 we  have  never  seen  this  before
[13:32] i  hope  that  all  the  neurons  in  your 
 brain  are  starting  to  click  and  you're 
 slightly  thinking  wait 
 that's  true  there's  a  phenomenon  of
[13:37] skinny  people  getting  metabolic  syndrome 
 and  we've  thought  the  metabolic  syndrome
[13:42] was  caused  by  fat  gain 
 but  it's  not  it's  caused  by  the  types  of 
 food  we  eat  and  this  is  so  important
[13:47] because 
 now  i  am  adamant  to  say  that  this 
 sickness  that  comes  with  metabolic
[13:53] syndrome  is  not  caused  by  a  calorie 
 surplus  it's  not  caused 
 by  eating  too  much  the  biggest  strain  in
[13:59] our  healthcare  system  the  biggest  reason 
 why  the  obesity  pandemic 
 is  such  a  huge  problem  is  because  of
[14:05] the  type  of  food  that  we  eat  is  causing 
 visceral  fat 
 visceral  fat  is  the  problem  and
[14:11] skinny  people  can  get  this  it's  your 
 diet  it's  not  just  how  much  you  eat
[14:16] and  it's  not  just  the  size  of  you  the 
 weight  of  you  people  with  normal  weight 
 normal  sizes  are  getting  metabolic
[14:21] syndrome  visceral  fat 
 is  causing  metabolic  syndrome  not  just
[14:26] fat  gain  not  just  obesity  obesity  just 
 visually  looking  at  someone  who's  300
[14:32] pounds  is  barely  even  a  problem  let's 
 say  a  250  pound  guy 
 it's  just  harder  for  him  to  exercise  if
[14:38] he  got  to  that  weight  by 
 over  eating  relatively  healthy  foods  but 
 no  one  gets  to  that  weight  by
[14:44] eating  relatively  healthy  food  that's 
 why  such  a  small  number  of  people 
 are  overweight  and  healthy  but  also  most
[14:50] people  who  are  at  normal  weight  at 
 underweight 
 are  also  sick  with  metabolic  syndrome
[14:55] because  it's  the  types  of  food  that 
 we're  all  consuming 
 because  we  all  fell  for  the  biggest  scam
[15:00] this  dumb  little  triangle  this  is  gonna 
 start  to  sound  like  a  conspiracy  theory 
 hopefully  you're  still  following  along
[15:05] and  everything  i'm  saying  is  making 
 sense 
 i'm  not  gonna  explain  much  exactly  why 
 this  dumb  little  triangle  this  pyramid
[15:11] is  the  biggest  scam  humanity  fell  for 
 the  the  tldr 
 of  it  by  putting  carbs  is  our  biggest
[15:16] intake  and  reducing  fat 
 means  that  we  are  inherently  going  to  be 
 eating  more  sugar  even  though
[15:22] the  sugar  is  the  you  know  the  top  of  the 
 pyramid  the  smallest  thing  that  we 
 should  be  having  is  a  treat 
 that  is  impossible  if  fat  is  reduced
[15:30] anything  you've  ever  seen  in  the  shop 
 that  says  low  fat  reduced  fat 
 would  taste  like  absolute  garbage  it
[15:37] would  probably  make  you  throw  up 
 but  the  reason  why  it  doesn't  is  because 
 anything  that  says  low  fat  reduced  fat
[15:44] actually  means  increased  sugar  go  ahead 
 and  look  at  anything  you  can  go  and  find 
 go  and  look  at  any  cereal  any  cheese  any
[15:50] any 
 cream  any  yogurt  anything  you  want  go 
 and  look  at  it  if  it  says  reduce  fat  go
[15:55] and  check  how  much  sugar  it  has 
 and  you'll  be  disgusted  fat  is  taste 
 imagine  a  carb  that  has  no  fat  so  just
[16:01] plain  rice 
 plain  bread  no  butter  tastes  disgusting
[16:06] food  only  tastes  good  when  you  put  fat 
 onto  it  so  when  we  take  the  fat  out  of 
 this  stuff
[16:11] it  tastes  like  but  it's  now  got 
 reduced  calories  where  everyone's  so 
 happy  is  that  hey
[16:16] we're  eating  less  calories  we're  not 
 gonna  get  obese  but  now  it  tastes  like 
  so  what's  the
[16:21] cheapest  substance  that  they  can  add 
 into  it  to  one  make  it  taste  good  but 
 hopefully
[16:26] to  make  you  an  addict  and  make  you  buy 
 it  again 
 sugar  sugar  is  the  reason  why
[16:32] people  are  dying  sugar  is  the  cause  of 
 visceral  fat 
 sugar  in  our  alcohol  alcohol  is  actually
[16:38] a  massive  one  but  that's  got  so  many 
 health  problems  to  it  that  it's  not  just 
 limited  to  visceral  fat  i'm  going  to
[16:44] talk  about  hormones  and  this 
 in  case  i'm  watching  this  younger  me  18 
 year  old  me
[16:49] any  time  that  i'd  watch  videos  like  this 
 and  they  started  talking  about  insulin 
 and  ghrelin  and  leptin  and  all  these
[16:54] hormones  and  brain  signaling 
 it  would  fry  my  brain  and  i'd  just  click 
 off  and  i'd  just  be  thinking  okay  just
[16:59] just  tell  me 
 the  calories  tell  me  what  foods  i  should 
 be  eating  please  trust  me  that  i  wasted 
 years  of  my  life
[17:04] and  i  kept  on  binge  eating  for  so  long 
 up  until  i  understood  about  hormones  so
[17:09] i'll  try  to  explain  this  as  simple  as  i 
 can 
 this  is  the  most  important  part  even 
 with  sugar  we  need  to  understand
[17:15] why  we're  over  eating  it  and  it's  all 
 down  to  our  hormones  literally 
 everything  about  diet  is  down  to  our
[17:21] hormones  because  it's  our  hormones  that 
 makes  us  feel  hungry  it's  our  hormones 
 that  makes  us  want  to  eat  more
[17:26] it's  our  hormones  that  signals  that 
 we're  tired  and  we  can't  exercise 
 my  hormones  on  the  other  hand  signal  to
[17:31] me  that  i  can  exercise  for  three  hours 
 and  enjoy  it  my  hormones  make  me  crave 
 healthy  food
[17:36] i  can't  believe  i  get  to  say  that  my 
 hormones  genuinely  now 
 signal  to  me  to  crave  healthy  food  and
[17:42] signal  to  me  to  go  and  exercise  for  at 
 least  two  to  three  hours  a  day 
 sounds  crazy  i'm  hopefully  going  to  get
[17:48] you  there  i'm  just  saying  this  so  much 
 to  my  younger  self  that  18  20  year  old 
 me  who  would  have  heard  about  insulin 
 and  be  like
[17:53] oh  i  don't  need  to  know  any  of  this  just 
 just  tell  me  what  protein  to  eat 
 don't  be  like  me  listen  to  this  there's
[17:59] three  major  hormones  that  we  need  to 
 know  about  in  terms  of  diets 
 leptin  insulin  ghrelin  let's  start  with
[18:04] leptin  leptin 
 signals  to  our  brain  that  we're  full  and 
 it  actually  signals  to  our  brain  that
[18:09] we've  got  some  energy  to  expend  because 
 we've  just  ate 
 so  we  want  a  good  level  of  leptin  people
[18:14] who've  got  a  healthy  level  of  leptin 
 stop  eating  as  soon  as  they  feel  full 
 they  stop  eating
[18:20] how  crazy  is  that  even  maybe  before  they 
 feel  you  know  sickly  full 
 they  stop  eating  because  they've  gotten 
 that  signal  that  okay  i've  had  enough
[18:26] these  people  are  also  the  people 
 who  can  exercise  for  hours  so  hello  me
[18:31] insulin  is  what  spikes  after  we  eat 
 carbs  especially  sugar 
 insulin  stops  the  leptin  signal
[18:38] how  mad  is  that  insulin  when  we  have 
 carbs  especially  sugar 
 that  stops  that  either  reduces  or  stops
[18:45] the  signaling  from  leptin 
 so  when  our  insulin  goes  up  we  don't  get 
 the  signal  that  we  are  full  when  our
[18:51] insulin  goes  up  we  don't  get  the  signal 
 that  we  are 
 energized  and  we  have  enough  strength  to
[18:57] go  and  exercise 
 so  in  a  practical  sense  eating  carbs 
 especially  sugar 
 tells  our  brain  that  we  need  to  eat  more
[19:04] and  that  we  don't  have 
 energy  which  is  so  weird  because  carbs 
 are  supposed  to  give  us  energy  but
[19:09] that's  like 
 in  the  long  run  there's  a  reason  why  so 
 many  people  after  they  eat  any  kind  of 
 carb
[19:14] they  get  a  dip  in  energy  where  they  just 
 want  to  lay  down  for  a  certain  amount  of 
 time  and  then 
 a  few  hours  later  they  get  like  the
[19:20] boost  of  energy  that  dip  is  your  leptin 
 signal  not  being  heard  by  your  brain 
 because  insulin  is  stopping  it  so  really
[19:25] what  we  want  is  to  reduce  how  much 
 insulin  is  produced  in  our  body 
 insulin's  first  job  is  to  give  our  cells
[19:31] some  energy  so  this  is  why  carbs  give 
 energy  but 
 insulin's  second  job  is  to  store  fat
[19:38] once  we  don't  need  any  more  energy  what 
 else  is  it  going  to  go  into 
 insulin  then  produces  fat  this  we'll
[19:43] talk  about  this  more  later  but  this  is 
 why  the  fitness  industry  is  all  wrong 
 they're  all  just  simpletons
[19:48] who  have  just  not  looked  into  like  a 
 level 
 science  to  realize  this  stuff  that  what
[19:54] you  eat 
 truly  changes  like  if  we  just  talk  about 
 calories  macronutrients 
 we're  not  talking  about  insulin  and  now
[20:00] don't  you  see  that  the  insulin  is  what 
 causes  fat  gain 
 so  imagine  if  we  had  days  where  we
[20:05] didn't  have  much 
 insulin  at  all  we  didn't  have  much  carbs 
 at  all  would  we  still  gain  fat
[20:11] now  you  would  be  saying  okay  on  a 
 calorie  surplus  yes 
 but  it's  debatable  and  trust  me  i  have
[20:16] 100 
 been  in  this  situation  where  no  no  it's 
 a  calorie  surplus  that's  the  only  thing 
 that  matters
[20:21] but  now  i  am  unconvinced  and  i'm  pretty 
 sure 
 i'm  on  the  other  side  now  where  i  don't
[20:27] believe  you  can  actually  gain  fat 
 if  you  reduce  sugar  if  we  overeat  carbs
[20:32] and  if  we  overeat  sugar 
 insulin  starts  producing  fat  because 
 we've  got  an  excess  of  energy  now  we
[20:37] should  be  using  that  energy  to  go  and 
 exercise  but  insulin 
 reduces  the  leptin  signaling  for  some
[20:43] time  and  so  that  means  that  if  you 
 overeat  which  pretty  much  all  of  us 
 overeat  all  the  time  insulin  is  going  to
[20:48] start  producing  fat  which  means  that  we 
 are  producing  fats  pretty  much  every  day 
 because 
 kind  of  side  note  food  has  been  made  to
[20:55] be  over  eight 
 so  then  we  could  say  that  fat  gain  is 
 caused  by  insulin  which
[21:00] it  pretty  much  is  so  the  question  then 
 we  should  be  asking  is 
 what  actually  causes  the  highest  amount
[21:06] of  insulin  what  causes  a  small  amount 
 and  we  should  be  choosing  the 
 the  foods  that  has  the  small  amounts  of
[21:11] insulin  spike 
 this  is  what's  called  the  glycemic  load 
 it's  kind  of  like  complicated  so  i  won't 
 get  into  it  too  much  but  pretty  much  if
[21:17] you  can  just 
 trust  the  research  and  i'll  link  some 
 things  that  you  can  learn  from  as  well 
 low  quality  junk  food  has  a  high
[21:23] glycemic  load 
 and  high  glycemic  load  converts  into 
 high  insulin
[21:28] so  it's  what  you've  known  all  this  time 
 shitty  junk  food  even  stuff  that  isn't 
 high  in  sugar 
 still  has  a  high  glycemic  load  so  that
[21:35] converts  to  higher  insulin 
 so  again  there  is  bad  food  food  that 
 heavily  spikes  your  insulin
[21:41] is  bad  do  not  trust  the  youtubers  who 
 keep 
 the  cringy  videos  minor  there's  no  such
[21:46] thing  as  bad  food  it's  it's  just 
 marketable  just  so  now  hopefully  you've
[21:51] got  like  an  a  level  understanding  this 
 is  what  you  should  have  known  when  you 
 were  like  13  years  old  but  of  course
[21:56] school  didn't  teach  us  this  doctors 
 don't  even  know  this  the  the  fitness 
 industry  are  just  a  bunch  of
[22:01] photoshopping  steroid-taking 
  that  are  not  going  to  tell 
 you  the  truth 
 because  it's  not  marketable  so  hopefully
[22:07] now  you  know  that  all 
 calories  are  not  the  same  there  is  bad
[22:12] food 
 and  so  the  objective  of  any  diet  plan 
 should  be  one  that  gets  you  to 
 reduce  the  bad  food  but  heavily  focuses
[22:19] on  increasing  the  good  food 
 the  food  that's  got  a  low  glycemic  index 
 the  food  that  doesn't  heavily  spike  your
[22:25] insulin 
 the  food  that  doesn't  mess  up  your 
 leptin  signaling  which  means  that  when 
 you  eat  it
[22:30] you  start  to  feel  really  full  and 
 satiated  the  final  hormone  that  we  have 
 to  talk  about  is  guerrilla  and  put
[22:35] simply  ghrelin  is  just 
 your  hunger  hormone  when  you  feel  hungry 
 that's  because  ghrelin  has  been  released
[22:40] to  signal  that  you  should  eat 
 ghrelin  is  just  a  hormone  it's  just  a 
 feeling  you  don't 
 the  psychological  mindset  is  that  you
[22:46] don't  actually  have  to 
 listen  to  it  so  it's  interesting  to  know 
 that  our  hunger  feeling
[22:51] is  just  a  hormone  and  now  if  we  can 
 understand  what  ghrelin  is  like 
 we  can  understand  hunger  the  very
[22:57] important  part  of  obesity  or  fat  gain 
 is  why  are  people  who  are  fat  why  are 
 people  who  overeat
[23:02] still  hungry  that's  a  very  important 
 question  it's  because  of  ghrelin  brellin 
 doesn't  really  care  if  you've
[23:08] ate  much  ghrelin  increases  at  the  time 
 that  you  normally  eat 
 but  what's  really  surprising  which  most
[23:13] people  haven't  put  together 
 is  that  if  you  don't  eat  your  ghrelin 
 goes  down  think  about  that  time  that  you
[23:18] were  like  really  really  busy 
 that  one  time  you  didn't  eat  for like 
 you  know  eight  hours  were  you  literally
[23:23] starving  at  the  end  that  you 
 you  were  like  about  to  die  now  you  got 
 the  you  got  the  feeling
[23:28] of  gret  and  you  got  the  feeling  of 
 hunger  and  you  started  feeling  quite 
 hungry 
 but  after  about  an  hour  the  hunger  went
[23:33] down  this  graph 
 shows  exactly  what  ghrelin  is  like  it 
 just  spikes  when  you  normally  eat  food
[23:39] so  you  can  see  that  these  spikes  are  at 
 breakfast  lunch  and  dinner  but  the 
 amount  of  ghrelin  our  body  produces  just
[23:44] goes  down 
 after  the  time  that  we  stop  eating  so 
 ghrelin  just  kind  of  likes  consistency 
 it  just  wants  us  to  eat  at  the  same  time
[23:50] every  day  kind  of  gives  us 
 a  reminder  to  feel  hungry  at  the  same 
 time  to  just  signal  like  oh  yeah
[23:55] like  this  is  when  you  normally  eat  to  go 
 and  eat  but  we  don't  have  to  listen  to 
 it  and  you  can  see  that  ghrelin  goes
[24:00] down  so  that  explains  why  people  who 
 overeat  still  feel  hungry  because 
 ghrelin  just  kicks  in
[24:05] when  we  normally  eat  and  it  also 
 explains  why  people  who  do  fasting
[24:10] people  who  fast  for  days  at  a  time 
 actually  don't  feel  like 
 disgustingly  starving  by  the  end  of  it
[24:15] because  ghrelin  goes  up 
 and  it  goes  down  we  kind  of  believe  that 
 our  hunger  would  go
[24:21] up  in  a  linear  correlation  with  how  long 
 it's  been  since  we  ate  but  that's  not 
 true
[24:26] the  ghrelin  the  hunger  just  goes  up  and 
 down  in  waves  so  that  was  a  lot  to  take 
 in 
 you've  just  had  your  entire  knowledge
[24:33] of  diet  of  nutrition  completely  changed 
 hopefully 
 and  now  we're  going  to  talk  more  about
[24:40] on  a  societal 
 level  the  issues  with  diets  and  the 
 first  one  that  i've  got  a  bone  to  pick
[24:45] with  is  the  fitness  industry  because 
 these 
 contributed  to  my  binge  eating  disorder
[24:50] what  is  the  purpose  of  any  content 
 online  what  what  do  the  news  wants  when 
 they  when  they  post  really  scary  stuff
[24:56] about  like 
 the  deaths  of  kovid  and  you  know  like 
 click  bait  and 
 what  do  they  want  they  want  views  they
[25:01] want  attention  so  bigger  things 
 things  that  are  quite  unconventional  get 
 more  views  so  fitness  people  with  abs
[25:07] who  are  doing  10  000  calorie  challenges 
 and  who  are  saying  you  can  eat  anything 
 you  want  there's  no  such  thing  as  bad
[25:12] food 
 that's  marketable  that's  so  interesting 
 that  i'm  gonna  click  on  it  even  though  i 
 know  it's  not  true  you're  gonna  click  on
[25:17] it  you've  watched 
 at  least  a  hundred  videos  of  some 
 fitness  guy  with  abs 
 who  who  says  that  he  eats  cocoa  pops  and
[25:23] stuff  and  he  does 
 and  that's  the  skit  and  that's  the  this 
 is  the  mind-boggling  thing  that  we  have 
 to  wrap  our  heads  around
[25:29] i  have  been  in  a  fantastic  shape  whilst 
 binge  eating 
 multiple  days  in  a  row  like  multiple
[25:35] months  in  a  row 
 how  the  most  common  diet  in  the  fitness 
 industry  is  if  it  fits  your  macros  my
[25:41] fitness  palace  made  this  very  convenient 
 you  set  your  number  of  macros  and  then 
 you  aim  to  hit  that  goal  with  pretty
[25:47] much 
 anything  you  want  that  makes  it  so  cool 
 wait  so  if  i  go  to  the  gym 
 and  i  track  what  i  eat  i  can  eat
[25:54] anything  i  want  so  you're  telling  me 
 i've  got  80  grams  of  carbs  and  i  can  eat 
 a  donut
[25:59] and  they'll  be  like  yeah  and  you'll  eat 
 it  and  you  will  actually  lose  weight  and 
 you'll  be  like  oh  my  god
[26:04] that  is  mad  calories  don't  matter  all 
 calories  are  the  same 
 just  eat  less  and  idiots  like  me  have
[26:11] preached  this  for  so  long 
 without  having  the  basic  level  of 
 education  to  know  that
[26:16] it  is  not  healthy  i  can't  believe  that 
 it's  so  common  sense  that  it  took  me 
 years  to  realize  that
[26:21] eating  junk  food  is  not  healthy  even 
 though  the  junk  food  can  reduce
[26:26] that  body  fat  if  you  just  eat  less 
 remember  we  said  that  there's  two  types 
 of  fat  the  fitness  industry  only  care
[26:32] about  that 
 visible  body  fat  because  it's  full  of 
 narcissistic  vain  people  like  myself  who
[26:37] only  care  about 
 appearance  it  is  mad  it  is  crazy  that 
 the  fitness  industry 
 is  full  of  some  of  the  most  unhealthy
[26:43] people  do  not  trust  these  people  what's 
 happening  in  the  fitness  industry 
 since  they  only  care  about  appearance
[26:48] they  only  focus  on  reducing  the  first 
 level  of  fat 
 but  in  order  to  do  that  in  a  marketable
[26:53] way  which  is  hey  guys  you  can  eat 
 anything  you  want  just  track  your  macros 
 and  eat  less  calories
[26:58] it's  causing  the  visceral  fat  mark  my 
 words  in  20  years  time  most  of  these 
 people  that  you're  seeing  on  the  biggest
[27:03] fitness  pages 
 they're  all  going  to  have  diabetes  and  a 
 lot  of  them  are  gonna  die  from  stroke 
 and  heart  disease  i  know  it  sounds  like
[27:08] disgusting  for  me  to  say  that 
 i  don't  wish  it  on  anyone  but  i  believe 
 it's  true  i  believe  it's  gonna  be  a  very
[27:14] scary  moment  in  about  20  years  time  when 
 the  biggest  people  of  the  fitness 
 industry  start
[27:19] dropping  like  flies  because  of  the 
 visceral  fat  that  they're  gaining  from 
 this  if  it  fits  your  macros
[27:24] why  clean  eating  is  bad  for  you  lost 
 respect  for  geoff  nippardman  when  i 
 mentioned  diet  in  a  previous  video  one
[27:30] guy  commented  and  he  said 
 i  see  what  you  mean  it's  not  healthy  to 
 eat  this  stuff  but
[27:35] technically  if  you  only  care  about  what 
 you  look  like  you'd  look  the  same  you'd 
 have  the  same  body  composition  if  you
[27:40] ate  junk  food  compared  to 
 healthy  food  and  that  is  what  the 
 fitness  industry
[27:45] has  preached  that  we're  only  caring 
 about  appearance  so  if  you  eat  junk  food 
 you  get  to  enjoy  the  junk  food  and
[27:51] you  get  to  look  good  and  that  is  not 
 true  you  might  get  to  look 
 good  and  you  might  get  to  still  make
[27:56] progress  eating  the  junk  food  but  your 
 body  composition  what  you  look  like 
 if  we're  only  caring  about  appearance  by
[28:02] the  way  is  not  going  to  be  as  good 
 as  if  you  ate  clean  healthy  foods 
 because  the  way  that  i'll  have  the
[28:08] comment 
 of  me  in  this  guy  the  way  that  i 
 explained  it  to  him  was  that  when  you 
 eat  the  healthy  food  you're  just  better
[28:14] fueled  for  the  workout  and  when  you're 
 better 
 fueled  for  the  workout  you  just  have  a 
 better  body  composition  you're  going  to
[28:19] make  more  muscle 
 in  the  leg  session  in  which  you  had 
 chicken  or  rice  beforehand  compared  to 
 be  in
[28:24] cocoa  pops  and  that's  just  on  a  base 
 level  if  we're  just  talking  about  how  it 
 fuels  your  workout  the  leptin  is
[28:29] actually  very  important  in  this  because 
 the  low  quality  junk  food 
 since  it  blocks  the  leptin  signal  it 
 actually  means  one  you're  gonna  eat  more
[28:35] which  means  that  you're  more  prone  to 
 binge  eating  so 
 you  just  look  anyway  and  to  your
[28:40] brain  not  getting  the  leptin  signal 
 means  that  you're  gonna  feel  more  tired 
 and  exercise  less  with  less  intensity
[28:46] so  the  junk  food  is  going  to  lead  to 
 exercising  less 
 so  that  if  it  fits  your  macros  it's
[28:51] completely  it's  just  it  should  have 
 never  even  been  something  that  we  all 
 preach  then 
 idiots  like  me  which  i'm  so  ashamed  of
[28:58] preached  it  for  so  long 
 after  being  like  so  into  the  fitness 
 industry  i've  concluded  that
[29:03] it's  riddled  with  mental  health  problems 
 it's  riddled  with  binge  eating  disorders 
 it's  riddled  with  anxiety  with
[29:08] depression  with  low  self-esteem  just 
 don't  trust  them 
 there's  a  reason  why  each  and  every  one
[29:13] of  these  fitness  enthusiasts 
 are  doing  binge  eating  challenges 
 because  they've  got  an  eating  disorder
[29:18] and  they  think  oh  as  long  as  i  record  it 
 and  i  look  pretty  whilst  eating  i'll  get 
 some  views 
 don't  trust  them  so  let's  move  on  what
[29:24] is  a  healthy  diet  what  should  you  eat 
 now  again  even  though  i've  said  there's
[29:29] so  much  bad  food 
 my  advice  in  terms  of  the  diet  is  not  to 
 reduce  the  bad  food  because  if  that  is
[29:34] your  mindset 
 that  actually  gets  quite  depressing  you 
 wake  up  with  like  a  sense  of  anxiety
[29:39] like  you've  got  craving  for  mcdonald's 
 for  chocolate  for  crisps 
 and  you  think  oh  no  no  hamsa  the
[29:45] youtuber  said  not  to  eat  it  and  then 
 you've  got  to  think  like  oh  but 
 i  don't  want  any  damn  vegetables  it's
[29:51] not  a  good  way  to  live 
 instead  my  advice  has  always  been  to 
 have  the  positive  approach  to  eat
[29:56] more  good  food  to  eat  more  healthy  food 
 the  unprocessed  food  what  is
[30:01] unprocessed  food  i  used  to  watch  these 
 videos  years  ago 
 and  when  they  say  unprocessed  i  never
[30:06] really  put  two  and  two  together 
 so  the  way  that  i  like  to  think  about  it 
 now  which
[30:11] it  maybe  seems  a  little  bit  overboard 
 but  when  you  try  it 
 you'll  see  that  it's  like  a  fail-proof
[30:17] system  as  long  as  you 
 keep  using  the  system  before  you  eat 
 anything 
 look  at  the  ingredient  list  usually  in
[30:23] unprocessed  food 
 there  is  no  ingredient  list  because  the 
 food  is  the  ingredient
[30:28] the  ingredients  in  potato  is  potato  the 
 ingredients  in
[30:33] broccoli  is  broccoli  you  see  how  they 
 are  literally  like 
 one  base  ingredients  and  then  go  and
[30:39] look  at  something  that's  processed  here 
 is 
 a  picture  of  a  mcdonald's  wrap  so
[30:45] there's  a  lot  of  ingredients  right  so  my 
 so  my  little  system  that  i  do 
 which  i  try  to  stick  to  but  even  i  do
[30:51] you  know  fail  it  i  don't  follow  it 
 sometimes  is 
 always  look  at  the  ingredients  and  if 
 there  is  one  thing  on  the  ingredients
[30:57] list  that  you  don't  know 
 that  you  literally  cannot  like  identify 
 it  right  now  what  this  is  what  it  looks
[31:02] like  what  you  know  where  it  came  from 
 google  it  look  at  the  ingredients  list 
 and  just  google  the  things  that  you 
 don't  know
[31:07] and  you'll  find  that  how  long  it  takes 
 you  to  do  that  with  something  like 
 mcdonald's
[31:12] is  not  even  worth  it  and  so  this  is  how 
 you  pick  the  unprocessed  foods  it's  just 
 to  think  about  the  foods 
 that  are  like  the  base  natural
[31:19] ingredients  and  just  have  them 
 and  do  not  fall  for  the  the  american
[31:24] view  that  are  this  but  this  food  is  it's 
 hard  to  prepare  it's  not  quick  easy  and 
 cheap  and  it  doesn't  taste  nice
[31:30] one  nutrition  your  diet  should  not  be 
 quick  easy  and  cheap  i  can't  believe
[31:35] those  words 
 have  have  to  be  said  your  nutrition  is 
 something  to  invest  in 
 if  you  are  one  of  those  people  who  wants
[31:41] your  diet  to  be  quick  easy  and  cheap 
 that's  disgusting  your  nutrition  should 
 be  somewhat  of  a  slow  process  that  you
[31:48] put 
 a  lot  of  intention  into  it  should  be  not 
 expensive  but  it  should  be  not  expensive 
 it  should  be  kind  of  frugal  but  it
[31:54] should  be 
 high  quality  and  it  should  not  be  just 
 easy
[31:59] it  could  if  that's  like  a  positive  of 
 some  kind  of  healthy  food  yes 
 but  most  healthy  food  is  not  quick  easy
[32:05] and  cheap  and  that's  okay 
 this  is  something  to  invest  in  to  invest 
 some  time  some  effort  some  money  into
[32:10] better  nutrition  and  that  is 
 one  of  the  best  investments  you'll  ever 
 make  in  your  life  and  then  the  taste
[32:15] factor  we've  been  conditioned  from 
 childhood  to  think  that  vegetables 
 aren't  tasty 
 they  are  it's  just  that  your  parents
[32:20] aren't  really  good  at  cooking  them  learn 
 how  to  cook  them  you've  got  the  internet 
 at  your  hands  you've  hopefully  learned 
 so  much  in  this  video  and  you  hopefully
[32:26] understand  that  the  internet  can  be  used 
 to  go  and  learn  things  ask  yourself  this 
 question  how  many  hours  in  the  last
[32:31] month  have  you  spent 
 actively  searching  to  find  out  how  to 
 make  healthy  food  taste  nice
[32:36] zero  100  of  the  people  watching  this 
 have  spent  zero  hours 
 actively  searching  on  how  to  make
[32:41] healthy  food  taste  nice  i've  just  called 
 you  out  but  it's  true 
 when  was  the  last  time  you  literally
[32:46] googled  how  to  make  broccoli  taste 
 better 
 you've  never  done  that  in  your  life  i've 
 never  done  that  in  my  life  i'm
[32:52] just  being  biased  but  i  have  done  that 
 with  things  like  salmon  with  sweet 
 potatoes  so  here's  my  advice
[32:57] start  with  the  ingredients  let's  say 
 sweet  potatoes  they're  quite  nice 
 then  do  a  little  google  search  watch  a
[33:02] little  youtube  video  and  go  and  look  at 
 the  one  that  looks  quite  nice 
 how  to  make  sweet  potatoes  taste  better
[33:07] how  to  make  broccoli  taste  better  how  to 
 make 
 salmon  and  sweet  corn  and  oats  taste
[33:13] better 
 all  of  these  one  based  natural 
 ingredients  can  taste  delicious 
 it's  just  that  we've  never  really  put
[33:19] time  to  make  them  delicious  the 
 information  is  at  your  fingertips 
 it  sounds  kind  of  cliche  but  lots  of
[33:24] vegetables  high  fat  low  sugar 
 high  fiber  is  the  way  to  go  the 
 mentality  to  have  with  this  healthy  diet
[33:29] is  that  it's  not  just  going  to  click 
 like  this 
 most  for  some  reason  that's  the 
 mentality  we  all  have  with  everything
[33:35] that  we  do 
 we  get  so  motivated  by  a  video  like  this 
 and  then 
 don't  have  a  100  perfect  diet  the  next
[33:42] day 
 and  we're  like  oh  i  can't  even  do  it 
 like  no  bro 
 it  takes  a  while  you  dumbass  like  stay
[33:47] to  it  have  the  mentality  that  you  want 
 to  have  a  healthy  diet  and  nutritious 
 diets  which  doesn't  mess  up  your
[33:52] hormones 
 and  start  following  that  as  best  as  you 
 can  every  day  it's  not  we're  not  doing
[33:57] like  a  binary  thinking  of  zero  to  one 
 like  oh  if  you  ate  something  bad  today 
 that's  it  the  whole  day's  gone  off  and
[34:02] you  failed  no  no  it's  like  zero  to  one 
 hundred  and  most  days 
 you're  going  to  end  up  about  50  about
[34:07] 60.  hopefully  this  video  will  help  you 
 get  to  like  60  70. 
 that's  okay  don't  think  that  you  start
[34:12] at  100  and  the  moment  you  ate  something 
 bad  you're  at  zero 
 so  the  rest  of  the  day  you  may  as  well 
 binge  eat  don't  do  that  let's  talk  about
[34:18] binge  eating  there  is  two 
 cures  to  binge  eating  which  is 
 mindfulness  and
[34:23] the  foods  that  don't  mess  up  your 
 hormones  that's  the  two  things  you  need 
 to  know 
 no  one  else  is  telling  you  this  advice
[34:29] the  advice  that  i  see  on  the  big 
 youtubers  channels  like 
 just  wait  20  minutes  if  you  want  to
[34:34] binge  eat  you  can  just  wait 
 20  minutes  the  lack  of  the  lack  of 
 education  and  knowledge  in  videos  like
[34:40] that  just  makes  me  cr  it  makes  me  hate 
 the  person  that's  making  the  video 
 because  i  just  think  like 
 you're  not  even  helping  anyone  it's  just
[34:46] that  clickbait  it  looks  so  marketable  by 
 you 
 saying  oh  you  just  wait  20  minutes  i  was
[34:51] a  chronic  binge  eater  and  it's  been  over 
 six  months  since  i've  binge  it  exactly 
 how  did  i  do  it  through  the  healthy  diet
[34:57] change 
 remember  those  hormones  again  it  is  the 
 lack  of 
 leptin  signaling  to  your  brain  that
[35:03] causes  binge  eating  remember  that  leptin 
 signals  to  our  brain  that  we're  full  and 
 that  we  can  stop  eating  and  remember
[35:08] that 
 insulin  blocks  that  leptin  signal  so  if 
 you  want  to  feel  full  and  not  just  you
[35:13] know 
 the  feeling  of  full  but  actually  you  get 
 that  like  satisfying  thing  where 
 you  actually  don't  eat  anymore  what
[35:19] we've  got  to  do  is  make  sure  that  we're 
 getting  that  leptin  signal  and  we  get 
 that  left  in  signal 
 by  not  having  a  massive  spike  in  our
[35:25] insulin  so  secure  binge  eating 
 eat  food  with  low  glycemic  load  eat  food
[35:30] that  doesn't  heavily  spike  your  insulin 
 which  means  low  sugar  and  low  amounts  of
[35:35] processed  food 
 no  one  ever  in  the  history  of  mankind 
 has  ever  binge  ate  on  oats
[35:40] yeah  maybe  if  they  put  chocolate  in  the 
 oats  then  they've  been  shaped  on  it  but 
 no  one  has  ever  binged 
 on  healthy  vegetables  because  you  you
[35:47] get  sickly  full  from  it  in  in  such  a 
 satisfying  way  because  it  doesn't  spike 
 your  insulin  much  this  is  another
[35:52] problem  of  the  fitness  industry  which 
 has  caused  so  much  binge  eating  around 
 the  world  that  promoting  this  idea
[35:57] of  you  know  there's  no  there's  no  such 
 thing  as  bad  food  all  calories  are  the 
 same  just  if  it  fits  your  macros  eat  the
[36:02] right  calories 
 the  problem  with  that  is  that  when  you 
 tell  people  that  you  can  eat  some  junk
[36:07] food 
 that  is  how  binge  eating  starts  no  one 
 actually  starts  the  day
[36:12] eating  something  healthy  like  oats  and 
 eggs  or  something  and  says  straight 
 after  the  eggs
[36:17] they  think  you  know  what  i'm  gonna  binge 
 eat  on  these  eggs  mommy  make  me  20  more 
 eggs  no  one  does  that
[36:22] it's  you  started  the  day  pretty  nicely 
 and  then  you  had  the  first  sweet 
 thing  or  you  had  the  first  processed
[36:28] junk  food  and  then  you  binge  ate  so  the 
 cure  to  this  binge  eating 
 firstly  is  to  just  not  really  have  those
[36:34] foods  have  them 
 every  now  and  then  and  even  then  you'll 
 find  that  really 
 ever  having  food  that  is  low  quality
[36:40] ever  having  food  that's  high  in  sugar 
 will  have  a  risk  of  binge  eating  if  you 
 never  eat  that  food  which  i  know  sounds
[36:46] really  serious  but  if  you  pretty  much 
 never  eat  that  food 
 you  will  never  binge  eat  again  and 
 you'll  be  happier  healthier  and  you'll
[36:52] actually  feel  full  all  the  time  instead 
 of  that  sickly  feeling  where 
 you  don't  feel  full  but  you  do  feel  full
[36:57] and  you  feel  like  and  you've  just 
 ate  a  week's  worth  of  calories  i've  done 
 a  video  a  while  ago  on  how  mindfulness
[37:03] cures  binge  eating  i  think  mindfulness 
 is 
 the  most  effective  cure  for  any 
 addiction  most  addictions  we  indulge  in
[37:10] mindlessly  we  aren't  thinking  straight 
 when  we  start  overeating  and  stuff 
 having  increased  levels  of  mindfulness
[37:15] through  meditation  it  kind  of  gives  you 
 like  an  extra  second 
 a  second  chance  before  you're  about  to
[37:20] indulge  in  something  a  huge  part  of 
 binge  eating  happens  because  of  anxiety
[37:25] we  binge  eat  for  comfort  because  that  is 
 the  comfortable  thing  in  our  day  that  we
[37:30] we  we  associate  good  positive  feelings 
 with 
 especially  if  we've  had  a  stressful  day
[37:35] again  mindfulness  is  the  cure  to  that  it 
 might  seem  like  i'm  oversimplifying  it
[37:40] this  video  is  not  about  mindful 
 meditation  but  if  you  watch  one  of  the 
 playlists  you'll  probably  understand  why
[37:45] i  preach  it  so  much  now  let's  talk  about 
 diet  in  terms  of  building  muscle  the 
 most 
 effective  way  to  build  muscle  is  to  be
[37:51] in  a  calorie  surplus  but 
 do  not  follow  the  fatty  youtube 
 weightlifter  advice
[37:56] eating  in  a  calorie  surplus  does  not 
 mean  to  eat  you've  hopefully  now 
 got  the  level  of  education  required  to
[38:02] know  that 
 we  don't  want  to  spike  our  insulin  we 
 don't  want  to  mess  up  our  hormones  our 
 leptin  we  don't  want  to  eat  that
[38:08] that  gives  us  visceral  fat 
 what  we  want  is  to  simply  eat  more  of 
 the  healthy  foods  and  this 
 is  where  bulking  becomes  not  fun  this  is
[38:16] where  bulking  becomes 
 difficult  to  build  muscle  efficiently 
 you  have  to  bulk 
 and  most  people  love  to  bulk  because
[38:22] that  is  their  excuse  for  their  eating 
 disorder  they  just  want  to  eat  more 
 junk  food  if  you  don't  want  to  get 
 metabolic  syndrome  and  you  want  to  do
[38:28] this  in  a  healthy  way  to  build  muscle 
 bulking  is  difficult  because  bulking 
 literally  means  to  eat
[38:33] more  of  the  food  that  really  fills  you 
 up  so  when  you're  bulking  you  should 
 feel  like
[38:38] it's  a  struggle  that's  why  when  people 
 talk  about  weightlifting  and  diets 
 they  say  that  the  diet  is  actually  way
[38:43] harder  and  it  only  is  harder 
 if  you  eat  the  healthy  foods  bulking
[38:48] should  be  a  struggle  because  you're 
 literally  force  feeding  yourself 
 calories  if  you  eat  junk  it's  easy  but
[38:54] if  you  eat  junk 
 that's  going  into  visceral  fat  you  will 
 gain  weight  when  you  do  that 
 and  it'll  seem  like  you  are  bulking
[38:59] because  your  weight's  going  up  and  you 
 look  a  little  bit  bigger 
 but  really  what's  just  happening  is  that 
 most  of  it  is  fat  and  most  of  that  fat
[39:05] is  visceral  fat  it's  not  what  we  want  in 
 a  ideal  world 
 we'd  like  to  gain  just  muscle  and  zero
[39:12] fat 
 that  would  literally  be  like  a  dream  and 
 the  closest  you  can  get  to  that  is  by 
 doing  it
[39:17] in  the  most  clean  eating  way  the  foods 
 that  don't  mess  up  your  leptin  signal 
 just  foods
[39:22] that  don't  give  you  visceral  fat  the 
 foods  that  don't  spike  your  insulin  eat 
 big  to  get  big  is  a  myth
[39:27] we  only  need  a  moderate  calorie  surplus 
 as  a  very  rough  amount  we  only  need  to 
 eat  like  an  extra  200  calories  a  day  so
[39:33] it's  not  too  much 
 if  you're  eating  that  with  healthy  foods 
 that  don't  spike  your  insulin  that  don't
[39:38] mess  up  your  leptin 
 your  body  composition  will  look  so  much 
 better  at  the  end  of  your  bulk  than  if
[39:43] you  ate  just 
 junk  food  even  though  the  junk  food 
 would  technically  feel  like  you  were 
 doing  it  right  because
[39:48] your  weight  would  go  up  but  remember 
 strip  back  down  to  the  basics  we  don't 
 just  want  our  weight  to  go  up  we  only
[39:54] use  weights  as  just  a  way  to  track  our 
 progress  in  the  bulk  but  what  we  really 
 want  when  we  bulk
[39:59] is  just  muscle  we  want  as  close  to  100 
 muscle  gain  as  possible  we  want  as  least
[40:05] fat  gain  as  possible  because  fat  gain 
 just  means  that  we  have  to  then  go  and 
 do  a  cut 
 i'm  losing  my  voice  so  when  trying  to
[40:11] build  muscle 
 focus  on  lean  bulking  with  a  small  to 
 moderate  calorie  surplus
[40:16] and  that  calorie  surplus  should  entirely 
 come  from  the  same  foods 
 of  healthy  high  fiber  high  fats  low
[40:22] sugar 
 low  glycemic  load  so  just  remember  that 
 bulking  shouldn't  be
[40:28] fun  it  shouldn't  be  something  that 
 you're  thinking  like  oh  well  i  can't 
 wait  to  eat  some  muffins  after  my 
 workout  because  it's  got  carbs  and
[40:34] the  fitness  people  told  me  it's  okay  no 
 no  we're  still  trying  to  eat  healthy 
 bulking  is  not  an  excuse  for  your  eating
[40:39] disorder 
 that's  my  message  to  everyone  in  the 
 fitness  industry  finally  losing  fat
[40:45] losing  fat  requires  you  to  be  in  a 
 calorie  deficit  that  means  to  eat  less 
 than  your  maintenance  now  being  in  a
[40:51] calorie  deficit  is  not  a  problem 
 everyone's  so  scared  of  going  on  to  a 
 cut  because  they  eat  junk  food  when  you
[40:56] eat  junk  food 
 you  spike  your  insulin  you  mess  up  the 
 leptin  you  are  hungry  all  the  time
[41:01] so  imagine  now  trying  to  be  on  reduced 
 calories  and  still  be  easing 
 that's  what  everyone  in  the  fitness
[41:06] industry  does  don't  do  that  if  you  cut 
 and  you  only  eat 
 again  the  same  foods  that  we've
[41:11] mentioned  cutting's  fine  you  actually 
 like 
 you  actually  look  forward  to  it  because 
 it's  a  time  when  you  don't  have  to  force
[41:17] feed  yourself 
 100  grams  of  oats  and  300  grams  of  rice 
 it's  it's 
 it's  not  too  bad  perhaps  i'll  make  a
[41:23] whole  video  on  what's  called  water 
 fasting  but  that  is  now  what  i  preach  as 
 the  most  efficient  way  to  lose  fat
[41:28] so  to  lose  fats  you  have  to  be  in  a 
 calorie  deficit  we've  already  known  this 
 but  hopefully  with
[41:33] some  knowledge  that  i've  told  you  in 
 this  video  you  now  hopefully  understand 
 the  types  of  food  you  eat  will  make  or
[41:40] break  the  cut  it  will  make  or  break  your 
 life 
 so  do  not  cut  do  not  just  eat  the  the
[41:46] shitty  food  that's  making  all  this 
 difficult  that's  leading  to  the 
 metabolic  syndrome  losing  fat
[41:51] is  easy  it  is  literally  easy  when  you 
 eat 
 the  the  healthy  processed  foods  here's  a
[41:57] little  graph  of  my  fat  loss 
 i  did  it  with  healthy  foods  and  i  have 
 always  struggled  with  cutting  because
[42:02] a  day  into  the  cut  i  start  pinch  eating 
 because  i  would  try  to  cut 
 doing  if  it  fits  your  macros  if  it  fits
[42:08] your  macros  is 
 the  horrible  way  the  worst  way  to  diet 
 because 
 the  moment  you  have  a  bit  of  sugar  the
[42:14] moment  you  have  a  bit  of  that  unhealthy 
 food 
 most  people  can't  stop  there  and  so 
 every  cut  beforehand  i've  pretty  much
[42:20] failed  apart  from  this  one 
 because  i  didn't  eat  any  of that  junk 
 and  i  was  full  i  literally  did  not  feel
[42:25] hungry  i 
 i'm  being  honest  i  know  this  is  a 
 privilege  that  i'm  grateful  of 
 i  forgot  what  hunger  feels  like  you
[42:31] probably  won't  believe  me  but  that  is 
 the  truth  i  genuinely  forgot  what  hunger 
 feels  like  i  have  not  felt  hunger
[42:36] in  over  six  months  i'm  literally  being 
 serious  and  there's  some  days  where  i've 
 done  like  a  bit  of  intermittent  fasting
[42:41] i  didn't  eat  till  four  pm 
 i  have  not  felt  the  hunger  i've  not  felt 
 ghrelin
[42:46] in  six  months  let  me  say  that  again  i 
 have  not  felt  what  hunger  feels  like  in
[42:51] six  months  i've  kind  of 
 forgot  what  it  feels  like  because  i  am 
 constantly  full  and  satiated
[42:56] even  on  a  calorie  deficit  because  of  the 
 foods  that  i  eat  unprocessed 
 my  leptin  signaling  much  must  be  so
[43:02] amazing  and 
 i  can  exercise  for  about  three  hours  a 
 day  i  know  that  this  seems  like  an
[43:07] exaggeration  you're  like  he  must  be  over 
 training  or  he's  lying  like 
 it's  true  and  i  do  it  with  a  smile  on  my
[43:12] face  i  actually  feel  energized 
 throughout  all  of  it  and 
 it  feels  good  to  me  when  you  eat  this
[43:17] stuff  it  it  changes  your  life  man  for 
 example  yesterday  i  did 
 my  leg  session  in  the  gym  which  was  one
[43:22] hour  and  20  minutes  i  did  a  45  minute 
 run  a  5k 
 run  then  i  went  to  my  gymnastic  ring
[43:27] spot  and  it  did  a  one  hour  session  there 
 so  that's  about  three  hours  that  i 
 exercised  yesterday  my  body's  pretty
[43:32] like  sore  but 
 in  a  nice  way  i  could  not  imagine  being 
 like  this  a  year  ago
[43:37] i  think  the  reason  why  is  because  of  my 
 leptin  signaling  because  i  finally 
 gave  my  body  the  nutrition  it  deserves
[43:43] and 
 i  think  that  this  is  one  of  the  best 
 things  you  can  do  for  yourself 
 so  hopefully  you  enjoyed  this  video  and
[43:48] i  really  really  hope  you  got  some  value 
 you've  learned  a  lot  from  this  i 
 i  have  been  a  victim  of  the  the  shitty
[43:54] diet  that  everyone  is  recommending  the 
 doctors  are  recommended  that 
 everyone  who's  unhealthy  has  recommended
[44:00] me  an  unhealthy  diet  hopefully 
 i  am  somewhat  of  a  role  model  to  you  i'm 
 somewhat  i've  got  like  a  body  that  you
[44:06] kind  of  want  yourself  i've  got  the  the 
 performance  that  you  want  yourself 
 hopefully  you  can  look  up  to  that  and
[44:12] think  that  this  is  how  i  got  here 
 and  it's  nothing  special  i  am  not 
 genetically  like  this  because  a  year  ago
[44:18] i  was  not  like  this 
 so  that  means  that  whatever  i've 
 recently  implemented  has  caused  this
[44:23] to  be  true  and  that  is  what  everything 
 you've  learned  in  this  video  improving 
 your  diet  is  a  big  journey  it  is  quite
[44:28] difficult 
 there's  so  much  to  know  i  could  speak 
 for  another  two  hours  about  everything
[44:34] if  you  want  me  to  coach  you  on  a 
 one-to-one  basis  i  will  teach  you  so 
 much  more  and 
 we'll  walk  you  through  the  diet  plan
[44:40] we'll  do  it  in  a  way  that's  sustainable 
 i  will 
 not  get  you  fast  results  you  will  not
[44:45] get  fast  results  with  me 
 if  you  want  fast  results  i  cannot 
 promise  that  i  could  get  you  a  little
[44:50] bit  faster  than  if  you  did  it  yourself 
 the  big  benefit  of  working  with  me  is 
 that  i  will  do  it  in  a  sustainable  way
[44:55] for  you 
 i've  got  one  student  right  now  speaking 
 to  him  yesterday  and  i  said  that  the  one 
 part  of  the  diet's  goal  you  know  the
[45:01] weight  loss  goal  that  everyone  sets 
 that  everyone  forgets  about  the  one  part 
 that  we  just  forget  to  think  about
[45:06] is  that  we  want  to  lose  x  amount  of 
 weight 
 and  keep  it  off  when  you  want  fast
[45:12] results  and  you  try  and  do  loads  of 
 cardio  and  you  try  and  starve  yourself 
 and 
 do  whatever  the  messed  up  you  do  to
[45:17] lose  weight  we're  forgetting  that  we 
 want  to  lose  that  weight  and  then 
 not  have  the  weight  come  back  and  most
[45:22] people  just  never  think  about  that 
 when  you  work  with  me  we're  gonna  do  in 
 a  sustainable  way  that  will  take  a
[45:27] little  bit  longer  than  if  we  did  it  in 
 the  most  fast  brutal  way 
 but  the  hope  is  that  once  you  get  to
[45:32] that  goal  weight  the 
 goal  health  that  you  want  from  the  diet 
 you're  going  to  stay  there  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  because
[45:38] i'm  not  just  going  to  help  you  with 
 weight  loss  i'm  going  to  reframe  imagine 
 what  this  this  video  is  probably  going
[45:43] to  be  close  to  an  hour 
 imagine  this  every  week  on  a  one-to-one 
 basis  i  hope  that  that's  got
[45:49] a  huge  amount  of  value  because  i  am 
 going  to  reframe  everything  you  think 
 about 
 in  terms  of  diet  and  lifestyle  and
[45:55] everything  i 
 want  to  completely  change  your  future  i 
 don't  just  want  to  put  you  on  a  shitty
[46:00] uh  check  your  calories  mate  and  just  eat 
 two  thousand  calories  a  day 
 it's  too  basic  the  moment  you  stop
[46:06] tracking  your  calories  the  moment  you 
 stop  eating  at  the  calorie  deficit 
 you're  gonna  go  back  to  the  foods  that 
 cause  you  to  gain  that  weight  anyway  i'm
[46:11] gonna  come  in  every  single  week  we're 
 going  to  speak  and  slowly  and  surely  i'm 
 going  to  re-change  how  your  brain  is
[46:16] structured  so  that  you  just  don't 
 eat  the  same  food  now  usually  at  the  end 
 of  these  videos  it's  nice  to  link  one  of
[46:22] my  videos  so  that  you  know  i  get  more 
 views  and  watch  time  but 
 hopefully  you  understand  how  important 
 this  video  that  i'm  going  to  tell  you  to
[46:28] watch  is  because  i'm  literally  losing 
 you  know  potential  watch  time  to 
 recommend  someone  else's  video
[46:33] there  is  one  video  which  is  not  optional 
 it  is  required  and  i  know  it  might  seem 
 a  little  bit  boring  because  it's  like  an
[46:38] hour  or  two  hours  long  and  it's  kind  of 
 like  just  a  professor  talking  it  is  an 
 absolute  requirement  you  must
[46:44] watch  this  video  it's  called  fat  chance 
 it'll  be  linked  in  the  description  i 
 have  to  say  it  again  you
[46:49] have  to  watch  this  video  to  the  end  it's 
 a  long  video  so  you  can  watch  it  over  a 
 few  days
[46:54] but  seriously  i  have  to  say  this  again 
 if  it  is  not  optional 
 it  is  literally  required  you  must  watch
[46:59] it  click  on  the  link  right  now  and  watch 
 it  all  the  way  to  the  end 
 it  will  change  your  life  not  only  will
[47:04] it  change  your  life  it  would  probably 
 save  your  life  and  what  you  learned  from 
 it  i  hope  that  you  could  then  pass  it  on
[47:11] to  other  people  that  you  care  about  that 
 you  love 
 so  that  it  could  save  their  life  too 
 hope  you  appreciate  this  video
[47:16] i've  been  talking  for  a  while  i've  lost 
 my  voice  my  throat  hurts  so 
 i  really  hope  that  you  got  a  lot  of 
 value  from  this  i  had  fun  making  it
[47:23] please  leave  a  like  and  then  hopefully 
 the  the  youtube  gods  will 
 show  this  video  to  loads  of  people
[47:28] please  leave  a  comment  and  then  you  know 
 the  youtube  algorithm  will  like 
 the  the  engagement  the  viewer  engagement
[47:33] will  increase  and  maybe  i'll  get 
 monetized  soon  or  something  alright  take
[47:39] care
"
NKL5PRaJFKQ,"[00:00] I  didn't  hit  puberty  till  I  was  like  16 
 17  years  old  like  I  was  literally  five
[00:07] foot  four  till  I  was  17  years  old 
 and  the  the  guys  that  I  grew  up  with
[00:13] like  the  video  Gamers  I  started  to  see 
 them  one  by  one  in  our  teenage  years  14
[00:18] 15  16. 
 start  attracting  girls  and  getting  into 
 relationships  and  the  concept  of  that
[00:24] like  when  I  was  in  high  school  the 
 feeling  of  that  just  made  me  feel 
 awkward  and  I  couldn't  tell  why
[00:30] and  it  it  was  because  I  had  this  belief 
 that  like  I  wasn't  involved  I  wasn't
[00:35] invited  to  the  dating  scene  like  it  just 
 felt  awkward  to  me  I  come  from  a  brown 
 Muslim  family  and  so  that  there  was
[00:42] always  like 
 you  know  a  weird  feeling  with  that  can  I 
 even  get  a  girlfriend  one  time  I  asked 
 my  mom  like  I  literally  said  to  her  like
[00:47] I  want  to  get  a  girlfriend  and  she 
 looked  at  me  weird  and  she's  like  no  you 
 finish  your  studies  first  lit  that's  the
[00:52] truth 
 and  another  time  I  remember  most  of  it 
 like  13  14  years  old  no  problem  yeah  14
[00:58] years  old  and  my  best  friend  was  around 
 my  house  we  were  literally  downstairs 
 and  he  had  been  dating  recently  he  was
[01:04] speaking  about  some  girl  and  he  kind  of 
 like  went  quiet 
 and  he  he  like  almost  in  like  a  shy  way
[01:09] he  asked  me  something  that  he  thought 
 was  really  embarrassing  and  but  he 
 wasn't  doing  it  to  you  know  feel  bad
[01:14] about  me  he  was  just  kind  of  like  asking 
 me  as  a  friend  he  went  like  don't  you 
 want  a  girlfriend  like  don't  you  want  to
[01:20] experience  this  and  I  just  I  literally 
 just  got  like  almost  shocked  like  just 
 like  just  stuck  I  didn't  know  what  to
[01:26] say 
 I  felt  totally  left  out
[01:31] you  know  people  in  my  school 
 a  lot  like  some  people  were  having  sex 
 at  age  13  and  14  and  I  don't  think
[01:37] that's  right 
 quite  a  lot  of  the  people  I  grew  up with 
 at  age  15  and  16  were  drinking  alcohol
[01:44] going  to  parties  and  literally  having 
 sex  like  in  those  parties  like  girls 
 from  from  this  class  were  going  to  this
[01:50] party  with  a  bunch  of  guys  and  like  they 
 were  drinking  and  you  know  like  being 
 flirtatious  and  stuff  and  then  literally
[01:55] going  to  the  toilet  stuff  [ __ ] 
 I  didn't  actually  realize  that  people
[02:00] were  having  sex  till  I  was  about  just 
 under  18  years  old  I  genuinely  didn't 
 think  anyone  else  was
[02:07] I  felt  like  I  was  missing  out  on  this 
 and  more  than  that  it's  like  I  did  have
[02:12] this  COPE  in  my  mind  which  you  might  do 
 which  was 
 what  if  in  some  ways  it  could  be
[02:17] beneficial  to  experience  this 
 because  if  I  keep  waiting  like  my  mom
[02:24] says  if  I  keep  waiting  to  pass  my 
 studies 
 keep  waiting  to  develop  myself
[02:30] I  won't  have  like  any  experience  with 
 women 
 and  so
[02:35] when  it  comes  to  needing  that  experience 
 maybe  with  the  the  other  girl  I 
 eventually  really  want  to  get  then  I'll
[02:41] struggle  with  her  these  were  the 
 thoughts  I  was  getting  when  I  was  17 
 years  old
[02:46] and  then  eventually  things  did  change 
 I'm  18  years  old  I'm  about  to  go  to 
 university  I've  been  going  to  the  gym
[02:52] I'm  hyping  up  I'm  actually  looking  kind 
 of  good  I'm  looking  confident  I'm 
 literally  hopping  on  Tinder  now  I'm
[02:57] getting  some  matches  on  Tinder  finally 
 because  I  upload  the  shirtless  picture 
 now  is  going  to  be  the  time  that  I'm 
 gonna  get  some  practice  with  women  I'm
[03:03] gonna  get  some  experience  with  women 
 this  is  going  to  be  really  productive 
 this  is  going  to  be  really  good  for  me
[03:11] I  went  to  University  and  it  just  so 
 happened  that  I  ended  up  getting  into  my 
 first  ever  real  relationship  with  a  girl
[03:17] that  I  truly  loved  things  didn't  work 
 out  with  her  and  I  explained  the  full 
 story  with  her  in  the  previous  video
[03:23] that  I  just  did  on  this  channel 
 did  the  breakup  with  her  which  which  was 
 totally  like  heartbreaking  and
[03:30] depressing 
 after  about  a  month  of  spending 
 literally  24  7  in  my  student  Hall's  room
[03:37] and  just  playing  Minecraft  and  RuneScape 
 after  about  a  month  of  feeling  just
[03:43] sorry  for  myself 
 I  started  to  be  more  social  make  more 
 friends  go  out  to  mob  parties  and
[03:49] nightclubs  and  actually  for  the  first 
 time  ever  start  hooking  up  with  girls 
 and  getting  the  experience  with  girls
[03:54] that  I  wanted  for  so  long  and  that  you 
 probably  want  to 
 this  isn't  like  another  like  red  pill
[03:59] alpha  male  video  where  the  guy's  gonna 
 say  like  yeah  yeah  I  I  get  with  loads  of 
 supermodels  man  I'm  so  amazing  like  the
[04:05] girls  I  was  like  I  slept  with  a  lot  of 
 girls  during  this  time  and  I  don't  say 
 that  to  both  or  anything  I'm  just
[04:10] telling  you  the  truth  and  the  girls  that 
 I  was  sleeping  with  were  absolutely  not 
 like  high  quality  of  course  not  they 
 weren't  like  very  beautiful  girls
[04:18] naturally  when  you  want  to  practice  with 
 women
[04:23] the  reason  why  we're  saying  practice  the 
 reason  why  you  may  have  thought  this  I 
 need  to  practice  I  need  to  get 
 experience  the  reason  why  is  okay  get
[04:28] experience  for  what 
 so  that  you  can  get  more  girls  okay  for
[04:33] what  what's  the  experience  for 
 oh  for  the  woman  that  I  eventually  have
[04:38] children  with  right  so  the  experience  or 
 the  practice  that  we  want  right  now  is 
 for  us  to  be  good  enough  to  get  or  even
[04:44] to  attract  or  whatever  to 
 for  the  the  future  wife  who  we're  gonna 
 have  children  with
[04:50] I  want  to  break  down  this  line  of 
 thinking  with  you  because  three  guys 
 literally  asked  me  this  question 
 yesterday  on  a  group  call  and  one  by  one
[04:56] when  they  asked  that  it  was  almost  like 
 a  funny  joke  between  the  guys  who  had 
 been  on  the  group  call  for  a  while 
 because  we  were  almost  laughing  of  how
[05:01] many  guys  we're  asking  this  exact  same 
 question 
 and  chances  are  if  you're  watching  this
[05:06] and  this  titles  intrude  you  you're  a 
 younger  man  you've  been  watching  my 
 videos  takes  videos  emans  videos  maybe
[05:12] first  month's  videos  and  first  man  it's 
 a  friend  of  mine  who's  been  pushing  this 
 message  recently  that  guys  should  not
[05:18] actually  pursue  building  getting 
 experience  with  girls  guys  should  not 
 pursue  like  girls  or  dating  at  all  when
[05:23] they're  young  and  instead  Focus 
 relentlessly  on  improving  yourself  and 
 growing  and  his  idea  has  been  criticized
[05:29] by  many  people  who  think  they  should 
 live  more  of  a  balanced  lifestyle  and 
 who  think  that  you  should  integrate 
 women  into  your  life  as  you  grow  up  and
[05:35] the  thing  is 
 I  didn't  do  what  first  man  said
[05:43] I  got  the  experience  I  got  the  practice 
 that  you  might  have  wanted
[05:48] and  I'm  here  to  tell  you  today  that  it 
 it  will  be  will  not  might  it  will  be  the
[05:53] biggest  mistake  one  of  the  biggest 
 mistakes  you  make  in  your  life 
 no  one  has  ever  pointed  these  arguments
[05:59] out  not  even  first  man  has  has  pointed  a 
 few  of  the  arguments  that  I'm  going  to 
 say  to  you  and  I  think  you're  gonna  find
[06:04] this  like  deeply  deeply  interesting 
 so  ask  you  just  just  to  listen  to  some
[06:09] of  the  points  I've  got  with  an  open  mind 
 and  just  to  kind  of  know  that  like
[06:14] I'm  on  the  other  side  of  this  I'm  not 
 some  some  strict  parents  or  Imam  or  past
[06:19] their  respect  to  them  but  I'm  not  like 
 someone  who  has  no  experience  of  this 
 just  kind  of  telling  you  that  all  this
[06:24] stuff's  bad  I  had  the  same  mindset  as 
 you  of  wanting  to  get  experience  with 
 girls  and  I  did  it
[06:31] and  so  I'm  on  this  like  where  you  want 
 to  be  technically  right
[06:36] and  I  don't  think  it's  a  good  idea  for 
 you  to  do  this  now  someone  might  say  to 
 this  like  Albert  Hamza  you  did  it  so
[06:41] like  how  can  you  tell  us  not  to  but  I 
 see  this  comment  quite  a  lot  when  I  talk 
 about  like  oh  yeah  like  I  I  was  a
[06:46] degenerate  I  slept  around  with  girls  and 
 stuff  so  you  shouldn't  and  it's  always 
 like  a  guy  who  gets  a  little  bit
[06:51] triggered  by  that  and  says  like  oh  but 
 you  got  to  so  how  can  you  tell  us  not  to 
 that's  not  fair  but 
 hopefully  you  understand  like  this  is
[06:57] the  nature  of  like  passing  our  wisdom 
 onto  each  other  it's  like  I  have  to  make 
 the  mistake  to  eventually  tell  you
[07:06] the  first  reason  why  you  don't  need 
 experience  with  women 
 and  what  pretty  much  everyone  who  gives
[07:12] this  advice  online  of  first  man  is  is 
 this  YouTuber  who  says  this  there's  a 
 bunch  more  roll  automatic  you  know  all
[07:17] these  guys  who  kind  of  say  that  okay 
 build  yourself  up  as  a  man  first  and 
 maybe  don't  think  about  girls  so  much
[07:22] when  you're  younger  and  the  first  and 
 biggest  reason  why  is  so  that  you  can 
 focus  on  your  own  growth  your  own 
 self-improvement  and  your  own  success
[07:29] this  is  something  that  you've  already 
 known  and  you've  already  thought  yeah 
 like  in  our  focus  more  without  a  girl
[07:34] but  maybe  you've  never  really 
 experienced  what  it's  like 
 totally
[07:39] one  being  deep  in  like  the  part  not  just 
 Party  Zone  but  like  you  know  with  with
[07:44] getting  girls  dating  and  literally 
 having  sex  with  girls  or  having  sex  with 
 multiple  girls  a  week
[07:50] but  two  also  maybe  you  haven't 
 experienced  the  other  side  of  like  total 
 monk  mode  where  you  actually  don't  want
[07:55] to  get  girls  so  there's  two  big 
 different  sides  and  I've  experienced 
 both  so  I'll  tell  you  right  now
[08:01] if  this  is  so  interesting  right  no  one 
 has  said  this  before  but  like  I  promise
[08:06] you  this  is  the  case  I  am  very  like 
 observant  of  my  brain  and  I'm  very  much 
 into  self-improvement  and  I'm  very  like
[08:11] aware  of  things  right  you  might  have 
 known  like  I'm  quite  like  aware  of 
 myself
[08:16] I  do  have  a  lot  of  journaling  and 
 meditation  so  this  is  going  to  be  really 
 interesting  I  promise  you  right  now
[08:22] let's  say  You're  not  meeting  girls 
 you're  not  meeting  anyone  dating  anyone 
 let's  say  you're  not  having  sex  with  any
[08:28] girls  but  let's  just  say  you  are  texting 
 texting  just  one  girl  that  you  like
[08:33] you're  texting  just  one  girl  you're  not 
 even  going  on  phone  calls  whether  you're 
 not  even  meeting  her  in  person  you're
[08:39] just  texting  one  girl  that  you  like  I 
 promise  you  that  will  sap  about  40  of
[08:46] your  brain  power 
 literally  just  opening  up  like  the  door
[08:51] of  dating  of  like  women  a  tiny  Creek 
 it's  like  it  has  this  huge  impact  on  how
[08:58] much  like  brain  power  you  lose  which  you 
 could  put  into  growing  yourself  a  huge 
 like  a  huge  level
[09:04] it's  absolutely  crazy  that  even  a  small 
 amount  of  like  being  open  to  dating  a 
 small  amount  of  for  example  just  looking
[09:10] at  girls  on  Instagram  maybe  just  maybe 
 just  having  a  Tinder  account  and  your 
 own  online  dating  accounts  and  saying  oh
[09:15] no  but  this  is  like  an  efficient  way  to 
 date  you  know  I'd  have  to  go  on  a  date 
 and  I  can  just  quickly  write  type  and 
 stuff  I  promise  you  you're  losing  so
[09:20] much  of  your  brain  power  because  you  if 
 you  want  to  know  like  how  to  get 
 successful  you  want  me  to  tell  you 
 something  right  now  that  this  piece  of
[09:26] advice  that  I  don't  hear  often  the  route 
 to  success  is  to  pick  one  maybe  two  big
[09:31] goals  and  to  dedicate  as  many  thoughts 
 as  possible  to  that  goal  when  you're
[09:36] having  a  [ __ ]  you  should  be  thinking 
 about  your  goals  when  you're  having  a 
 shower  you  should  be  thinking  about  your
[09:41] goals  when  you're  going  to  bed  you 
 should  be  thinking  about  your  goals  if 
 you  want  to  become  a  successful  man  this 
 is  what  it  takes  and  when  you  say  that
[09:48] oh  but  it's  just  half  an  hour  a  day  for 
 me  to  check  Tinder  or  you  know  just 
 three  hours  a  week  for  it  for  for  dates
[09:53] it's  not  about  the  time  where  we 
 physically  do  the  thing  it's  it's  that
[09:58] it  saps  thousands  of  thoughts  a  week 
 away  and  this  is  like  this  is  undeniable
[10:04] this  is  non-negotiable  we  as  men  know 
 this 
 and  if  you  have  an  experienced  the  total
[10:09] Bliss  of  like  full  on  declaring  to 
 yourself  like  I  am  in  a  period  just  the 
 period  not  for  life  just  a  period  where
[10:16] I'm  not  even  open  to  girls 
 and  you  close  that  door  fully
[10:21] you  will  be  so  surprised  of  how  much  of 
 your  brain  power  comes  back  it  will  not 
 be  like  what  you  thought  was  the
[10:28] equivalent  of  how  much  you  were  putting 
 into  dating  it  will  not  be  that  it's 
 like  this  weird  like  outsized  return
[10:33] back  to  your  brain  power  I  know  this  is 
 like  a  weird  thing  to  say
[10:39] the  benefit  of  this  is  that  you  will 
 excel  and  you  will  push  forward  in  your
[10:45] goals  your  business  your  developments 
 even  improving  your  smv  your  sexual 
 market  value  you're  literally  like  you 
 know  be  able  to  focus  more  on  becoming
[10:52] more  attractive  later  it's  the  delayed 
 gratification  it's  setting  yourself 
 future  self  up  and  this  is  like  the
[10:57] fundamental  principles  of 
 self-improvement  this  is  the  whole  point 
 of  self-improvement  we  we  delay  a  bigger
[11:02] reward  for  our  future  selves  instead  of 
 our  current  selves  we  take  the  second 
 marshmallow  15  minutes  from  now  rather
[11:08] than  just  indulging  in  the  first  one  we 
 don't  cash  out  our  current  life  in  smv 
 right  now  for  the  girls  that  we  can  get
[11:14] right  now  and  instead  we  just 
 relentlessly  focus  on  the  better  girls 
 that  we  could  get  in  the  future  now  you
[11:20] might  say  okay  sweet  you  could  you  know 
 gain  some  attractiveness  and  stuff  but 
 you'd  have  no  experience  with  girls  and
[11:25] so  when  you  do  finally  attract  some 
 girls  you  know  okay  maybe  you've  offer 
 six  pack  a  year  from  now  but  what  if
[11:30] you're  like  really  awkward  with  girls 
 what  if  you're  not  like  good  with  them 
 what  if  you  don't  know  how  to  navigate 
 dating  and  sleeping  with  girls  when
[11:36] you're  eventually  improve  yourself  and 
 maybe  you  meet  like  a  really  good  well 
 but  you've  never  had  practice  before
[11:43] this  is  where  it  gets  very  interesting 
 because  I  have  not  seen  this  argument 
 online  but  I'm  going  to  tell  you  right 
 now
[11:49] practicing  and  getting  experience  with 
 girls
[11:54] fundamentally  means  that  those  skills 
 are  going  to  be  off  lower  quality
[11:59] you  can  agree  with  that  right  practice 
 saying  that  we  want  to  just  practice 
 with  some  girls  right  now
[12:04] literally  means  that  these  girls  are 
 going  to  be  lower  quality  and  easier  to 
 get  than  our  actual  future  wife  right  if
[12:10] you  could  meet  the  10  out  of  10  like 
 Dream  Woman  for  you  right  no  girl's 
 perfect  but  if  you  can  meet  literally 
 like  imagine  like  a  full-on  stunning  10
[12:16] out  of  10  and  she  likes  you  too  right 
 you  will  just  get  with  her  and  that 
 would  probably  be  your  future  wife  right
[12:21] if  everything  else  worked  out  we  can't 
 get  her  right  now 
 but  we  can  get  some  random  girl  on
[12:26] Tinder  who  we  know  is  not  our  future 
 wife  but  we  can  get  some  practice
[12:32] so  we  have  to  like  confirm  this  the 
 practice  and  the  experience  that  we  can
[12:37] get  right  now  is  specifically  with  lower 
 quality  and  unfortunately
[12:43] degenerates  women  it's  with  women  that 
 we're  going  to  meet  in  easier  places
[12:48] like  online  dates  in  Tinder  and 
 nightclubs  and  you  know  some  other 
 places  find  some  gym  and  stuff  but  when
[12:54] you  get  into  this  thing  of  like  okay  I 
 need  some  experience  most  likely  I'll  go 
 through  online  dating  and  you'll
[12:59] automatically  meet  lower  quality  women 
 who  are  [ __ ]  a  bunch  of  guys  using  the
[13:04] same  like  app  just  before  you 
 and  then
[13:11] this  is  where  it  gets  so  interesting 
 where  my  heart  breaks  knowing  that  I've
[13:16] done  this  and  where  I  want  to  like  stop 
 you  from  feeling  the  pain  that  I  have 
 you  learn
[13:22] and  you  practice  the  wrong  things 
 you  see  two  get  experience  with  the
[13:29] girls  who  are  quite  easy  to  get  the 
 girls  that  you  can  get  right  now  when 
 you're  quite  lower  quality  to  get
[13:35] experience  with  these  girls  on  Tinder  to 
 get  experience  with  these  random  girls 
 that  you  see  around  you  who  aren't  wife
[13:40] material  because  again  if  they  were 
 white  material  then  you  wouldn't 
 consider  it  as  experience  you're  just 
 think  oh  [ __ ]  I  I  met  like  an  awesome
[13:45] girl  already  I  might  seriously  get  in  a 
 relationship  with  her  so  these  low 
 quality  women  most  likely  the  general
[13:50] women  and  the  way  to  like  actually  be 
 good  with  these  girls  if  you've  never 
 heard  this  before  this  is  like  the
[13:55] greatest  tip  the  way  to  get  experience 
 with  these  girls  and  to  to  do  well  with 
 these  girls
[14:01] is  to  act  in  a  in  quite  a  like  in  a  way 
 for  you  in  a  way  that  you  wouldn't  act
[14:07] your  future  wife  you  see  to  attract  like 
 a  girl  on  Tinder  you  need  to  play  this 
 game  that  you  don't  care  about  how  you
[14:12] need  to  play  this  game  that  you  don't 
 give  a  [ __ ]  you  need  to  play  this  game 
 like  you're  some  like  Stone  Cold  Chad 
 this  like  alpha  male  personality  where
[14:18] you  don't  even  like  her 
 you're  not  going  to  tell  her  how  you 
 actually  feel  you're  not  going  to  tell
[14:23] her  about  your  goals  because  these  kinds 
 of  girls  like  you  think  oh  no  I  might  do 
 actually  but  bro  you  can  try  your
[14:29] authentic  way  with  these  dating  apps  and 
 stuff  but  eventually  you'll  realize  if 
 you  want  to  get  good  at  dating  apps  and
[14:34] Nightclub  game  and  a  night  game  and 
 everything  to  get  girls  right  now  and 
 you  want  to  hook  up  with  girls  right  now 
 bro  I  learned  this  stuff  the  way  to
[14:40] attract  those  kinds  of  girls  is  to  dumb 
 yourself  down  and  also  to  date  in  a  way
[14:45] that's  quite  toxic  to  date  in  a  way 
 where  you  act  like  you  don't  even  like 
 or  respect  her  today  in  a  way  where  you
[14:50] and  her  aunt  don't  even  feel  like  a  team
[14:55] to  make  these  kinds  of  women  more 
 attracted  to  you 
 you  literally  [ __ ]  them  and  then
[15:01] disappear  and  they'll  come  after  you 
 to  make  these  kinds  of  women  more
[15:06] attracted  to  you  you  literally  don't 
 reply  to  their  messages
[15:12] do  you  see  the  problem  that  we're 
 getting  at  here 
 the  experience  and  the  practice  that  we
[15:17] can  get  right  now  with  the  girls  that  we 
 can  get  right  now  that's  gonna  give  us 
 the  experience  of  dating  in  the  wrong
[15:25] way 
 because  when  you  try  to  eventually  use 
 what  you've  just  learned  on  your  future
[15:30] wife 
 she's  not  going  to  be  attracted  to  you
[15:35] so  what  is  the  practice  for  if  you're 
 not  going  to 
 actually  improve  the  level  that  you
[15:41] needed  to  begin  with  the  skill  that  you 
 needed  to  begin  with 
 let's  say  our  ultimate  ideal  goal  is
[15:48] beautiful  really  high  quality  wife 
 really  good  like  characteristics  traits 
 foundations  family  everything  right
[15:54] really  beautiful  girl  really  like  highly 
 like  sexual  and  everything  right  and 
 also  have  like  children  with  her  and
[15:59] everything  that's  like  the  ultimate  goal 
 right 
 that's  the  skill  we  can  say  this  is  like
[16:04] a  basketball  competition  okay  we  need  we 
 need  to  be  good  at  basketball  to  get
[16:09] this  right 
 what  we're  doing  right  now  by  saying  we 
 need  to  practice
[16:14] we're  practicing  football 
 we're  practicing  football  with  the  girls
[16:20] that  aren't  like  her  because  this 
 inherently  our  future  wife 
 we're  gonna  set  high  standards  with  men
[16:26] on  self-improvement  we're  ambitious  men 
 so  our  future  wife  she's  going  to  be 
 attracted  to  a  secure  warm
[16:33] guys  she's  gonna  be  attracted  to  a 
 secure  warm  loving  guy
[16:38] these  women  they're  attracted  to 
 avoidance  cold  guys
[16:45] I  will  say  that  again  these  women  that 
 you  can  get  right  now  you  will  get  more 
 girls  if  you  act  in  this  way  and  now  you
[16:51] might  get  excited  and  think  okay  I'll 
 just  act  in  that  way  and  I'll  get  some 
 girls  but  just  think  right  now  again  we
[16:56] are  ambitious  men  we  don't  just  think 
 one  step  in  the  future  you  want  to 
 become  successful  a  great  tip  is  okay
[17:01] think  50  000  steps  in  the  future 
 becoming  successful  is  as  simple  as
[17:07] literally  just  looking  further  into  the 
 future  than  all  of  the  mediocre  people 
 around  you  it's  literally  that  simple 
 it's  choosing  the  second  marshmallow  but
[17:13] you  have  to  wait  15  minutes  for  it  so 
 don't  just  think  okay  but  I  can  get  some 
 girls  right  now  so  I'll  just  do  that  but
[17:18] just  think  let's  think  about  the 
 consequences  of  our  actions  we  practice 
 with  these  girls  we  practice  being  cold 
 we  practice  not  replying  to  text  we
[17:24] practice 
 the  way  that  you  know  like  how  we  speak 
 to  them  and  how  we  make  them  feel  and  we
[17:29] and  you  realize  that  these  toxic  traits 
 are  very  good  at  attracting  a  certain
[17:34] kind  of  women  and  this  certain  kind  of 
 women  are  the  ones  that  dominate  social 
 media  Instagram  that  dominates  online
[17:39] dating  and  everything  and  so  we've  all 
 this  time  been  practicing  playing 
 football 
 hoping  that  it's  gonna  help  us
[17:45] eventually  for  the  basketball 
 competition  where  we  will  meet  our 
 future  wife
[17:50] you're  gonna  go  to  you're  going  to  go  to 
 this  competition  eventually  and  start 
 [ __ ]  dribbling  the  ball  kicking
[17:55] around  the  ball  and  stuff  and  everyone's 
 gonna  think  you're  stupid  now  this 
 sounds  like  a  silly  analogy  I'm  telling
[18:00] you  from  experience  I'm  from  pain 
 this  is  exactly  what  will  happen
[18:06] I  practiced  I  got  the  experience  that  I 
 thought  that  I  needed  and  I  got  good
[18:11] very  good  surprise  honestly  surprisingly 
 good 
 at  attracting  like  the  common  girl  that
[18:17] you  can  find  on  dating  apps  and  I  again 
 I'm  not  saying  this  to  both  because  this 
 is  not  something  boastful  this  is  like
[18:23] getting  these  girls  is  literally  like 
 level  one  okay  congratulations  you  can 
 literally  get  some  girl  that  has  already
[18:28] been  [ __ ]  this  week  and  you  can  [ __ ] 
 it  too  it's  like  this  is  level  one  bro 
 if  you  think  I'm  boasting  right  now
[18:34] this  is  level  one 
 level  10  is  like  attracting  the  [ __ ]
[18:39] beautiful  like  high  high  high  high 
 quality  and  she  wants  to  be  your  wife
[18:44] and  she  wants  to  give  you  children  and 
 she  is  so  like  securely  loving  and  warm 
 that  she  feels  like  a  wind  on  your  back
[18:50] she's  pushing  you  you're  literally 
 making  more  progress  to  your  goals  that 
 when  you  meet  her  the  kind  of  woman  that
[18:56] when  you  have  some  kind  of  setback  you 
 actually  can  tell  her  about  it  and  she 
 just  looks  at  you  with  almost  like  like
[19:02] a  smug  look  on  her  face  saying  like  well 
 I  know  you  can  do  it
[19:07] what  [ __ ]  girl  you  meet  from  social 
 media  or  from  online  dating  is  gonna  say 
 that  to  you  bro  what  [ __ ]  girl  you're
[19:12] gonna  meet  from  like  from  Tinder  and 
 you're  gonna  tell  her  about  your  goals 
 but  you  can  try  that  stuff  you  can  try
[19:17] telling  some  random  girl  about  your 
 goals  and  she  might  be  into  you  bro  I'm 
 telling  you  right  now  it's  not  right
[19:22] so  I  got  good  at  this  like  cold-hearted 
 degenerate  pickup  Game  Party  game
[19:28] nightclubs  and  stuff  right  I  got  good 
 right  I  got  the  experience  that  I  always 
 wanted  maybe  the  experience  that  you
[19:34] wanted 
 do  you  think  that  experience  now 
 translates  into  finding  a  good  woman
[19:44] if  the  test  is  to  attract 
 a  low  quality  woman  a  hoe
[19:50] who's  got  Daddy  oh  bro  I'm  sick  of  that 
 oh  oh  a  star  if  the  test  is  to  attract  a
[19:56] secure  woman 
 a  good  woman 
 I'm  telling  you  right  now
[20:03] I'm  being  honest  with  you  I  had  a  decent 
 amount  of  experience  I'm  telling  you 
 right  now  if  a  woman  of  wife  quality
[20:10] sees  me  and  interacts  with  me  she  would 
 not  be  attracted  to  me 
 because  I  have  built  like  the
[20:16] neuroplasticity  in  my  brain  I  have  built 
 like  the  like  the  the
[20:21] muscle  memory  of  acting  like  a  fuckboy 
 in  dating
[20:27] it  is  natural  for  me  to  act  in  a  way 
 that  attracts  a  certain  kind  of  woman
[20:32] but  would  fully  like  unattract  another 
 kind  of  woman  and  this  is  the  issue  of 
 going  down  like  the  degenerate  path  it
[20:39] it's  common  sense  when  someone  says  it 
 to  you  like  this  but  we  need  to  kind  of 
 declare  this  when  you  go  down  the
[20:44] degenerate  path 
 you  sacrifice  you  you  undermine
[20:49] the  future  most  important  relationship 
 of  your  life  you  don't  improve  it
[20:54] you  will  not  get  like  a  better  wife 
 by  Sleeping  with  a  bunch  of  like  low
[21:00] quality  girls
[21:06] and  this  isn't  even  bringing  out  a  huge 
 extra  issue
[21:11] maybe  some  people  can  be  different  to 
 this  but  when  you  practice  with  girls 
 and  you  practice  dating  and  eventually
[21:17] you  go  on  to  like  you  know  sleep  with 
 some  girls  that  you  know  aren't  your 
 wife  right  you  know  this  one  it  eats  you 
 up  in  life  alive  because  you  know  that
[21:23] okay  you're  kind  of  messing  around  but 
 you're  like  yeah  whatever  like  you  know 
 religions  like  false  anyway  I  don't 
 really  believe  in  God  anymore  or  I  don't
[21:29] even  want  to  get  married  like  people  say 
 not  to  get  married  anyway 
 I  totally  understand  that  by  the  way I
[21:35] totally  understand  like  I  we  wouldn't 
 marry  99.99  of  women  of  course  not  so
[21:40] it's  like  I  totally  understand  why  we 
 could  just  generalize  that  and  say  yeah 
 don't  get  married  the  idea  is  here  I
[21:45] don't  get  married  to  99  of  women 
 but  here  is  the  thing
[21:50] when  you  are  on  this  path  of  of 
 practicing  and  getting  experience  and 
 you're  doing  it  with  women  that  you  know
[21:55] aren't  your  future  wife  the  thing  is 
 there  will  be  a  time  when  you  can't 
 avoid  this  you  will  end  up  getting
[22:01] really  like  deep  feelings  for  some  of 
 these  girls  one  of  these  girls
[22:07] you  will  literally  fall  in  love  with  a 
 girl 
 who  was  supposed  to  be  practice
[22:14] this  is  one  of  the  most  painful 
 experiences  that  I've  ever  felt
[22:20] you  will  form 
 a  bond  that  is  so  primal
[22:26] a  bond  an  attachment  that  literally 
 regulates  your  nervous  system  like  these
[22:31] weird  things  inside  of  us  you've  you 
 release  these  these  dopamines  this 
 oxytocin  you  have  these  memories
[22:37] together 
 with  a  girl  that  you  genuinely  know 
 you're  not  actually  gonna  stay  with  you
[22:43] know  like  you  fall  in  love  with  a  girl 
 that  you  know  eventually  you're  gonna
[22:48] break  up  with 
 now  you  might  say  oh  but  I  wouldn't  fall 
 in  love  with  these  hoes  you  might  say
[22:53] that 
 but  the  truth  is  when  you're  having  sex 
 with  someone  consistently  and  you're
[22:58] having  like  good  times  and  stuff  it's 
 almost  like  it's  bound  to  happen  now
[23:03] with  certain  girls  it  just  won't  but  if 
 you  do  actually  practice  like  a  lot  it
[23:08] will  happen  maybe  one  in  ten  for  example 
 it  will  happen  where  you  like  you  end  up 
 bonding  and  actually  having  like  you 
 know  the  personality  fits  and  everything
[23:15] but  you  just  will  never  be  able  to  take 
 her  seriously  because  of  how  you  met  her 
 you  met  her  through  again  these  dating
[23:20] apps  and  everything  and  you  know  that 
 she  was  she  was  [ __ ]  a  guy  literally 
 the  day  before  you  so  you  know  like
[23:26] there's  no  coping  you  know  that  she's 
 not  your  future  wife  you  know  it 
 and  yet  you've  got  this  huge  attachment
[23:33] to  her  that  you  don't  want  to  get  rid  of 
 you've  leveled  up  that  you've  gotten  a 
 bit  more  seriously
[23:45] and  that's  not  what  you  wanted  you  don't 
 want  this  attachment  with  this  girl 
 let's  be  honest  right  now  now  okay  if
[23:50] you  want  to  practice  you  want  to 
 practice  so  why  don't  you  fall  in  love 
 with  a  hoe 
 so  it  was  never  about  practice  was  it  we
[23:55] did  that's  not  the  situation  you  wanted 
 to  be  and  you  know  that  right  you're  a 
 small  enough  guy  you  do  not  want  to  be
[24:00] in  a  situation  where  you're  genuinely  in 
 love  with  a  girl  who  is  like  this  right
[24:05] and  this  is  no  disrespect  to  those  girls 
 or  anything  but  it's  just  one  one  thing 
 we  have  to  acknowledge  is  like  this  is
[24:10] your  responsibility  and  accountability 
 right  if  you're  in  love  with  the  whole 
 chances  are  you're  the  hoe  as  well  bro
[24:15] that  being  said 
 Maybe
[24:21] maybe  just  maybe  we  we  be  honest  with 
 ourselves  and  say  you  know  what
[24:26] seeking  practices  cope 
 saying  they  are  but  I  need  experience 
 with  women  maybe  that's  just  cope  maybe
[24:33] it's  just  cope  bro  maybe  it's  just  not 
 maybe  it's  not  experience  because  again 
 experience  with  something  means  that
[24:38] eventually  you're  gonna  use  that 
 experience  with  something  else  in  the 
 future  and  so  we've  just  acknowledged
[24:43] and  hopefully  you can  believe  this 
 experience  with  the  girls  that  you  can 
 get  right  now  will  not  help  you  with
[24:48] your  future  wife  and  you  might  think  oh 
 well  experience  with  these  girls  right 
 now  will  help  me  get  more  experience  so 
 I  can  get  more  of  these  girls  and  you'll
[24:54] just  literally  dig  deeper  in  the  in  the 
 the  depth  of  the  degeneracy  and  we  know
[24:59] that's  not  good  for  us  we  know  it  okay 
 you've  seen  all  those  like  rejected 
 generacy  videos  and  stuff  bro  it's  like
[25:04] I  know  that's  a  meme  and  stuff  but  it  is 
 so  true  that  going  down  this  pathway  of 
 degeneracy  of  like  casual  sex  and  stuff
[25:10] it's  not  good  for  you  you  know  this  and 
 you  don't  need  like  a  vice  you  don't 
 need  it
[25:15] because  why  the  idea  I'm  not  saying  is 
 that  like  you  know  I'll  just  be  a  monk
[25:20] forever  and  ever  have  sex  never  have 
 women  in  your  life  the  idea  is 
 wait  for  the  second  marshmallow
[25:27] because  the  better  you  can  navigate  your 
 dating  life 
 the  better  quality  your  future  wife  is
[25:33] gonna  be 
 the  single  most  important  decision 
 you'll  ever  make  is  of  what  woman  to 
 have  children  with  is  it's  just  a  fact
[25:40] and  so  if  you  mess  this  up 
 and  you  waste  a  bunch  of  your  your  brain
[25:45] power  your  ability  to  develop  yourself 
 and  to  grow  and  you  know  to  become 
 successful  and  build  wealth  the  things
[25:50] that  would  attract  a  really  high  quality 
 woman  as  well  as  you  know  building  the 
 character  that  comes  from  being  an 
 entrepreneur  and  all  these  things  right
[25:56] you  will  sacrifice  some  of  these  goals 
 by  being  open  to  dating  and  also
[26:01] eventually  falling  in  love  with  the 
 lower  quality  girls  that  you  know  and  is 
 not  your  future  wife
[26:06] and  maybe  that  the  concept  of  a  future 
 wife  is  so  weird  and  distant  for  you 
 that  it's  hard  to  think  about  it
[26:13] but  genuinely  if  you  build  yourself  up 
 and  just  kind  of  wait  and  just  keep 
 building  and  building  and  building 
 whilst  also  you're  still  building  like
[26:19] all  areas  of  life  you're  still  building 
 like  your  social  life  you've  got  friends 
 and  stuff  so  you're  not  like  awkwardly
[26:24] just  sat  inside  all  day  but  you're  still 
 like  imagine  you're  a  confident  guy  who 
 just  right  now  has  this  like  confidence
[26:29] of  like  nope  she's  not  my  future  wife 
 nope  she's  not  no  no  no  guys  I've  got 
 I've  just  got  really  high  standards
[26:34] imagine  that  bro  imagine  being  the  guy 
 who  can  say  nope  I've  just  got  really 
 high  standards  sorry  like  you  know  what
[26:39] his  friends  are  saying  like  oh  well  why 
 don't  you  ever  get  girls  bro  imagine 
 building  yourself  up  you've  got  a 
 six-pack  you  look  good  you're  actually
[26:44] handsome  you're  a  bit  older  now  and  all 
 of  the  random  girls  that  you  see  that 
 sometimes  hold  eye  contact  with  you  you
[26:50] just  think  to  yourself  nope  not  my 
 future  wife  I'm  waiting  for  the  second 
 marshmallow  because  I  know  that's  the 
 right  thing  to  do  I  know  it  is  I  know
[26:56] that  that's  the  right  thing  to  do 
 if  you  did  that 
 and  you  essentially  sacrifice  which
[27:02] isn't  a  sacrifice  because  you're  going 
 to  have  a  fun  time  doing  this  anyway 
 you're  like  building  your  business  and 
 developing  yourself  and  still  spending
[27:08] time  with  friends  and  stuff  right 
 essentially  just  specifically  not  being 
 a  degenerate  not  [ __ ]  like  random 
 girls  and  stuff  right
[27:14] eventually  bro  you're  gonna  meet  her 
 like  and  not  just  you  know  oh  the  one
[27:19] already  I  don't  believe  in  like  some 
 Disney  the  one  but  you're  gonna  meet 
 extremely  high  quality  women  who  are
[27:25] beautiful  have  got  a  great  personality 
 and  have  also  got  like  a  great 
 foundation  with  her  father  and  a  mother
[27:30] are  still  together  in  love  her  father's 
 masculine  her  mother's  feminine  this  her 
 parents  are  in  love  which  is  fantastic
[27:35] to  see 
 she's  got  a  really  good  personality 
 maybe  she  maybe  she's  never  even  been
[27:40] with  a  guy  before  and  so  you're  gonna  be 
 her  everything 
 and  then  because  you  you're  on
[27:46] self-improvement  because  you  you  look 
 sexy  because  you've  been  going  to  the 
 gym  and  everything  because  you're
[27:51] masculine  because  you've  been  watching 
 videos  like  this  because  you've  been 
 becoming  like  a  superior  man  and 
 learning  how  to  breathe  properly  and  to
[27:56] to  level  up  your  sex  life  and  stuff 
 right 
 you're  gonna  meet  this  awesome  woman
[28:01] who's  literally  gonna  be  literally 
 prettier  than  the  girls  you  could  get 
 right  now 
 and  the  sex  life  where  there's  going  to
[28:07] be  better 
 one  one  fear  I  had  for  a  long  time  was 
 like  oh  but  if  I  do  this  like  the  sex 
 life's  just  gonna  be  dead  with  like  you
[28:13] know  some  like 
 um  wife  quality  girl  you  know  it's  a 
 common  thing  about  our  husband  and  wife 
 get  together  and  the  sex  goes  down
[28:19] I  think  that's  only  with  chump  husbands 
 honestly  because  I'm  thinking  right  now 
 okay  you've  got  a  six-pack  you're  going
[28:24] to  the  gym  you're  like  leading  a  class 
 in  the  gym  or  in  Jiu  Jitsu  or  something 
 you're  a  successful  guy  confident  guy
[28:29] and  you  know  how  to  polarize  women  you 
 literally  imagine  like  for  the  next  10
[28:35] years  learning  how  to  actually  use  what 
 you  learn  in  this  book  learning  how  to 
 polarize  women 
 because  her  wanting  sex  with  you  is
[28:41] literally  just  as  simple  as  are  you 
 polarizing  her  and  most  husbands  are 
 Chumps  right  most  husbands  get  a  good
[28:46] wife  but  then  they  don't  know  how  to 
 polarize  and  So  eventually  they  don't 
 praise  her  and  stuff  and  then  she  feels 
 like  Baron  out  of  corn  they  stop  having
[28:52] sex  that's  not  gonna  happen  to  us 
 because  the  thing  is  we  have  the  the 
 brain  capacity  this  is  kind  of  like  an
[28:58] insult  to  our  fathers  but  bro  we're 
 smart  enough  that  if  we  weren't  having 
 sex  with  our  wife  we'd  do  something 
 which  is  just  so  [ __ ]  obvious  would
[29:04] Google  it  and  we'd  watch  it  on  YouTube 
 and  there'd  be  people  giving  us  good 
 advice  like  oh  yeah  keep  going  to  the 
 gym  do  this  do  this  make  her  feel  like
[29:10] you  know  praise  her  like  you  follow 
 advice  literally  as  long  as  you've  got 
 this  book  you're  gonna  have  a  lot  of  sex
[29:15] when  you're  married  probably  more  than 
 with  the  random  girls  right  now  and 
 better  bro  better  because  you  know  this
[29:22] woman  now  and  you  actually  love  us  you 
 can  open  up  your  heartfully  and  she  can 
 do  the  same  to  you
[29:28] so  there's  not  gonna  be  like  when  you 
 get  into  that  good  good  relationship 
 there's  not  going  to  be  a  sacrifice  like
[29:33] oh  man  but  like  you  know  she's  oh  but 
 she's  not  you  know  she's  not  going  to  be 
 good  at  giving  ahead
[29:38] you  will  train  her 
 let  me  let  me  let  me  ask  you  something 
 bro
[29:43] how  do  you  think  girls  get  good  ahead 
 all  the  guys  have  trained  her
[29:50] so  when  you  find  a  girl  who's  amazing  at 
 head  right  now  and  it's  so  good  oh  yeah 
 oh  yeah  guys  I'm  getting  experience
[29:56] another  guy  trained  her  for  that 
 but  when  it's  your  future  wife
[30:01] and  of  course  you  set  high  standards 
 most  likely  you  know  our  values  are
[30:07] different  but  most  likely  you'll 
 probably  want  her  to  be  quite  pure 
 sexually  right  you  probably  don't  want 
 her  to  have  had  too  many  experiences
[30:12] beforehand 
 you  will  train  her
[30:18] that's  the  the  best  of  all  cases 
 and  so  we  need  to  acknowledge  that
[30:23] practice  and  experience  with  with  these 
 random  girls  these  low  quality 
 degenerate  girls
[30:29] it's  cope  it's  not  that  it's  some 
 productive  self-improvement  thing  that 
 we  can  do  yeah  I'm  just  practicing
[30:34] getting  girls  guys  it's  just  instant 
 gratification  it's  just  pleasure  so  what 
 we  need  to  do  right  now  is  remove  the
[30:41] word  experience  remove  the  word  practice 
 because  that  makes  it  sound  productive 
 and  simply  just  be  honest  right  we  can
[30:46] be  respectfully  honest  and  just  say  you 
 know  what  I  just  want  some  pleasure  I 
 honestly  I  just  want  to  [ __ ]  I  just  want
[30:51] to  know  and  at  that  point  it's  like  okay 
 now  you're  being  honest  because  bro  of 
 course  we  feel  those  urges  of  course  we
[30:57] do  that's  a  better  question  to  ask 
 we  should  reject  like  this
[31:03] this  false  cope  this  cope  of  oh  but  you 
 know  it'd  be  productive  if  I  got  with
[31:08] girls  right  now  because  we  know  it 
 wouldn't  so  don't  say  that  this  is  for 
 self-improvement  for  your  own 
 development  as  a  man  because  it  would
[31:13] like  lead  your  life  down  a  wrong  path 
 right  with  no  degeneracy  is  bad  for  us 
 you  see  this  with  so  many  guys  right  so
[31:19] it's  not  about  that  oh  I  need  to 
 practice  it's  simply  just  oh  man  I'm 
 horny  and  I'm  lustful
[31:24] and  I'd  like  to  like  ejaculate  when  you 
 say  it  like  that  it's  not  attractive  now
[31:29] is  it  like  um  I'd  like  to  ejaculate  bro 
 like 
 and  what  can  we  say  about  this  well  you
[31:34] know  there's  so  many  videos  online  I  can 
 tell  you  about  like  oh  yeah  how  to  like 
 control  your  lust  and  everything  but
[31:39] there's  a  few  principles  from  this  book 
 which  are  really  good  so  you  can  just 
 have  a  look  at  this  book  if  you  want  but 
 in  general  the  thing  is  like  you  can
[31:45] control  that  luster  and  you  can  you  know 
 you've  heard  the  term  like  sexually 
 transmutates  like  a  bunch  of  like  the
[31:50] old  school  Success  people  used  to  say 
 this  like  you  can  sexually  transmutate 
 that  energy  that  lust  into  your  work  and
[31:56] the  gift  that  you  give  the  world  it's 
 like  when  you  choose  to  you  can  almost
[32:01] turn  off  the  lust  so  that  it  doesn't 
 feel  bad  like  lust  you  know  how  we  want 
 to  [ __ ]  right  that's  like  some  like  a
[32:08] build  up  of  weird  energy  inside  of  us 
 usually  either  in  our  mind  we're  in  our 
 balls  and  in  this  weird  like
[32:14] visualization  you  can  just  imagine 
 breathing  deeply  and  having  it  spread 
 across  your  body  differently  and  almost
[32:21] like  thank  the  women  of  the  world  that 
 they've  given  you  this  energy  and  say  to 
 yourself  again  I'm  gonna  use  this  energy
[32:27] now  to  to  fulfill  my  purpose  to  work  on 
 my  goals  it's  a  weird  practice  that  I 
 personally  like  to  do  and  I  learned  from
[32:33] this  book  The  Way  of  the  superior  man 
 and  so  that  can  help  you  with  the  love 
 so  it's  like  okay  we  know  it's  not 
 practice  we  know  it's  not  experienced
[32:38] and  also  the  fact  that  it's  okay  but  I 
 just  want  some  pleasure  hamster  we  know 
 pleasure  is  not  good  for  us  oh  but  you
[32:43] know  like  I'm  really  lust  like  I've 
 lustful  and  stuff  well  there's  things 
 you  can  do  about  that  you  can  go  YouTube 
 right  now  how  to  deal  with  us  how  to
[32:48] deal  with  urges 
 the  worst  case  scenario  bro  honestly 
 like  I've  never  said  this  on  YouTube
[32:53] before  so  I  might  get  criticized  for  it 
 but  worst  case  scenario 
 maybe  it's  better  to  fap  once  a  week
[32:59] with  no  porn  it's  not  even  like  that  fun 
 or  something  let's  just  do  it  fast  once 
 a  week  to  control  some  of  the  urges  no
[33:05] porn  prom  make  that  promise  no  porno 
 it's  Pawn's  [ __ ]  horrible  for  you  bro 
 literally  no  point  just  imagination  just
[33:11] imagine  your  future  wife 
 and  I  just  get  back  to  work  worst  case 
 scenario  if  that's  what  you  got  to  do  to
[33:16] like  control  some  of  the  urges  you  can 
 do  that  that's  that's  better  than  that 
 having  that  same  ejaculation  but  like
[33:22] inside  of  a  random  girl  that  you've  just 
 met  that's  a  lot  better  for  you  right  so
[33:27] if  you  feel  like  you  can't  control  your 
 urge  just  fap  once  or  twice  a  week 
 honestly  like  I'd  give  you  that  like 
 doctor's  recommendation  right  now  if  if
[33:33] it's  gonna  distract  you  so  much  because 
 I  do  get  into  some  moments  where  it  is 
 very  distracting  for  me
[33:40] and  one  one  extra  like  Point  here  is  you 
 know  okay  but  we  want  to  practice  we 
 want  to  get  experiences  because  when  we
[33:46] do  eventually  meet  the  woman  like  we 
 don't  want  to  be  like  [ __ ]  with  her 
 right 
 well  practice  with  her  when  you  meet
[33:53] that  high  quality  woman  that's  when  the 
 practice  is  worth  it  because  you're 
 practicing  with  women  that  aren't  her
[33:59] before  this  like  I  have  right  I've 
 practiced  with  women  who  aren't  the 
 woman  that  I  actually  want  and  it
[34:04] doesn't  fit  perfectly  like  what  I've 
 learned  to  what  I'm  gonna  need  to  learn 
 it  doesn't  fit  because  every  woman  is
[34:10] genuinely  like  very  unique  and  I  don't 
 say  this  we're  just  like  oh  you  know 
 like  what  they  like  to  do  yeah  I  like  to
[34:15] watch  TV  it's  like  their  feminine  energy 
 the  depth  of  like  a  feminine  energy
[34:20] the  way  that  she  loves  and  what  she 
 needs  is  incredibly  unique  and  you  don't
[34:25] want  to  have  this  preconceived  like  this 
 pre-built  experience  from  girls  who
[34:30] aren't  but  like  the  woman  who  actually 
 matters  and  again  I  will  say  like  I 
 don't  think  there's  the  one  or  you
[34:36] should  wait  out  for  your  soul  mates  I'm 
 just  saying  okay  wait  till  till  the 
 women  who  are  coming  into  your  life  are 
 of  us  such  high  quality  where  they're
[34:42] beautiful  but  then  also  have  like  a 
 great  foundation  for  for  marriage  and 
 children  and  at  that  point  right  now  you
[34:48] might  be  thinking  oh  but  you  know  we 
 should  get  married  in  the  western  stuff 
 when  you  meet  a  woman  who  genuinely  has
[34:53] like  a  strong  masculine  father  who 
 genuinely  has  like  a  submissive  feminine 
 mother  who  you  can  see  is  literally  like
[34:59] religious  she's  never  had  a  guy  before 
 you  and  so  if  that's  when  you'll 
 reconsider  it  because  you'll  think  like 
 wait  like  she's  literally  waiting  for
[35:04] marriage  all  of  the  the  anti-marriage 
 stuff  is  based  on  yeah  don't  [ __ ] 
 marry  the  the  other  girls  bro  of  course
[35:10] not  bro  no  matter  how  much  you're  in 
 love  with  with  one  of  the  other  girls 
 don't  marry  them  but  there's  gonna  be  a
[35:16] moment  when  you  genuinely  you  will  know 
 it  is  actually  right  to  marry  a  woman  I 
 am  sure  I  am  certain  of  this  no  no
[35:21] matter  what  any  red  pill  guy  says 
 they're  talking  about  the  girls  that 
 they  get  which  are  the  DJ  and  party  club
[35:26] girls  the  Instagram  girls  the  tender 
 girls  there's  going  to  be  a  moment  at 
 some  point  and  I'll  explain  how  we're 
 actually  going  to  meet  this  like  this
[35:31] this  really  10  out  of  10  woman  soon 
 right 
 but  just  remember  because  you  know  we
[35:36] like  to  improve  things  right  this 
 doesn't  mean  that  we're  never  going  to 
 improve  our  date  in  life  it  just  means 
 we're  not  going  to  improve  it  improve  it
[35:42] in  in  the  worst  way  we're  going  to  wait 
 till  we  have  like  one  of  the  high 
 quality  women  one  of  the  healthy  women 
 and  improve  it  with  them  so  when  you
[35:48] meet  your  future  wife  you  start  to 
 practice  an  experience  with  her  you  read
[35:53] these  books  that  tell  you  about  how  to 
 love  a  woman  you  read  attached  by  Amir
[35:58] Levine  you'll  read  like  books  on 
 attachment  styles  on  love  and  maybe 
 together  and  this  is  now  your  journey 
 like  your  project  together  where  you
[36:03] literally  think  okay  I  actually  really 
 [ __ ]  want  to  make  it  work  with  this 
 woman  she's  so  high  quality  and  you  say
[36:10] to  her  like  let's  do  this  together  let's 
 learn  about  the  type  of  people  we  are 
 and  how  we  love  and  what  we  need  from
[36:15] each  other  and  like  you  tell  me  like 
 what  what  would  you  like  from  me  you  can 
 learn  and  practice  with  her  so  why  would
[36:21] you  like  do  that  with  some  random  girl 
 that  you  don't  actually  care  about  that 
 you're  faking  to  care  about  that  you
[36:27] know  like  you  know  these  random  girls 
 you  know  that  eventually  you're  gonna 
 break  up  with  them
[36:32] and  not  only  because  of  the  fact  that 
 eventually  you  know  you're  gonna  you 
 want  the  future  wife  and  These  Girls 
 Aren't  but  also  the  fact  that  like
[36:37] you're  climbing  very  fast  as  a  man  on 
 self-improvement  no  bro  I'm  telling  you 
 right  now
[36:43] no  girls  that  I  mean  the  least  that  I've 
 met  but  maybe  this  they're  awesome  out 
 there  no  girls  can  match  the  rate  that
[36:49] we  can  collide 
 if  you've  been  like  a  like  a  big  fan  of
[36:55] mine  for  maybe  two  years  you've  seen  the 
 relationships  that  I  got  into  really
[37:00] happy 
 and  then  ended  up  breaking  up  with  every 
 single  girl  that  I  dated  simply  because 
 we  would  meet  on  the  same  level  and
[37:06] three  months  six  months  later  it's  like 
 I  just  this  sounds  [ __ ]  horrible 
 right  this  is  like  a  first  man  concept
[37:11] that  I  learned  from  him  that  every  other 
 YouTuber  every  other  like 
 um  person  out  there  will  say  like  oh
[37:16] this  is  such  a  weird  thing  truthfully 
 when  you're  on  self-improvement  and 
 you're  you're  ruthlessly  improving
[37:21] yourself  your  value  like  the  person  you 
 are  you  will  out  Climb  Every  Woman 
 especially  like  the  the  sort  of  online
[37:27] dating  apps  Instagram  kind  of  girls 
 even  the  girl  who's  on  self-improvement
[37:32] herself  but  you  know  her  foundations  all 
 cracked  and  stuff  and  and  she  slept 
 around  a  lot  before  you  she's  taking  a
[37:37] lot  of  drugs  and  her  father's  not  in  the 
 picture  and  stuff  even  if  she's  really 
 on  self-improvement  she'll  never  be  able
[37:42] to  match  your  rate  of  growth 
 it's  just  as  simple  as  that
[37:50] so  practice  and  experience  with  your 
 wife  learn  how  to  love  her  forever  you 
 know  with  these  books  and  still  learn
[37:56] some  red  pill  truth  so  this  isn't  to  say 
 like  yeah  be  totally  blue  pill  this  is 
 to  like  learn  some  things  that  you  still
[38:02] need  to  know  learn  about  hypergamy  learn 
 about  like  female  nature  and  stuff  still 
 learn  some  of  these  things  but  with
[38:09] the  best  women  not  with  the  lowest 
 quality  women  that  you  can  get  right  now 
 this  is  literally  just  all  about  are  you
[38:14] going  to  take  the  marshmallow  right  now 
 or  the  second  one  later  it's  just  simply 
 just  that 
 when  you've  heard  of  that  marshmallow
[38:20] study  you  know  the  kids  are  sat  there 
 and  they're  told  do  you  want  the  one 
 marshmallow  now  the  second  marshmallow 
 later  it's  like  I  don't  know  about  you
[38:25] but  it  makes  me  feel  awkward  hearing 
 that  study  knowing  that  as  a  kid  I  would 
 have  taken  the  first  one  and  that  really
[38:30] like  reflected  like  my  first  like  18 
 years  where  I  was  just  playing  video 
 games  and  stuff  you  know  the  instant
[38:35] gratification  is  not  good  for  you 
 instant  gratification  has  never  served 
 you  not  even  once  it  has  Stripped  Away
[38:40] years  of  your  [ __ ]  youth 
 imagine  if  you  never  took  the  first
[38:45] marshmallow  in  the  in  the  reflection  of 
 playing  video  games  and  watching  porn 
 for  like  10  years  straight  imagine  if  we
[38:51] were  literally  bro  you  can  be  a  10  year 
 old  who's  actually  productive  in  reading 
 books  genuinely  I  know  that's  like  rare
[38:57] to  see  but  like  we  could  have  been  if  we 
 were  the  kind  of  kids  who  took  the 
 second  Marshmallow  with  instant
[39:03] gratification  has  never  served  us  once 
 why  would  it  serve  us  here  in  such  an 
 important  part  of  our  Lives  which  is  our
[39:08] day  in  life  and  who  we  bonded  with  and 
 attach  with 
 and  one  point  that  none  of  the  red  pill
[39:13] guys  actually  say 
 is  that  the  highest  quality  women  you're 
 the  really  wifey  qualities  right  I'm  not
[39:19] just  saying  like  the  just  the  beautiful 
 girl  or  something  I'm  saying  imagine  the 
 girl  who's  got  the  package  like  she's 
 beautiful  and  she's  also  got  a  really
[39:24] awesome  personality  and  she's  also  got  a 
 really  awesome  family  right  I'm  not  like 
 like  you  know  she's  not  perfect  right  no
[39:30] one's  perfect  right  but  just  imagine 
 right  those  kinds  of  women  have  high 
 standards  of  course  they  do  so  they  want
[39:36] the  best  mental  what  are  the  best  men 
 because  so  far  you've  thought  that  the 
 best  men  are  simply  the  high  value  men 
 they're  like  the  the  red  pill  alpha
[39:42] males  you  know  they've  got  success  and 
 they've  got  girls 
 there's  a  level  of  man  above  those  guys
[39:47] those  guys  are  above  most  most  men  but 
 there's  a  level  of  man  above  those  guys
[39:52] and  that  is  the  guy  who's  High  status 
 who's  high  value  who's  attractive 
 but  who's  also  got  incredibly  high
[39:58] standards  that  he  doesn't  [ __ ]  around 
 who's  also  religious
[40:03] this  is  hard  to  imagine  because  this  is 
 you  know  like  we  said  oh  the  top  one 
 percent  man  those  are  the  red  pill  guys 
 right  this  is  like  the  top  zero  zero
[40:09] zero  one  percent  man  right
[40:14] there  is  a  level  of  man  that  that  isn't 
 really  on  the  internet  these  days  and 
 I'm  certainly  not  him  right  so  there's
[40:19] the  one  percent  guy  that  we  want  to  be 
 like  oh  yeah  private  jets  and  girls  oh 
 wow  that's  amazing  right  but  above  that
[40:24] is  the  guy  who  doesn't  indulge  in  women 
 is  the  guy  who's  got  such  high  standards
[40:31] that  he  just  he  literally  keeps  thinking 
 that  this  girl's  not  good  enough  this 
 girl's  not  good  enough  this  girl's  not
[40:36] good  enough  and  everyone  especially 
 people  on  the  internet  think  he's  crazy 
 oh  man  you  need  to  lower  your  standards 
 and  all  this  [ __ ]  they'll  say  like  oh 
 but  no  one  no  girl's  gonna  be  perfect
[40:42] and  no  girl's  gonna  and  he  just  knows 
 he's  got  this  to  see  nope  nope  I  know 
 what  I'm  looking  for  five  years  down  the
[40:47] line  six  years  down  the  line  maybe  he's 
 discovered  God  or  something  and  then  he 
 founds  a  woman  who  respects  literally
[40:53] likes  him  more  because  she  can  see  that 
 he's  actually  had  such  high  standards 
 that  he  hasn't  indulged  on  the  way  there
[41:00] with  lower  quality  girls 
 you  want  to  know  how  like  okay  I  want 
 you  to  imagine  not  just  like  the
[41:05] beautiful  girl  who's  who's  kind  of  like 
 a  [ __ ]  okay  I'm  I'm  talking  the  highest 
 quality  girls  right  they've  literally
[41:11] got 
 undeniably  this  is  impossible  without 
 them  I'm  sorry  for  the  girls  watching
[41:16] this  but  to  be  the  highest  quality  girl 
 you  need  to  have  a  strong  masculine 
 father  figure  who  still  married  to  your
[41:21] mother  it's  like  they  can't  be  split  up 
 literally  it's  it's  that's  just  a 
 non-negotiable  maybe  if  a  father  passed
[41:26] away  it's  a  bit  different  but  literally 
 the  highest  quality  women  have  got  a 
 strong  masculine  Father  Figure  who's
[41:32] still  in  love  in  still  married  maybe  in 
 like  a  religious  marriage  to  his
[41:37] feminine  Like  Loving  beautiful  wife 
 right  that  that's  what  your  woman  future 
 woman  seeing  right  this  is  the  highest
[41:43] quality  like  this  is  an  absolute 
 undeniable  if  that  man  or  if  she  is  as 
 high  qualities  as  we  think  she  is  that
[41:49] father  has  to  be  as  observant  and  strong 
 as  we  think  he  would  have  needed  to  be 
 to  to  nurture  his  daughter  into
[41:56] essentially  not  being  a  degenerate  in 
 this  modern  world  that's  hard  right  you 
 probably  never  even  like  saw  this 
 Dynamic  before  where  a  girl  is  growing
[42:01] up  to  not  be  like  a  Degen  at  all  right 
 so  this  requires  a  strong  father  bro 
 when  you're  the  top  one  percent  man  and
[42:07] you  sit  in  front  of  him  and  the  strong 
 father  can  see  through  you  that  you 
 [ __ ]  a  hundred  girls  he's  gonna  know
[42:13] he's  going  to  know  that  you're  actually 
 not  the  level  that  he's  looking  for 
 because  he's  looking  for  the  kind  of  guy
[42:18] who's  got  the  personality  the  money  the 
 status  the  the  fame  and  everything  but 
 he's  also  looking  for  the  kind  of  like
[42:23] usually  godly  man  who  has  literally  been 
 like  waiting  for  the  second  marshmallow
[42:30] view  this  is  literally  like  like  an 
 example  of  the  highest  quality  people 
 ever
[42:36] and  it's 
 it's  unrealistic  for  us  to  reach  towards
[42:41] that 
 that's  what  everyone  will  tell  you  it's 
 unrealistic 
 and  of  course  if  anyone  puts  down  your
[42:47] goals  they're  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and  you 
 shouldn't  spend  time  with  them 
 I'm  very  lucky  that  when  I  announced  my
[42:53] goals  years  ago  to  my  family 
 no  one  put  my  goals  down
[43:01] every  goal  that  I've  achieved  over  the 
 last  few  years  is  unrealistic 
 so  why  not  this  one  why  not  this  one  for
[43:07] you 
 the  highest  like  literally  the  highest 
 quality  women  will  be  thinking  about
[43:14] your  previous  dating  life  and  of  course 
 you  could  hide  it  from  them  of  course 
 you  don't  need  to  tell  them  details 
 about  the  women  you  [ __ ]  and  practiced
[43:19] with  right 
 is  that  the  kind  of  relationship  you 
 want  to  start  with  where  she's  not  even
[43:24] dating  like  the  real  you  where  she  knows 
 like  60  of  actually  Who  You  Are
[43:29] in  some  ways  be  mysterious  in  some  ways 
 you  know  be  busy  you  know  with  your  work 
 100  you  know  like  I  give  this  advice
[43:34] yeah  bpsc  be  like  you  know  focus  on  your 
 purpose  yeah 
 but  at  the  same  time  like  imagine  not
[43:41] actually  being  able  to  show  the  real  you 
 to  the  woman  that  you're  entrusting 
 everything  with
[43:52] I  think  I  could  be  wrong  but  I  think 
 with  the  ideal  relationship  you  should
[43:57] know  and  accept  and  love  100  of  her  her 
 past  her  experiences  her  values
[44:03] everything  and  she  should  do  the  exact 
 same  thing  for  you  you  can  still 
 maintain  mystery  past  this  you  can  still
[44:08] go  to  the  gym  and  not  reply  to  a  phone 
 for  like  three  hours  you  can  still  go 
 work  on  your  purpose  and  stuff  of  course
[44:17] but  when  you  get  to  this  depth  of  like 
 openness 
 I  think  that's  when  you'll  get  the  best
[44:22] relationship  you  could  possibly  get  and 
 I  think  that's 
 is  the  foundation  in  which  we  should
[44:29] have  our  kids 
 you  see  all  this  time  we've  just  been 
 speaking  about  girls  and  future  wife  and
[44:35] stuff  but  in  the  end  it  just  comes  down 
 to  fatherhood 
 how  much
[44:40] how  long  you  will  wait  for  that  second 
 marshmallow  defines
[44:46] [ __ ]  me  bro 
 how  long  you  will  wait  for  that  second 
 marshmallow
[44:51] defines  how  many  guys  will  [ __ ]  your 
 future  daughter
[44:57] if  you  go  about  this  wrong 
 and  you  expect  to  have  children  at  some
[45:02] point  and  you  go  about  this  wrong  and 
 you  practice  and  you  mess  around  and 
 stuff 
 your  daughter  will  literally  have  a
[45:07] higher  body  count  your  daughter  will 
 give  her  soul  to  guys  who  don't  even 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  her  to  guys  she
[45:12] doesn't  give  a  [ __ ]  about  and  she'll  end 
 up  getting  into  that  situation  where 
 like  she's  one  of  these  Degen  women 
 who's  ended  up  partnering  up  with  like  a
[45:18] self-improvement  guy  and  he  can  never 
 just  accept  the 
 your  inability  to  delay  for  that  second
[45:25] marshmallow  literally  means  that  more 
 guys 
 will  will  [ __ ]  like  nut  over  your
[45:30] [ __ ]  future  daughter  bro
[45:35] it  means  that  your  son  will  be  more  of  a 
 Jeffrey 
 it  means  that  your  son  will  have  [ __ ]
[45:40] posture  whilst  he  literally  like  he 
 indulges  in  the  [ __ ]  futuristic  porn
[45:45] that's  out  there  this  is  the 
 consequences  of  our  actions  as  young  men 
 and  when  you  spend  time  distracted  by
[45:51] degeneracy 
 degeneracy  will  compound  in  your 
 bloodline
[45:58] you  are  not  that  kind  of  man  who  would 
 allow  this  to  pass  the  room  you  would 
 not  be  watching  a  video  like  this  you
[46:03] would  not  be  watching  my  channel 
 I  don't  think  we  even  comprehend
[46:09] the  consequences  of  our  actions  here 
 but  our  decisions  in  dating  is  one  of
[46:14] the  most  important  not  only  for  what 
 happens  in  dating  but  also  for  how  much 
 like  dating  can  distract  you  in  certain
[46:20] ways  now  if  you  meet  the  high  quality  10 
 out  of  10  woman  that  is  not  a 
 distraction  then  that's  the  woman  to
[46:25] pair  up  with  100  but  till  you  meet  her 
 stay  focused  on  growing  yourself  and
[46:31] this  doesn't  mean  I'll  just  be  indoors 
 and  don't  talk  to  anyone  do  like  a 
 semi-monk  mode  where  you  still  want  to
[46:36] build  like  a  vibrant  life  of  of  male 
 friends  and  then  it's  like  okay  that's
[46:41] awesome  maybe  even  make  some  female 
 friends  but  you  know  like  like 
 specifically  I'm  going  to  tell  you 
 specifically  the  issue  is  just  you
[46:47] having  sex  with  women 
 who  aren't  going  to  be  your  future  wife 
 it  literally  comes  down  to  that  and  I
[46:53] know  how  weird  it  is  for  me  to  say  that 
 as  a  guy  who's  done  it  but  of  course 
 like  this  is  how  I'm  able  to  pass  on  the
[46:58] wisdom  series  like  I  made  the  mistake  so 
 now  I'm  telling  you  what  I  did  wrong  you 
 don't  have  to  take  the  Learning  lesson
[47:04] but  honestly  I  wish  I  did
[47:10] so  how  should  we  navigate  our  day  in 
 life  then 
 maybe  the  best  way  is  literally  just
[47:17] permanently  be  in  a  full  state  of  of 
 hard  work  and  growth  and  not  just  you
[47:22] know  like  oh  grind  or  like  thingy  but 
 like  you  know  like  hard  working  growth 
 also  means  take  a  long  walk  every  day  it
[47:28] also  means  the  journal  and  read 
 generally  just  essentially  how  about  we 
 just  don't  date
[47:33] honestly  religious  people  had  this  role 
 how  about  we  just  literally  don't  date
[47:38] within  a  glance  like  you're  coping  if 
 you  if  not  right  bro  within  a  glass 
 you'll  come  across  some  women  in  the  gym
[47:43] or  whatever  right  within  one  single 
 glance  one  conversation  you  can  tell  if 
 she's  not  eligible  to  be  your  wife  you
[47:49] can  tell  don't  don't  cope  bro  you  see  a 
 tattoo  on  her  bro  she's  not  your  future 
 wife  simple  as  that  you  see  this  she's
[47:54] got  colorful  hair  bro  she's  not  your 
 future  wife  you  see  that  she's  got  that 
 that  friend  who's  a  bit  of  a  [ __ ]  bro 
 don't  cope  don't  cope  she's  not  your
[48:01] future  wife  now  this  is  easy  to  do  when 
 you're  rational  headed  but  when  you  meet 
 these  women  or  like  a  date  and  you  end
[48:06] up  having  sex  with  them  then  it's  harder 
 then  you  like  you  have  sex  with  this 
 girl  knowing  that  she's  got  tattoos  and 
 stuff  oh  yeah  I'm  just  practicing  bro 
 I'm  just  you  know  getting  some  instant
[48:12] gratification  yeah  I  feel  like  a  man  bro 
 and  then  you  see  how  the  general  family 
 you  see  the  general  friends  and  you're 
 like  you're  in  too  deep  and  you've
[48:18] fallen  in  love  with  the  bro  you  don't 
 want  to  be  in  that  situation  from  one 
 glass  just  don't  have  sex  with  these 
 women  it's  literally  as  simple  as  that  I
[48:23] don't  have  sex  with  them  because  then 
 you'll  pair  the  attachment  with  them  and 
 it's  not  worth  it  it's  a  distraction 
 from  your  business  and  and  over  the  next
[48:28] five  years  ten  years  that  distraction 
 compounds  you  don't  realize  how  much 
 you'll  miss  out  on  this  not  just  for  the
[48:33] work  but  also  for  the  kind  of  what  man 
 that  you  become  to  attract  the  the  Dream 
 Woman  of  yours
[48:40] maybe  literally  just  don't  date  as  soon 
 as  you  see  women 
 within  a  second  you  know  within  one
[48:46] conversation  you  know  there's  some 
 brutal  like  facts  which  a  lot  of  women 
 don't  like  to  hear  but  tattoos
[48:52] she's  got  guys  around  her  she's  got 
 [ __ ]  friends  those  kinds  of things  as 
 soon  as  you  see  that  her  parents  are 
 divorced  personally  like  I've
[48:59] nope  sorry 
 my  standard  literally  don't  even  say  it 
 to  her  but  just  say  to  yourself  I'm  a
[49:04] man  of  really  high  standards  I  hold 
 myself  like  say  it  with  a  sense  of 
 [ __ ]  pry  like  you're  in  the  military 
 I  hold  myself  to  really  high  standards  I
[49:10] hold  myself  to  really  high  standards  I 
 hold  myself  to  really  high  standards
[49:15] I  will  wait  for  the  second  marshmallow
[49:24] just  no  dating  just  keep  improving 
 yourself  and  then  you  might  think  okay 
 well  how  do  I  find  her
[49:30] honestly  I  think  women  are  supposed  to 
 find  you  I  think  that  you  will  tend  to
[49:35] the  god  and  I  think  that  you  will  keep 
 improving  and  ruthlessly  running  and 
 going  to  the  gym  and  stuff  and  when
[49:41] you're  like  high  attractive  enough  when 
 you're  high  value  enough 
 good  women  just  seem  to  find  you  and  we
[49:47] can  wait  for  that  because  as  soon  as  we 
 try  to  find  the  woman  we  start  cooking 
 about  it  in  the  d-gen  ways  you  know
[49:52] we're  on  dating  apps  we're  looking 
 online  we're  on  Instagram  and  stuff 
 we're  going  to  parties  and  and  you  know 
 trying  to  go  out  cold  approaching  and
[49:57] that  just  practices  the  wrong  thing  I 
 think  if  we  focus  entirely  on  just 
 building  but  also  living  like  a  vibrant
[50:03] life  with  our  male  friends  or  going  on 
 Hikes  we're  going  to  to  stuff  like  that 
 I  think  you'll  end  up  just  naturally
[50:09] just  coming  across  some  women  not 
 nowhere  near  as  much  as  if  you're  on 
 online  dating  and  stuff 
 and  then  with  that  start  to  just  filter
[50:16] them  out  with  really  high  standards  and 
 then  you  might  actually  meet  some  women
[50:21] who  are  really  high  quality  because  you 
 yourself  are  high  quality
[50:30] three  guys  asked  me about  this  yesterday 
 three  different  guys  on  a  three  hour 
 group  call  I  have  a  new  like  online
[50:36] community  which  is  for  guys  to  come 
 together  and  to  like  get  very  close  to 
 me  like  I  literally  was  on  on  the  phone
[50:41] call  for  like  five  hours  yesterday  and 
 there's  the  top  Link  in  the  description 
 if  you're  interested  in  that  do  the  hard
[50:46] work  especially  when  you  don't  feel  like 
 it  what
"
jSiWpRyHIbU,"[00:03] your  audio  is  not  switched  on 
 we're  having  some  technical  difficulties
[00:09] there  we  go 
 okay  hi  hi  how  you  doing  hi
[00:17] this  is  [ __ ]  weird 
 you  really  really  win  but  yeah  i'm  good
[00:24] it's  nice  to  see  you  peter
[00:30] good  for  them  it's  going  good
[00:35] i'm  a little  bit  nervous  i'm  all  like 
 yeah  me  too  look
[00:42] very  weird  all  right  so 
 i  think  boys  you  know  eve  she's  showing
[00:49] up  in  a  couple  other  videos 
 about  a  month  ago  and  we're  going  to
[00:54] talk  about  our  relationship  and  we're 
 going  to  talk  about 
 some  advice  and  we'll  see  how  it  goes
[01:01] do  you want  to  introduce  yourself 
 yeah  i'm  eve  um
[01:08] i'm  hansen's  ex-girlfriend
[01:23] what  was  it  like  dating  me
[01:28] when  it  was  good  it  was  really  good  but 
 when  it  was  bad  it  was  really  bad
[01:33] as  a  summary  basically  can  you  expand  on 
 that
[01:39] um  yeah  like  obviously  we  got  on 
 really  well  like  we  have  like  a  really
[01:45] good  connection  and  stuff  but 
 i  think  you  have  a  lot  of  toxic  traits
[01:50] like  a  lot  of  toxic  traits 
 um  which  i  don't  think  you'd  call  as
[01:56] toxic  but  they  are  toxic 
 um  and  ultimately  in  my  opinion  that's
[02:01] why  we  ended 
 um  but  dating  like  it  was  good  like  i'm
[02:06] saying  this  is  if  our  relationship  was 
 bad  like 
 the  most  part  of  our  relationship  was 
 good  it  was  just  the  end  was
[02:11] [ __ ]  and  what  were  the  toxic  traits
[02:18] um  controlling 
 manipulative  like  borderline  abusive
[02:26] emotionally  not  physically 
 emotionally  not  verbally
[02:33] but  just  i  don't  know  i  feel  like  you 
 played  mind  games  quite  a  lot 
 um  let's  go  through  them
[02:39] so  why  would  you  say  controlling
[02:45] why  do  you  think  i'd  say  controlling  to 
 start  with 
 you  tell  me  if  that's  that's  one  of  my
[02:50] tricks  that  you  saw  in  me 
 um  telling
[02:56] your  girlfriend  if  you  go  to  a  nightclub 
 without  me  i  break  up  with  you
[03:01] it's  just  it's  just  a  little  bit 
 controlling 
 um  just  like  all  the  things  at  the  end
[03:07] of  our  relationship  like 
 telling  me  the  first  like  going  to 
 nightclubs
[03:12] like  oh  what  i  could  post  on  instagram 
 or  not  i  mean  i 
 never  posted  the  kinds  of  things  that
[03:18] you  were  on  about  but  um 
 like  not  moving  to  liverpool  likes  when 
 you  said  to  me  if  i  went  and  moved  to
[03:23] liverpool  you  break  up  with  me  like 
 that's  controlling 
 like  that's  using  like  you  used  my  fear
[03:30] of 
 abandonment  and  fear  of  rejection  which 
 like 
 i've  had  for  all  my  life  like  from  my
[03:36] childhood  and  like  stuff  in  my  dad  and 
 stuff 
 like  you  really  did  use  that  against  me
[03:41] a  lot 
 so  you  thought  that  was  a  like  a 
 calculated
[03:47] attack  that  i  made  on  you  no  i  think  it 
 was  calculated
[03:52] um  yeah
[03:57] i  don't  think  it  calculated  i  just  think 
 it's  the  way  that  you  are
[04:04] joe  it's  interesting  how 
 we  have  very  very  different 
 interpretations  of  the  same  thing
[04:11] because  you  see  this  is  controlling 
 and  i  would  honestly  see  this  as  healthy 
 boundaries  and
[04:17] the  way  that  you  said  it  as  well  is 
 almost  like 
 like  you  maybe  could  even  remember  a
[04:23] false  moment  in  your  mind  of  me  saying 
 okay 
 if  you  do  this  i  will  break  up  with  you 
 but  i  don't  ever  speak  like  that  it  was
[04:29] more 
 i  am  not  a  girlfriend  no
[04:36] i  was  literally  sat  here  i  remember  the 
 conversation 
 so  you  kind can  genuinely  believe  i  said
[04:42] if  you  do  this 
 i  will  break  up  with  you  i  threatened 
 you
[04:48] does  that  sound  like  that 
 yeah  well  no  but  yeah  towards  the  end
[04:56] do  you  not  remember  like  when  i  was  here 
 i  came  back  to  uni  for  six  days 
 and  then  you  broke  up  with  me  i  came
[05:02] home  um 
 and  then  when  we  had  that  conversation
[05:07] in  the  car  when  we  got  back  together 
 that's  when  you  laid  out  these 
 boundaries  about  nightclubs  and
[05:13] liverpool  and 
 i  did  not  feel  like  that  was  a  good
[05:19] discussion  to  have 
 um  boundaries  of  course  but  not  the
[05:24] boundaries  that  you  set 
 healthy  boundaries  are  i  need 
 i  need  x  amount  of  free  time  to  spend
[05:30] time  with  my  friends  or  i  need  x  amount 
 of  time 
 to  spend  and  focus  on  my  work  like 
 they're  healthy  boundaries
[05:35] or  oh  i  don't  feel  comfortable  like  say 
 oh  how  healthy  boundaries  are  that  you
[05:41] do  have  some  healthy  boundaries  like 
 not  posting  like  [ __ ]  pictures  to
[05:46] instagram  because  obviously  you  don't  do 
 that  if  you're  in  a  relationship 
 um  like  that  is  a  healthy  boundary  i
[05:51] think  but 
 the  boundaries  that  you  set  weren't
[05:56] necessarily  the  healthiest 
 i  disagree  i'd  say
[06:03] it  shouldn't  really  need  to  be  said  that 
 type  of  boundary 
 because  when  you're  in  a  good  committed
[06:11] relationship 
 you  don't  do  certain  things  anymore  and 
 that
[06:16] is  you  can  see  it  as  controlling  if  for 
 example  you  want  to  take  a  negative  view 
 of  the  person  who  says  that  and  if
[06:21] you've  already  kind  of  you  know  you  want 
 to  like  say  something  towards  them  but
[06:26] that  that  single  people  stuff  going  to  a 
 nightclub  going  to  like  move  into  a 
 place  which  is
[06:31] which  in  this  house  where  there's  going 
 to  be  a lot  of  parties  and  there's  going 
 to  be  a lot  of  like 
 people  interacting  with  each  other
[06:36] that's  like  single  people  stuff  and 
 if  we  weren't  in  a  serious  relationship 
 if  we  were  just  kind  of  casually  dating
[06:42] fair  enough  i  would  say  that's  control 
 and  i'd  agree  with  you 
 but  when  we're  genuinely  planning  our 
 life  together  and  we  were  like  talking
[06:47] about  kids  and  everything 
 and  then  we're  saying  this  stuff  and  you 
 know  then  you're  like  oh  yeah  let  me
[06:53] uh  next  week  i'm  gonna  go  to  this 
 nightclub  like  that's 
 the  two  things  don't  match  you  you  don't
[06:58] if  you  were  being  honest  with  the  plans 
 that  we  made 
 you  don't  also  believe  that  whilst
[07:04] thinking  oh  yeah  let  me  go  live 
 my  normal  single  life  like  enjoy  my  hot 
 girl  summer
[07:10] i  i  understand  why  you  think  that  a
[07:15] hundred  percent 
 like  i've  actually  made  like  i've  made  a 
 few  notes  of  things  i  want  to  say  this
[07:20] was  actually 
 [Laughter]
[07:27] hello 
 um  before  we  begin
[07:33] before  it  starts  maybe  getting  hurtful 
 or  some  [ __ ] 
 i  didn't  do  this  but  i  did  plan  to
[07:39] so  we'll  do  like  a  real  life  journaling 
 session
[07:44] where  we'll  say  three  things  that  we 
 were  grateful 
 for  each  other  first  before  we  like  have
[07:50] you  ruined  my  life  and  i  hate  you 
 i'll  go  first  yeah  okay
[07:57] i'm  grateful  for  your  laugh  i  found  that 
 really  really  cute
[08:02] i'm  grateful  for  the  time  that  we  went 
 to  liverpool  and 
 we  saw  my  old  house  that  i  used  to  live
[08:07] at  and  then  we  went  to  that 
 spot  that  i  knew  that  we  would  go  to  one 
 time  and  we  did  the
[08:13] like  we  were  just  running  on  the  side  of 
 the  wall  i  think  that  was 
 such  a  very  very  cute  day
[08:19] and  i'm  grateful  for  the  vibe  that  we've 
 had  all  this  time
[08:24] that  we  would  meet  in  the  car  and  it 
 would  be  night  and 
 we'd  just  be  listening  to  music  and  like
[08:30] all  the  songs  we  used  to  listen  to 
 i  try  not  to  listen  to  them  anymore 
 because  it's  like
[08:37] by  association  i'm  instantly  thinking 
 about  you  and 
 yeah  i'm  grateful  for  that
[08:46] thank  you  um  i'm  grateful
[08:51] for  i  mean  i  said  this  to  you  like  all 
 throughout  our  relationship  even  though 
 things  have  ended  in  like  quite  a  bad
[08:56] way  and  like  i 
 like  yeah  things  have  ended  in  a  [ __ ]
[09:01] horrible  way 
 but  i  am  grateful  because  i  do  feel  like 
 despite  everything  you  did  have  a  very
[09:06] positive  influence  on  me 
 um  which  i  mean  i  said  that  to  you  like 
 all  throughout  our  relationship  so  you
[09:12] know  that  of  course  but  um 
 i'm  grateful  for
[09:17] all  the  time  we  spent  together  i  think 
 like  when  i  think  back  to  things 
 like  the  main  ones  like  delamere  forest
[09:23] and  like  the  pete  district 
 there's  like  two  of  my  favorites  and
[09:29] and  the  same  i'm  grateful  for  like  the 
 vibe  we  always  had  i  feel  like  we  always 
 just  got  on  really  well
[09:42] [Laughter]
[09:59] what  were  you  talking  about  just  before 
 though
[10:13] i  can't  remember  exactly  what  i  was 
 saying 
 um  oh  yeah  um
[10:20] like  i  do  believe  that  in  terms  of  stuff 
 like  this  you  are  quite  close-minded
[10:26] because  even  though  i  obviously  disagree 
 with  what  you  have  to  say  because 
 for  me  this  is  the  reason  why  we  broke
[10:32] up  i  feel  like  we  both  have  like  we'll 
 get  into  it  later  i'm  sure  but 
 that  we  both  have  very  different  ideas 
 of  why  we  actually  broken  up  with  them
[10:39] yeah  because  i  mean  we've  never 
 discussed  it  i  guess 
 um  but  although  like  i
[10:46] do  completely  disagree  with  your 
 belief  about  how  old  you  don't  go  to
[10:51] nightclubs  in  a  relationship  which 
 yeah  obviously  if  you're  in  a 
 relationship  you  shouldn't  be  going  to
[10:56] nightclubs  with  your  friends  every 
 weekend  but  that's  a  given  like  that's 
 just  not  going gonna  happen  and  if  it  is 
 then  you  shouldn't  be  in  a  relationship
[11:01] to  start  with 
 that  would  have  never  been  me  and  you 
 knew  that  um
[11:06] but  i  can  still  understand  why  you 
 believe  those  things  like  i  can 
 understand  like  oh  yeah  you  don't  put
[11:11] yourself 
 in  a  position  that  makes  your  partner 
 anxious  but  then  also
[11:16] like  you  shouldn't  but  you  shouldn't  we 
 do  feel  anxious  in  these  situations 
 because  i  do  as  well 
 but  we  shouldn't  feel  anxious  because  if
[11:22] you  really  trust  the  person 
 it  shouldn't  be  an  issue  you  know  what  i 
 mean  and  it's  like
[11:27] how  often  was  i  going  to  go  to 
 nightclubs  realistically  how  often  did 
 you  think  i  was  going  to  go  to
[11:32] nightclubs 
 i  had  to  say  because  you  you  do  have
[11:38] this  vibe  of  like  oh  no  not  me  like  you 
 know 
 i'll  go  once  every  now  and  then  but  i 
 only  knew  you  threw  kovid  anyway
[11:44] when  that  stuff  was  closed  and  the 
 moment  at  least  not  in  the  nightclubs 
 when  the  bars  were  opening  you  were
[11:49] going  straight  away 
 and  so  you  do  have  maybe  not  like 
 specifically  a  nightclub  but  you  have
[11:55] the  persona  of  someone  i'd  imagine  who 
 like  you  are  like  a  pretty  popular  girl 
 you've  got  a  pop  in  social  circle  and
[12:00] stuff  you've  built  that  up  so 
 you've  got  enough  people  to  like  hang 
 out  with  so  whilst  it  might  not  be
[12:05] specifically  at  nightclub  it  is 
 in  that  environment  of  like  nighttime
[12:10] drinking  mixing  with  a  bunch  of  guys  and 
 girls
[12:15] yeah  i  understand  that  i  have  probably 
 been 
 to  nightclubs  probably  maximum
[12:22] 15  20  times  in  my  whole  life  um
[12:27] so  it's  not  something  i  would  have 
 done  often  i  feel  like  we  both  have  a
[12:32] very  very  very  different 
 opinion  of  nightclubs  because  we've  had 
 very  different  experiences
[12:37] like  my  i've  never  been  to  a  nightclub 
 single  i've  never  been  to  a  nightclub
[12:42] not  once 
 when  i've  been  single  so  i've  never  gone 
 to 
 get  with  a  guy  or  and  or  anything  like
[12:48] that  i've  never  gone  for  male  attention 
 whereas  i  feel  like  you  genuinely 
 believe 
 that  the  only  reason  a  girl  will  go  to  a
[12:53] nightclub  is  to  get  attention  from  guys 
 and  the  only  reason  the  girl  will  get 
 ready  and  they'll  put  on  their  makeup
[12:59] and  they'll  make  themselves  look  nice  to 
 go  to  a  nightclub 
 is  for  guys  and  that's  like  yeah  that's 
 the  case  for  a  lot  of  girls  like  a  lot
[13:05] of  girls 
 but  not  for  me  and  not  for  my  friends 
 it's  never  been  me 
 like  ever  that's  what
[13:13] every  girl  would  say  though  that's  the 
 issue  yeah  maybe  it  is  but  that  does  it 
 doesn't  matter  what  every  girl  would  say
[13:19] it  matters  what  i'm  saying 
 because  i  was  your  girlfriend  it 
 shouldn't  matter  what  every  other  girl 
 oh  every  other  girl  goes  to  nightclubs
[13:25] to  impress  guys 
 okay  cool  but  i  don't  are  you  in  a 
 relationship  with  the  other  girl  no 
 you're  in  a  relationship  with  me
[13:31] so  what  should  have  mattered  we've  got 
 to  know  that  they 
 including  you  you  don't  consciously
[13:39] know  something  like  this  you  don't 
 consciously  think  oh  i'm  going  to  get 
 ready  i  hope 
 i  pull  a  guy  tonight  guys  do  this  guys
[13:45] openly  will  say  it  to  their  friends  like 
 i  hope  i  get  laid  tonight  for  poor  girl 
 tonight 
 girls  don't  exactly  have  that  openness
[13:51] even  though  girls  are  becoming  more  open 
 with  their  sexuality  and  they  will  say 
 to  their  friends  like  i  really  want  to 
 pull  a  guy
[13:56] it's  like  you  don't  exactly  know  it 
 yourself 
 because  you've  got  5  000  years  of
[14:01] progress  sexist  programming  telling  you 
 okay  don't  don't  show  any  kind  of 
 sexuality 
 be  repressed  and  so  subconsciously
[14:09] this  is  probably  what's  happening  is 
 subconsciously  you  kind  of  know  that  if 
 you  look  really  pretty  tonight  that
[14:14] there's  a  chance  to  get  with  a  guy  who's 
 like 
 really  really  really  awesome  but  it's 
 not  something  that
[14:19] you  hear  those  thoughts  in  your  mind 
 that  you  can  actually  express  to  people
[14:24] which  is  like 
 in  my  experience  if  one  of  say  if  i  was
[14:30] going  on  a  night  out  with  a  friend 
 and  they  were  like  wanted  to  get  with  a 
 guy  and  well  not  a  friend  could  never  go
[14:36] with  just  like  one  friend  it  would 
 always  be 
 like  a  group  of  people  um  they'd  say  it
[14:42] they  maybe  don't  say  it  to  guys  but  they 
 say  it  to  their  girlfriends
[14:47] but  i've  never  gone  to  clubs  for  like 
 that  reason 
 i've  never  put  on  makeup  to  impress  a
[14:52] guy  i've  never  worn  a  nice  outfit  to 
 impress  a  guy  yeah  it's  like 
 when  i've  got  ready  and  the  guy
[14:57] compliments  me  he  says  i  look  pretty  it 
 feels  like  it  [ __ ]  feels  nice  when 
 you  put  effort  into  your  appearance  but
[15:02] that  isn't  the  reason  i  do  it 
 like  when  i  put  on  makeup  when  i  get 
 ready  like  that's 
 my  like  form  of  expression  like  that's
[15:09] it's  like 
 creativity  like  i  could  [ __ ]  put  like 
 a  unicorn  on  my  eye  if  i  wanted  to  do
[15:14] you  know  i  mean  it's  like 
 you  can  do  whatever  you  want  with  it 
 it's  not  for  men  and  i  feel  like  that's 
 a  very
[15:19] outdated  view  to  think  that  makeup  and 
 clothes  is  for  men  when  that's  not  the
[15:24] case  for  some  girls  yeah  but  for  me  now 
 and  that's  what  matters  in  this 
 situation  because  it's  our  relationship
[15:30] not 
 every  other  goal
[15:36] what's  the  first  thing  you  have  on  your 
 your  list  that  you'd  like  to  discuss 
 on  my  list  um
[15:45] so  i've  like  done  it  in  sections  so 
 the  breakup  is  the  first  one  yeah
[15:52] it's  your  first  one  on  your  list 
 first  one  was  what  was  it  like  dating  me
[15:59] that  we  asked  that  one  and  the  second 
 one  was  the  best  and 
 the  best  of  worst  things  about  dating  me
[16:05] we  kind  of 
 i  mean  you  can  answer  that  if  you  want 
 but  you  kind  of  discussed  that  with  me
[16:11] the  toxicity  is  the  worst  and  the  best 
 was  like  the 
 positive  influence  on  the  blood
[16:18] um  i  wouldn't  even  say  that  was  the  best 
 thing  i'd  just  say 
 yeah  no  that  probably  was  the  best  thing
[16:23] actually  for  the  vibe 
 [Music] 
 another  the  third  one  i've  got  is  why
[16:29] did  we  break  up 
 i've  got  well  i  think  we  break  off  as
[16:34] well  what's  your  best 
 and  worst  thing  about  dating  me  um
[16:40] best  would  be 
 do  you  know  what  changed  i  remember
[16:45] saying  to  you  and  even  to  a  bunch  of 
 boys  that 
 the  the  best  thing  about  you  was  the
[16:51] fact  that 
 you  were  you  were  like  feminine  and
[16:56] it  complemented  me  so  nicely  that
[17:02] i  could i  could  influence  you  that  i 
 could  that  positive  influence  like  could 
 you  know  i  could  tell  you
[17:07] meditation  you'd  do  it  i  could  tell  you 
 this  and  this  and  this  even  from  the 
 start  before  i  got  you  onto  those 
 self-improvement  practices  i  would  often
[17:13] see  that 
 you'd  almost  automatically  be  influenced 
 by  my  decisions  and  my
[17:19] my  mindset  even  though  i  don't  think 
 you'd  be  able  to  admit  this  or  you  even 
 knew  what  would  happen 
 what  was  happening  but  i  remember
[17:24] sometimes  it'd  be  late  it  would  be  tired 
 for  example  you'd  say  that  you  didn't
[17:29] like  this  song  or  something 
 and  then  i  would  say  like  that's  pretty 
 good  and  you'll  be  like  yeah  that's
[17:34] pretty  good 
 all  right  so  that's
[17:39] yeah  that  was  your  best  trait  and  then
[17:44] after  everything  ended  and  i  was  opening 
 my  mind  up  to  someone  and  he
[17:49] he  said  no  no  that's  that's  not  what  you 
 want  a  girlfriend  at  all 
 and  i'm  so  confused  i've  literally
[17:54] thought  the  ability  to  influence  your 
 your  girlfriend  and  to  like  train  her  to 
 be  you  know  into  the  self-improvement
[17:59] was  awesome 
 and  say  like  nah  if  she's  got  that  trait 
 that  means  that
[18:04] she'll  blow  wherever  the  wind  goes  or 
 she'll  go  wherever  the  wind  blows  and 
 that 
 anyone  around  her  will  be  able  to
[18:09] influence  her  and 
 straight  i  was  like  that's  the
[18:15] unfortunate  truth  is 
 when  you  were  with  me  you  were 
 completely  obsessed  with  me  you  did 
 everything  exactly  like  me  but  then  when
[18:21] you  were  with 
 your  friends  you  turned  exactly  like 
 them  and  you  were with  your  family  you 
 turned  like  them
[18:26] and  so  it  was  like  kind  of  like  a 
 shape-shifter  personality  where 
 no  one  really  knows  who  the  real  version
[18:33] of  you  actually  is 
 i  think  that's  fair  to  say  why  not
[18:40] i  just  don't  think  it  is 
 do  you  think  it's  not  nice  to  say  but
[18:45] you  think  it's  partially  true  at  least 
 um  i  think  it's  partial  it  is  partially
[18:52] true 
 like 
 um  i  don't  think  that's
[19:00] the  case  that  i'd  just  be  influenced  by 
 anything 
 i'm  influenced  by  things  that  interest
[19:05] me 
 i'm  not  this  shape-shifter  person  i'm 
 not  a  different  person  when  i'm  with  my
[19:10] mom  i'm  not  a  different  person  when  i'm 
 with  you  i'm  not  a different  person  when 
 i'm  with  my  friends 
 i  saw  that  of  course  yeah  but  we  talk
[19:17] like  i'm  not  going  to  talk  about  the 
 same  things  to  you  that  i  talk  about 
 with  my  friends  am  i 
 of  course  i'm  going  to  be  slightly
[19:22] different  we  were  in  a  relationship 
 together 
 i'm  not  going  to  be  the  exact  same  with 
 you  as  i  was  with  my  mum  or  i  was  with
[19:27] my  friends  because  we  were  in  a 
 relationship 
 yeah  i'm  not  expecting  you  to  to  talk
[19:33] about  the  same  things  but 
 your  your  personality  changed  a
[19:39] significant  amount 
 if  you'd  be  next  to  me  you  were  very 
 similar  to  me  and  you'd  be 
 like  the  other  half  of  me  and  then  you
[19:45] went  away  you  went  to  uni 
 and  it's  like  you  turned  into  just  like 
 a  normal  girl
[19:51] who's  doing  [ __ ]  on  like  social  media 
 who's  like  stalking  my 
 checking  my  followers  and  everything  and
[19:57] it  was  like  you  literally  changed  the 
 way  that  you'd  speak  and  like  that 
 attitude  that  was
[20:02] that  you  were  holding  you you're 
 presenting 
 i  don't  think  it's  something  that  you
[20:07] would  be  so  aware  of 
 and  it  is  like  it  is  somewhat  of  a 
 commentary  i  do  see  this  with
[20:13] a  lot  of  people  and  especially  if 
 they've  had  similar  experiences  as  you 
 add 
 which  we  want  we  don't  need  to  go  into
[20:19] too  much  detail  but  like 
 a  lot  of  the  stuff  that  the  boys  who  are 
 watching  this  have  experienced  where
[20:24] you  know  you've  been  in  high  school  and 
 and  you've  had  like  some  shitty  friends 
 and  so  if  you  felt  somewhat  excluded
[20:29] when  you  were  younger 
 you  will  do  everything  it  takes  to  make 
 sure
[20:34] you're  around  a  pop  in  social  life  now 
 that  you're  accepted  amongst  other 
 people 
 and  that  that's  i  think  what  you
[20:40] portrayed  which  i  thought  was  your  best 
 trait  was  that  essentially  you  were 
 you  were  doing  what  it  took  to  be
[20:45] accepted  by  me  and  i  thought  that  was  an 
 awesome  trait  made  me  feel  awesome  that 
 oh  you  know  she's  changing  the  mind
[20:50] about  the  song  and  about  bigger  things 
 and  everything 
 and  then  i  would  see  you  do  that  with
[20:55] other  people 
 and  like  what
[21:04] it's  like  your  interest  changed  so  your 
 interest  was 
 next  to  me  it  was  like  a  simple  life  it
[21:11] was  very  similar  to  the  life  i'm  living 
 where  it was  like  dopamine  detox  you 
 barely  use  your  phone  you  barely  do  like
[21:16] any  of  the  bad 
 behaviors  or  anything  and  the  moment  you 
 step  away  from  me 
 you  want  to  go  to  nightclubs  you  want  to
[21:22] like  drink  and  and  get  into  like  the 
 instagram 
 but  hamza  the  thing  that  you  don't
[21:27] understand  is  i  didn't  want  to  go  to 
 nightclubs  like  if 
 if  a  friend  asked  me  that  oh  you  want  to
[21:32] go  out  this  weekend  like 
 i'd  either  say  yes  or  no  depending  on  if 
 i  wanted  to  it  wasn't  my  friends
[21:38] influencing  me  but 
 the  issue  was  i  wasn't  upset  with  your 
 control  because  i 
 so  desperately  wanted  to  go  to
[21:44] nightclubs  is  that  i  shouldn't  have  been 
 told  what  i  can  and  can't  do  in  the 
 first  place 
 i  probably  would  have  never  gone  to
[21:49] nightclubs  realistically  i  probably 
 would  have  gone 
 to  a  nightclub  without  you  maybe  once  a 
 year  maybe  maybe  twice  a  year  at  a  bush
[21:56] it  isn't  the  fact  that  i  really  really 
 desperately  wanted  to  do  these  things 
 it's  because  i  was  being  told  that  i
[22:01] couldn't 
 that  isn't  healthy  that  isn't  how  that 
 isn't  in  any 
 way  shape  or  form  that  is  not  healthy
[22:08] so  still  to  this  day  you  you  can 
 remember  a  time  where  i  said  you  cannot 
 do  this  that  if  you  do  this
[22:14] like  i  gave  you  an  ultimatum  if  you  do 
 this  i  will  break  up  with  you  because 
 that's  not  how  it  went 
 the  conversation  talking  about
[22:20] boundaries 
 i  had  broken  up  with  you  and  we  were 
 kind  of  like  speaking  again  so  we  kind 
 of  back  together  and  i  said  that
[22:26] i  didn't  want  a  girlfriend  who  would  be 
 going  into  that  environment
[22:31] that's  it's  not  exactly  yeah  controlling 
 with  liverpool  that's  a  different  thing 
 with  liverpool  that's  it  i  can
[22:37] understand  that  slightly  more  because 
 like  i  wasn't  going  to  go  into  a  party 
 environment  i  was  going  to  go
[22:42] live  with  people  who  like  to  go  out  and 
 party  sometimes  but  it wasn't  it  wasn't 
 going  to  be  a  party  environment  at  all
[22:48] like  i'm  going  to  be  a  master  student 
 they're  going  to  be  third  year  students 
 like 
 it's  not  going  to  be  like  a  first  year
[22:54] party  house 
 but  i  can't  remember  what  my  initial 
 point  was  with  that  no  that  was  a
[22:59] different  thing 
 but  nightclubs  is  a  whole  separate  thing 
 that  has  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with
[23:04] me  going  and  living  there 
 still  the  same  boundaries  it's  not
[23:10] you  expressed  your  boundaries  to  me  that 
 you  didn't  feel  comfortable  with 
 me  training  shirtless  in  in  the
[23:17] gymnastic  ring  spot 
 i  stopped  straight  away  because  i  saw
[23:22] this  for  the  long 
 long  term  for  example  like  i  wasn't 
 doing  any  of  the  parting  stuff  but  for 
 example  you  did  say  that
[23:27] i  think  like  yes  sound  like  this  is  my 
 baby  girl  this  is  the  girl  who
[23:32] i'm  gonna  have  kids  with  like  a  party  at 
 nightclub  is is 
 nothing  if  it  even  makes  you  feel  one
[23:38] percent  worried  or  anxious 
 it's  not  worth  it  because  i  plan  my  life 
 with  you
[23:43] and  to  see  you  like  i  guess  like  argue 
 against  this  and  to  see  your  family  kind 
 of  back  all  this  up
[23:48] it  was  just  showing  me  like  maybe  your 
 intentions  weren't  honest  maybe
[23:53] the  plans  that  we  made  with  the  stuff 
 that  you'd  say  about  your  connectivity 
 to  me  and 
 your  future  that  you  saw  with  me  i  can't
[24:00] i  can't  see  how  you'd  see  both  of  those 
 being  a  reality  to  still  keep  up 
 the  nightclub  environments  party  stuff
[24:09] they  keep  up  as  if  that's  a  lifestyle  i 
 have  i've  never  had  that  lifestyle 
 not  once  my  whole  life  the  most  i've
[24:16] probably  ever  been  out  is  like 
 twice  in  one  week
[24:24] i  cannot  i  can  i  can  completely 
 understand  where  you're  coming  from  and 
 saying  that
[24:29] like  i  can  understand  why  you  have  that 
 view  but  then  also 
 like  i'm  not  i'm  not  saying  i  was
[24:35] perfect  in  the  relationship  i  was  toxic 
 as  well  like  that's  something  i  should 
 have  said  that  earlier  but  i  was  toxic
[24:40] as  well 
 like  saying  to  you  oh  i  don't  want  you 
 to  train 
 here  because  it  makes  me  uncomfortable
[24:47] that's 
 toxic  me  saying  to  you  oh  what  was 
 what  was  i  what  my  other  like  boundary
[24:53] that  i  made  can  i 
 actually  can  i  be  honest  with  you  you 
 know  we  were  having  that  conversation 
 about  boundaries
[24:58] and  we  were  sat  in  the  car  and  you  were 
 like  oh  what's  your  boundaries 
 i  was  actually  thinking  in  my  head  i  was
[25:03] like  i  don't  i  can't  actually 
 think  of  any  boundaries  that  i  have
[25:08] which  like  i  should  have  boundaries  like 
 that's 
 my  own  like  fault  of  course  but  i  was 
 actually  thinking  in  my  head  like  do  i
[25:13] just  say  that  i  don't  have  any  because  i 
 don't 
 like  i'm  pretty  chill  with  most  things
[25:18] or  do  i  turn  around  and  say  oh  my 
 boundaries  are  you  don't  train  at  this 
 spot 
 you  don't  i  can't  what  the  other  one  was
[25:27] i um  i  i  can't  remember  what  the 
 boundary  asset  was  but  um 
 something  like  training  shirtless  or
[25:32] something  but  i  was  like  oh  do  i  just 
 use  this  as  a 
 chance  to  get  rid  of  all  the  things  that
[25:37] make  me  slightly  uncomfortable  because 
 if  that's  what  hamza's  doing  i  might  as 
 well  do  the  same  thing 
 but  i  would  have  never  if  you  hadn't
[25:43] like  said  to  me 
 oh  you  you  can't  do  this  you  can't  do 
 that  i  would  have  never
[25:49] turned  around  and  said  to  you  oh  you 
 can't  work  out  here  because  i  know  that 
 me  being  anxious  about  you  working  out
[25:54] with  that  spot  that's  like  a  valid 
 that's  a  valid  thing  to  be  worried  about 
 like  you  get  girls  there  like  you  did
[25:59] right  before  we  got  together  like  that's 
 a  very  valid  thing  for  me  to  be  anxious 
 about  but  i  would  never
[26:04] ever  ever  tell  you  what  you  kind  of 
 can't  do  just  because  i'm  anxious 
 like  i've  had  these  insecurities  and
[26:10] these  like  anxieties 
 way  before  you  and  they'll  exist  way 
 after  you 
 i  would  never  ever  ever  use  them  or  use
[26:17] attachment  styles  or  use 
 being  insecure  as  an  excuse  to  tell  you 
 what  you  can  and  can't  do  but  i  did
[26:22] because  that's  what  you  were  doing 
 and  i'll  put  my  hands  up  and  i'll  say 
 i'll  regret  that  like  i  behave  toxic  at 
 the  end
[26:27] but  that's  not  something  that  i  would 
 normally  do
[26:34] i'm  not  sure  you've  got  like  an 
 understanding  of 
 healthy  relationships  i'm  not  gonna  lie
[26:40] i  don't  think  you  have  an  understanding 
 of  healthy  relationships 
 can  i  well  have  you  been  in  a  healthy
[26:46] relationship  before 
 yeah  really  yeah
[26:54] well  from  what  you've  told  me  of  them 
 they  didn't  see  him  maybe  the  foot  would 
 you  mean  the  first  one
[26:59] yeah  oh  yeah  okay  i'll  give  you  that  to 
 be  fair 
 have  you  i  did  team  it  wasn't
[27:06] at  the  end  but  generally  it  was  very 
 healthy
[27:12] the  reason  why  i  say  that  that  i  don't 
 think  is  because 
 of  something  you  just  said  then  that  you
[27:19] call  yourself 
 toxic  and  honestly  that  it's  not  even 
 been  in  my  mind  at  all
[27:24] like  i  i  don't  think  i  don't  call  myself 
 toxic  but  i  behave  in  toxic  ways
[27:29] but  you  think  that  you 
 telling  me  something  that  made  you
[27:34] anxious  was  toxic 
 not  telling  you  but  telling  you  what  you 
 can  and  can't  do  because  of  it
[27:40] yes  without  telling  you  i  don't 
 understand  how  your  mind  goes  to  that 
 i'd  i'd 
 like  that  isn't  what  the  conversation
[27:47] was  like 
 your  mind  was  the  conversation  you  you 
 believed  that  when  we  had  that
[27:52] conversation  we  were  saying  this  is  what 
 you  can  and  can't  do 
 because  like  you  actually  think  that  you
[27:57] said  that  to  me  but  you  never  once  said 
 it 
 like  we  weren't  talking  to  each  other  in
[28:02] in  a  hostile 
 negative  way  i'm  sorry  yeah  deception 
 that  it  wasn't  not  saying  that 
 like  you  did  not  say  um  you  i  don't  want
[28:09] you  to  train  shirtless  you  can't  train 
 shirtless  and  i  did  not  say  i  don't  like 
 you  cannot  you  cannot  go  to  nightclubs
[28:14] or  anything  i'm  so  surprised  that  you 
 have  this  perception  of  that 
 conversation  because 
 it  was  literally  your  saying  what  would
[28:20] hurt  us  and  what  what  makes  us  feel 
 anxious  and  the  other  person  was  like 
 like  i  said  it  to  you  and  you  were  like
[28:25] oh  yeah  like  i  don't  even  like  going  to 
 night  club  so  if  it  makes  you  anxious 
 like  there's  no  worries  like  oh  and  you 
 literally  even  said  like  oh
[28:30] about  moving  like  you  plan  to  move 
 somewhere  and  you're  like  oh  no  like 
 if  it  makes  you  anxious  like  yeah  you're
[28:36] gonna  like  probably  decide  against  it 
 and  i  did  the  same  thing  for  you  when 
 you  said  like  about  me  training  in  the
[28:41] gym  ring  spot 
 you  didn't  say  like  no  i  don't  want  you 
 to  train  that  you  just  said  like  yeah  it 
 does  make  me  like  anxious  because
[28:47] you  you  got  a  girl  from  there  just 
 before  we  got  together  and 
 you  um  if  you  keep  training  there  it's
[28:52] like  you  know  that 
 girls  walk  past  and  they  talk  to  me  and 
 so  i  said  it  to  you  like  i  said  okay
[28:57] like  i'm  gonna  stop  training  the  not 
 once  did  either  of  us  actually  say 
 like  we  weren't  that  type  of  couple  i'm
[29:03] so  surprised  that  you  have  i  didn't  say 
 pudding  i'm  so  surprised  like  perception
[29:08] of  us  that  we  were 
 the  type  of  couple  who  who  said  you  can 
 do  this  and  you  cannot  do  this 
 it  was  more  that  we  were  saying  about
[29:13] our  own  personal  feelings  say 
 you  were  saying  that  it  would  make  you 
 feel  like  scared
[29:18] because  of  like  what  you  know  girls 
 could  walk  past  and  i  was  saying  yeah  it 
 could  make  me  feel  scared  if  you  went  to
[29:23] the  nightclub  because 
 of  the  experiences  i've  had  in 
 nightclubs
[29:28] like  neither  of  us  actually  said  to  each 
 other 
 oh  you  i  didn't  say  i can't  go  there  i
[29:34] didn't 
 yeah  neither  of  us  actually  physically 
 said  that  that's  not  what  i'm  saying  but 
 i'm  saying  you  said  to  me
[29:40] oh  if  you  went  if  you  went  to  a 
 nightclub  i'd  feel  too  anxious 
 so  i  couldn't  be  with  you  i  won't  be
[29:46] able  to  be  in  a  relationship  with  you 
 but 
 it  doesn't  matter  the  way  you  think 
 about  that  do  you  think  what  you  said
[29:55] how  is  that  manipulative  how  because 
 it's 
 saying  oh  if  you  go  and  spend  time  at
[30:01] this  place  with  your  friends 
 i'm  gonna  leave  you  they  should  never  be 
 like
[30:06] it  should  never  be  you  or  that 
 they  can  coexist  like
[30:13] so  if  someone  if  that  was  someone's 
 boundary 
 and  they  did  not  want  to  be  with  someone 
 who  was  going  into  that  environment  that
[30:19] they  weren't  comfortable  with 
 what  would  the  non-manipulative  way  that 
 this  person  should  express  it  because  i
[30:25] think  i  did  it  in  a  pretty  healthy  way
[30:32] i'm  not  saying  that  you  said  it  in  a 
 nasty 
 it's  coming  across  that  way  because  like
[30:38] we've  broken  up  like 
 you're  not  exactly  going  to  talk  about 
 things  in  the  nicest  way  but  i'm  not 
 saying  that  you  said  it  in  a  nasty  way
[30:44] you  said  it  exactly  like  that  if  you  if 
 you  went  to  a  nightclub  with  your  friend 
 i'd  feel  too  anxious  so  i  break  up  with
[30:49] you 
 that  is  what  you  said  correct 
 so  that  that  is  manipulative  it's  saying
[30:57] oh  if  you  don't  behave  in  a  way  that  i 
 that  i  specifically  want  you  to  if  you 
 don't  fit  this  cookie  cutter
[31:02] then  that's  it  and  i'm  not  when  i'm 
 talking  about  this  i'm  not  talking  about
[31:08] going  to  liverpool 
 i'm  talking  about  just  nightclubs 
 specifically  which  i  don't  know  why  i'm
[31:13] focusing  on  that  because  i  don't  even 
 like  them  anyway 
 but  i  literally  don't
[31:20] i'm  confused  the  issue  isn't 
 the  issue  isn't  oh  i  so  desperately  want
[31:26] to  go  to  nightclubs  so  i  so  desperately 
 want  to  go  out  and 
 be  around  loads  of  guys  and  just  be  with
[31:31] my  friends  and  never  spend  time  with  you 
 that  isn't  the  issue  the  issue  is  that 
 you  shouldn't  tell  someone  what  they  can
[31:36] and  can't  do 
 that's  the  bottom  line  it  isn't 
 it  doesn't  matter  what  it  is  i  agree
[31:43] with  that 
 and  that  i  don't  believe  that  i've  ever 
 i  ever 
 told  you  what  you  could  or  could  not  do
[31:49] and  that's  i  think 
 by  the  way  you've  like  we've  both  just 
 admitted  that  i  said  something  as
[31:54] very  similar  to  that  if  you  go  to  those 
 places  i'll  be  too  anxious 
 i'll  be  too  like  uncomfortable  with  it
[31:59] and  so  i  wouldn't  want  to  be  with  you 
 but  that  is  healthy  boundaries
[32:04] manipulation 
 toxicity  and  like  abusiveness  is  me 
 saying  no
[32:09] if  you  go  there  i  will  break  up  with  you 
 if  you  like  you  cannot  go  no  it's  not 
 even  that  even  that  is  like
[32:14] honestly  on  the  healthier  side  it's  it's 
 if  i  said  you  cannot  you're  not  allowed 
 to  go
[32:19] that's  manipulative  that's  abusive 
 that's  toxic  if  i  said  you  are  not 
 allowed  to  go 
 as  if  i  said  that  like  you  want  to  we're
[32:25] going  to  stay  together 
 but  you're  not  allowed  to  do  this  my 
 thing  was  okay  if  that's  what  you  want
[32:30] to  do 
 then  we're  not  compatible
[32:35] that's  healthy  that  is  not  manipulative 
 like 
 i  think  like  everyone  around  you  has
[32:41] kind  of  twisted  your  mind  to  think  that 
 what  the  some  healthy  parts  of  our 
 relationship
[32:47] just  because  it  kind  of  insults 
 the  people  who  have  been  giving  you
[32:52] advice  if  for  example  your  friends  go 
 out  to  these  clubs  or  for  example  your 
 mum  likes  to  drink 
 and  her  her  response  to  this  was
[33:00] oh  hamza  is  going  to  control  you  he'll 
 never  never  let  you  out  for  a  drink 
 like  and  she  got  really  really  like 
 angry  and  like  resentful  towards  me  when
[33:06] she  heard  about  me  saying  that  oh 
 like  we're  not  going  to  be  compatible  if 
 you  go  out  to  night  clubs
[33:11] they  were  personally  getting  offended  at 
 something  i  said  without  actually  taking 
 into  account  the  fact  that  you  didn't
[33:16] even  like  to  go 
 and  you  said  it's  like  10  times  in  this 
 goal  you  didn't  even  like  to  go  there  so 
 the  fact  that  if  you  are  going
[33:21] when  you  know  of  how  worried  that  would 
 make  me  feel  because  of  experiences  i've
[33:26] had  in  nightclubs  when 
 no  matter  how  much  you  want  to  say  it 
 you  you  do  like  you  were  able  to  see  it
[33:31] from  my  point  of  view  that 
 yeah  half  of  the  girls  i've  been  with 
 have  got  boyfriends  a  girl  saying  that
[33:36] she's  got  a  boyfriend 
 it  doesn't  stop  that  type  of  guy  and  it 
 happens  only  in  nightclubs
[33:41] and  so  like  the  mindset  i've  had  for 
 years  which  i  tell  the  boys  which  tell 
 everyone  is  that
[33:46] no  girl  when  she  enters  the  nightclub 
 has  a  boyfriend 
 it's  just  they'd  love  to  think  that  they
[33:52] do  they'd  love  to  say  like  oh  no 
 i'm  just  getting  ready  to  have  fun  with 
 the  girls  but  if  the  right  guy
[33:57] approaches  her  and  he  says  the  right 
 things 
 it  there  is  no  relationship  the  girls
[34:02] will  back 
 uh  back  her  up  if  the  boyfriend's  not 
 there  it  literally  takes  like  two 
 sentences  to  get  a  girl  to  like  drop  a
[34:07] relationship  for  the  right  guy 
 and  you  can  say  oh  no  but  i'm  different
[34:12] i'm  different  to  all  the  women  you've 
 ever  experienced  in  your  life 
 and  i  don't  think  that's  exactly  like  a
[34:18] fair  statement  to  say  but  you  could  say 
 it  but  either  way 
 having  empathy  for  from  my  experiences
[34:23] and  what  i've  what  i've  felt 
 and  the  fact  that  you  didn't  even  want 
 to  go  to  clubs  you  should  instantly  be
[34:28] saying  like  yeah 
 like  i'm  not  gonna  go  then  maybe  we'll 
 go  together  i  did  say  that
[34:33] did  i  not  say  that  to  you  but  then 
 you're  literally  a  couple  days  later 
 you're  like  oh  yeah 
 so  there's  a  there's  a  club  on  21st  of
[34:40] june  that  i'm  going  to  go  to  with  my 
 friend 
 no  no  that  wasn't  that  wasn't  what 
 happened
[34:45] we  were  on  facetime  and  we  were  talking 
 about  it  and  i  said 
 i've  completely  forgotten  how  it
[34:50] reminded  me  today  like  literally  like  a 
 month  ago  we  had  this  thing  booked  when 
 everything  was  meant  to  be  open
[34:55] and  i  was  like  would  i  be  able  to  go  and 
 he  said  no
[35:00] but  it  isn't  it  isn't  even  like  i  can 
 completely  like  i  agree  with  that  like 
 some  girls
[35:05] some  guys  like  a  lot  of  people  are 
 horrible  a  lot  of  people 
 are  like  untrustworthy  like  you  should
[35:10] not  be  in  relationships  but 
 if  i  for  one  second  ever  thought  that  if
[35:15] i  were  to  go  into  an  environment  where 
 arguably  yeah 
 cheating  is  much  easier  in  nightclubs  if
[35:20] i  ever  thought  that  if  i  were  to  go  into 
 an  environment 
 and  would  cheat  on  someone  i  won't  be  in 
 a  relationship  to  start  with
[35:27] like  the  you  always  would  use  the  term 
 of  like 
 bad  patches  it  doesn't  matter
[35:34] it  literally  doesn't  matter  what  did  you 
 say  at  the  end  then  because  there  was  a 
 point  i  was  going  to  make  i  forgot  what
[35:39] it  was
[35:44] well  they  didn't  want  to  go 
 no  it's  something  that  you  said  at  the
[35:49] end  i  can't  remember  what  it  was 
 um  that  you  weren't  being  like
[35:54] empathetic  to  how  i  felt  with  my 
 experiences 
 oh  yeah  um  i
[36:01] i  can  understand  why  you  disagree  with 
 that  because  of  obviously  everything  i'm 
 saying  now 
 but  i  just  want  to  like  reiterate  my
[36:08] issue  isn't  the  fact  that  like 
 you  said  oh  i  won't  feel  comfortable  if 
 you  went  to  nightclubs  like
[36:13] it's  not  about  nightclubs  it's  just  the 
 fact  that 
 you  were  saying  like  what  i  can't  do
[36:19] anyway  what  i  forgot  what  the 
 point  even  was  i  keep  going  off  on  these 
 tangents  and  forget  what  i'm  even  saying
[36:25] what  was  it  i'm  sorry
[36:31] um  oh  yeah  i wasn't  being  empathetic  um 
 [Music] 
 do  you  like  think  that  i  wasn't  being
[36:37] empathetic  yeah  you  weren't 
 why
[36:44] i  don't  think  you  had  any  level  of 
 empathy 
 in  our  relationship  i  think  you  were
[36:50] like 
 very  very  quick  to
[36:55] drop  your  attempts  at  trying  to  make  me 
 feel  better  if  you  made  me  feel  anxious 
 if  you  made  me  feel  worried 
 i  remember  there  was  a  couple  of  times
[37:01] when  we'd  be  on  a  call  and  and 
 literally  within  30  seconds  of  you 
 trying  to  make  me  feel  better  you  just
[37:06] kind  of  shrug  your  shoulders  and  say 
 well  i  don't  know  what  i  can  do  then  i 
 don't  know  what  else  i  can  say  to  you
[37:13] these  situations  would  never  happen  on 
 calls 
 they  wouldn't  exactly  happen  on  the  call
[37:18] but  we'd  be  talking  about  it  afterwards 
 though 
 i  don't  remember  anything  ever  happening
[37:23] like  that  in  on  the  call  but  i  remember 
 it  happened  in  person 
 and  yeah  i  should  have  been  more
[37:28] empathetic 
 100  but  i  wasn't  shrugging  my  shoulders 
 and  being  like  i
[37:33] don't  know  what  to  say  now  i'll  give  up 
 don't  know  what  to say  but  i  was 
 genuinely  saying  like 
 i  like  i  don't  know  how  to  be  like  in  a
[37:40] lot  of  situations  i  didn't  know  how  to 
 reassure  you  like  i  tried 
 what  i  thought  would  work  what  would 
 work  for  me
[37:46] and  it  wouldn't  work  and  that's  i  yeah  i 
 shouldn't  have  said  that  i  agree  like  i 
 didn't  behave  in  the  best  ways  in
[37:51] our  relationship  i  think  i  don't  think 
 it's  fair  to  say  that  i  wasn't 
 empathetic  i  think 
 you  have  this  assumption  of  me  that
[37:57] actually  really  hurts  that  you  have  this 
 assumption  of  me  because  i  remember  when 
 i  came  back  to  uni
[38:02] yeah  i  messed  up  and  i  did  that  whole 
 instagram  thing  which  i  shouldn't  have 
 done  like  i  looked  through 
 um  who  you  were  following  um
[38:09] which  i  shouldn't  have  done  but  i  like  i 
 hand  in  heart  can  say  like 
 subconsciously  yeah  i  was  doing  that  out
[38:14] of  insecurity  but  i 
 genuinely  wasn't  doing  out  of  insecurity 
 like  i  was  just  messing  about  with  my
[38:19] friend  and  i  can  understand  why  that 
 comes  across 
 stupid  because  it  was  stupid  i  didn't 
 think  about  it  at  the  time  and  i  think
[38:24] you  have  this  assumption  that  my  friends 
 are  always  like 
 oh  like  backing  me  and  hating  anyone
[38:29] else  like 
 that  i'm  with  but  after  i  after  i  went 
 and  told  harry  about  that  afterwards  and
[38:34] she  was  like  eve  you  shouldn't  have  done 
 that  but  that  was  really  messed  up  you 
 shouldn't  have  done  that  and  i  was  like 
 oh  god  i  didn't  even  think  of  it
[38:40] in  a  bad  way  because  i  wasn't  doing  it 
 in  a  bad  way 
 but  i  shouldn't  have  done  that  and  it's
[38:46] like  and  my  mom  called  me  out  as  well  my 
 mom  said  you  shouldn't  have  done  that 
 and  she  said  that  to  you  when  she  spoke 
 to  you  about  it  i'm  sure
[38:54] it  was  an  interesting  conversation  i  had 
 with  your  mum  which 
 it  the  reason  i'll  tell  you  now  like
[39:00] why  i  have  like  such  a  a  negative 
 perception  of  everything  where 
 right  now  i  don't  exactly  look  back  with
[39:06] any  kind  of  positivity 
 is  because  of  how  i  feel  like  everyone
[39:12] in  your  life  was  like  two-faced  to  me 
 where  they  your  mum's  calling  me  we  have 
 an  hour  conversation  she's  saying  that
[39:17] i've  changed  your  life  i've  changed  her 
 life  i've  changed  your  sister's  life 
 i've  been  such  a  good  positive  influence
[39:22] i'm  so  good  and  amazing  and  and  i  should 
 come  around  on  saturday  when  you're  not 
 even  there  like  i  should  come  around  and 
 spend  time  with  her  and
[39:27] the  family  and  everything  and  by 
 expressing  my  one  boundaries
[39:33] everyone  changed  their  their  opinions  of 
 me 
 and  like  we  will  get  into  the  video  as
[39:39] well 
 but  that  was  the  boundaries  wasn't  what 
 changed  it  was  the  boundaries  pad  with
[39:44] the  video 
 yeah  but  like  it  was  originally  the 
 boundary  like
[39:49] me  expressing  the  fact  that  i  didn't 
 want  like  to  feel  i  don't  want  to  be 
 with  a  girl  who  was  going  to  nightclubs
[39:54] was  what  started  her  sort  of  negativity 
 of  me  where 
 she  was  giving  you  like  the  mean  girl
[39:59] attitude  and  she  was  like  not  speaking 
 to  you  and  everything  and  saying  like 
 you  shouldn't  come  speak  to  me  and 
 everything  and  that's  when  she  started
[40:04] you  know  essentially  digging  up  dirt  on 
 me 
 and  yeah  we'll  give  the  boys
[40:11] if  she's  looking  through  all  my  old 
 videos  like  pretty  much  she  was  looking 
 for  something 
 she  um  she  didn't  look  through  it  what
[40:17] happened  was  she  had  a  conversation  with 
 her  friend  cat  and  laura's  mum  and  cat
[40:22] and  laura  had  seen  the  video  before  and 
 then  they  heard  what  happened  showed  the 
 video  to  them  and  then 
 they  showed  it  someone  showed  it  to  my
[40:28] mum  wasn't  my  mom  going  digging 
 it  was  found  because  of  my  friends
[40:33] i  don't  know  if  that's  true  that's  what 
 i  thought  the  day  because  that's  what  i 
 thought  had  happened
[40:38] this  wasn't  like  my  mum  found  out  about 
 the  manipulation  video 
 days  before  we  broke  up  but  we  like  we
[40:43] weren't  speaking  i  didn't  know 
 i  had  no  idea  about  this  i  didn't  find
[40:48] out  until  after  we  broke  up 
 the  um  the  video  got  sent  by  my  woman's 
 friend  because  my  friend
[40:53] showed  it  to  them  yeah  so  for  contacts 
 for  the  context  for  the 
 viewers  who  are  watching  so  eve's  like
[40:59] family  or  friends  they  found 
 an  old  video  of  mine  which  is  how  to 
 manipulate  people  using  psychology
[41:06] and  i  mean  i'll  link  the  video  in  the
[41:11] description  in  the  comments  i'd  like  to 
 hear  everyone's  opinion  of  it  you  can 
 see 
 like  we  can  send  hundreds  of  people
[41:16] there  and  see 
 still  to  this  day  i'm  surprised  that 
 that  video  has  been  taken  negatively
[41:22] because  you  watch  it  and  almost 
 instantly  i  say  oh  by  the  way  i'm 
 literally  using  the  word  manipulation
[41:28] for  views 
 what  we're  just  going  to  talk  about  is 
 how  healthy  people  interact 
 huh  you  don't  say  that  in  the  video  yes
[41:34] i  do 
 i'll  say  it  in  the  video  and  i  also  said 
 like  it's  like  the  first 
 sentence  in  the  description  yeah  it's  in
[41:41] the  description 
 yeah  and  i  say  like  manipulation  sounds 
 bad  but  like  it  sounds  like  a  horrible
[41:46] word  what  we're  actually  doing  is  just 
 positive  reinforcement  and  this  is  how 
 healthy  people  interact  with 
 if  someone  behaves  but  you'd  like  them
[41:52] to  then  you  spend  more  time  with  them 
 that's  like  it's  okay  it's  manipulative
[41:57] in  a  certain  way  but  at  this  point 
 it's  like  the  word  manipulation  needs  to 
 needs  to  have  its  negative
[42:02] label  removed  and  just  say  like  okay 
 that's  how  humans  interact  everything  at 
 that  point  is  manipulation  if
[42:07] if  that  is  what  what  you  think 
 manipulation  is  is  that
[42:13] someone  acts  in  a  way  that  you  like  it 
 so  you  like  them  more 
 now  healthy  people  do  this  automatically
[42:18] the  reason  why  i'm  making  these  videos 
 is  because 
 these  videos  are  not  for  healthy  guys 
 they're  for  guys  who  are  trying  to  be
[42:23] healthy  but  right  now  they're  unhealthy 
 all  of  their  lives  is  spent  on  the 
 computer  screen  so  they  need  to  be
[42:29] taught  this  stuff 
 your  family  who  saw  this  and  had  a  very 
 very  negative  hostile  resentful
[42:35] vibe  to  me  because  of  this  video  they 
 did  not  once  consider  the  fact  that  i'm 
 using
[42:40] youtube  as  a  business  to  help  people  who 
 are 
 help  a  specific  type  of  person  who's
[42:45] going  to  be  attracted  to  that  type  of 
 video  that's  why  i  want  that  video  is 
 like  one  of  the  highest  views  on 
 my  channel  that  instantly  got  like  2  000
[42:51] views  because  that's  what  these  guys 
 want  to  see  they  want  to  see  a  picture 
 of  a  girl  in  the  thumbnail  they  want  to 
 see  a  guy  talking  about  getting  girls
[42:58] and  you've  you've  seen  the 
 transformation  of  the  boys  who  watch  a 
 lot  of  my  videos  seeing  the 
 transformation  where 
 i  don't  do  really  that  stuff  anymore  i'm
[43:04] not  like  a  player  anymore 
 and  so  it's  not  exactly  a  reflection  of
[43:09] me 
 it's  a  reflection  of  the  guy  i'm  trying 
 to  to  attract 
 so  that  he  can  go  through  the  same
[43:14] journey  as  i  have 
 but  you  guys  saw  it  and  you  said  okay 
 this  is  hamza  hamza  is  manipulative
[43:20] he  is  controlling  and  he  also  said  to 
 eve  that  she  shouldn't  go  to  nightclubs 
 so  he's  controlling  his  manipulative  he
[43:25] can't  be  trusted  he's  grooming 
 my  granddaughter  and  she's  not  safe  with
[43:30] him  we  can't  allow  her  to  speak  to  him 
 and  so  we're  gonna  break  up  we're  gonna 
 break  them  up
[43:36] that  was  at  least  my  perception  of  the 
 breakup  would  you  agree  with  that 
 um  to  some  extent  yeah  to  a  big  extent
[43:45] yeah 
 because  you  have  to  understand  like 
 obviously  you're  saying
[43:50] um  this  isn't  like  you 
 isn't  a  representation  of  you  it's  a
[43:55] representation  of  what  you're  trying  to 
 sell  online 
 but  you're  saying  in  the  video  this  is 
 what  i  do  you're  using  me  as  an  example
[44:01] in  that  video 
 so  of  course  my  family  gonna  see  it  as  a
[44:06] game  when  they  like  they  don't  know 
 like  youtube  is  a  business  they  don't 
 know  that  you're  doing  it
[44:11] to  attract  these  guys  to  you  know  i  mean 
 to  build  your  business  essentially 
 they've  seen  it  as  oh  they  say  he's
[44:18] talking  about  eve 
 and  saying  how  he's  managed  to 
 manipulate  her  into  buying
[44:23] food  and  going  getting  drinks  and  giving 
 her  giving  like 
 him  her  ring  and  then  using  like  my  text
[44:30] messages  and  stuff 
 paired  with  the  fact  that  i  came  back 
 for  i  came  back  to  uni  for  six  days
[44:35] i  came  back  because  you  broke  up  with  me 
 and  then  i  moved  out  of 
 in  the  space  of  this  was  all  in  the
[44:40] space  of  three  days  dropped  out  of 
 moving  to  go  and  live  with  my  best 
 friend  in  liverpool 
 i  said  i  wasn't  like  obviously  told  them
[44:47] about  the  nightclubs  and  stuff 
 but  also  another  thing  that  i  forgot  to 
 mention  is  i  remember  saying  to  you  when
[44:52] we  were  having  this  conversation  in  the 
 car 
 like  when  we  were  talking  about  the 
 boundaries  like  it  wasn't  exactly  said
[44:57] like  oh  if  you  do 
 x  i  will  break  up  with  you  but  that  it 
 was  it 
 that  is  what  you  were  saying  whether  you
[45:02] said  it  that  in  that  exact  sentence  that 
 is  what  you  were  saying
[45:07] another  thing  was  i  remember  i  said  to 
 you  um 
 i  don't  know  if  you  remember  talking
[45:12] about  my  friend  daisy  who  lives  in 
 london 
 um  i  remember  i  said  to  you  oh  like  i
[45:17] barely  ever  see  her  like 
 would  it  be  like  just  like  speaking 
 hypothetically  like  sometime  in  the
[45:22] future  would  it  be  okay 
 for  me  to  go  and  visit  her  and  you  were 
 like  that  won't  make  me  feel  comf  that
[45:27] would  make  me  feel  anxious 
 so  no  i'd  probably  end  up  leaving
[45:35] your  perception  of  these  things  is 
 completely  off  when  you  said  that 
 i  told  you  that  i'd  feel  anxious  about
[45:41] of  course  i  would  that  was  it 
 i  didn't  one  say  oh  if  you  go  if  you  go 
 see  your  friend  then  i'm  gonna  like
[45:46] you  you  think  you've  been  convinced  that 
 i'm  manipulative  everyone  around  you  has 
 has  fed  this  into  you  you  saw  that  video
[45:52] yourself  be  like  months  before  everyone 
 else  and  you  literally  just  watched  it 
 with  me  as  if  it  was  nothing
[45:57] and  everyone  has  kind  of  like  maybe 
 kind  of  insulting  you  but  like  with  the
[46:02] shapeshifter  kind  of  personality  that 
 said  do  you  probably  do  have 
 you've  now  believed  this  stuff  and  so
[46:08] you've  gotten  a 
 far  far  negative  more  hostile  view  of 
 all  of  our  interactions  because  that  is
[46:13] not  how  it  went 
 whatsoever  you  mentioned  that  in  passing 
 and  i  said
[46:18] yeah  it  would  i  like  i  would  probably 
 feel  pretty  anxious  with  it  that  was  it 
 i  didn't  like  everything  just  stops 
 talking  i  was  like  no  no  if  you  do  that
[46:24] like  i'll  break  up  with  you 
 it  didn't  know  you  didn't  say  it  like  i 
 never  i  never  said  that  you  said  it  like
[46:29] oh  i'd  break  up  with  you  you  said  no  i 
 feel  so  anxious 
 yeah  but  that's  that's  which  in  my  my
[46:34] head  i  can't  remember  whether  you  said 
 i'd  leave  or  not  you  probably  didn't 
 need  to  be  fair 
 but  in  my  head  me  thinking  oh  he  said
[46:42] he'd  feel  anxious  if  i  went  to  a 
 nightclub  so  he  would  leave  me 
 so  i'm  thinking  in  my  head  oh  he  said  it
[46:47] means  that  he's  anxious  so  that  means 
 he's  going  to  leave  me 
 so  i  it's  not  like  a  fair  thought  though
[46:53] that's  not  like 
 you  can't  exactly  it's  not  but  that's 
 the  way  you  feel
[46:59] that's  the  way  you  made  me  feel  but 
 anyway  back  to  like  the  video 
 you  have  to  think  like  all  the  big
[47:05] changes  that  i 
 made  in  the  space  of  a  few  days  that 
 came  home  from  uni 
 um  said  about  liverpool
[47:12] um  and  then  my  family  saw  this  video 
 where  you're  saying  like 
 oh  like  women  buy  me  like  they  buy  me
[47:18] things  like  they  do  like  the  manual 
 labor  of 
 like  my  work  of  my  job  like  they  come
[47:24] and  see  me  like  and  all  this 
 of  course  they're  gonna  think  that 
 you're  doing  this  as  a  game  and  that
[47:29] this  is  all  so  big 
 but  i  don't  think  it  was  a  game  like  we 
 didn't  mean  to  end  up  in  a  relationship
[47:34] it  just  happened  like  i  know  for  a  fact 
 it  wasn't  a  game  i  don't  think  it  was  in 
 genuine  at  all
[47:39] i  feel  like  you  you  believe  that  i  think 
 it  was  in  genuine 
 is  that  true  no  so  why  did  you  ask  me  if
[47:45] i  was  manipulating  you  then 
 when  did  i  ask  you  if  you  manipulated  me
[47:50] when  your  family  had  an  intervention 
 with  you  and  then  i  facetimed  you 
 and  your  grandfather  all  um  answered  the
[47:56] call 
 and  your  whole  family  is  like  literally 
 swearing  at  me  shouting  across  the
[48:01] street  it doesn't  sweat 
 the  word  he  doesn't  swear  i  can  still 
 remember  like  see
[48:06] the  disrespectful  faces  of  the  people 
 who  had  literally  just  smiled  at  me  and 
 said  like  how  much  i've  transformed  your
[48:11] life 
 and  your  grandparents  got  calling  me  a 
 [ __ ]  your  grandma's  like  climbing  over 
 the  table  like  screeching  like  break  up
[48:17] with  them  you've  just  ended  none  of  this 
 happened 
 on  the  call  that  i  was  in  maybe  in  the 
 calls  that  you  and  my  granddad  had  when
[48:22] i  was  in  the  room  i 
 i  heard  that  you  were  just  sat  on  the 
 kitchen  table  because  then  he  turned  it 
 around  it  and
[48:28] it  was  you  and  it  was  like  we  went  from 
 just 
 me  and  you  versus  the  world  kind  of  vibe
[48:34] to  you  just 
 automatically  believe  in  what  they  had 
 said  where  i  smiled  and  i  said  to  you
[48:40] like  oh  hi 
 and  you  literally  just  started  like  you 
 went  aggressive  on  me  out  of  nowhere  i
[48:45] mean  you  were  good  literally  a  couple 
 hours  ago  and  you  went  aggressive  and 
 you're  like 
 this  isn't  a  time  to  smile  i'm  just  like 
 were  you  manipulating  me  like  were  you
[48:51] manipulating  me  i  wasn't 
 i  was  not  aggressive  i  was  literally  in 
 tears  i  could  be
[48:56] like  that  was  literally  like  like  i 
 can't  even  remember  a  lot  of 
 that  conversation  because  it's  just  like
[49:02] i  mean  you  saw  me 
 i  was  in  a  mess  but  when  i  was  sat  at 
 the  table  with  my  family
[49:07] when  all  that  was  happening  like  behind 
 the  scenes  when  you  didn't  see  the  calls 
 like  i'm  i  was  defending  you  to  them
[49:15] you  probably  won't  believe  that  because 
 of  everything  i've  said  in  this  but  i 
 was  literally  defending  you  i'm  going 
 in  this  video  because  yeah  the
[49:21] manipulation  video  that  is  how  normal 
 people  interact 
 it's  like  if  the  same  thing  had  happened
[49:26] with  that  text  conversation 
 and  it  was  the  other  way  around  i 
 wouldn't  have  replied  to  you  like 
 that  is  just  how  people  interact  but
[49:32] it's  the  way  you're  explaining  it  in  the 
 video 
 and  i'm  sat  there  and  i'm  saying  this  to 
 them  and  i'm  going  like  no  but  this
[49:37] isn't 
 like  this  is  just  how  people  act  like 
 this  is  how  people  are  in  dating  now 
 like  in  like  [ __ ]  2021.
[49:44] so  i  was  i  was  literally  sat  there 
 defending  you  at  that  table
[49:49] you  didn't  know  that  because  obviously 
 you  weren't  there  like  i  can't  blame  you 
 for  not  knowing  that 
 i  can't  blame  you  for  like  i've  always
[49:54] said  this  like  since  the  breakup  like 
 i  can't  blame  you  for  not  knowing  how  i 
 feel  because  i  never
[49:59] really  gave  you  that  chance 
 to  know  how  i  felt
[50:07] i  think  that  you  have  i  think  that  you 
 have  a  much  more  negative  perception  of
[50:12] what  my  perception  is 
 what  is  your  perception  if  you  have  if
[50:19] you  look  back 
 over  the  no  no  not  not  right  now  but 
 let's  say  over  the  last  week  or  so
[50:25] when  you  randomly  get  thoughts  of  me  in 
 the  relationship 
 what  kind  of  thoughts  are  they
[50:32] um 
 go  down  bad
[50:40] generally  like 
 i  it's  hard  to  put  into  words
[50:48] i  think  like  i  don't  believe  i  think 
 you're  a  bad  person 
 at  all  like  i  don't  think  that  like  you
[50:54] you  treated  me  very  well  in  our 
 relationship  like  i've 
 always  said  that  like  i've  listened  like 
 even  after  we've  broken  up  when  i've
[50:59] spoken  back  to  people  i've  said  like 
 i  i  can  say  he  did  treat  me  well  like  he
[51:04] did 
 but  i  just  think  that  you  have 
 i  think  in  in  terms  of  a  lot  of
[51:11] relationship  stuff  we  have  very 
 different  mindsets 
 um  yeah  agreed
[51:17] so  when  i  when  i  have  these  thoughts  i 
 get  up 
 like  i  get  upset  of  course  because  i'm
[51:23] upset  like  it  ended  like  this  because  i 
 like  we  did  end  because  of  like  your 
 boundaries
[51:29] on  my  part  um 
 but  i  do  like  i  do  have  a  lot  of
[51:34] reference 
 what  did  you  mean  by  what  you  just  said 
 then  we  ended  because  of  my  boundaries
[51:40] on  your  part 
 yeah  on  my  like  on  my  part  like  from  my
[51:46] view 
 on  my  like  reason  why  we  ended  because 
 it's  like  a  weird  breakup  like  we  never
[51:51] really  spoke  about  anything  it's  like 
 we  went  on  this  facetime  call  and  it's 
 like  i  can't  even  remember  like
[51:57] who  broke  up  with  who  but  like  we  both 
 knew  that  we  were  like  breaking  up  with 
 each  other 
 it  was  like  a  i  feel  like  it  was  a  very
[52:03] unmutual  thing 
 um  what  was  the  question  again
[52:10] our  our  perception  on  the  breakup
[52:17] yeah  mine  was  because 
 i  realized  like  after  seeing  the  like
[52:23] after  seeing  the  manipulation  video  in  a 
 different  light  because  obviously  i 
 when  i  saw  it  i  saw  it  like  i  was  like  i
[52:28] feel  like  what  the  [ __ ]  for  i  saw  it  in 
 a  more  positive  way  because  i  was 
 obviously  with  people  then  when  i  was 
 kind  of
[52:33] partially  taken  out  of  the  situation  and 
 saw  saw  it  from  a  different  light  and 
 then  paired  with  everything  else  i  was
[52:38] like  wait 
 but  there's  a  lot  of  um  there's  a lot  of 
 other  things 
 like  not  things  that  happened  but  things
[52:44] that  were  said  throughout  our 
 relationship  that 
 like  i  kind  of  blocked  out  at  the  time
[52:49] and  then  when  like  we've  broken  up  and 
 i'm  like  [ __ ]  wait  this  none  of  this  was 
 okay
[52:54] am  i  well  um 
 i'm  gonna  move  back  just  because  my 
 back's  hurting  from  saying  i'm  obviously
[53:12] sucks 
 so  i'm  just  getting  comfy
[53:18] um
[53:24] and  it's  just  like  a  few  things  that  you
[53:29] said 
 um  so  like
[53:35] like  throughout  our  relationship 
 obviously  you 
 said  like  my  insecurity
[53:42] is  your  responsibility  which  to  some 
 extent  it  is 
 um  but  then  you  also  said  things  that
[53:48] like 
 very  much  contradicted  that  so 
 i  remember  when  you  said  to  me  this
[53:55] wasn't  when  we  were  just  like  seeing 
 each  other  this  was  when  i  don't  think 
 we  were  in  a  relationship  at  this  point 
 but  i  think  this  is  when  we  both
[54:00] stopped  like  seeing  other  people  and 
 when  you  said  to  me  that  you  would 
 i  can't  even  remember  what  the  context
[54:06] it  was  said  in 
 um  but  i  remember  you  saying  that  you'd 
 have  sex  with  my  auntie
[54:13] and  i remember  you  saying  that  if  we 
 weren't  in  like 
 we  weren't  in  a  relationship  at  this
[54:18] point  but  we  weren't  not  in  a 
 relationship  i  can't  remember  like  when 
 we  were  like  exclusive  or  whatever  the
[54:23] hell  that  means 
 um  i  remember  that  really  upset  me  at 
 the  time  and  i  remember  thinking  like
[54:29] why  did  you  say  that  like  it  wasn't 
 exactly  necessary  and  also  another  thing
[54:35] when  you  would  say 
 that  your  love  is  conditional  and  that 
 all  it  would  take  is  a  conversation  with
[54:40] your  ex 
 for  you  to  get  feelings  with  them  again 
 um
[54:45] and  it's  like  yeah  like  it's  not  that 
 big  of  a  deal  to  say  things  like  that
[54:50] but  also  it's 
 you  saying  that  i  should  be  aware  of 
 your  insecurities  and
[54:55] i  was  very  i  can't  what  the  word  was 
 that  you  used  but  i  wasn't  empathetic
[55:00] towards  you  and  your  insecurities  in 
 terms  of  me  saying  that  it  wasn't 
 fair  for  you  to  say  that  you  would  break
[55:06] up  me  if  i  went  to  a  nightclub 
 but  then  you  played  on  my  insecurities
[55:13] i  think  it's  very  hypocritical  for  you 
 to  say  that  i  wasn't  empathetic  towards 
 you  when  you  literally  said  to  me  hamza
[55:19] that  you  would  have  sex  with  my  auntie 
 that  like  there's  no  context  for  that  to
[55:24] ever  come  up  in  conversation  and  the 
 next  and  then  the  next  time  my  auntie 
 came  over  you  went  and  gave  her  a  hug
[55:30] i  remember  you  turned  around  and  said  to 
 me  sorry  i'm  getting  upset
[55:36] um 
 yeah  and  you  you  gave  her  a  hug
[55:44] i  mean  i remember  you  turned  around  and 
 said  to  me  afterwards  i  can't  remember 
 exactly  what  you  said  but  you  were  like
[55:49] oh  you're  getting  anxious  i  was  like  no 
 no  i  wasn't  before  but  i  am  now
[55:54] and  you  said  about  the  auntie  thing  you 
 were  like  oh  like  if  we  were  still 
 seeing  each  other  like  i'd  try  and  make
[55:59] it  happen  like  i  could  see  it  happening 
 like  who  says  that  to  my  girlfriend
[56:09] i'm  sorry  i  don't  want  to  get  upset  but
[56:14] i'm  sorry  but  you  can't  sit  here  and  say 
 that  i  was  unsympathetic  towards  you  and
[56:20] your  insecurities  when  you  were  saying 
 things  like  that  to  me
[56:27] that  was  disrespectful  i'm  sorry  for 
 saying  that
[56:35] thanks  for  apologizing
[57:10] um  but  yeah 
 i  just  feel  like  you  did  really  play  on
[57:16] my  insecurities 
 i  felt  i've  constantly  felt  um
[57:21] scared  that  you  were  gonna  leave  me  like 
 all  the  time 
 especially  towards  the  end  the  last  few
[57:28] weeks  like 
 i  mean  obviously  you  saw  me  like  i  was 
 just  crying  all  the  time  like  i  wasn't 
 doing  well  at  all
[57:35] um  and  it's  like 
 i  don't  know  i  was  just  i  just  felt  like
[57:41] i  was  walking  on  eggshells  a  lot  of  the 
 time 
 because  i  was  just  so  so  scared  of  you
[57:47] leaving  me 
 [Music] 
 and  i  think  you  did  play  on  that  because
[57:52] you  knew  that 
 it's  not  the  right  word  to  use  it  wasn't 
 play  it  wasn't
[57:58] yeah  maybe  that's  not  the  right  one  yeah 
 because  that's  like  assuming  that  i  was 
 playing  a  game  or  something  that  i
[58:03] wasn't  being  hurt  through  all  this  time 
 and  that  wasn't  like 
 feeling  the  yeah  the  pace  like  we
[58:08] connected  and  we  we  got  so  attached  that 
 you  experiencing  pain  was  painful  for  me
[58:14] and  i  need  you  to  know  that  because  i 
 think  you  have  a  perception  of  like
[58:19] i  wanted  you  to  like  feel  bad  for  this 
 stuff  anytime  you  felt  bad  like  i  felt 
 bad  too
[58:24] and  that  was  the  issue  that  we  both  just 
 would  get  into  this  like 
 very  very  negative  hurtful  cycle
[58:30] and 
 i  agree  with  you  like  honestly  almost
[58:37] not  not  throughout  the  relationship  but 
 at  least  for  like  the  second  half  of  it 
 i  was  i  kept  on  said
[58:42] like  telling  you  like  i  was  on  the  line 
 of  like  not  wanting  to  be  with  you 
 and  looking  back  at  it  now  i  realize
[58:48] it's  because  we  should  have 
 we  were  never  compatible  for  a  long-term 
 relationship  like  we  were  very  very
[58:54] compatible  in  terms  of 
 like  friends  with  benefit  in  terms  of 
 like  just  connecting  with  each  other  but
[58:59] i  think  that 
 the  foundation  a  friend  that  i  spoke  to
[59:04] said  it  perfectly  for  me  like  i  had  this 
 feeling  throughout  our  entire 
 relationship  but  i  wasn't  able  to  put  it
[59:09] into  words  up  until  he  said  it  and  he 
 said  that 
 what  you've  built  is  is  great  but  the 
 foundation  was  always  weak
[59:16] and  that's  what  it  was  it  was  you  as  a 
 person  was  not 
 the  type  of  person  that  not  the  type  of
[59:22] girl  that  i  wanted  to  have  as  my 
 girlfriend 
 that  when  we  were  just  kind  of  casually 
 seeing  each  other  when  you  tell  me  about
[59:28] like  stuff  that  you  were  doing 
 in  my  mind  i'd  just  be  like  silently 
 judging  you  thinking  like  yes
[59:33] don't  get  feelings  for  hamza  don't  be 
 dick  don't  don't  get  feelings  for  this 
 girl  but  she's  a  thoughtless  say  the 
 exact  same  thing  about  you
[59:43] friends  with  benefits  potential  we  were 
 like  what  is  that  and  i  think 
 getting  feelings  for  each  other  just
[59:49] kind  of  like  i  would  and  i  can't  even 
 say  that  because  honestly  like  the  best 
 part  came  once  we  got  feelings  for  each
[59:54] other  because  we  connected  so  well  and 
 we  had 
 like  such  a  great  strong  connection  that 
 i'd  never  felt  before
[60:00] that  was  the  best  part  and  then  of 
 course  it  kind  of 
 slingshotted  to  the  worst  part  that  now
[60:05] because  we've  got  that  great  connection 
 we've  got  so  much  to  lose  and  now  we're 
 just  like 
 at  least  i  was  like  so  anxious  of  losing
[60:12] it
[60:17] through  our  time  together  especially 
 like  before  we  got  into  a  relationship  i 
 was  thinking  that
[60:23] like  i  i  didn't  plan  it  but  i  saw  the 
 the  trajectory  of  our  time  together  that
[60:28] it  would  be  that  we'd  be  somewhat  just 
 doing  the  same  thing  for  a  while  just 
 being  would  stay  single  but  we'd  keep
[60:33] seeing  each  other  every  now  and  then 
 and  then  once  you  finish  uni  and  you 
 matured  a  bit  then  we'd  probably  get
[60:39] into  a  relationship  then  when  you  were 
 like 
 22  23  and  i  think  that  would  have  been
[60:44] like  the  better  case  scenario  because 
 i  did  i  did  my  growing  up  over  the  last 
 year  and
[60:50] to  see  someone  like  who  does  like 
 normal  people  stuff  is  weird  for  me
[60:56] because  i'm  not  normal  anymore 
 like  i'm  very  abnormal  and  i  think 
 although  we  were  compatible  in  terms  of
[61:02] like 
 our  sort  of  companionship  we  weren't 
 compatible  in  terms  of  our  the  habits
[61:08] and  the  people  we  surround  ourselves 
 with 
 and  that  always  used  to  just  scare  me
[61:13] and 
 to  think  that  in  my  opinion  almost 
 everyone  around  you  was  like  a  negative
[61:18] influence 
 even  though  it's  hard  for  me  to  explain 
 why  that  was
[61:24] i  think  maybe  i've  got  the  ego  the  bias 
 to  think  that  good  influence  on  you 
 would  be  the  things  that  i  was  doing
[61:29] which  was  like  getting  you  away  from 
 like  the  bad  habits 
 whereas  we  could  argue  that  the  bad 
 habit  is  like  good  for  you  if  you  wanted
[61:35] to  do  them 
 but  objectively  we  could  say  that
[61:40] for  example  going  on  social  media  going 
 out  drinking  is  like  somewhat  of  a  bad 
 habit  whereas 
 objectively  everyone  agrees  like
[61:46] meditating  and  getting  our  self 
 improvement  is  a  good  habit 
 and  so  i  felt  like  it  was  me  against 
 your  entire  social  circle  it  was  me
[61:52] trying  like  and  i  was  winning  i'm  not 
 gonna  lie 
 that  was  the  thing  it  was  like  everyone 
 was  pulling  you  away  from  the
[61:58] like  i  was  pulling  you  away  from  the  bad 
 habits 
 and  like  your  mum  said  this  you've  said
[62:04] this  a lot  of  times 
 even  in  this  course  that  i  was  a  very 
 positive  influence  on  you
[62:10] and  i  don't  feel  the  same 
 about  you  on  me  like  i  wrote  this  on
[62:17] like  one  of  the  love  letters  that  like 
 the  last  love  letter  that  i  sent  you 
 where  you  and  your  family  got  better
[62:24] because  of  me  but  i  only  got  worse 
 like  i  i  took  that  sacrifice  to  be  with 
 you
[62:29] i  didn't  voice  like  how  did  you  how  did 
 you  get  worse
[62:36] like  the  [ __ ]  we  were  going  through  was 
 a  lot  of  it  was  unnecessary 
 and  a  lot  of  it  if  for  example
[62:43] like  bad  guy  good  guy  but  if  you  had  to 
 say  that  if  like  you  were  a  bad  guy  in  a 
 situation
[62:48] it  was  like  just  because  you'd 
 emotionally  react  to  it  and  start  crying 
 because  i  was  upset  with  you  and  i  you 
 know  i'm  not  replying  to  for  example
[62:53] because  i  don't  want  to  speak  to  you 
 right  now  i've  lost  attraction  in  you 
 and  stuff 
 then  you're  crying  and  okay  i'm  the  bad
[62:58] guy  now  now  i've 
 made  you  cry  now  that's  how  it  is  i 
 don't  think  that  i  don't  think  that's
[63:03] true 
 like  if  i 
 like  if  i  start  crying  that's  just  like
[63:09] you  know  i'm  emotional  i  just  react  to 
 things  like  that  but  that  isn't  me 
 automatically  becoming
[63:14] the  person  who's  in  the  right  but  what's 
 this  like  i  can't 
 like  what's  a  situation  where  that  kind
[63:20] of  thing  happened 
 where  you  were  like  oh  i'm  not  speaking 
 to  you
[63:27] it  was  a  few  like
[63:32] but  when  you  went  to  your  uni  house  and 
 then 
 the  social  media  ship  that  was  like  the
[63:38] first  big  one  and  then  after  that  it  was 
 like 
 yeah  i  remember  being  like  a  week  or  two
[63:44] where 
 it  was  just  kind  of  like  negativity 
 almost  every  single  like  we'd  be  like 
 fully  in  love  with  each  other  we're 
 spending  all  day  on  facetime  like
[63:50] literally  24  7  like  you're  watching  me 
 have  a  poop  like 
 seven  times  a  day  and  then  the  next  day
[63:55] we're  like 
 i'm  back  to  thinking  like  this  is  this
[64:00] is  horrible  for  me  like  this 
 like  my  life  was  actually  better  before 
 this  like  before  we  actually  got  serious
[64:06] like 
 yeah  i  used  to  think  that  as  well  i  used
[64:11] to 
 because  like  we  obviously  weren't  in  a 
 relationship  for  a  very  long  time  we 
 were  literally  in  a  relationship  for
[64:17] like 
 how  long  was  it  i  think  it  was  that  long
[64:22] i  think 
 it was  like  three  weeks  literally
[64:35] [Laughter]
[64:52] yeah  three  weeks 
 i  felt  longer  than  that  like  i  felt  like
[64:58] it's  weird  like  we  we  got 
 so  attached  to  each  other  so  quickly  i
[65:04] think  we  already  had  like 
 a  good  level  of  connection  and  a  good 
 compatible  personality
[65:10] but  the  moment  that  we  actually  became 
 exclusive  and 
 we  just  kind  of  suddenly  fell  in  love
[65:15] with  each  other  and  we  became  like  so  so 
 attached  to  each  other  that 
 our  relationship  was  just  very  very
[65:22] like  it  was  just  like  very  intense  very 
 quickly  yeah
[65:27] that  was  it  it  went  from  like  nothing  to 
 like 
 100  and  then  zero  yeah
[65:34] space
[65:40] it  was  longer  than  that  because  we  were 
 exclusive  for  a  while  before  we  were 
 in  a  relationship  like  six  weeks
[65:47] well  it would  take  most  couples 
 literally  like  their  three  to  five  year 
 relationship  where  they  have  the 
 honeymoon  period  and  then  they  start
[65:52] like  hating  each  other  and  then  they 
 eventually  break  up 
 we  did  that  in  like  six  weeks  so  we  beat 
 the  high  school
[65:57] good  job
[66:05] oh  that's  it  yeah  it's  [ __ ] 
 oh  is  it  there's  a  video  that  i  haven't
[66:11] released 
 that  it  was  on  like  the  list  for  the 
 video  editor  sam  to  edit
[66:17] and  then  i  just  took  it  off  because  i  we 
 watched  it  and  just  made  me  really  sad 
 where
[66:22] it  was  titled  like  why  you  should  care 
 and  i  was  saying  like  oh  you  know 
 jeffrey  doesn't  doesn't  want  to  care
[66:28] like  he  searches  for  advice  on  how  not 
 to  care  what  people  think 
 and  i  said  that  oh  no  like  caring  what 
 other  people  think  is  actually  like
[66:34] the  big  alpha  male  trait  because  the 
 alpha  male  of  like  a  tribe 
 cares  the  most  and  i  said  that  caring
[66:40] has  got  me  this  business 
 and  you  know  i  went  into  like  detail  i 
 went  into  like  unfiltered  talk  and  i  was
[66:46] talking  about  our  relationship  and 
 that's  the  one  where  i  went  like  really 
 into  detail  with  a  bunch  of  our  stuff
[66:51] this  was  like  before  we  broke  up  so  we 
 were  still  like  fully  together  and  i 
 keep  calling  you  like 
 baby  girl  and  everything  i'm  talking
[66:57] about  like 
 the  secret  handshake  and  like  connecting
[67:02] with  you  forgot  about  that
[67:18] you  still  love  me 
 you  still  love  me
[67:25] i  don't  know  um 
 you  still  love  me
[67:37] it's  like 
 it's  the  i'm  not  in  love  with  you
[67:44] it's  almost  like  i'm  not  allowing  myself 
 to  because  it  would  it 
 it's  not  practical  it's  not  like
[67:50] you  know  why  would  you  like  turn  it  on 
 right  now  it  feels  like  something  that 
 we  could  allow  it  to  turn  on
[67:58] yeah  but  we're  just  not  letting  it  yeah 
 it's  kind  of  like  it's  almost  like
[68:04] binary 
 and  then  it's  like  a  percentage  where
[68:09] it's  like  you'll  meet  people 
 eventually  it  clicks  and  it's  like  okay 
 this  is  the  person  that  you  love
[68:14] and  then  from  that  point  it's  like  the 
 percentage  and  right  now  it's  like  we're 
 already  in  in  the  love 
 i  don't  think  you  can  ever  come  out  of
[68:19] that  binary  like  we're  on  the  one  like 
 we're  on 
 love  but  it's  like  been  dialed  down  to
[68:25] like  one  percent  where  we  can't  exactly 
 feel  it  because 
 our  mind  and  our  body  our  chakras  or
[68:31] something  has  has 
 dialed  it  down  so  we  don't  get  hurt 
 like  it  doesn't  meet  the  circumstances
[68:37] of  our  lives  right  now  so  it's  just  not 
 yeah  this  is  what  i  know  it  hurt  you  but
[68:42] this  is  what  i  meant  when  i  said  that 
 like  one  conversation  with  like  my  ex 
 could  turn  like  i  could  i  could  be  in
[68:48] love  with 
 them  again  i  could  be  yeah  i  could  be  in 
 love  because 
 the  right  conversation  would  you  and
[68:54] both  of  us  would  be  back  at  100 
 and  i  think  yeah
[68:59] i  think  that's  true  and  so  when  i  when  i 
 said  that  about  my  ex  i  didn't  mean  so
[69:04] obviously  like  scare  you 
 or  or  make  you  feel  negative  is  more
[69:09] that 
 i  was  still  trying  to  discover  my  own 
 meaning  and  my  own  version  of  love
[69:16] yeah  of  course  and  i  think  i  don't  want 
 to  lie  to  you 
 yeah  when  i'm  saying  these  things  like
[69:22] um 
 like  what  i  said  before  about  like  oh 
 when  you  said  your  love  is
[69:27] conditional  and  think  about  your  ex  um 
 i  didn't  i  don't  think  that  apart  from
[69:32] the  anti  thing  because  i  can't  really 
 think  that  you  would  say  that  without 
 thinking  it  wouldn't  hurt  me  especially
[69:38] like  you  know  my  insecurities  were  at 
 that  point  we'd  like  been  through  all 
 this  like  we  were  pretty  much  together
[69:43] um  but  i  don't  think  you  said  these 
 things  to  hurt  me  i  didn't  believe  that
[69:48] you  did  any  of  these  things  to  hurt  me 
 like  when  you  were  controlling  i  don't
[69:53] think  you  were  doing  that  to  hurt  me 
 i  i  know  i  don't  think  i  know  that  you
[69:58] were  doing  it  because 
 you  wanted  what  was  best  for  me  but 
 you  can't  you  can't  take  what  you  think
[70:05] is  best  for  someone 
 and  tell  them  what  they  can  and  can't  do 
 based  on  that  like  look  i'll  give  you  an
[70:10] example  okay  so 
 my  ex-boyfriend  um  obviously  we  were
[70:15] together  when  i  went  to  uni 
 um  he  was  cheated  on  she  probably
[70:20] shouldn't  be  saying  this 
 but  he  was  cheated  on  um  by  his  ex
[70:25] and  they  she  is  i  think  she's  still  in  a 
 relationship  with  that  guy  now
[70:31] and  when  i  was  going  to  uni  obviously 
 tom  was  anxious  about  me  going  and  being
[70:37] a  part  of  your  lifestyle 
 in  first  year  of  course  you're  going  to 
 think  that  when  i'm  in  first  year 
 um  i  didn't  get  into  the  uni  that  i
[70:43] wanted  to  so  i  went  through  clearing 
 i  got  into  leeds  beckett  sheffield
[70:48] hallam  and  then  i  got  into  york 
 so  obviously  york's  the  best  out  of  all 
 of  them  it's  like  a  brussels  group  uni
[70:54] and  i  really  i  really  really  didn't  want 
 to  come  to  york  but  he  was  like  pushing 
 me  and  saying  like 
 come  on  like  you  should  go  to  york  like
[71:00] this  is  the  best  uni  like  for  your 
 degree  which  it  was  in  the  country  at 
 the  time
[71:05] um  but  even  though  he  was  going  to  be 
 anxious  about  that  i  was  going  to  be 
 putting  myself 
 in  a  situation  where  he  was  going  to  be
[71:11] anxious  he  pushed  me 
 into  doing  it  he  pushed  me  into  going  to 
 the  uni  that  was  the  furthest  away  from
[71:17] him 
 because  he  wanted  what  was  best  for  me 
 you  don't  tell  people  what  they  can  and
[71:22] can't  do  because  you  think  that's  what's 
 best  for  them 
 you  feel  like  going  to  nightclubs  is  the
[71:27] best  for  you 
 no  of  course  not
[71:32] [Music] 
 so  but  it's  not  nightclubs  isn't  a  lot
[71:37] the  point  you  just  made  is  that  he  did 
 something  good  which  was  he 
 he  he  was  anxious  and  he  pushed  you  to
[71:42] do  something  good  like  something 
 positive 
 i  mean  like  moving  to  liverpool  i'm
[71:47] talking  about  liverpool  in  this 
 situation  what  would  you  say  that  that's 
 that's  positive  um
[71:54] what  pushing  me  into  living  there  or  not 
 not  living  there  i  think  there's
[72:02] positives  and  negatives  for  both
[72:16] i  don't  think  that  you  ever  did  any  of 
 these  things  to  hurt  me  like 
 i  do  think  he  played  games  but  i  don't
[72:21] think  it  was  a  big  game  to  like  make 
 me  fall  in  love  with  you  that  wasn't  the
[72:26] plan 
 i  mean  like  we  were  seeing  each  other 
 for  like  eight  months  before  we  even  got 
 into  a  relationship
[72:31] hmm  what  games  do  you  think  i  played
[72:37] i  think  you  just  kind  of  i  don't  know  if 
 you  did  it  subconsciously  or  not  like  i
[72:42] don't  think  you  played  games  actively  if 
 that  makes  sense 
 um  i  just  think  you  kind  of  tried  to
[72:48] like  keep  me  on  my  toes 
 and  stuff  i  feel  like  you  knew  how 
 scared  i  was  for  you  to  leave  me
[72:55] and  you  did  play  on  that  by  constantly 
 saying  like  literally  every  day  you'd  be 
 like  oh  i'm  online  and
[73:00] i  remember  when  i  was  here  and  we  were 
 talking  about  you  coming  to  visit 
 me  and  one  day  on  facetime  you'd  be  like
[73:06] oh  like  don't  not  let  me  come  like  make 
 sure  i  come  like  we're  gonna  have  such  a 
 nice  time  and  all  this
[73:11] and  then  you  were  like  oh  like  look  at 
 train  times  and  i'll  book  it  tonight  and 
 then  we  got  onto  a  facetime  and  you're
[73:16] like  oh  i  don't  know 
 back  coast  the  land  again  and  it  was 
 like  this  like  every  single  day  i  was  in 
 york  but 
 one  day  you're  like  oh  yeah  i'll
[73:21] definitely  come  like  don't  let  me  not 
 come 
 and  the  next  day  you're  like  i'm  too 
 close  like  oh  no  i  can't  even  see  us
[73:26] being  together  on  the  19th  which  i  mean 
 you're  right  so  well  done  but  um
[73:34] yeah  i  think  it's  just 
 i  don't  know  if  you  i  think  it  was
[73:39] probably  subconscious  but  i  do  think 
 that  you 
 were  aware  of  how  scared  i  was  for  you 
 to  leave  me  and  i  think  you  did
[73:45] you  did  play  on  it  because  you  can't  you 
 can't  have  not  been 
 when  you  were  saying  the  things  that  you
[73:50] were  saying  and  i  was  feeling  the  things 
 that  i  was  feeling 
 it  wasn't
[73:57] when  i  was  saying  that  stuff  it  was 
 because  we  we  had  a  very  very  honest  and
[74:02] and  open  relationship  we  didn't  hide 
 because  we  had  done  saying  this  to  each
[74:07] other  that  these  were  like  the 
 uncomfortable  conversations  that  most 
 people  would  just  keep  to  themselves  if 
 they  had  this  thought  of  like  oh
[74:13] i  don't  really  feel  so  confident  in  our 
 relationship  and  stuff  that  they'd  keep 
 it  to  themselves  and  then  they'd  kind  of 
 stay  together  for  a  longer  period  of
[74:18] time  but 
 it'd  be  unideal  we  never  did  that  like  i
[74:23] we  both  made  it  like  such  a  such  a  big 
 intention  to  like  just 
 fully  say  what  was  on  our  mind  that  was
[74:29] me  saying  it  wasn't  me  saying  it  and 
 like  oh 
 i  bet  this  is  gonna  hurt  her  but  this  is 
 gonna  make  her  anxious  because  i  didn't
[74:34] want  that  effect 
 but  it  was  more  so  me  saying  it  because 
 i  was  hoping  that  you'd  just  be  able  to
[74:39] kind  of  say  the  right  things  to  me  and 
 say  that  you  know  you  cared  about  me  you 
 wanted  to  be  with  me  and  that  you  could 
 see  us  together  that
[74:44] would  warm  me  up  to  to  it  as  well 
 but  this  is  what  i  mean  this  is  when  i
[74:49] said  like  i  didn't  think  you  had 
 any  empathy  because  i  would  say  this  a 
 lot  of  the  times  and  i  don't  remember  a
[74:54] single  time  that  i  would  say 
 something  like  this  like  essentially  i 
 was  saying  i  don't  feel  confident  in  our
[74:59] relationship  right  now  because 
 of  whatever  i  don't  remember  a  single 
 time  where  you  were  able  to  like
[75:04] or  you  even  put  in  an  okay  amount  of 
 effort 
 to  change  my  mind  whereas  the  times  you
[75:11] never  really 
 said  something  like  this  but  i  could 
 imagine  if  you  did  i'd  be  like  all  over 
 you  i'd  be  like
[75:16] telling  you  just  so  much  stuff  about  our 
 plans  together  and  i  get  your  mind  off 
 that  and  i'd  get  you  like  feeling 
 confident
[75:22] i  would  say  those  things  to  you
[75:27] i  will  always  try  to  reassure  you  i  feel 
 like  you're  painting  this  as  if  i  was 
 just  like 
 oh  you  feel  insecure  like  but  don't  need
[75:34] to  do  about  it 
 but  that  was  never  the  case  at  all  i  got 
 so  upset  over  your  like
[75:39] that  i  i  would  always  feel  i  felt 
 insecure  a  lot  of  the  time
[75:44] the  end  of  our  relationship  but  i  like 
 we  were  so  sensitive  to  each  other's 
 emotions  like  you  said  it  before
[75:49] you're  like  if  you  felt  insecure  i'd 
 feel  insecure  but 
 you  felt  insecure  so  like  so  much  of  the
[75:54] time  towards  the  end  and 
 maybe  it's  because  i  was  here  and  you 
 were  at  home
[75:59] um  i  mean  yeah  that  was  definitely  the 
 reason  but
[76:04] coming  out  like  the um  and  i  think 
 that's  why  one  we  had  distance  between
[76:09] us 
 and  yeah  this  is 
 i  mean  it's  hard  for  everyone  but
[76:14] obviously  at  least  for  me  like 
 distance  is  like  it  kills  the  there  is
[76:19] no  relationship  with  distance  in  my 
 opinion  like 
 for  me  other  people  can  say  oh  you  know
[76:24] they're  fine  with  it  they  can  do  long 
 distance  they  can  be  away  from  each 
 other  but  for  me  it's  like 
 my  relationship  is  literally  physically
[76:30] being  around  each  other  like  24  7. 
 and  maybe  maybe  it's  not  healthy  right 
 that's  me  i  can't  expect  that  all  the
[76:35] time 
 yeah  i  don't  think  that  is  healthy
[76:42] somebody  both  unhealthy  because  honestly 
 that's  what  you  wanted 
 yeah  i  know
[76:51] yeah  i'm  not  saying  that  i  was  i  was 
 perfect  like  neither  of  us  were  we  both 
 made  mistakes
[76:57] we  both  have  a  lot  to  learn  from 
 i  know  that  i  definitely  do  i  know  that
[77:02] you  definitely  do  whether  you 
 take  it  and  learn  from  it  i  don't  know 
 that's  completely  your  choice  but
[77:13] what  do  you  think  your  learning  lessons 
 are
[77:18] um  or  what  do  you  think  mine  should  be 
 that's  great  and  then  i'll  tell  you  what 
 i  think  you  you  should  be
[77:25] um  you  go  first 
 i  was  going  to  think  of  him  as  you  were
[77:30] talking  i  was  going  to  think  about  it
[77:35] give  me  a  second  i'm  really  firstly  done 
 let  me  read  my  notes
[77:42] what  was  the  question  again  so  what 
 something  we  should  both  learn  you've
[77:48] got  a  short  term  memory  loss  recently 
 right 
 i  do  have  short-term  memory  loss
[77:53] i  have  a  really  bad
[78:01] because  you  can't  even  remember  who's 
 your  question 
 i  was  thinking  of  a  different  question 
 but  enough  i  want  to ask  that  one
[78:08] go  on  my  heart's  like  beating  fast  no 
 i'm  not  asking  it  i  was  like 
 no  please  you  can't  say  that  and  they're
[78:13] not  asking  no 
 come  on  have  you  started  dating  anyone
[78:18] else
[78:24] not  dating  anyone  else  yeah
[78:29] i  think  you  moved  on  very  quick 
 i  was  surprised  to  see  that
[78:35] um  don't  need  to  be  honest  with  you 
 i  was  very  upset  for  the  first  week
[78:42] i  was  like  literally  a  mess  like  i 
 couldn't  be  on  my  own  i  literally  wasn't 
 on  my  own  for  a  whole  week
[78:47] um  and  then  obviously  i  had  my 
 dissertation  to  write  oh  yeah 
 like  literally  we  broke  up  and  my
[78:53] dissertation  was  due  like  two  weeks 
 afterwards  and  i  hadn't  started  writing 
 it  i  was  like  oh  my  god  like  what  was  my 
 lifestyle
[78:59] um  so  i  think  i  kind  of  suppressed  it 
 um
[79:04] [Music] 
 yeah  for  all  that  time  and  then  when  i
[79:09] submitted  my  dissertation  it  like  kind 
 of  hit  me 
 all  over  again  as  if  it  just  happened  so
[79:15] yeah  didn't  move  on  quick  what  makes  you 
 think  that  i  moved  on  quickly  i  remember
[79:22] i  started 
 being  a  little  social  media  [ __ ]  and  i 
 was
[79:27] um  like  i  just  kept  on  going  on  your 
 page  i  was  like  i  know  the  advice  i  give
[79:33] that  advice  to  everyone  like 
 don't  you  know  block  her  don't  go  on  a 
 page  don't  do  anything  but  it  was  like
[79:38] automatically  when  we  were  messaging 
 each  other  on  instagram 
 i'd  do  it  and  then  i'd  see  your  follower 
 can't  go  up  and  i was  thinking  okay  she
[79:44] hasn't  obviously  met  these  guys  in 
 person  so 
 within  a  day  of  breaking  up  for  a  couple 
 days  like  she's  back  on
[79:49] the  dating  apps  and  that  made  me  like  i 
 didn't  i  didn't  get  dating  apps  until
[79:54] like  maybe  two  or  three  weeks  after  we 
 broke  up 
 and  i  don't  even  use  them  i  downloaded 
 them  but  i  don't  use  them
[79:59] i'm  not  sure  about  that  because  unless 
 you  just  randomly 
 like  followed  a  couple  of  guys  who  are
[80:05] your  type  because  i  sorry  and  i  was  like 
 oh  like 
 okay  like  she  moved  on  quick  where  i
[80:10] can't  remember  who  i  felt 
 i  remember  i  followed  joe  back  after  we 
 broke  up
[80:15] because  obviously  he's  my  friend 
 so  i  followed  him  back  but  i  can't
[80:20] remember  who  else  i  followed  but  it  was 
 never 
 like  that  but  i  mean  i  was  doing  the 
 exact  same  thing  as  you  said
[80:27] and  i  saw  your  follower  can't  go  up  yeah 
 but  not  my  voice
[80:32] i  didn't  really  like  how  much  did  mine 
 go  up  by
[80:38] um  i  think  it's  almost  like  four  like  i 
 i  don't  know  why  i'm  pretending  because 
 i  know  exactly  the  numbers
[80:49] [Laughter]
[80:55] i  mean  it  was  an  easy  number  to  remember 
 in  it  and  you're  on  like 
 just  under  600  like  i  haven't  actually
[81:00] looked  through  it  recently 
 well  you  were  on  like  1-1-1  because  i
[81:05] remember  you  were  on  112 
 and  then  you  went  down  to  1-1-1  i 
 remember  thinking  has  he  done  that  on
[81:10] purpose  so  i'm  like 
 angel  number  nah  i  didn't  even  think  of 
 that
[81:18] but  yeah  no  um 
 [Music]
[81:24] when  when 
 was  the  last  time  that  you  did  that  what
[81:31] social  media  stuck 
 so  recently  as  i've  been  messaging  you
[81:36] for  the  podcast  i'd  go 
 i've  clicked  on  your  name  but  i  haven't
[81:41] clicked  on  your  follower  account 
 so  i  i  don't  know  if  i  was  expecting  to
[81:46] see  like 
 a  picture  of  you  like  a  second  or 
 something
[81:53] but  i  was  i  don't  know  like  yeah  like 
 i  looked  through  your  follow  account  i
[81:59] think  probably 
 probably  like  five  ten  times  over  the
[82:04] couple  of  days  after  we  broke  up 
 and  then  after  a  certain  amount  of  time 
 i  think  by  the  time  like  because  i 
 blocked  you  for  a  little  bit
[82:10] i  think  by  that  point  then  i  just 
 stopped  looking  and  i  was  like 
 yeah  because  to  be  honest  you  you 
 started  grinding  for  the  dissertation  i
[82:17] literally  started  grinding  for  the 
 business 
 because  it  was  like  at  this  point  i  was 
 putting  in  like
[82:23] eight  hours  of  deep  work  like 
 unimaginable  levels  of  deep  work  and 
 [ __ ] 
 and  so  i  literally  i  went  celibate  i
[82:29] went  like  you  literally  made  me  like 
 asexual  like 
 i'm  not  even  interested  anymore  like  i 
 don't  even  need  women  i've  reached  a
[82:35] higher  level  where  i  just 
 levitate  and  i'm  in  monk  mode  now
[82:40] [Laughter] 
 how  long  can  we  celebrate
[82:48] probably  a  high  school  mate  um 
 it's  probably  a  high  school  now
[82:55] have  you  seen  anyone  since  we  broke  up
[83:00] i  met  one  woman  but  i  didn't  exactly 
 like
[83:06] dude  that  was  just  like  two  days  ago  but 
 i  didn't  exactly  do  anything  with  her 
 it's  like  kissed  and  other  than  that
[83:11] like  just  kept  to  myself 
 like  i  was  the  usual  stuff  out  like  what
[83:17] my  mind 
 wanted  me  to  do  was  to  get  on  the  app 
 city  sap  and  start  like  sleeping  with
[83:22] girls  again 
 and  i  just  got  a  feeling  of  like  nah
[83:27] like 
 i'm  for  this  time  like  i'm  not  purposely 
 gonna  go  and  like  rebound  and  like
[83:32] do  that  [ __ ]  i'm  just  i'm  actually  going 
 to  accept  the  feeling  of  like
[83:37] the  disattachment  and  like  the  breakup 
 feeling  without  trying  to  cover  it  with
[83:42] someone  new  so  i've  literally  just  kept 
 to  myself 
 apart  from  meeting  this  one  girl  nothing
[83:49] i've  literally  done  the  exact  same  like 
 i  just  kind  of
[83:54] like  after  the  breakup  like  obviously 
 straight  away  you're  like  oh  not 
 straight  away  but  like  after  a  bit  of 
 time  you're  like  oh
[83:59] i'm  gonna  get  back  on  dating  outside  i'm 
 just  gonna  see  loads  of  people  and  it's 
 not  even  gonna 
 like  think  about  him  i'm  just  gonna
[84:04] distract  myself  about  so  many  people  but 
 i  just  like  i  downloaded  the  dating  apps
[84:09] and  like 
 i  just  i  just  don't  reply  to  people 
 like  i  just  never  ever ever  reply  to
[84:16] people  i  just  don't  i  just  don't  have 
 interest 
 honestly  i  just  don't  have  an  interest 
 in  it  like  so  i'm  kind  of  the  same  like
[84:22] kind  of  turned  asexual  i  guess  um 
 and  was  just  not
[84:29] even  interested  at  all  and  i  mean  i'm 
 still  not 
 yeah  yeah  we're  both  still  in  love  with
[84:36] each  other 
 we're  both  still  in  love  with  each  other
[84:41] do  you  think  i  think  at  least  for  me 
 it's  like 
 i've  not  wanted  to
[84:48] i've  wanted  to  view  everything  more 
 negatively  so  that  it  hurts  less
[84:54] but  yeah  me  too 
 judging  off  how  like  our  actions  have 
 been  and  how
[85:01] with  it  like  it's  just  it's  becoming  so 
 clear  to  me 
 because  i  don't  think  that  me  and  you
[85:08] even  like 
 broke  up  like  we  we  have  broken  up  but  i 
 don't  think  that  i  broke  up  with  you  or
[85:13] you  broke  up  with  me  i  think 
 it  was  just  a  weird  situation  where  your 
 family  broke  up  with  us
[85:20] because  if  for  example  that  didn't 
 happen  you  wouldn't  have  broken  up  with 
 me  just  then  even  if  you  had  it  in  mind
[85:25] like  oh  you  know  the  manipulation  video 
 or  the  boundaries  or  whatever  you 
 wouldn't  have 
 and  i  wouldn't  have  either  like  we  would
[85:30] have  literally  died  together
[85:35] [Laughter] 
 you  would  have  got  to  find  where  you
[85:40] swallowed  the  key 
 i  locked  myself  inside  of  you  neither  of
[85:46] us  leave
[85:55] doesn't  make  you  sad  when  you  think 
 about  it
[86:00] like  i'll  be  completely  honest  the  only 
 thoughts  i've  had 
 have  been  like  resentful  ones  not  even
[86:05] like 
 hostile  ones  not  not  sad  ones  and  not 
 positive  ones  i  think
[86:10] my  mind  just  keeps  generating  reasons  to 
 be  like 
 mad  it's  like  my  like  before  i  came  onto
[86:18] this  call  i  was  like  thinking  like 
 let  me  write  down  all  these  points  why 
 he's  a  dick
[86:24] but  i  [ __ ]  hate  him 
 but  it's  like  like  i  remember  i  was
[86:29] speaking  to  my  friends  about  they're 
 like  oh  like 
 i  don't  want  you  to  go  on  thinking  it's 
 going  to  be  like  a  nice  conversation
[86:35] i  was  like  oh  no  it  probably  won't  be 
 but  like  i  wouldn't  say  it's  been  like  a 
 necessarily  not  nice  conversation  like  i
[86:41] think  we  both  feel  very  respectful  to 
 each  other 
 and  i  think  like  when  it's  like  when  the
[86:47] person  becomes  not  a  person  anymore 
 they  just  become  like  an  image  in  your 
 head
[86:53] that's  what  you  became  for  me  yeah 
 that's  a  very  very  good  because  i
[86:58] i  feel  like  the  same  way  but  i  can't 
 exactly  describe  it 
 but  it's
[87:07] i  honestly  can't  even  describe  it  how  i 
 feel  towards  you 
 because  i  said  this  to  you  last  time  it
[87:14] was  like 
 huh  is  it  good  or  bad
[87:20] up  until  this  call  it  was  like  100  bad 
 not  like  horrible  horrible  but  like  just
[87:25] every  now  and  then  i'd  be  brushing  my 
 teeth  like  that  [ __ ]  [ __ ]
[87:30] just
[87:35] but  i  think  now  that  we've  spoke 
 and  especially  because  we  haven't  been
[87:40] like  hostile  with  you  i  mean  you 
 probably  did  start  a little  bit  hostile 
 like  oh  yeah  do  you  have  manipulative
[87:48] [Music]
[87:53] [Laughter] 
 journal  still  been  using  this  one
[88:07] hi  literally  straight  after  we  broke  up 
 the  relationship  journal 
 the  attachment  book  anything  that
[88:13] reminded  me  of  you  literally 
 throw  into  the  back  of  the  wardrobe  i 
 couldn't  look  at  it  i  couldn't  meditate
[88:18] for  weeks  couldn't  journal  for  weeks 
 i've  only  just  been  able  to  listen  to 
 some  of  our  songs
[88:23] only  just  but 
 what  songs  like  what  are  like  proper
[88:28] like  trigger  songs  for  you 
 i  wonder  if  they're  the  same  red  stripe
[88:33] rapid  z 
 yeah  yeah  i  haven't  listened  to  because
[88:38] as  soon  as  we  broke  up  i  went  on 
 we  had  like  a  joint  playlist  i  went  on 
 that  and  just  like  removed  myself  from
[88:43] it 
 because  i  knew  that  it would  be  like  so 
 hurtful  i  removed  you  from  it 
 no  i  left  from  it  oh  you  might  have  like
[88:51] i  i  might  have  actually  just  like  taken 
 off  the  playlist  off  my  spotify  but  you 
 probably  like  saw  my  account  on  there
[88:56] you  probably 
 removed  me  like  that  but  i  like  stopped 
 i  removed  you  often
[89:01] yeah  so  i  couldn't  moved  you  up  and  i 
 added  you  back  on 
 so  you're  back  on  it  just  because  he
[89:06] wants  to  add  anymore
[89:18] [ __ ]  stuff
[89:27] what  are  the  songs
[89:32] um  the  late  night  vibe  i  don't  know  the 
 exact  names  of  them  but  there  was  like 
 you  know  the  female  artists  a  bunch  of
[89:38] them  like 
 warm  pants  obviously
[89:44] i  don't  even  listen  to  warm  pants  oh  my 
 god  i'm  not  gonna  be  able  to  listen  to 
 that 
 and  i  was  like  i  actually  changed  it  i
[89:49] was  like  no  i'm  good
[89:59] [Laughter]
[90:05] which  ones  is  it  for  you  um
[90:10] 24k  that's  a  big  one  which  one  is  that
[90:15] [Music] 
 um
[90:28] i  can  think  of  one  that  would  be  but  i'm 
 never  going  to  listen  to  ever  again 
 that  fallen  for  you  one  oh  yeah
[90:35] no  i'm  good  i'm  i've  been  listening  to 
 that  but  yeah  i've  never  listened  to 
 that  ever  again
[90:40] because  we  actually  thought  that  that 
 was  like  our  song  didn't  we 
 yeah  it  was  it  wasn't  looking  that's
[90:47] another  one  i've  not  even  listened  to 
 that  one  i  won't  be  able  to
[90:52] because  that  was  another  one  that  we 
 said  was  literally  us 
 in  a  song
[91:00] oh
[91:06] i  think  that's  the  thing  that  was 
 pissing  me  off  the  most  about  the 
 breakup
[91:11] like  not  being  able  to  listen  to  music 
 like  i  literally  didn't  listen  to  music 
 for  like  weeks
[91:20] i'm  actually  like  i've  been  avoiding  it 
 thinking  like  oh  you  know  make  me  think 
 about  her  but  now  i'm  like
[91:26] yeah  maybe  think  about  [ __ ]  like  i 
 want  this  song  to  come  on  now  because 
 i  was  for  the  first  time  yesterday
[91:32] instead  of  just  listening  to  drill  or 
 like  an  audio  book 
 i  was  coming  home  from  kickboxing  and  i
[91:37] went  through  i  usually  like  don't  ever 
 do  this  but  like
[91:42] i  went  off  the  the  drill  playlist  and  i 
 went  to  the  chill  rap  one 
 and  i  scrolled  on  that  out  i  haven't 
 listened  to  that  because  that's  the  one
[91:48] which  we  originally  started  listening  to 
 when  we  first  started  like 
 seeing  each  other  where  it  was  like  come
[91:53] through  and  chill  and  everything 
 burnt  fires  when  exchange  came  on
[91:59] and  i  was  i  was  still  making  the  noises 
 by  myself  and  i was  just  imagining  you 
 like 
 looking  at  me  weird  when  i  was  doing  the
[92:05] ad-libs 
 that's  so  weird  i  think  the  exact  same 
 thing  when  that  song  comes
[92:15] i  think  songs  like  that  like  exchange 
 like  i've  listened  to  that  a  few  times 
 since  we  broke  up  and  i  did  think  of
[92:20] like  that  moment  but  i  think  because  i 
 listened 
 i  think  once  i  listened  to  before  you
[92:25] i  thought  they're  okay  yeah 
 yeah  agreed  like  the  start  of  that
[92:33] i  remember  it  being  like  it  would  make 
 me  think 
 but  then  i've  listened  to  that  song  for
[92:39] like 
 like  that  was  like  one  of  my  go-to  songs 
 anyway  and  so  it  was  just  kind  of  like 
 it  was  reminding  me  of  like  all  the
[92:44] stuff  was  like  being  back  in  manchester 
 and  everything  so  it  was 
 it's  like  an  emotional  song  for  me  in
[92:49] general  but  the  ones  with  you 
 specifically  are  like  the  ones  that 
 they're  the  playlists  we  made  and  that
[92:55] whole  playlist 
 yeah  like  we've  got  like  four  playlists 
 like  that  can't  even  like
[93:00] look  on  spotify  anymore  after  like  click 
 on  the  the  drill  playlist  like  that  like 
 not  look  at  anything  else  you  would
[93:07] listen  to  the  journaling  playlist 
 anymore  yeah 
 dude  did  that  not  make  you  sad  to  start
[93:12] with 
 it  gets  me  in  my  feelings  it  gets  me 
 like  deep  thoughts
[93:18] because  i've  always  uh
[93:27] it's  hard  to  say  because  it'd  be 
 somewhat  in  general  like  i  don't  get  an 
 overwhelming  sense  of  like
[93:33] thinking  about  you  but  at  the  same  time 
 like
[93:39] i've  i  think  i've  only  journal  like  i've 
 joined  about  some 
 some  of  the  stuff  i've  pretty  much  only
[93:44] journaled  about  you  since  like  the  last 
 month  or  so  because  it's  been  like  the 
 thing  on  my  mind 
 journal  about  maybe  like  two  three  other
[93:50] stuff  that's  about  it 
 and  so  have  you  journaled  me  much  since 
 we  broke  up
[93:55] did  i  not  just  say  that  research  yeah 
 but  much 
 yeah  but  you  said  you  could  have  only
[94:00] journaled  three  times  if  you  broke  up 
 yeah  um
[94:08] we  broke  up  by  like  the  start  of  may 
 i think  it's  starting  may  [ __ ]  it's
[94:13] actually  it  was  the  12th  of  may 
 yeah  april
[94:19] so  this  was  28th  of  april  10  things  i'm 
 grateful  about  you  okay  let's  not  read 
 that
[94:24] so  yeah  let's  not  read  that  one  7th  of 
 may
[94:29] um  this  is  me  talking  about 
 social  media  and  everything  8th  of  may
[94:36] 12th  may  it  happened  i  think  11th  of  may 
 was  like  the  last  time  we 
 we  spoke  and  this  was  when  i  wrote  like
[94:42] we  were  on  facetime  when  i  wrote  like  a 
 letter  to  you  while  you  were 
 talking  on  facetime  and  i  was  saying
[94:48] you've  got  to  stop  indulging  in  your 
 emotions  baby 
 you've  been  practicing  mindfulness  and
[94:53] gratitude  for  months 
 and  then  the  next  one  is  just  we  broke
[94:58] up 
 and  then  20
[95:04] how  many  we  got  26  reasons  why  like 
 you  were  trash
[95:24] [Laughter]
[95:31] 18th  of  may  i  got  like  i  wasn't  even 
 joking  before  you  know 
 debate  in  celibacy
[95:38] i  hope  for  like  whilst  i  was
[95:50] no  i'm  not  gonna  read  this  why
[95:58] there's  some  emotional  stuff  on  this 
 a  letter  to  future  hamza
[96:05] no  matter  what  your  connection  with  her 
 do  not  forget  about 
 her  found  it  do  not  forget  about  the
[96:10] foundation  which  your  relationship  is 
 built  upon
[96:16] i  think  that's  like  the  main  thing  like 
 no  matter  how  much  we  get  on 
 no  matter  how  like  compatible  we  are
[96:23] like  we  have  different  values  in  terms 
 of  relationships  so  it would  never  work
[96:29] bad  yeah  i  agreed 
 i  just  think  like  everything  is  a  life
[96:36] lesson  like  everyone 
 come  like  comes  into  your  life  to  teach 
 you  a  lesson  like
[96:41] good  things  bad  things  like  like  after 
 we 
 broke  up  i  literally  just  wanted  to  have
[96:46] a  [ __ ]  brain  shock  therapy  and  have 
 my  memory  wiped  into 
 you  like  completely  i  didn't  want  to 
 know  who  you  were  i  didn't  want  to
[96:52] like  anything  i  just  completely  wanted 
 to  be  like  rid  of  you  but  now  that  i'm 
 like
[96:57] over  it  not  like  i'm  not  fully  over  it 
 i'm  not  gonna  lie  like 
 i'm  not  even  nearly  there  i  don't  think
[97:05] um  you're  not  over  it 
 no
[97:12] boy  you  used  to  love  me
[97:21] [Laughter]
[97:26] all  right  boys  100  likes  on  the  podcast 
 i  mean  if  we'll  get  back  together
[97:32] smash  that  like  button  guys  rate  comment 
 and  subscribe
[97:43] i  just  yeah  reckon  that's  because  of 
 closure 
 or  just  in  general  like  yeah
[97:51] definitely  that's  why  i've  done  this 
 that's  why  i've  agreed  to  do  it 
 because  obviously  like  when  we  broke  up
[97:58] you  asked  to  meet  up 
 and  i  said  no  because  i  just
[98:03] i  just  needed  to  like  like  like  i  said  i 
 wanted  to  forget  that  you  existed  so  i
[98:08] just  needed  to  like 
 and  it's  like  i  don't  think  you 
 understand  like
[98:13] i  think  you  seem  to  think  that  because  i 
 was  quite  like
[98:18] like  quite  not  ignorant  but  like  i 
 wasn't  really  willing  to  like  have  a
[98:23] conversation  with  you  after  we  broke  up 
 like  at  all  or  i  think  that  you
[98:29] and  i  would  do  the  same  if  it  was  like 
 rolls  reverse  i'd  like 
 assume  that  that  means  that  like  oh  the
[98:34] other  person's  moved  on  like  it's  fine 
 but  it  was  just  it  was  just  too  painful 
 it  was  just  way  too  painful
[98:40] so  that's  why  i  was  when  we  broke  up  i 
 was  like  no  like 
 i  can't  meet  up  with  him  like  i  can't
[98:45] even  have  a  face  time  with  him  i  was 
 like 
 like  we've  broken  up  like  we've  had  a 
 few  days  of  no  contact  i  was  like
[98:50] i  can't  go  back  to  that  now  but  then 
 like  obviously  over  time  i've  realized 
 like
[98:55] i  do  need  that  closure  and  i've  been 
 trying  to  figure  out  how  to  say  what  i 
 like  needed  to  say  to  you
[99:00] because  obviously  you  wrote  me  that 
 letter  and  i  said  that  i'd  let  you  know 
 how  i  felt  and  then  like 
 a  month  later  still  haven't  said
[99:06] anything  um 
 so  and  then  i  was  still  trying  to  figure
[99:12] out  how  to  tell  you  how  i  felt  and  then 
 you  asked  me  to  do  this  so  i  was  like
[99:18] let  me  let  me  just  jump  on  this  real 
 quick  and  just 
 really  yeah  um
[99:26] me  too  did  it  hurt  you  when  i  was  like 
 hesitant  to  talk  to  you  afterwards
[99:33] no  not  at  all  actually  because  really 
 yeah  i  actually  did  understand  and  i
[99:38] didn't  really  view  it 
 because  by  this  point  i  had  stopped  like 
 checking  on  instagram  i  was
[99:43] just  back  to  in  the  business  instantly 
 productivity  went  so  business  was 
 growing  and  everything  and  so  i  was  just
[99:48] busy  and  i  was 
 i  just  i  honestly  at  this  point  i  went 
 into  like  this  monk  mode  period  where  i
[99:53] just  went  like  celibate  i  didn't  even 
 want  to  think  about  girls  for  a  bit 
 of  it  like  yeah  so  i  didn't  even  view  it
[100:00] negatively  at  all  i  figured  it  was 
 your  way  of  like  coping  with  it  and  yeah
[100:06] i'll  be  honest  after  the 
 when  i  sent  you  like  a  long  message  we 
 were  like  we  weren't  going  to  meet  in
[100:11] person  so  i  wrote  the  letter  and  i  just 
 sent  you  like  a  three-page  letter  and 
 recorded  it  all  on  voice  note
[100:16] literally  the  moment  i  said  that  it 
 wasn't  three  pages  it  was  like
[100:25] the  moment  i  sense  it  i  was  like  that 
 was  my  closure  honestly 
 it  kind  of  felt  like  i  didn't  exactly
[100:30] need  to  to  hear  back  from  you 
 because  i  needed  to  say  my  piece  and
[100:36] i  knew  that  hearing  your  piece  would  be 
 like 
 for  you  not  for  me  yeah  so  i  got  mine
[100:42] and  i  was  like 
 i  just  dipped  after  that  yeah  i was 
 literally
[100:47] i  think  that's  why  i  found  it  hard  to 
 move  on  because  i  haven't
[100:52] ever  like  given  myself  that  yeah  that's 
 honestly  that's  what  it  was  for  it  was
[100:57] like  me  saying  it  helped  me  and  i  think 
 if  you  said  it  would  have  helped  you  it 
 might  have  like  worsened  it  for  me
[101:03] you  know  hearing  how  like  you  felt  and 
 you  if  you  said  anything  bad  or  if  you 
 said  even  good  stuff  about  me  would  have
[101:08] like 
 emotionally  affected  me  whereas  it  just 
 feels  relieving  to  like
[101:13] say  what  needs  to  be  said  and  so  i'm 
 very  very  glad  that  i  just  wrote  that 
 massive  letter  sent  it  over  to  you
[101:18] because 
 straight  after  that  i  just  started  like 
 clearly  like  haven't  fully  moved  on  or
[101:23] anything  i  don't  think  either  of  us  have 
 but  at  least 
 it  was  like  some  sort  of  closure
[101:29] yeah  it  was  at  least  like  close  the 
 chapter  in  it 
 yeah  of  course  i  think  that's  why  i
[101:35] struggled  because  i  haven't  had  that 
 i  mean  that's  my  own  fault  i  just  i 
 couldn't  have  met  up  with  you  like
[101:42] i  just  couldn't 
 i  wanted  to  more  than  anything
[101:50] come  to  meet  me  and  start  packing  the 
 [Laughter]
[101:58] blankets 
 [Laughter]
[102:09] um  yeah  i'm  gonna  just  look  over  this 
 and  see  because  i'm  gonna  be  really
[102:16] annoyed  at  myself  if  i  haven't  said 
 anything  that  i 
 want  to  say  um
[102:23] yeah  sorry  to  take  it  from  like  a 
 positive  note  to  back  to  a  negative  from 
 a  negative
[102:28] i  think  like  the  day  that  we  broke  up  i 
 saw  a  very  different  side  to  you 
 that  i've  never  seen  before  like  i
[102:35] understand 
 like  i  can  understand  why  you  were  like 
 laughing  and  smiling  and  i  don't  think  i
[102:40] was  aggressive  towards  you  on  that 
 facetime  call 
 i  think  like  i  wouldn't  be  surprised  if
[102:46] it  came  across  that  way  because 
 obviously  it's  like  my  whole  family  were 
 like  kicking  off  at  you  you're  gonna
[102:51] think  that  i  was  being  aggressive  but  i 
 wasn't  being  aggressive  at  all  and  when 
 you  were  smiling
[102:56] i  remember  i  literally  said  to  you 
 exactly  like  this  like  this  isn't  a 
 laughing  situation  hamza  like  this  is 
 horrible
[103:01] and  i  think  that  like  that  did  hurt  me 
 that  you  were  smiling  because
[103:06] to  me  it  seemed  as  though  it  didn't 
 matter  to  you 
 like  if  it  was  rolls  reverse  and  say  i
[103:11] was  in  that  situation 
 where  your  family  were  like  really  upset 
 with  me
[103:16] i  wouldn't  be  sat  there  smiling  no 
 matter  how  awkward  i  felt  i'd  literally 
 be  in  tears  like  please
[103:21] let  me  explain  and  obviously  i  didn't 
 hear  the  conversation  between  you  my 
 grandad  so  i  don't  know  what  was  said
[103:26] but  um 
 yeah  it  just  kind  of  hurt  me  to  see  that 
 you  were  smiling  because  it  made  me  feel
[103:31] like 
 you  didn't  care  and  i  was  in  absolutely 
 i  mean  you  saw  the  mess  i  was  in
[103:37] um  it's  interesting  that  you  like  you 
 perceived  me  smiling  as 
 as  negative  because  my  smile  wasn't
[103:46] my  it  wasn't  like  me  smiling  at  the 
 situation  it  was  me  smiling  at
[103:51] the  girl  i'm  in  love  with  it  actually 
 it's  like  seeing  her  for  the  first  time 
 in  a  little  while  in  a  stressful 
 situation 
 it  was  yeah  it  was  me  smiling  at  you
[103:59] not  at  the  situation  like  the  situation 
 was  making  me  tense  and 
 uncomfortable  but  the  moment  i  see  you
[104:05] it's  like  i  always  smile 
 and  it  it  hurt  when  you  instantly  took
[104:10] that  as  like 
 an  insult  and  you  like  you  you  it  was 
 like  now  it  felt
[104:15] at  first  it  felt  like  me  and  you  versus 
 everyone  then  it  felt  like 
 you  plus  everyone  versus  me  because  then
[104:20] you  started  like  you  were  like 
 doing  the  gun  fingers  and  [ __ ]  and  like
[104:25] manipulating  me  i'm  seeing  [ __ ] 
 grooming  gang
[104:30] oh  thank  you  yeah 
 he  said  that  you  agree  with  me
[104:38] he  still  believes  that  now  but  like 
 i  don't  blame  him  honestly  he's  like  you
[104:44] see  that  video  you  see  me 
 like  getting  girls  and  stuff  it's  like  i 
 couldn't  understand  this  perception  of
[104:49] that 
 it's  obvious  it's  not  right  but  it's 
 like  i  was  and  it  isn't  like
[104:54] well  for  that  buzz 
 would  you  say  i  was  like  resentful
[105:03] for  the  perception  that  that  was  the 
 image  that  was  put  onto  me  for  that  all 
 this 
 that  i  was  like  grooming  you  i  was
[105:09] manipulating  you  but 
 and  i  said  that  myself  i  said  that  you 
 weren't  grooming  me
[105:14] like  i  think  you  did  you  did  manipulate 
 me  like  you've  even 
 kind  of  admitted  it  to  admitted  to
[105:20] having 
 somewhat  manipulated  me  in  the  past  like 
 when  we  weren't  together
[105:25] obviously  when  it  was  just  like  seeing 
 each  other 
 i  think  without  actually  having  like
[105:31] without 
 having  to  try  and  convince  someone  first 
 oh  but  but  by  the  way  like  manipulation
[105:36] is  kind  of  how 
 humans  interact  anyway  and  so  you've  got 
 to  not  use  manipulation  yeah
[105:41] it  would  a  way  yeah 
 but  i  think  you  have  a  very  negative
[105:46] view  of  my  family  yeah 
 i  do  i'm  very  very  negative
[105:51] yeah  and  i  can  understand  why  you  have 
 that  view 
 but  like  it
[105:58] indifference  it  like  i  didn't  ever 
 expect  for  this  to  happen  like  i'm
[106:03] i  was  just  as  like  confused  as  you 
 i  wasn't  so  confused  but  i've  never  ever
[106:10] ever  seen  my  granddad  like  that  before 
 [Music] 
 i  think  he  was  just  very  i  think  it  was
[106:17] the  pictures  that  you  included  in  the 
 video  i  don't  think  it  was  necessarily 
 i  think  it  was  what  you  were  saying 
 about  me  of  course  and  i  think  it  was
[106:23] the 
 it  was  the  comparison  it  was  when  you
[106:28] were  talking  about 
 the  experiments  with  rats  and  pigeons
[106:33] and  he's  like  he's  comparing  a  woman 
 no  that's  such  a  like  useless  point
[106:38] honestly 
 i  know  like  it  might  be  a  useless  point 
 but  you  have  to  think  like
[106:43] this  is  someone  who's  nearly  in  their 
 70s  like  a  completely  different 
 generation  doesn't  know 
 what  youtube  is  i've  seen  a  video  of  you
[106:49] saying  oh  this  is  how  i  manipulate  girls 
 into  getting  what  i  want 
 and  then  all  the  things  that  had
[106:54] happened  of  course  he's  going  to  see  it 
 in  a  negative  way  like 
 my  granddad  he's  my  granddad  but  he's 
 like  my  dad  he's  raised  me
[107:01] if  he  thinks  that  there's  some  a  guy 
 that's  like 
 like  showing  some  form  of  danger  towards
[107:06] me  of  course  he's  gonna  react  in  a 
 horrible  way  because 
 that's  his  job
[107:13] yeah  that's  why  although  i  have  like  a 
 negative 
 thought  towards  like  the  situation  your
[107:21] family 
 but  i  don't  exactly
[107:26] like  i'm  i'm  offended  but  i  understand 
 i  think  that's  the  way  it  is  i'm  pissed
[107:32] off  that 
 me  and  you  we  didn't  get  the  autonomy 
 like  we  didn't  get  the  freedom  to  make
[107:37] this  choice  because 
 i  think  that  it  put  us  in  like  a  weird 
 situation
[107:42] where  we  didn't  get  to  like  break  up 
 with  each  other  which  would  have  been 
 the  best  case  scenario  like
[107:47] it  was  like  yeah
[107:52] like  that  wasn't  fair  and  the  last 
 conversation  we  had  is 
 you  know  you  go  up  to  your  room  so  we
[107:58] can  speak 
 on  facetime  and  then  your  granddad  walks 
 straight  up  as  well  he's  still  stood 
 there  like  he  was  talking  aggressively
[108:04] to  me 
 but  at  that  point  it's  like  that's  so  so 
 respectful  if  if  it's  going  to  be  your
[108:10] last  conversation  in  a  relationship  you 
 you  deserve  to  at  least  have 
 two  minutes  to  say  goodbye  to  each  other
[108:15] and  to  like  end  it 
 and  the  grand  island  is  like  looking  at 
 me  [ __ ]  like
[108:21] i  mean  like  it's  kind  of  funny  now  but 
 it 
 it's  not  something  at  the  time  it  was
[108:26] like  i'm  not  gonna  sound  like  a  [ __ ] 
 but  it's  not  something  i'd  expect  them 
 to  say 
 in  person  because  that  that's
[108:32] that's  man  to  man  that's  very  offensive 
 man  to  find  you  don't  say  that  type  of 
 [ __ ]  to  someone 
 and  especially  not  if  you  you  think  it's
[108:38] good  i  didn't  hear  it 
 i  didn't  hear  whatever  was  said  to  say
[108:43] what  is  to  look  at  someone  and  say  like 
 start  swearing  at  them
[108:48] like  okay  say  that  i've  done  something 
 wrong  fine  but  if  you  start  swearing  at 
 me  like 
 that  is  not  just  an  insult  it's  like
[108:54] it's  a  threat 
 at  that  point  yeah  and  you  can  say  i 
 mean  i  i  can't  comment  on  that  because  i
[108:59] didn't  hear  him  i 
 i  didn't  hear  him  i  can't  comment  on 
 that  because  i  didn't  hear  him  and  if  he
[109:04] did  swear 
 like  i  don't  think  he  should  have  done 
 but  then  they 
 they  didn't  know  you  they  didn't  know
[109:11] the  good  sides  to  you  all  they  saw  was 
 this  bad 
 and  that's  that's  why  i  i've  got
[109:17] negative  views  of  them  is 
 there's  a  hundred  videos  on  my  channel  a 
 hundred  videos  of  me  talking  about 
 mental  health  of  me  talking  about
[109:23] helping  these  guys 
 thousands  of  comments  of  guys  saying 
 that  i've  helped  them  but  the  issue
[109:28] isn't  about  how  you  can  help  guys  judged 
 literally 
 my  whole  like  person  my  every  the  person
[109:34] i  am  they've  judged  me  from  one  video 
 not  even  just  one  video 
 the  title  of  the  video  i've  been  i've
[109:40] been 
 branded  as  a  manipulator  because  i  made 
 a  video  on  manipulation 
 like  that  is  true  but  you  have  to  think
[109:46] that  interest  isn't 
 that  interest  isn't  how  well  you  can 
 help  young  men  i'm  not  a  young  man  who's
[109:52] been  helped  by  you 
 i  was  a  girl  that  was  in  a  relationship 
 with  you  so 
 their  concern  is  going  to  be  your  views
[109:58] towards  women  which 
 from  that  video  your  views  towards  women 
 seem  very  negative  because
[110:03] i  believe  they  were  very  negative  at 
 that  time 
 whether  they  are  now  or  not  i  don't  know
[110:08] i  i  don't  know  it's  like 
 when  we  were  in  a  relationship  like  i
[110:13] remember  i'd  say  to  you  all  the  time 
 like  the  guy  that  you  were 
 when  for  the  majority  of  the  time  that
[110:19] we  knew  each  other  even  though  like  the 
 time  we  were  spending  together  was  like 
 still  the  same  but  we're  still  getting 
 on  the  same
[110:24] seemed  like  you  were  a  completely 
 different  guy  like  i 
 i  wasn't  in  love  with  that  guy  i  was  in
[110:29] love  with  the  guy  i  was  in  a 
 relationship  with 
 but  like  when  this  is  a  video  that
[110:35] you've  posted  on  the  internet  people 
 can't  differentiate
[110:40] people  aren't  in  the  people  aren't  in 
 the  relationship  the  only  people  that 
 were  in  the  relationship  is  me  and  you
[110:47] so  they  they  didn't  know  the  extent  of 
 the  good 
 and  like  i've  spoken  to  my  grandparents
[110:52] afterwards  like  i've  spoke  to  my  nana 
 like 
 she  said  like  he  was  like  a  very
[110:57] positive  influence  like  i  do  think  he 
 was  a  good  guy  like  he  wanted  what  was 
 best  for  you  but 
 he  just  got  some  [ __ ]  up  views
[111:07] i  think  you  like  whether  you  do  now  or 
 not  but  i  think  in  the  past  you  have  had 
 some
[111:12] very  very  very  negative  news  towards 
 women  but  you  even  said  to  me  yourself 
 that  you  hated  women
[111:18] no  do  you  still
[111:23] no  that  was  a  long  time  ago  and 
 i'm  glad  i've  experienced  that  that  it's
[111:29] a  transition  that 
 these  guys  are  going  through  and  and 
 it's  a
[111:34] lot  more  common  than  most  people  think 
 it  is  the  majority  of  young  guys  hate 
 women
[111:39] because  the  world's  against  them  women 
 are  against  them  they  don't  understand 
 how  women  work  and  when  they  do  try  and 
 find  out  that  they're  branded  as  creeps
[111:46] they're  branded  as  like  weirdos  and 
 misogynists  and 
 and  in  cells  and  all  this  [ __ ]  and
[111:55] it's  not  exactly  like  something  fair  to 
 say  it's  like  oh  he's  got  such  a 
 negative  view  because
[112:01] i  have  to  counter  and  say  yeah  but 
 everyone  does  is  when 
 if  for  example  a  girl  says  oh  men  are
[112:06] trash  which  for  example  you've  at  least 
 either  said  that  before  or  you've  like 
 had  that  feeling  before  like  oh  these 
 guys  are  just  dicks  that's  that's
[112:12] horrible  that's  toxic  and  every  so  we 
 can  say  every  girl 
 every  mod  like  middle  um  my  age  girl
[112:18] like  20  year  old  girl  is  toxic 
 but  then  that's  just  a  stupid  conclusion 
 to  make  and  at  that  point  we  can  say
[112:24] okay 
 either  everyone's  toxic  or  we  are  now  at 
 the  baseline  where 
 the  baseline  is  toxic  and  above  that  is
[112:30] like  something  else 
 above  that  is  like  misogynistic 
 assumption  and  extremely  extremely  toxic 
 and  elusive
[112:35] and  abusive  and  i  wasn't  there 
 i  was  about  here  but  i  was  i  was  making
[112:41] it 
 honestly  i  was  about  here  making  videos 
 for  people  who  were  about  here
[112:46] but  i'm  like  i'm  at  the  level  if  this  is 
 my  ego  i  don't  know  but  i'm  at  the  level 
 where  i'm
[112:51] past  the  normal  level  of  toxicity  i'm  at 
 like  the  acceptance  stage  where  like 
 i  understand  how  this  stuff  works
[112:57] because  i've  spent  five  years 
 researching  it 
 like  i've  done  more  than  a  master's
[113:02] degree  of  how  of  behavioral  science 
 of  how  men  and  women  interact  with  each 
 other
[113:07] i  don't  know  i  i  don't  think  i  i  mean 
 obviously  yeah  you've  done  the
[113:12] the  work  behind  it  but  i  don't  agree 
 with  that  i  think 
 from  my  experience  on  what
[113:18] a  healthy  relationship  is  and  when  i've 
 spoken  to  people  about 
 what  their  view  of  a  healthy
[113:23] relationship  is  like  all  the  things  that 
 you 
 said  to  me  weren't  healthy  not  old
[113:29] things  like  old  things 
 that  we're  talking  about  you  know  i  mean 
 all  the  bad  things  but
[113:34] so  i  was  i  wasn't  good  either  i  wasn't 
 great  you
[113:39] things  that  you  said  were  worse  i  think 
 but  i  wasn't  great  either
[113:53] yeah  like  your  boundaries 
 boundaries  um  we're  much  more  extreme
[114:00] than  mine 
 cut  in  those  fingers  though
[114:06] but  yeah  my  boundaries  were  more  extreme 
 that's  because 
 i  was  doing  less  of  the  things  that
[114:11] would  make  you  anxious  so  naturally  mine 
 would  be 
 more  restrictive  i  wasn't  going  out
[114:16] clubbing  clubs  aren't  even  open 
 what  was  the  the  problem  through  all
[114:21] this  if  i  was  saying  this  and  you  were 
 like  oh 
 still  to  this  day  you  said  i  didn't  even 
 want  there  you  go  boys  we  got  her
[114:29] she  dipped  out  of  the  course  she  had 
 nothing  to  say  for  that  one's  gonna  die
[114:50] i  you  have 
 really  bad  trust  issues
[114:55] [Music] 
 like  really  bad  and  i  remember  when  we
[115:01] used  to  have  conversations 
 and  this  would  usually  be  when  i  was
[115:06] not  empathetic  towards  your  insecurities 
 i  think  this  would  always 
 pretty  much  always  be  the  situation
[115:12] where  that  would  happen  where  we'd  get 
 onto  the  conversation  of  trust  and  you'd 
 say 
 um  oh  like  i  wouldn't  ever  cheat  on  you
[115:19] but  it  could  happen  he's  like 
 like  say  if  we  were  in  a  bad  patch  and 
 like  a  girl  approached  me
[115:24] like  it  could  happen  like  i  could  see 
 myself  doing  it 
 and  when  i  would  turn  around  and  say  to
[115:30] you  it  wouldn't  happen 
 like  it  would  never  ever  ever  no  matter
[115:35] what  bad  patch  we  were  in  it  would  never 
 happen  and  you  would  say 
 no  like  you're  not  being  truthful  like 
 it  could  happen  of  course  it  could
[115:41] happen 
 i'm  not  going  to  say  it  could  happen 
 when  it  wouldn't  and  i 
 i  believe  now  and  i  said  this  to  you  at
[115:49] the  time  as  well  and  i  think  this  is 
 probably  why  i  used  to  get  so  upset  well 
 it  is  why  i  used  to  get  so  upset
[115:54] um  i  felt  like  your  lack  of  trust  in  me 
 was  a  reflection  of  yourself
[116:00] because  in  your  brain  it  seemed 
 physically  capable  for  you  to  cheat  on 
 me 
 whereas  in  my  brain  it  it  wasn't  even  it
[116:07] wasn't  even  part  of  it  like  me  and  my 
 ex-boyfriend 
 like  you  know  what  we  went  through  like
[116:12] we  went  through  some  of  the  worst 
 patches  you  could  have  ever  imagined 
 not  once  did  i  ever  cheat  on  him  i  was
[116:17] still  going  to  nightclubs  i  would  have 
 guys  approach  me  in  nightclubs 
 turn  around  and  tell  them  to  effort  like
[116:24] not  once  did  i  even  think  about  it  in  a 
 three-year  relationship 
 where  we  were  having  some  of  the  worst
[116:29] patches  like  obviously  i'm  not  going  to 
 go  into  it  but 
 some  of  the  worst  patches  you  could  have 
 ever  ever  ever  imagined
[116:37] and  not  once  did  i  think  about  it  and  i 
 think  that  i  think  that's  why  i  became
[116:42] unempathetic  because  i  would  get 
 frustrated  that  you 
 i  felt  like  you  weren't  believing  me
[116:48] when  i  was  saying  that  i  would  never 
 cheat  on  you 
 when  i  wouldn't  have  like  no  matter
[116:54] what  bad  patch  we  were  in  like  no  matter 
 whether  you  cheated  on  me  which  like 
 i  won't  be  still  be  with  you  but  say  if
[117:00] you  had  cheated  on  me  and  we  had  to  stay 
 together 
 or  anything  like  no  no  amount  of  being
[117:05] in  a  bad  couch  would 
 ever  ever  ever  change  my  values  and  my 
 morals  and  my  values  my  morals  are  that
[117:10] you  don't  cheat  on  someone  that  you're 
 with  like  i  think  that's  like 
 lowest  of  the  low  like  absolute  scum
[117:15] like  anyone  who  cheats  like 
 it  it  just  doesn't  make  it  honestly
[117:20] makes  no  sense  to  me 
 at  all  like  why  are you  gonna  hurt  the
[117:25] person  that  you're  supposed  to  be  in 
 love  with 
 and  i  think  that's  why  i  was 
 unempathetic  because  to  me
[117:30] it  was  physically  like  it  wasn't  even  a 
 possibility  that  i'd  cheat  on  you  not 
 even
[117:35] like  if  anything  had  happened  whereas  to 
 you  when  you  were  saying  to  me
[117:40] oh  um 
 when  you'd  say  to  me  oh  my  brain  is
[117:45] broke 
 when  you'd  say  to  me  that  it  was
[117:50] possible  for  you  to  do  it  i  think  that's 
 what  hurt  me  because  it  felt  like  your 
 lack  of  trust  was  a  reflection  of
[117:55] your  possible  like  unfaithfulness
[118:01] that  could  be  it's  hard  for  me  to  like 
 fully  say  but  i  mean 
 i  do  hear  that  that's  something  that
[118:07] happens  with  people  is 
 if  they  feel  untrustworthy  themselves 
 then  they  think  the  other  person's 
 untrustworthy
[118:12] so  that  could  have  but  then 
 i  mean  it  could  have  it's  hard  for  me  to
[118:17] like  say  yes  or  no  but  when 
 instantly  i  thought  about  my  first 
 girlfriend  and  i  felt  the  same  way
[118:23] and  after  reading  more  about 
 some  things  about  relationships
[118:29] something  stuck  out  to  me  recently  and 
 it  said  that
[118:34] don't  know  if  i'm  just  using  this  as 
 some  kind  of  basic  excuse  but  it  did  say 
 like 
 you  you  get  the  you  expect  the  love  that
[118:41] you  got  from 
 your  parents  and  it  does  seem  like  to  be 
 generally  true
[118:47] and  somewhat  i  think  that 
 my  expectations  of  of
[118:53] like  anxiousness  and  broken  love 
 reflects  my  childhood  experiences  of
[118:59] of  somewhat  like  an  abusive  house  and 
 that's  my  my  view  of  relationships
[119:05] because  i've  never  exactly  trusted 
 anyone  i've  been  with  because 
 it's  not  it's  not  an  insult  on  you  and
[119:10] your  faithfulness  it's  more 
 i  can't  imagine  how  anyone  would  be
[119:17] faithful  to  me 
 do  you  think  that  you  would  have  cheated 
 on  this
[119:23] no  but  this  is  a  different  question  to 
 what  originally  we  were  speaking  about 
 though  the
[119:28] i  know
[119:33] i  was  like  madly  in  love  with  you  like 
 not  even  in  love 
 not  just  like  normal  people  love  like  i
[119:38] was  on  the  extreme  level 
 like  there  was  not  even  like  i  was  going 
 to  say  there's  not  a  possibility  but
[119:43] that's  that's  false  the  reason  why  you 
 when  you  ask  me  or  is  there  a  chance
[119:48] like  i  i  don't  believe  anyone  could  say 
 that  oh  no  there's  no  chance  whatsoever 
 i  think  that  consciously  it  sounds  so
[119:54] nice  to  think  like  oh  no  no  100 
 it's  not  gonna  happen  but  i  think  that
[119:59] are  you  literally  saying  that  there's 
 like  a  zero  percent  chance  there's 
 almost  nothing  has  a  zero  percent  chance
[120:04] almost  and  so  there  is  like  a  zero  point 
 something  percent  chance  for  it  to 
 happen  when
[120:09] for  example  i  think  we're  going  to  break 
 up  anyway  and  you've  you've  cheated  on 
 me  you've  hurt  me  or 
 where  you  know  something's  like  [ __ ]  has
[120:15] happened  i  think  we're  going  to  break  up 
 and  someone's  like  entered  my  life  at 
 this  point  and  they've  said  the  right 
 things  and  i'm  feeling  the  right
[120:20] emotions  like 
 it  can  happen  and  yeah  i  wasn't 
 empathetic  to  you 
 to  you  because  this  this  now  that  i  say
[120:27] it  like  this  makes  me  think  that  this 
 was  a  very  like 
 analytical  logical  way  to  think  about
[120:34] probability  and  [ __ ]  instead  of  thinking 
 about  how  you  do  it  with  emotions  which 
 is  oh  [ __ ]  he  just  said  that  he  could
[120:39] cheat  on  me  whereas  i  was 
 like  i  was  thinking  like  is  there  more 
 than  a  zero  point  is  like  greater  than
[120:44] sign  a  zero  percent  chance  like  i  guess 
 they  would  be  like  let  me  add  up  all  the 
 variables  like
[120:49] and  the  thing  is  if  you  do  that  you  have 
 to  be  a  liar  to  say  like  oh  no  it's 
 still  going  to  be  zero
[120:54] you  have  to  be  because  yeah  the  person 
 can  hurt  you 
 yeah  so  then  but  the  thing  is  like
[121:01] like  it  could  happen  of  course  and  thank 
 you  like  for  saying  that 
 because  i  think  that  is  a  big  thing  that
[121:07] made  me  feel  insecure  in  our 
 relationship  was  how  you  would  always 
 say  that  but  it's  like  yeah  but  if  it
[121:12] wouldn't  happen 
 it  couldn't  like  of  course  it  could 
 happen  like 
 of  course  when  you  were  asking  me  like
[121:18] oh  could  it  happen  like  like  could  you 
 see  yourself 
 i'm  not  asking  you  could  it  i'm  asking 
 you  would  it  but  no  you  guys  don't  think
[121:25] that's  that  though 
 because  you  used  to  ask  that  like  like 
 you  did  today  like  a  little  bit  later 
 and  i'd  say  no  and  then  you  get  confused
[121:31] but  you  just  said  that 
 because  you're  asking  each  other  feel 
 like  in  my  head  could  it  happen
[121:36] is  like  you  physically  thinking  would  it 
 happen  yeah 
 i  wasn't  thinking  about  the
[121:41] probabilities  i  never  even  thought  of  it 
 like  that  until  you  said  it 
 yeah  i  think  the  thing  is  like  people
[121:47] who  are  gonna  cheat  are  gonna  cheat 
 regardless 
 of  what  environment  they're  in  like
[121:53] no  no  that  is  so  true  that  is  so  true 
 like 
 that  girl  the  girl  at  the  gym  rings  all
[121:59] she  did  was  go  for  a  walk 
 and  she  cheated  on  her  boyfriend
[122:04] nah  all  she  did  was  go  through  real  life 
 of  course  of  course  it's  easier  in  the 
 club 
 i  don't  know  serial  cheaters  will  but
[122:12] without  i'd  have  to  go  into  like  vulgar 
 detail  to  explain  how  it  truly  happens 
 but
[122:17] through  my  experiences  which  i've  told 
 the  boys  as  well  to  be  honest  for  like 
 two  hours  into  the  podcast  i  can  speak
[122:22] pretty  unfiltered 
 so  i've  told  the  boys  and  i  think  i've 
 told  you  as  well  about  half  of  my
[122:28] the  girls  that  i've  been  with  have  been 
 with  her  bad  boyfriends  and 
 through  this  experience  the  same
[122:37] thing  always  pops  into  my  mind  is  that 
 it  is  a  situation  that  builds  it  and
[122:42] there's  about  like  five  like  triggers  of 
 this 
 and  problems  with  the  boyfriend  is 
 always  number  one
[122:47] because  if  you  were  like  very  very  like 
 a  you  know  on  our  good  days  we're  like 
 proper  hugging  each  other  you're  not
[122:52] you're  not  even  gonna 
 like  it  could  not  even  that's  a  zero 
 percent  day 
 but  never  gonna  happen  on  that  day
[122:58] anyway 
 it  was  gonna  go  from  zero  to  like  zero 
 zero  zero  point  one  percent
[123:03] when  we  think  we're  going  to  break  up 
 anyway  when  you  feel  close  to  the  line 
 because  i've  done  something  stupid  or 
 you  know  something  happens
[123:09] if  for  example  on  that  day  like 
 everything  went  down  we  we 
 ended  on  that  day  but  for  example  if  we 
 didn't  but  your  parents  were  saying  oh
[123:15] no  you  can't  be  with  him  but  we  didn't 
 end  on  that  day 
 then  if  you  went  out  then  if  the  right
[123:20] attractive  guy  came  and  he  said  like  the 
 right  words  to  you  and  you  were  feeling 
 him 
 then  the  probability  goes  up  like  the
[123:26] situation  builds  and  it  is 
 yeah  like  the  point  just  was  because
[123:31] the  thing  that  i  was  anxious  and  i  had 
 boundaries  about  was  the  situation  that 
 i  could  see  happening  where  it  is  always
[123:37] night  time  at  least  it's  always  alcohol 
 related  it's  always 
 like  female  friends  related  all  the
[123:44] girls  i've  been  with  it's 
 honestly  largely  because  their  their 
 female  friends  kind  of  like
[123:49] made  it  happen  and  we  were  all  drinking 
 and  it  was  nighttime  and  she  was  having 
 problems  with  the  boyfriend  and 
 generally  i  was  higher  value  than  the
[123:55] boyfriend 
 now  maybe  my  big  fight  ego  but  it  would 
 be  difficult
[124:00] for  you  to  like  see  someone  who  was 
 better  than  me 
 but  it  does  happen  like  there  are  some
[124:05] [ __ ]  like  good  guys  out  there 
 and  some  attractive  ass  guy  can  approach 
 you  and  it  like  it  can't  happen
[124:11] it's  not  gonna  happen  that  often  and 
 it's  quite  funny  because  it's  like 
 it's  hard  to  be  better  than  me  but  i've
[124:17] been  embarrassed  i've  been  in  bad 
 practices  and  gone  on  nights  out  and  not 
 cheated  i've  been  on  i've  been  in  bad 
 patches
[124:22] i've  gone  on  nights  out  and  had  guys 
 approach  me  that  i  found  attractive 
 didn't  cheat  that's  most  of  the  situ
[124:28] that's  most  of  the 
 the  factors  a  couple  more  factors  and
[124:33] it  could  have  like  no  no  amount  of 
 factors  like  i
[124:39] ultimately  i  can't  blame  you  for  feeling 
 this  way  because  i  know  myself  no  one 
 can  ever  know  you
[124:44] to  the  extent  that  you  know  yourself  i 
 know  that  i'd  never  do  that  like 
 i'm  not  asked  about  going  out  and
[124:49] getting  with  guys  like  i  literally  went 
 to  a  house  party  a few  days 
 ago  didn't  even  think  about  it  not  and
[124:54] didn't  even  think  about  it  for  one 
 second  i  went  there  to  be  with  my 
 friends 
 and  to  have  a  nice  time  with  my  friends
[124:59] i  didn't  go  because  i  want  to  get  with 
 the  guy
[125:05] but  this  is  the  tricky  part  because 
 it's  not  a  conscious  decision  it's  not
[125:11] it's  it  never  is  that's  the  thing  no  one 
 actually  thinks  themselves  like  oh  i'm 
 going  to  cheat  today
[125:17] no  of  course  not  but  only 
 when  you  think  about  okay  you  know
[125:22] you've  had  the  opportunity  with  your  ex 
 for  example  but  like  10  times  over  the 
 times  you  went  to  the  clubs  and  stuff
[125:28] when  this  keeps  happening  but  you  end  up 
 staying  together  for  literally 
 three  four  five  years  that's  when  it
[125:33] starts  happening  because  at  that  point 
 you've  had 
 a  hundred  situations  where  it  could  have 
 happened  and  then  it  only  needs  to
[125:39] happen  once  for  the  entire  thing  to 
 crumble 
 now  yeah  when  i  look  back  on  it  i  just 
 think  like
[125:45] so  me  from  a  couple  months  like  one  two 
 months  ago  i was  just  thinking  like 
 like  what  what  benefit  what  positive  was
[125:52] there  for  you  to  even  have  this 
 this  feeling  of  this  foreseeable  future
[125:57] to  think  oh  she  could  cheat  on  you  like 
 why  not  just  act  as  if  she'll  never 
 cheat  on  you  and  go  up  with  that  because
[126:02] she'll  be  less  likely  to  cheat  on  you 
 and  you'll  be  less  likely  to  break  up 
 if  you  just  kind  of  hold  the  identity
[126:07] that  she  never  will  anyway  instead  of 
 expressing  that  oh 
 it  could  happen  like  maybe  if  john  so
[126:12] i'd  like  i  see  it  from  your  point  of 
 view  because  me 
 holding  that that  insecurity  and  that
[126:17] jealousy 
 it's  just  it's  like  autistic  it's  just 
 unvaluable  in  every  sense
[126:23] it  doesn't  do  anything  positive  and  all 
 it  does  is  just  make  it  more  likely  to 
 happen  because
[126:28] you're  obviously  going  to  go  through 
 more  problems  this  way  yeah  of  course 
 do  you  think  i  would  have  cheated
[126:36] no  but  i  mean  if  we  talk  about  the 
 probability
[126:41] i  could  see  i  can  see  like  it  could 
 happen 
 0.000
[126:57] do yeah  think  i  would  have  do  you  think 
 like 
 there  was  like  a  pretty  big  chance  like
[127:03] 10  15 
 like  it  would  have  happened  over  a 
 couple  years 
 yeah  yeah  when  we  were  together  no
[127:11] but  when  we  broke  up  i  remember  thinking 
 about  it  and  i  was  like 
 yeah  this  guy  would  have  cheated  on  me
[127:18] like  this  is  gonna  sound  [ __ ] 
 horrible  to  say  but  i'm  glad 
 i  got  out  of  our  relationship  granted
[127:26] well  it  didn't  go  on  any  longer  although 
 it  was  painful  it  was  like  literally  one 
 of 
 the  most  painful  things  i've  ever
[127:32] experienced  in  my  whole  life  like 
 it  was  horrendous  or  i  was
[127:37] grateful  because 
 i've  been  debating  whether  to  say  this
[127:43] or  not  for  the  whole  thing  but  i'm  like 
 [ __ ]  it  do  i  just  i  you
[127:49] i've  like  read  into  it  and  stuff  since 
 we  broke  up  because 
 um  i've  like  struggled
[127:56] you  were  showing  all  of  the  first  signs 
 of  abuse
[128:01] like  what  controlling
[128:06] gaslighting  because  you  got 
 you  did  gas  like  me  you  made  me  feel  so
[128:11] guilty 
 like  so  guilty  pudding  what's  good
[128:16] it's  when  you  it's  a  form  of  emotional 
 manipulation  where  you 
 make  the  person  feel  like  they're
[128:23] like  guilty  for  everything  or  make  them 
 feel  like  they're 
 like  going  crazy  and  i  remember
[128:30] i 
 just  heard  the  noise  home  below  that's
[128:36] kind  of  good 
 yeah  i'm  literally  like  my  all  my 
 housemates  because  i'm  back  at  you  now
[128:41] if  you  can't  tell 
 or  my  housemates  have  moved  out  so  i'm 
 just  i'm  well  once  but
[128:46] what  was  i  even  saying  oh  yeah 
 gaslighting  um  basically  where  you  kind
[128:53] of  make 
 not  it  is  question  their  sanity  but 
 that's  like  an  extreme
[128:58] case  so  basically  just  like  when  i  was 
 at  uni 
 when  i  came  back  to  york  um  i  remember
[129:04] you  say  to  me  that  oh  like  you've  not 
 reassured  me  at  all  since  you've  been 
 back  which 
 i  messed  up  and  i  did  that  instagram
[129:10] thing  but  like 
 i  admitted  that  was  messed  up  and  i 
 shouldn't  have  done  that
[129:15] but  and  you're  like  oh  you  haven't 
 reassured  me  like  you've  essentially 
 behaved  in  the  exact  way  that  i  was
[129:21] scared  of  you  behaving  but  literally 
 every  single  day  i  was  sending  you  so 
 many  messages  like
[129:26] you'd  wake  up  every  morning  to  a  massive 
 paragraph  for  me  tell  me  how  much  i 
 loved  you  like  voice  notes  and  you  made
[129:33] me  feel  like  i  wasn't  doing  that  and 
 it's  only  when  i  came  out  of  the 
 situation  i  was  like
[129:38] okay  what  what  else  did  you  expect  from 
 me
[129:44] and  it's  like  i  felt  i  felt  like  i  was 
 in  the  wrong 
 for  wanting  to  go  on  a  night  out  with  my
[129:50] friends  once  every  year  or 
 wanting  to  go  and  visit  my  friend  in 
 london  i  felt  like
[129:55] guilty  i  was  like  oh  i  shouldn't  want  to 
 do  those  things  anyway  like  it's  going 
 to 
 harms  are  anxious  which  yeah  to  an
[130:00] extent  but  you're  gonna  feel  anxious  in 
 those  situations  like  you  do  feel 
 anxious  when  your  partner  goes  out
[130:05] like  i've  had  that  exact  thing  i'm  like 
 what  if  he's  cheating  on  me  my  wife  is
[130:10] cheating  on  me  but  he's  like  no  he's  not 
 that's  just  the  anxious  part  of  my  brain 
 that's  being  stupid
[130:17] it's  not  the  real  belief
[130:23] i  feel  like  i've  just  explained  that 
 really  really  badly  but  i'll  get  your 
 point 
 i  mean  i  could  be  abusive  and  i  think
[130:30] you  are 
 i'm  not  saying  that  to  be  hurtful  i'm
[130:35] just  i  think  we  both  have  a  lot  like 
 this  is  why  i've  done  this  call  because 
 i  think  we  both  have  a  lot  to  learn  from
[130:41] that  we  don't  even 
 really  know  because  we  haven't  told  each 
 other  yeah
[130:49] i  think  you  are  abusive  hanzo 
 emotionally  anyway 
 i  remember  you  saying  to  me  that  a  few
[130:54] girls  have  said  that  to  you  in  the  past 
 that's  what  i  was  thinking  at  first  i 
 was  thinking  like
[131:01] like  oh  women  are  strange  because
[131:08] women  the  women  who  have  said  this  are 
 the  ones  who  like  me  the  most
[131:13] and  so  what  what  should  a  guy  do  if
[131:19] like  this  is  what  women  seem  to  want 
 this  is  what  women  are  like  attracted  to
[131:24] because  when  you've  been  emotionally 
 abused  and  manipulated  by  someone
[131:29] you  feel  like  you  have  to  clean  i  i 
 can't 
 i  know  it  in  my  head  but  i  can't  fully
[131:34] explain  it  but  it's  like 
 you  feel  the  need  to  like  cling  on  to 
 them  i  think  you  feel  more  attached  to
[131:39] them  because 
 they're  not  constantly  giving  you  good 
 attention  all  the  time  it's  like  when 
 they  do  it's  like  can  you  get  so
[131:44] attached 
 like  why  do  people  why  people  in  a 
 relate  an  abusive  relationship  and  stay
[131:49] in  it  for  30  years 
 you  get  attached  i  promise  you  this
[131:56] isn't 
 like  the  way  that  you  need  to  act  to  get 
 girls  like 
 it's  it's  not  nice  like
[132:04] the  the  mental  damage  that  you've  caused 
 me  in  just 
 three  days  of  being  controlling  and
[132:11] abusive 
 literally  it  was  it  was  like  everything 
 was  so  good  and  it  just  turned  to  [ __ ] 
 in  literally  three  days
[132:17] like  i'm  not  like  recovered  from  that
[132:22] like  you've  really  really  damaged  me 
 mentally 
 like  really  badly
[132:32] how 
 i  don't  know  how  to  exactly  like  put  it 
 into  words  but  i  don't  know
[132:37] how  does  it  make  you  feel 
 um
[132:46] depressed  and  anxious 
 and 
 [Music]
[132:52] like 
 it's  not  even  a  feeling  i  can  describe
[133:02] i  wouldn't  wish  anyone  to  feel  the  way 
 that  you  made  me  feel
[133:11] my  perception  of  it  is  that
[133:17] i  i  just  set  my  boundaries 
 like  i  you  know  i  said  that  i  didn't
[133:24] want  to  be  with  a  girl  who 
 would  do  x  for  example  x  and  if  you
[133:30] wanted  to 
 not  exactly  like  oh  you  know  if  you 
 wanted  to  stay  with  me  but  it  was  like 
 your  conscious  decision  to  think  oh
[133:36] x  is  worth  less  than  hamza  so  i'll  be 
 with  hamza 
 so  that  to  me  doesn't  seem  like  it  would
[133:41] be  like 
 mentally  traumatic  no  it  was  just
[133:46] things  over  time  like  the  gaslighting 
 and  thinking  back  to  things  that  you 
 said  in  the  past  and
[133:53] just  the  like  i  don't  know  your  attitude 
 towards  certain  things  like  i  remember 
 when
[133:58] you  went  to  have  the  conversation  with 
 my  granddad  i  remember  i  was  on  the 
 facetime  call  with  you  and  i  was  crying
[134:03] and  i  was  like  can  you  please  come  and 
 have  a  conversation  with  him  tomorrow 
 and  you  were  like  no  it's  a  work  day
[134:08] which  i  complete  like  i  completely 
 understand  like  yeah  it's  a  work  day 
 like  work  is 
 the  priority  as  you  always  used  to  say
[134:15] um 
 but  you  it  just  seemed  like  you  were  you
[134:20] seemed  very  like  insensitive  like  i 
 remember  you  weren't  even  like  looking 
 at  me  you  were  just  doing  something  on
[134:25] your  computer  and 
 that  was  actually  like  crying  and 
 begging  you  and  being  like  please  like 
 i'm 
 i'm  struggling  so  much  like  i  really
[134:30] just  need  you  to  have  this  conversation 
 with  him 
 and  i  mean  yeah  you  would  breathe  in  the
[134:36] end  but  you  were  like  no 
 you  don't  know  sorry  baby  no  and  like 
 that  just
[134:41] hurt  because  i  needed  that  from  you  so 
 badly  like 
 i  remember  like  literally  begging  you
[134:46] being  like  please  i  need  this  like 
 like  i  need  i  literally  need  you  to  have 
 this  conversation
[134:53] and  i  just  felt  like  you  were  very  like 
 insensitive  towards  it  i  don't  know  i 
 just  felt  like  i  saw 
 the  old  you  in  the  last  few  days  of  our
[134:59] relationship 
 and  it  kind  of  scared  me
[135:05] that  makes  sense  as  we  got  closer  and  i 
 was  able  to 
 like  peel  back  the  onion  layers  i  was
[135:12] able  to  show  you  like 
 the  sweet  side  of  me  the  the  un
[135:17] um  i  don't  know  what  you  call  it  but  i 
 was  able  to  show  you  like 
 maybe  i  can't  tell  if  it's  the  real  side
[135:23] of  me  you  know  it  probably  is  if  it  was 
 like  the 
 side  of  me  that  was  coming  out  when  we 
 were  like  in  love  with  each  other  and 
 that  so  that's  probably  the  real  side
[135:29] the  real  side  to  you  but  i  think  the 
 side  that  you 
 not  necessarily  a  side  that  you  put  on
[135:35] as  a  facade 
 but  i  feel  like  maybe  you  initially  put 
 it  on  as  a  facade  and  now  that's  like
[135:40] become  who  you  are  like  in  social 
 situations  but  i  think  who  you  were  with 
 me  was  the  real  you
[135:45] because  it  was  a  complete  decide  to  have 
 never  been  anywhere 
 yeah  that's  actually  something  that  i've
[135:50] thought  and  i've  spoke  to  the  boys  about 
 is 
 when  you  do  get  into  the  culture  that
[135:56] i'm  in  when  you  when  you  talk 
 like  talking  about  like  cringy  [ __ ]  like 
 alpha  male  bitter  male  and  [ __ ]  it's
[136:01] like 
 automatically  you  are  gonna 
 push  towards  that  even  if  you're  trying
[136:07] to  remain  you  know 
 like  oh  yeah  we  want  we  want  to  be 
 individual  but  for  example  like 
 girls  don't  exactly  do  this  right  but  a
[136:13] lot  of  guys  who  have  watched  this  but  i 
 could  almost  guess  that  100  of  the guys 
 who  are  still  watching
[136:18] have  watched  the  video  on  for  example 
 how  to  increase  testosterone 
 and  i  doubt  you  know  a  single  girl  who's
[136:24] ever  searched  unless  if  it  was  medical 
 related  like  how  to  increase  estrogen  to 
 be  like  more 
 womanly  and  attractive  to  men  well  guys
[136:30] do  this  [ __ ]  because  we  need  every 
 little  bit  of  like  advantage  we  can 
 and  so  we  watch  a  video  like  this  and  it
[136:35] says  oh  the  the  alpha  male  does  this  and 
 he 
 and  he  speaks  with  a  deeper  voice  and  he
[136:40] and  he  takes  up  more  and  so  we're  like 
 oh  yeah 
 okay  yeah  me  too  but  next  one  x  so  we 
 start  doing  it  we  fake  it  till  we  make
[136:46] it  people  start  believing  in  it  we  get 
 more  confidence  we  go  to  the  gym  because 
 going  to  the  gym  building  the  body  make
[136:51] essentially  fools  people  to  think  that 
 this  was  your  natural  genetics  and 
 you're  better  than  them  naturally  and 
 this  is  why
[136:56] it's  attractive  to  women  it's  not  that 
 they  actually  care  about  the  fact  that 
 you've  done  a  thousand  workout 
 issues  that  it  makes  your  genetics  seem
[137:02] better  yeah  it's  just  the  attraction 
 that  it  gives  you  yeah 
 so  we  do  this  stuff  and  it's  like  you 
 you
[137:07] you  forget  who  you  were  at  the  start  but 
 then  also 
 is  that  even  you  anymore  because  the
[137:13] thousand  workouts  does  truly  change  you 
 and  you  do  get  a  sense  of  like 
 of  you  know  that  discipline  and  and  for
[137:19] a  lot  of  guys  it  does  turn  into  a 
 cockiness  and  it  did  for  me 
 because  you  do  get  if  you've  been
[137:25] zero  to  100  if  you've  been  the  [ __ ] 
 sim  to  pimp  you  do  get  cockiness  from 
 that 
 and  i  found  that  it  does  go  like  this
[137:31] where  like  cockiness 
 hits  here  because  right  now  all  the 
 gains  all  the 
 the  result  is  new  and  obviously  like  the
[137:38] ego  hasn't  caught  up  to  it 
 and  eventually  it  becomes  natural  and 
 it's  like  okay  now  i'm  like
[137:43] the  the  natural  person  who's  used  to 
 this 
 yeah  i  feel  uh
[137:51] yeah  so  it  can  go  i  forgot  what  the 
 point  was  right  like  it  can
[137:57] about  personality  in  it  because  i  i've 
 was  wondering  this  as  well 
 because  there  was  times
[138:05] no  i'll  let  you  finish  because  i  wasn't 
 even  sure  i  was  gonna  say
[138:12] there  was  times  when  i  remember  when  you 
 you  were  like  proper  proper  insulin  you
[138:18] you  proper  found  me  cute  and  everything 
 when 
 it  was  like  the  opposite  of  what
[138:25] is  it  a  persona  i  don't  know  but  you  can 
 say  that  there's  two  versions  of  me  that 
 you  saw 
 there  was  like  and  and  this  is  the  issue
[138:32] because 
 you  you  got  with  the  first  guy  that's 
 the  thing  like  the  first  guy
[138:39] he  was  like 
 the  reason  why  you  stayed  around  and
[138:44] actually  got  to  witness  the  second  guy 
 and  this  is  at  least  like  these  boys
[138:49] yeah 
 right  if  i  was  originally  the  second  guy 
 i  would  have  been  like  the  guys  on  your
[138:54] snapchat  with  where  we  have  a  40  day 
 conversation  and  you're  not  meeting  me 
 because  you'd  be  meeting  a  guy  like  the
[138:59] first  guy 
 i  was  the  first  guy  i  was  i  was  like  the 
 avoidant  style  like  the  [ __ ]  boy  style
[139:04] and  that's  what  actually  attracted  you 
 you  you 
 were  attracted  because  of  that  masculine
[139:09] like  alpha  male  type  of  [ __ ] 
 but  you  stayed  because  of  the  pain  but  i 
 wasn't  i  wasn't  looking  for  a
[139:15] relationship 
 i  didn't  want  a  relationship  with  you 
 like  for  the  most  like  for  the  first
[139:20] part  of  our  relationship 
 well  not  relationship  but  like  you  know 
 i  mean  like  first  part  was  knowing  each
[139:25] other 
 like  i  remember  we  we  literally  like
[139:30] wouldn't  text  apart  from  when  we  would 
 see  each  other  like 
 usually  you'd  message  me  to  come  and  see
[139:36] me  to  come  and  see  you 
 um  and  i  literally
[139:42] wouldn't  i'm  gonna  be  saying  to  me  as  a 
 joke  you'd  be  like  oh  you've  been 
 thinking  about  me  and  i'd  be  like 
 no  i  literally  like  i  wouldn't  think
[139:49] about  you  unless  you  messaged  me  to  come 
 and  see  you  like  that's  the  only  time 
 i'd  ever  think  about  you
[139:54] so  it  wasn't  like  i  was  going  into  this 
 one  in  a  relationship  i  never  wanted  a 
 relationship  from  you  and  like
[140:00] i  thought  you  were  an  absolute  like  dick 
 like  literally  my  nickname 
 i've  called  you  a  what  was  it  a  scumbag
[140:06] that  was  the  little  nickname  i  made  for 
 you  a  scumbag  like  i  thought  that  you
[140:11] were  an 
 absolute  like  egotistical  like  arrogant
[140:16] like  that  you're  attracted  to  and  this 
 is  why  guys  are  confused
[140:24] we  just  got  on  and  then 
 when  like  we  both  started  like  getting
[140:29] feelings  but  didn't  admit  it 
 i  think  the  second  you  had  started  to 
 come  out  a  little  bit  because  that's  why
[140:35] i 
 kind  of  started  getting  feelings  because 
 we  started  it  was  kind  of  weird  we 
 started  acting  like
[140:41] i  think  we  both  had  like  two  sides  to  us 
 and  slowly  we  started  showing  like
[140:47] the  vulnerable  real  honest  side  tools 
 which  we  because  we  just  you've  done  the 
 same  thing  maybe  to  less  of  an  extent
[140:53] because  you  haven't  actually  done  like 
 the  whole  like 
 self-improvement  as  much  as  i  have  but
[140:59] you  definitely  had  like  a  different 
 persona  as  well  the  first  times  like  you 
 were  just 
 standing  basically  yeah  like  you're
[141:05] you're  i  was  very 
 i  was  very  different  when  we  first  met 
 yeah  i  was  a  very  very  very  different
[141:10] person  when  we  first  met 
 you  you  did  develop  as  a  person  but  it
[141:15] was  also 
 this  the  version  of  you  that  you  were 
 showing  i  think  if  we  say  persona  maybe
[141:21] it's  like  a  bit  too  negative  but  it 
 it's  kind  of  like  um  you  go  to  an
[141:26] interview  and  they  see  a  version  of  you 
 compared  to  how  your  friends 
 see  you  and  it's  like  i  think  generally
[141:31] how  relationship  seems  at  least  it  was 
 for  us  is 
 the  first  time  you're  meeting  for  for  a 
 while  it  was  like  we  were  both
[141:37] conveying  what  was 
 expected  or  strategic  or  whatever  where
[141:43] it  was  in  that  environment  where  we  were 
 just  purely  just  meeting  and  we  weren't 
 exactly  like  getting  feelings  we  weren't
[141:48] going  to  show  up  our  vulnerable  side  to 
 like  be  open  honest  with  each  other 
 and  as  we  spent  time  with  each  other  and
[141:53] we  started  doing  that  that's  when  the 
 feelings  came 
 yeah  because  we  always  kind  of  acted
[141:59] like  even  when  we  weren't  like  doing 
 cuckoly  things  i  feel  like  we  did  always 
 kind  of  act  like  a  couple  like
[142:04] even  kind  of  near  dark  that's 
 interesting 
 not  right  here  there's  not  like  a  month
[142:09] or  two  yeah  but  do  you  think  like 
 the  reason  why  we  actually
[142:16] the  reason  why  we  progressed  and  we  like 
 we  continued 
 was  because  of  let's  say  the  real
[142:23] vulnerable  like 
 cutie  side  to  us  because  that  was 
 actually  the  reason  why  like  i  was  more
[142:28] interested  in  you  than  other 
 it  was  because  it  wasn't  just  like  i  was 
 meeting
[142:33] not  exactly  like  i  still  thought  you 
 were  a  basic  [ __ ]  but  it  was  like 
 i  wasn't  meeting  like  a  girl  who  just
[142:38] had 
 the  the  male  personality  equivalent  of
[142:44] what  you  thought  i  was  in  terms  of 
 scumbag  fuckboy 
 it's  like  that's  you  were  the  female
[142:49] equivalent  of  that 
 and  most  girl  like  all  girls  i  mean 
 honestly  like  the  female  equivalent  of 
 that  i 
 know  you  don't  you  don't  like  see  it  but
[142:55] i  was  never  i've 
 never  been  a  you  can't  tell  though  you 
 weren't  dating  you  you  weren't  like 
 meeting  you  though  if  i  accept  that  i
[143:03] was  a  scumbag  if  you're  saying  it 
 you've  got  to  accept  this  yeah  that's 
 true  that  is  true
[143:09] i  just  thought  you  know  when  you  text  me 
 to  do  the  podcast
[143:14] that  was  when  i  as  i  was  i  was  literally 
 drinking  a  basic  [ __ ]  cocktail  that's
[143:20] what  it was  called  basic  [ __ ]  cocktails 
 and  i  saw  that  you've  messaged  me 
 and  i  was  like  i  might  just  send  a
[143:26] picture  of  this  content 
 that's  your  answer  i  am  really
[143:31] interested  in  that 
 to  think  that  at  first  okay  we  were
[143:36] attracted  to  each  other  just  on  that 
 like  kind  of  physical  sense 
 and  the  personality  we  were  conveying
[143:41] was  like  let's  say  [ __ ]  boy  and  [ __ ] 
 girl 
 superheroes  and
[143:49] perhaps  the  reason  why  at  least 
 you  for  me  was  that  you  were  the
[143:54] priority  like  i  told  you  this  you  were 
 like  the  priority  above 
 other  girls  or  like  pretty  quickly  and
[144:00] i  think  that's  because  actually  like  i 
 saw  the  non-fucking  version  of  you  and  i
[144:05] think  you  felt  the  same  way 
 when  you  started  to  see  the  non-fuckboy
[144:10] version  of  me 
 and  it's  like  we  all  like  you 
 automatically  did  it  i  consciously  did 
 it  which  is  like  more  manipulative  i
[144:16] will  say  that  but 
 both  of  us  put  this  this  persona  that  is
[144:21] more  widely  socially  accepted 
 and  you  kind  of  have  to  do  this  [ __ ] 
 when  you  go  on  to  dating  apps  and  you're 
 seeing  a  hundred  people
[144:27] you  have  to  be  like  maybe  the  avoidance 
 style 
 personality  where  you  you  know  yeah  if
[144:33] you're  cool  and  everything  they're 
 treating  me  and  keep  them  keen  yeah  both 
 of  us  did  that  because
[144:39] we  actually  progressed  because  we we 
 went  away  from  that  and  it's  making  me 
 think 
 what  if  there  was  just  none  of  the
[144:46] the  first  part 
 i  was  thinking  i  wonder  if  it  would  have
[144:53] happened  or  not 
 would  we  have  even  been  attract  like 
 attracted  to  each  other
[144:59] i  think  we  would  have  been  or  would  we 
 have  literally  just  been  like  one  of  the 
 people  who  sent  like  paragraphs  on
[145:04] dating  apps  and  then  just  never  met  up 
 because  the  reason  why  we  were  attracted 
 to  each  other  was  honestly
[145:09] it  was  sexual  attraction  at  first  we 
 didn't  know  enough  about  each  other's 
 personality  we  met  just  because  we  knew 
 like  okay
[145:14] both  of  us  was  just  like  i'd  [ __ ]  this 
 book  i  was  just  like  this  guy's  a  dick 
 but  he's  good  looking  and  i  get  on  with
[145:19] him  so 
 yeah  i  was  thinking  about  myself  as  well 
 yeah  of  course
[145:25] you  have  a  god  complex 
 it's  not  a  complex  way  it's  just
[145:34] honestly  some  of  the  things  you  say  make 
 me  feel  physically  repulsed 
 like  literally  there's  been  so  many
[145:40] things  you  said  in  this  call 
 i  hope  he  texts  me  i  hope  he  texts  me
[145:46] today 
 well  that's  what  i'm  thinking  i  actually
[145:51] haven't  thought  that  since  we  broke  up 
 no  i'm  not  saying  you  broke  up  but  just 
 in  general  like  because
[145:56] near  the  start  obviously  you  were  saying 
 that  i  was  a  scumbag  i  was  a  dick  but  it 
 was  like
[146:02] as  soon  as  i  sent  you  the  message  you're 
 like  oh  yeah  let's  go  let's  go  meet  this 
 guy  oh  yeah 
 that's  another  thing  in  the  manipulation
[146:08] video  that  you  [ __ ]  lie  about 
 you're  like  oh  you  like  guys  won't
[146:13] believe  this  like  the  girl's  doing  all 
 the  work  like  she's  asking  to  see  me 
 literally  when  we  were  like  before  we
[146:18] were  in  a  relationship  i  probably  asked 
 to  see  you  like 
 three  or  four  times  and  we  saw  each 
 other  like  three  times  a  week
[146:26] no  you  no  you  you  could  scroll  up  the 
 text  messages  at  first  it  was  mostly  me 
 and  then  it  began  to  be  you  like
[146:32] when  we  were  in  a  relationship  yeah  not 
 before  that  not  hard
[146:37] yeah  like  even  then  we  can  say  that  this 
 is 
 like  weirdly  your  level  of  manipulation
[146:43] where  even  though  you  wanted  to  see  me 
 you  knew  for  a  fact  i'd  be  messaging  you 
 today  or  tomorrow  anyway
[146:48] so  yeah  i  mean  so  you  can  shut  the  [ __ ] 
 up  you  just  didn't  want  to  put  yourself 
 the  manipulation  that's  just  i  don't
[146:54] want  to  be  the  one  to  ask  but  i  know 
 he's  going  to  ask  me 
 there  we  go  the  first  time
[147:07] let's  see  let's  see  what  else  oh  no  no 
 more  of  the  negative  [ __ ] 
 i'm  done  there  is  negative  stuff
[147:18] [Music]
[147:28] 11. 
 oh  that's  not  bad  reason  number  eleven
[147:33] why 
 uh  what  what  i  didn't  i  haven't  actually
[147:40] titled  it  why  eve  is  trash  but  we  can 
 say  that's 
 that's  the  list  is  number  11.  she  wanted
[147:45] to  continue  her  plans  which  she  made 
 when  she  was  single  and  everyone 
 supported  that
[147:50] you  already  knew  that  to  be  honest  i'll 
 let  you  re-roll  for  another  one 
 because  there's  some  juicy  ones  on  this
[147:56] read  me  the  juiciest 
 no  you  cut  you  guessed  the  number
[148:01] 17  17.
[148:10] oh  interesting 
 she  would  have  pressured  me  into
[148:16] marriage  and  like  a  dumbass  i  would  have 
 considered  it
[148:22] i  would  have  pressured  you  into  marriage 
 100. 
 no  100  that  actually  leads  me  on  to  what
[148:28] i  was  going  to  say 
 yeah  because  when  we  first  met  you 
 didn't  even  want  you  i  remember  asking 
 you 
 do  you  think  you'll  ever  get  into  a
[148:34] relationship  at  any  point  in  your  life 
 and  you're  like  no 
 no  he  didn't  say  that  i  did
[148:40] i  might  say  do  you  think  you  have  to  get 
 in  a  relationship  and  you're  like  no
[148:45] no  no  that's  that's  not  true  at  all  yeah 
 if  we  had  i  don't  remember  having  this 
 conversation  but  if
[148:50] if  you  asked  me  if  i  ever  wanted  to  be 
 in  a  relationship  for  the  rest  of  my 
 life 
 not  ever  i  probably  didn't  say  ever  i
[148:56] probably  said  can  you  see  yourself 
 getting  into  a  relationship 
 you're  like  no  yeah  but  could  you  at
[149:01] that  point  though 
 exactly  no  it  hit  us  both  yeah  i  wasn't 
 talking  about  with  me
[149:07] i  just  meant  in  general  because  i 
 couldn't  see  myself  getting  in  the 
 relationship  with  you  so  i  wasn't 
 talking  about  me 
 yeah  but  just  in  general  like  i  wasn't
[149:13] expecting  it  with  you  or  with  anyone 
 and  you  went  i  think  you  were  the  same 
 when  you  it  just  kind  of  happened
[149:18] yeah  that's  true  but  um
[149:23] you  have  in  the  terms  of  like 
 male  and  female  roles  you  have  like
[149:29] traditional 
 values  would  you  say  yeah  so
[149:34] do  you  think  that's  like  you  think  no 
 um  so  like  a  woman  should  be  submissive
[149:41] man  should  be  dominant 
 that's  what  you  said  but  i  think  it's
[149:46] you  can't  really  in  my  opinion  i  don't 
 think  you  can  really  pick  and  choose
[149:51] things  to  be  traditional  about  when 
 you  your  relationship  with  women  is 
 untraditional
[149:57] oh  casual  sex
[150:04] is  untraditional  not  necessarily  for 
 these  times  but  it's  also  for  these 
 times
[150:09] the  views  that  you  have  for  male  and 
 female  roles  are  very 
 outdated  and  not  traditional  so  and  also
[150:15] like 
 marriage  like  you  said  you  won't  get 
 married  that's  very  traditional 
 so  you  can't  really  say  oh  men  should  be
[150:22] this  and  women  should  be  this 
 unless  you  want  to  do  that  when  when  you 
 don't  have  the  whole
[150:27] traditional  problems
[150:34] we  got  him  girls  that's  a  very  good 
 point  actually 
 i  appreciate  you  bringing  that  up  i've
[150:39] never  even  considered  that  like  i  i  do 
 you  you  know  me  i'd  have  very  much
[150:44] valued  like  the  traditional  sense  of 
 like  man 
 because  these  days  like  relationship
[150:49] like  dynamics  are  just  [ __ ] 
 it's  like  both  of  them  are  dominant  or 
 usually  the  man  is  actually  submissive
[150:54] and  it  excuse  the  whole  thing  that  even 
 if  people  can  get  in  a  relationship  and
[150:59] stay  in  it 
 the  girl  always  resents  a  guy  who's  more 
 who's  less  dominant  than  she  is  no
[151:04] matter  if  she  wants  to  pretend  like 
 she's  like 
 not  as  dumb  it's  like  subconsciously  it 
 it  isn't  right
[151:09] even  we're  not  allowed  to  say  it's 
 offensive  but  subconsciously  it's  like 
 human  nature  is  that  the  man  is  more
[151:14] dominant  and  the  woman  is  more 
 submissive 
 and  yeah  i  do  agree  with  that
[151:19] well  i  think  i  want  that  without 
 actually  doing  the  rest  of  it 
 this  traditionally  yeah  which
[151:26] you  can't  expect  yeah  that's  a  very  good 
 point  and 
 it's  actually  something  i  realized  not
[151:31] completely  but 
 i  think  as  we  were  getting  together  and 
 i  was  i  was  drifting  away  from  casual
[151:36] sex  and  that 
 because  the  fulfillment  that  i  got  from 
 you  was 
 uncomparable  to  when  i  meet  girls
[151:44] just  to  sleep  with  them  and  i  always 
 find  myself 
 casually  sleeping  with  girls  and  wanting
[151:51] something  more  like  wanting  essentially 
 honestly  exactly  what  we  had  but 
 attracting  the  wrong  girls  from  that
[151:57] and  it's  more  like  easier  or  it's  easier 
 to  be  successful  with  that
[152:03] to  to  start  as  the  [ __ ]  boy  to  start  as 
 a  casual  sex  and  to  move  over  to
[152:08] the  relationship  because  you're  going  to 
 get  more  girls  like  this  but  the  issue 
 is  that  the  girls 
 you  attract  with  this  generally  don't
[152:14] fit  in  with  this 
 and  i  think  that  that  maybe  is  what 
 happened  with  us  is
[152:19] i  like  i  tried  we  went  into  the  casual 
 sex  thing  but  we 
 yeah  to  transition  that  into  a  long-term
[152:25] relationship  it  doesn't 
 generally  work  i  think  that's  the  i
[152:30] think  that's 
 the  issue  with  us  because  i'm  not  like 
 a  casual  like  i'm  not  like  you  in  terms
[152:37] of  like  my 
 i'm  not  like  the  other  girls  i'm  not 
 like  no  i'm 
 honestly  i'm  like
[152:44] like  i've  not  been  with  many  people  you 
 know  that  um
[152:51] so  i'm  not  like  i've  never 
 really  like  been  in  that  scene
[152:59] like  at  all  so  i  i  feel  like  this  like 
 [ __ ]  girl  i'm  really  surprised  that  you 
 say  that  i  had  like  a  [ __ ]  girl  persona
[153:05] because 
 like  that  couldn't  be  the  first  thing
[153:11] the  res  what  do  you  say  the  results  of 
 that 
 if  you  were  single  for  longer  put  in
[153:19] yeah  like  you  had  the  personality  and 
 the  behavior  of  it  you  just  didn't  have 
 enough  time  to
[153:24] essentially  get  the  the  body  count  up 
 and  i  think  with  some  time  you  yeah 
 maybe 
 when  you're  single  now  you're  gonna  go
[153:30] to  uni  you're  gonna  do  your  masters  and 
 everything  you'll  go  to  like 
 a  double  digit  body  count  and  then 
 triple  digit
[153:37] you're  going  to  be  a  triple  digits  are 
 you 
 you're  going  to  be  a  triple  digit  not
[153:43] like  you 
 no  i'm  not  that  i  mean  maybe
[153:48] that's  not  it's  not  going  to  be  me  i'm 
 not  like  you  i  don't  just  [ __ ]  anything
[153:54] that's  what  i  did  with  you  you  have  to 
 lower  the  standards  way  down
[153:59] i  might  just  drop  one  in  there 
 it  literally  goes  against  everything  you
[154:04] said  in  this  thing
[154:09] um  yeah 
 i  just  think  with  our  relationship  it
[154:17] seemed  very  much  like  it  was  like 
 for  a  lot  of  things  it  was  like  me  or 
 this
[154:22] like  i  feel  like  you  i  remember  when  i 
 came  back  to  uni  and  yeah 
 i  probably  shouldn't  have  come  back  to
[154:27] uni  like  we've  been  in  a  relationship 
 for  what  like 
 two  three  weeks  and  i  came  back  to  york
[154:32] which  yeah  i  probably 
 i  shouldn't  have  done  and  i  completely 
 understand  like  your
[154:37] view  on  that  like  100 
 um  but  then  also  i  think  it  needs  to  be
[154:43] considered  that  it  was  like  my  last  bit 
 of  time  here  like  i'm  never  gonna
[154:48] live  in  york  again  which  is  like  why 
 i've 
 stayed  here  when  everyone  else  has  gone
[154:53] because  i'm  just  like  i  wanna 
 be  here  but  um  that  didn't  mean  i  didn't 
 want  to  be  with  you  and
[154:59] you  said  bro  i  remember  you  saying  like 
 around  about  the  time  we  were  breaking 
 up  you're  like  oh  you 
 you  put  your  friends  above  me  which  i
[155:05] can  understand  why  you  feel  that  way  100 
 um  because  obviously  when  i  was  coming
[155:10] back  to  uni  i  was  like  oh like  grace  is 
 on  their  own  like  i  need  to  come  back 
 and  be  with  grace  and  all  this
[155:15] which  i  remember  you  saying  like  oh  you 
 put  being  with  grace  above  being  with  me
[155:22] but  the  thing  is  being  with  you  like  i 
 thought  i  was  going  to  spend  my  whole 
 life  with  you 
 what's  three  weeks  when  we've  got
[155:28] forever 
 when  i've  already  made  that  promise  to 
 my  friend  i'd  already  promised  her  that
[155:34] i  was  coming  back  two  weeks  before 
 and  if  i'd  have  told  her  that  i  wasn't 
 going  to  come  back  she  wouldn't  have 
 come  back  either
[155:40] so  that's  like  i  think  it's  it's 
 it  is  difficult  to  say  because  i 
 understand  your  perspective  on  it  but
[155:46] also  like 
 my  care  and  my  like  want  to 
 actually  like  spend  like  not  a  lot  of
[155:52] time  but  like  some  time  with  my  friends 
 never  ever  would  have  invalidated  my
[155:57] like  love  and  commitment  towards  you 
 and  i  don't  think  you  understood  that
[156:02] i  think  you  thought  that  it  was  like  me 
 choosing  my  friends  over  you  but  that 
 was  never  the  case
[156:07] but  that  i  think  i  think  you  can  see 
 it's  like  objectively  it  did 
 look  like  that  if  you  look  at  it  from
[156:13] the  outside 
 we  get  into  a  relationship  and  you  know 
 it's  like  literally  honeymoon  period
[156:18] we're  so  close  and  then  straight  away 
 you're  going  away  for  it  you're  going 
 away  for  as  long  as  we've  been  together
[156:24] and  yeah  you  know  i'll  come  and  see  you 
 for  like  a  couple  of  days  but  it's  like 
 it's  just  strange  to  do  that  but  i  think
[156:31] when  i  look  back  at  it 
 at  that  time  i  was  like  quite  resentful 
 and  i  was  quite  like  worried  and
[156:36] everything  for  it  but  now  when  i  look 
 it's  like 
 it  was  honestly  just  an  unideal 
 situation  where
[156:41] i  understand  why  you  went  and 
 i  i  was  really  really  looking  at  it  from
[156:47] your  point  of  view  and  even  my  point  of 
 view  which 
 i  was  thinking  okay  if  i  was  back  in 
 that  student  accommodation  which  i  used
[156:52] to  like  and  it  was  going  to  be  my  last 
 time  there 
 like  it  would  be  awesome  to  have  like
[156:57] three  weeks  there  even  if  it  would  make 
 you  feel  anxious 
 like  i  remember  i  remember  when  the
[157:02] lease  ended 
 in  the  place  that  you  with  with  your  ex 
 and  like  she'd  left  remember  you
[157:08] would  always  talk  about  it  and  you 
 remember  you  even  messaged  me  saying 
 like  oh  if  i  try  and  get  the  keys  like 
 like  we'll  go  and  we'll  spend  a  couple
[157:14] of  nights  there  like  that  was  you  really 
 wanting  to  go  and  spend  time 
 in  this  last  place  yeah  and  that's  what
[157:21] i  wanted  to  do 
 and  be  with  my  friends  who  like  one  of 
 my  friends  lives  in  guernsey
[157:26] when  am  i  ever  going  to  see  her  my  other 
 friends  live  in  london 
 like  realistically  how  often  am  i  going
[157:31] to  see  them  like  what  once  or  twice  a 
 year 
 if  that  and  this  was  the  last  bit  of
[157:37] time  that  i  had  here  i  mean 
 yeah  i  had  more  time  after  that  but  that 
 was  the  last  bit  of  time  that  i  was
[157:42] choosing  to  go  there 
 and  yeah  i've  come  back  like  sounds 
 contradictory  because  i'm  saying  like 
 that  was  my  last  bit  of  time  when  i'm
[157:47] literally  here  now 
 when  we've  been  broken  up  a  month  but 
 like  that  was
[157:52] like  i  remember  saying  to  you  like  i'm 
 gonna  come  for  this  amount  of  time  and 
 then  i'm  gonna  just  come  back  and  just 
 not  have  the  rest  of  the  lease  like  i
[157:57] was  planning  on  just  coming  and  staying 
 at  home  and  obviously  i  only  came  back 
 i  came  back  here  for  six  days  and  then
[158:03] went  home  because  you  broke  up  with  me 
 and  then  we  got  back  together  and  then
[158:08] broke  up  again  two  days  later 
 um  it was  a  horrible  week  god  that  was
[158:14] literally  like 
 like  that  showed  me  the  effect  that  an 
 attachment  can  have  when
[158:19] it  literally  made  me  feel  like  i  was 
 genuinely  sick
[158:24] like  i  know  i  literally  got  a  feeling 
 from  that  and  of  course 
 like  you  know  could  have  been 
 coincidence  or  something  like  i  got  a
[158:29] fever  randomly 
 but  i  think  it  genuinely  was  just  caused 
 by  forming  a  such  a  stronger  connection
[158:35] and  then  just  seeing  it  like 
 like  falling  apart  i  think  and  i  think
[158:41] that's  like  a 
 a  big  thing  like  people  in  my  life  that 
 i  need  like  i  would  want  people  in
[158:46] my  life  to  understand  is  like  like 
 obviously  everyone  in  my  life  has  a  very
[158:51] very  very  negative  opinion  of  you  and 
 you  know  i  actually  spend  a  lot  of  time
[158:56] defending  you  which  i  i  don't  like  and  i 
 get  called  out  for 
 all  the  time  but  um  just  joining  with
[159:02] him  like  yeah  he  wasn't  there 
 i  do  usually  join  him  but  then  like
[159:07] i  feel  like  they  don't  just  [ __ ] 
 say  that  so  i  do  usually  join  in  and
[159:12] then  move  the  topic  of  the  conversation 
 i  wasn't  moving  i  was  carrying  on  no  i
[159:18] mean  like 
 i  do  have  mainly  negative  feelings 
 towards  you
[159:23] probably  not  after  this  call  but  like  i 
 did  have  mainly  noticed  fearless  towards 
 you  but  like
[159:28] like  people  seem  to  think  that  i  was 
 completely  a  victim  in  this  which  like
[159:35] to  some  extent  yeah 
 but  also  like  you  were  hurt  as  well 
 like  it  was  a  very  hurtful  situation  for
[159:41] both  of  us  it  wasn't 
 one  of  us  was  hurting  the  other  person 
 it  was  was  both  hurting  each  other  and
[159:46] the  situation  hurting  both  of  us 
 like  it  was  my  friend  because  my
[159:51] if  i  like  the  guys  i  speak  to  only  have 
 like  the  negative  view  of  you  even 
 though
[159:56] i  said  so  much  positive  stuff  about  you 
 like  just  you  know  the  days  before 
 everything  happened
[160:01] so  when  it  comes  up  obviously  we're  just 
 like  insulting  you  and  [ __ ] 
 but
[160:09] what  do  you  say  when  you  insult  me  sam 
 always  calls  you  a  wench
[160:14] i  think  you're  like  oh  when  she  got  me 
 that  when  we  were  together 
 not  a  when  sam
[160:24] [Laughter]
[160:31] it's  how  i  expect  our  like  social  circle 
 to 
 because  all  your  friends  and  all  your
[160:36] family  are  not  just  going  to  suddenly 
 say  oh  hamza  was  a  great  they're  not 
 going  to  say  are  they  like  maybe  you'll 
 come  up  every  now  and  then  in  a  couple
[160:42] of  months  time  or  something  when  you're 
 reminiscing 
 oh  yeah  he  was  actually  called  for 
 setting  you  up  with
[160:47] mindfulness  or  something  but  right  now 
 easier 
 it's  like  nicer  for  our  friends  to  say
[160:52] bad  stuff  about  us  because 
 it  kind  of  helps  us  because  yeah  our
[160:58] minds  automatically  been  generated  more 
 negative  than  positive  because  positive 
 would  mean  that 
 we'd  want  this  connection  again  and  yeah
[161:05] i  wonder  what  it's  going  to  be  like 
 after  this  call  because  it's  definitely 
 going  to  at  least  for  me  it's  good 
 yeah  it  is  for  you  as  well  to  be  honest
[161:11] it's  going  to  be  like  more  positive  than 
 it  has  been 
 yeah  which  i  am  i'm  actually  really 
 looking  forward  to  that
[161:16] because  even  if  it  kind  of  hurts  and 
 more  in  the  sense  of  like  an  attachment 
 being  broken
[161:21] and  we  miss  each  other  more  i  i  actually 
 want  to  experience  that  than  just
[161:26] negativity  and  resent  in  you  like  i 
 actually  just  want  to  miss  you  i 
 i  want  to  feel  like  i  look  back  and  i
[161:33] cry  at  like 
 all  the  happy  moments  rather  than  look 
 back  with  like  anger  for  the  bad  moments
[161:38] that's  what  i  say  to  people  like  like 
 when  my  friends  are  really  trying  to
[161:43] but  it's  not  like  they're  trying  to  make 
 me  feel  negative  about  it  like  they  do 
 feel  negative  about  it  they  will  like  if
[161:48] i  was 
 my  friend  i'd  be  saying  the  exact  same 
 thing  i'm  saying  a  lot  of  the  same 
 things  that  they  aren't
[161:54] i'm  like  sat  here  like  oh  yeah  like  i 
 didn't  say  nice  things  like  i  literally 
 say  that  i  like  hate  you  all  the  time  i
[161:59] [ __ ]  hate  you 
 that  means  you  still  fancy  me
[162:04] [Laughter]
[162:10] um  i  forgot  what  i was  even  saying 
 what  was  i  even  saying
[162:19] it's  really  gonna  piss  me  off  because  it 
 was  a  good  point  as  well
[162:27] i  can't  think  but  no  like  friends  are 
 obviously  gonna  say  more  negative  stuff 
 but
[162:32] um  like  you  know  i'd  say  there's  more 
 positive  than  there  was  more  positive
[162:38] than  bad  in  our  relationship 
 like  it  was  eight  months  of  good  but  i
[162:43] think  the  bad  outweighs  the  good 
 there  was  less  bad  but  the  bad  was  more
[162:48] serious  yeah  but  honestly  like 
 the  good  was  extreme  as  well  and  i  think
[162:53] that  we've  just  focused  on  the  bad  just 
 because 
 i  honestly  feel  at  least  for  me  i  focus
[162:58] on  the  bad  because  it's  been 
 easier  emotionally  to  focus  on  it  than 
 it  is  to  focus  on  the  good
[163:03] and  yeah  if  we  did  focus  on  the  good  if 
 for  example  like  it'd  be 
 counter-intuitive  maybe  but  if  we  like
[163:09] for  example  we're  like  proper  every  day 
 thinking  about  what  we  were  grateful  for 
 each  other  for  instead  of  thinking  oh
[163:14] i'm  grateful  it  ended 
 we  thought  okay  i'm  grateful  why  it 
 happened  and  what  happened  inside  of  it
[163:19] and  i'm  grateful  for  like  this 
 that  we  did  yeah  that  was  my  point  like 
 i  remember  saying  to  my  friends  like
[163:25] because  when  i  say  like  positive  things 
 like  sometimes  they're  all  like  a  bit 
 concerning  that  you 
 that  you  like  say  positive  things  but  i
[163:31] don't  want  to  be  filled  with  hate 
 yeah  i  don't  want  to  be  filled  with 
 resentment  i  don't  want  to  look  back  at
[163:36] this  time  of  my  life  and  be  like 
 and  feel  regrets  like  we've  had  a  great
[163:41] time  together  like 
 lockdown  would  have  been  horrible  if  if 
 we  didn't  have  each  other  in  our  lives
[163:47] like  there's  a  lot  of  positive  that  we 
 have  to  look  back  on  and  i  don't  want  to 
 look  back  and  see  red
[163:54] i  want  to  look  back  and  see  all  like  the 
 nice  memories  let  me  just 
 change  the  color  what  color  do  you  want
[163:59] to  look  back  on  like  should  we  put  green 
 you  know
[164:15] i  made  that  call  myself
[164:25] but  yeah 
 how  do  you  think  this  call  is  gonna
[164:31] change  things  for  you 
 or  do  you  think  it's  gonna  change  things 
 for  you  yeah  definitely
[164:36] i'm  gonna  i'm  already  seeing  you  in  a 
 way  more  positive  like  because  it's  not
[164:41] just  on  like  instagram  messages  which 
 feels  kind  of  cold 
 and  so  yeah  i've  been  kind  of  cold
[164:46] towards  your  messages 
 i  feel  like  like  you  went  back  i
[164:52] remember  the work 
 yeah  i  just  couldn't  like  i  couldn't
[164:57] be  that  lovey  side  towards  you  like  i 
 just  oh  it's  a  weird  angle
[165:02] i  couldn't  um  i  couldn't  i  couldn't  just 
 even  acknowledge  it  like  it  was  just
[165:07] too  painful  which  is  horrible  that's  the 
 first  time  in  my  life  i've 
 ever  like  shut  something  out  of  my  brain
[165:14] like  that's  the  first  time  i've  ever 
 like 
 like  i've  been  the  one  like  cutting
[165:19] contact  but  it  was  just 
 it  was  way  too  much  i  wasn't  caught  in 
 contact  but  do  you  know  what i  mean  like
[165:24] i 
 is
[165:36] but  like  i  was  the  one  who  like  blocked 
 you  and  deleted  your  number  and 
 unfollowed  you  and  everything  first  it
[165:41] was  like 
 yeah  but  that's  not  just  something  that 
 that's  not  something  that  i  do  anyway
[165:47] um  i  mean  whatever  it is  it  doesn't  have 
 to  be  a  competition  of 
 who  can  be  meaner  than  you're  the  first
[165:53] no  of  course  not  but 
 like  i  remember  like  i  sent  you  that 
 message 
 it's  telling  you  that  i  missed  you  and
[165:59] then  you'll  reply  oh  my  god  i 
 [ __ ]  strangle  you  and  i  got  that 
 reviled
[166:04] you  start  crying  but  then  i  was  like 
 afterwards  like  i  looked  it  and  i  was 
 like  wait
[166:09] like  you  asked  me  up  and  i  was  like  no 
 like  you  sent  me  voice  notes  like
[166:15] telling  like  tell  me  how  much  you  love 
 me  like  i  didn't 
 say  i  love  you  once  after  we  broke  up
[166:21] because  i  couldn't  allow  myself  to  say 
 it  and  i  was  like  i  can't  really  be 
 upset 
 that  he  sent  a  message  like  this  when
[166:27] i've  literally  just  like 
 not  said  i  love  you  back  or  although  my 
 responses  were  very  like
[166:32] robotic  yeah  it  felt  like  you  were 
 replying  as  if  like
[166:37] if  your  family  was  like  looking  over 
 your  shoulder  and  you  were  replying 
 no  obviously
[166:43] i'd  expect  it  not  to  be  true  to  be 
 honest  but  this  is  how  i  felt  towards 
 your  messages  it  was  like  it  wasn't  my
[166:50] eve  who  was  replying  it  was  like
[166:55] the  world's  e  it  was  like  you  know  the 
 [ __ ] 
 it  was  like  the  [ __ ]  girl  eve  it  was
[167:00] just  kind  of  like  oh  that's  the  way  to 
 cal  to  get
[167:06] i  don't  know  but  i  think  it's  i  couldn't 
 be 
 your  eve  it  wasn't  that  i  didn't  want  to
[167:12] like  i  just  couldn't 
 i  just  couldn't  show  that  side  to  you
[167:18] anymore  because 
 if  i  started  showing  that  side  it  it
[167:23] would  be  harder 
 i  think  if  you  did  try  it  outside  we 
 would  have  like  somehow  reconnected  i
[167:28] think 
 you  would  have  told  your  mum  that  you 
 were  meeting  someone  else  you  just  met 
 each  other 
 that's  why  i  didn't  meet  up  with  you
[167:33] because  i  knew  that  i'd  want  to  get  back 
 with  you  immediately 
 yeah  probably  we  did
[167:42] do  you  think  we  would  have  done  it  from 
 at  all
[167:47] like  we  would  have  like  reconnected  on 
 that  day 
 and  i  think  we  would  have  like  seen  like
[167:53] we  would  have  like  essentially  just  been 
 together  messaging  again 
 but  i  think  it  potentially  would  have 
 like  ended  again  within  us
[168:00] like  it  would  have  been  just  prolonging 
 the  pain  um 
 yeah  that's  what  i  look  like  i  am  like
[168:05] grateful  like 
 it  was  an  awkward  situation  we  didn't
[168:10] really  break  up  your  family  broke  us  up 
 but 
 i  like  i  do  look  with  gratitude  for  that 
 because  i  don't  think  either  of  us  had
[168:16] like  the  ability  to  break  up  with  each 
 other  and  i  don't  know  if 
 our  like  we  ever  had  like  long
[168:22] term  do  you  think  we  had  potential  long 
 term
[168:28] um 
 it's  difficult  to  say  um  yeah
[168:37] i  couldn't  see  it  i  thought  i  thought  it 
 was  gonna  happen 
 yeah  we  were  planning  that  [ __ ]  like  we
[168:45] were  literally  like 
 fully  fun  in  it  yeah
[168:55] the  valley  i 
 [Laughter]
[169:04] don't  be  surprised  if  we  bump  into  each 
 other  in  bali  one  day  imagine  how  weird 
 that  would  be
[169:13] how's  your  youtube  channel  going 
 um  i've  not  posted  a  video  since
[169:19] the  last  one  with  you  in  the  thumbnail 
 yeah  did  you  delete  that  one
[169:24] i  deleted  it  i  privated  it  and  then  i 
 then  i  unlisted  it  and  i  put  it  on
[169:29] public  then  i  unlisted  it  and  i 
 [ __ ]  yeah  it's  on  public  now
[169:36] yeah  what  did  you  see  that  i  deleted  it 
 i  think  sam  told  me
[169:41] that  you  deleted  it  and  then  i  think  i  i 
 unsubscribed 
 see  i  smash  that  subscribe  button  i
[169:47] don't  want  to  see  that  [ __ ] 
 yeah  i  unsubscribed  from  you
[169:53] apologies  huh  apologies 
 that's  all  right  i've  got  plenty  more
[170:00] oh  really  how's  youtube  going
[170:05] have  you  not  seen
[170:16] i  mean  if  you  want  to  go  and  subscribe 
 then  maybe  you  can  uh 
 i  mean  i'll  subscribe  to  you  when  you
[170:21] subscribe  to  me 
 [Music]
[170:27] i  don't  want  to  see  a  video  on  your  page 
 how  i  really 
 began  to  love  my  life  is  just  you  with  a
[170:34] different
[170:48] i'll  let  you  report  your  video 
 do  you  think  if  i  well  when  i  post  a
[170:54] video  again  you'll  watch  it 
 i  wasn't  gonna  like  i  already  knew  to
[171:01] myself  if  i  do  see  you  post  one  that  it 
 would  hurt  watching  it  and  i  know 
 you  probably  would  speak  about  this  and
[171:07] it  would  hurt  yeah 
 but  i  think  now  i  i  probably  would 
 i  think  it  would  it  would  hurt  it  would
[171:13] make  me  feel  uncomfortable  because  i 
 know  that  you 
 know  you'd  be  spitting  truth  anyway  you 
 said  oh  well  how  my  relationship  ended
[171:19] and  he  was  he  was  toxic  he  was  abusive 
 but  i  feel  like 
 you'll  also  do  like  i  can  imagine  you 
 also  saying  but  i
[171:24] wasn't  perfect  either  you  know  i  was  i 
 was  this  i  was  there  so  you're  just 
 gonna  say  that  [ __ ]  i've  literally
[171:29] filmed  a  clip  of  me  saying  that  exactly 
 yeah  i  knew  you  would  have
[171:35] so  i  think  i  don't  i  don't  put  that  in 
 the  video 
 like  the  next  video  i've  done  i've  got
[171:41] it  like  pretty  much  finished  i  just  need 
 to  edit 
 it  we'll  finish  um
[171:47] i  feel  like  my  camera  angle  keeps 
 sliding  down  just  piss  me  off 
 um  right  in  my  dissertation  in  a  week
[171:55] [Music] 
 i  literally  wrote  it  in  like  five  days
[172:02] do  i  see  it
[172:21] how  many  pages  is  it  like
[172:26] 39
[172:31] yeah  9  968. 
 did  you  get  the  result  for  it  not  yet
[172:40] i  think  i'll  literally  get  it  any  time 
 in  the  next  few  days 
 [Music] 
 just  scary  i  hope  i've  done  well  [ __ ]
[172:47] proud  of  myself  for  the  last  few  months 
 you  know  like  not  a  few  months  like  last 
 month 
 obviously  with  like  this  breakup  and
[172:53] stuff  and  like  the  dissertation  and 
 the  topic  it  was  on  as  well  and  writing
[172:58] it  all  in  like  a  week  whilst  going 
 through  that  like 
 i'm  just  gonna  be  your  own  biggest  fan
[173:04] sometimes 
 i  know  i  feel  funny
[173:11] now  you  know  how  i  feel  god's  complex 
 [ __ ]  i'm  gonna  be  like  you  next
[173:17] um  yeah  i'm  just  looking  over  my  nose
[173:23] i  put  in  capitals  we  don't  use  our 
 insecurities  to  justify 
 abuse  manipulation  and  control
[173:33] i  think  i  think  the  biggest  thing  for  me 
 that  makes 
 me  see  you  was  controlling  is  it  all
[173:38] came  out  after  i  was  in  love  with  you 
 like  none  of  these  boundaries  were  set 
 into  place  before
[173:44] we  even  started  getting  into  a 
 relationship  and  i  think  if  they  had 
 been  we  wouldn't  have  gotten  to  one  yeah
[173:51] but  i  don't  think  that's 
 that's  like  a  a  good  point  though 
 because
[173:56] before  we  go  into  a  relationship  then  of 
 course  like  i'm  not  gonna  have 
 boundaries  for  you 
 because  yeah  of  course  but  i  mean  like
[174:01] when  we  started  getting  into  one 
 yeah  but  it  it  wasn't  something  like
[174:06] something  that  was  in  my  mind  to  think 
 like  okay 
 yeah  johnny  because  you  weren't  you 
 weren't  doing  the  stuff  then  anyway  so
[174:12] it  didn't  even  come  up 
 it  was  like  i  didn't  calculate  saying  oh 
 let  me  make  her  in  love  with  me  then  be
[174:17] really  strict 
 it  was  just  that  it  kind  of  happened 
 that  we  we  fell  in  love  and  then 
 the  opportunities  for  you  to  like  go  out
[174:23] and  plan  all  these  nights  out  then  came 
 and  of  course  the  boundaries  are 
 somewhat  going  to  get  stricter  when
[174:28] the  investment  is  higher  the  emotional 
 investment  is  higher 
 yeah  of  course  it  wasn't  honestly  like  i
[174:35] probably  am  manipulative 
 but  i  have  the  confidence  to  say  that 
 and  i  think  that 
 almost  every  single  person  has  to  say
[174:42] that  like  you  would  be  too  at  this  point 
 everyone  would  be 
 i  would  be  higher  than  everyone  else 
 because  i've  purposely  like
[174:49] researched  and  i  found  the  things  that 
 work  and  you  know  through 
 self-improvement  itself  is  manipulative
[174:54] but 
 then  you  know  i mean  at  this  point  it's 
 like  i'll  go  into  the  gym  as  manipulator
[174:59] is  someone  going  to  make  that  as  a  point 
 or  a  girl  getting  advice  from  her  friend
[175:04] in  terms  of  texting  a  guy  and  her  friend 
 says  oh  you  don't  do  this  like  don't 
 reply  to  him  just  yet  that's 
 manipulative  but
[175:09] is  anyone  gonna  join  it's  just  that
[175:14] i  can  be  branded  as as  a  guy  who's 
 manipulative  who's  controlling 
 and  i'll  take  it  but  i  don't  think  most
[175:20] of  the  people  would 
 like  if  that  is  what  manipulation  that 
 isn't  something  that  you  should  take
[175:26] that  isn't  something  you  should  take 
 that's  something  that  you  should 
 acknowledge  and  look  at  the  behaviors
[175:32] that  are  that  way 
 and  assess  and  think  right  what  can  i 
 change 
 and  learn  from  it  you're  always  about
[175:38] bettering  yourself  and  like  literally 
 your  whole  channel  is  about 
 self-improvement  like  use  this  to 
 improve  yourself
[175:45] goodbye  like  i  know  i  know  that  you  in 
 your  brain 
 telling  your  girlfriend  if  you  do  this
[175:52] i'll  leave  like  that  seems  justified 
 because 
 obviously  that  anxious  attachments  that
[175:58] you  don't  put  yourself  in  a  situation 
 that  makes  your  partner  anxious  which  i 
 i  do  agree  with  to  some  extent  but  it
[176:04] we  don't  tell  people  what  they  can  and 
 can't  do  and  yeah 
 ultimately  you  can  say  i  wasn't  telling
[176:09] you  what  you  can  and  can't  do  i  was  just 
 telling  you  if  you  do  certain  things  i'd 
 leave 
 but  that  is  telling  me  what  i  kind  of
[176:14] can't  do  because  i  don't  want  you  to 
 leave 
 i  won't  get  into  a  relationship  with  you 
 if  i  wanted  you  to  leave  so  of  course
[176:19] like 
 when  you're  saying  to  me  oh  if  you  do 
 this  i  feel  too  anxious  and  i'll  have  to 
 leave  that  is  telling  me  what  i  can  and
[176:24] can't  do  and  that's  making  me  choose 
 between  you 
 and  something  that  would  have  happened 
 like  so  how  should  i  have  done  that  then
[176:30] what  do  you  think  what  you  mean 
 like  put  yourself  in  my  shoes  that's  a
[176:35] boundary  that  i  want  to  like  make  clear 
 because 
 i  didn't  need  to  kind  of  express  it
[176:40] beforehand  before 
 it  came  up  that  you  wanted  to  like  start 
 you  know  to  go  to  this  club  or  something
[176:45] but  when  it  came  up  it  wasn't  because 
 i've  just  broken  up  with  you  straight 
 away
[176:50] what  do  you  mean  but  there  was  no 
 situation  where  i  wanted  to  go  to  a  club 
 the  only  situation  was  the  event  that  i
[176:56] booked  which  i  remembered  about  after 
 we'd  already  had  all  these  conversations 
 mm-hmm  but  it  didn't  remember  like  we
[177:02] were  speaking  about  it 
 like  like  what  i  kind  of  see  i  do  see
[177:07] your  point 
 and  i  am  beginning  to  agree  with  it  but 
 my  issue  is  then  is
[177:12] in  terms  of  improving  and  to  not  be 
 manipulative  or  to  set  these  like 
 controlling  boundaries
[177:17] how  because  the  only  other  way  is  to 
 just  never  get  into  a  relationship
[177:22] with  someone  who  could  potentially  cross 
 one  of  your  boundaries  which  honestly  is 
 probably  like 
 the  better  way  but  at  some  point
[177:30] no  matter  whether  you're  with  someone 
 who  never  ever  ever  goes  out 
 never  goes  to  clubs  never  puts
[177:35] themselves  in  that  environment  i'm  that 
 person 
 i  never  i  never  ever  ever  go  to  clubs
[177:40] like  ever  i  mean  obviously  it's  been 
 locked  down  since  you've  known  me  so 
 you  can  only  like  believe  so  much  but
[177:47] it's  never  been  me  second  year  of  uni 
 literally  went  out 
 twice  at  uni  it  was  literally  at  uni
[177:54] and  went  out  twice  in  the  whole  year  and 
 but  the  thing  is  even  if  you  get  with
[177:59] someone  who's  not  like  that  there's 
 going  to  be  if  you're  planning  on 
 spending  forever  together  that  is  gonna 
 be 
 a  point  where  i  would  have  gone  on  a
[178:05] night  out  without  you 
 that  is  gonna  happen  at  some  point  in
[178:10] forever 
 there's  gonna  be  a  point  where  you  can 
 go  on  a  night  out  with  your  boys  like 
 this 
 that's  what  happens  so  you  can't
[178:18] say  oh  i'm  never  gonna  i'm  not  gonna  get 
 with  someone  that  never  goes  to 
 nightclubs  like 
 that  was  me  i  never  go  to  nightfalls  but
[178:23] it  is  gonna  happen  at  some  point 
 and  you  can't  ruin  a  whole  relationship
[178:28] based  off  something  which 
 isn't  gonna  happen  like  yeah  they're 
 going  to  go  tonight  not  going  to  cheat 
 on  you
[178:33] and  you  your  fear  of  something  that 
 would  have 
 never  ever  ever  happened  ruined  our
[178:39] relationship 
 for  me
[178:44] and  the  reason  why  we  were  hesitant  to 
 get  into  a  relationship  was  because  of 
 your  trust  issues
[178:49] and  for  me  it  feels  like  it  ended 
 because  of  your  trust  issues  i  feel  like 
 it's  probably  very  different  from  you 
 but 
 we  both  have  different  experiences  from
[178:55] this  so 
 yeah  that's  true  no  i  can  see  it  as 
 that's  like  a  reasonable
[179:01] um  oh  i  need  to  sneeze  but  it's  just 
 like  teasing  me
[179:06] i  hate  that  sorry  what  were  you  saying
[179:12] um  i  can  see  that  as  like  a  reasonable 
 um  reason  for  you
[179:19] to  think  about  the  breakup  it's  not 
 exactly  the 
 the  thing  that  i  have  in  mind  but  to  be
[179:24] honest  it  kind  of  is  because 
 if  i  didn't  have  the  trust  issues  if  i 
 didn't  think
[179:29] like  if  i  didn't  need  to  keep  thinking 
 to  myself  okay  i'm  close  to  the  line  i 
 don't  feel  secure  in  this  relationship
[179:34] she  wants  to  go  do  this  like 
 40  single  girl  [ __ ]  then  it  would  have
[179:39] been  like  a  closer  connection  it  would 
 have  been  less  negativity  it  would  have 
 been 
 lesser  the  thing  that  ended  us  wouldn't
[179:44] have  ended  us 
 yeah  i  don't  know  because  i  mean
[179:50] maybe  we  would  have  ended  because  of 
 something  else  who  knows  but  because  we 
 ended  before  that
[179:57] because  i  broke  up  with  you  while  she 
 was  still  in  york 
 because  it  just  stopped  being  worth  it
[180:03] at  that  point 
 it  was  like  because  of  the  issues  that 
 you  have
[180:09] it  wouldn't  have  not  been  worth  it 
 that's  not  fair  to  say  like  all  those 
 shoes  you  have  is  the  issues  we  had
[180:14] because  yeah  yeah  i  agree  that's  caused 
 by  huge  i  mean  it  was  like 
 whether  or  not  you  know  it's  my  brain
[180:19] it's  irrational  but  it's  like  it  was  our 
 issues  and  it's  unfair  to  just  say  yeah
[180:27] yeah  yeah  sorry  you  had  less  trust 
 issues  simply  because 
 maybe  we're  like  built  different  but
[180:32] honestly  mostly  because  of  the 
 environment  because  you're  not  like
[180:37] going  to  fear  much 
 much  trust  with  the  things  that  i  do 
 which  is  just  my  routine  and  you  know
[180:43] the  biggest  thing  was  like  going  to  the 
 gym  rings  but  if  i  started  going  out 
 more  consistently  and  i  went  away  for  a
[180:48] couple  of  weeks  to  like  live  with  my 
 boys  for  a  bit 
 you  and  to  you  know  go  drinks  you  would 
 then  100  be  in  my  situation  in  it
[180:55] yeah  it  wasn't  exactly  issues  yeah  this 
 calls  like 
 opened  like  maybe  you  understand
[181:02] a  lot  of  things  more  and  i  feel  like 
 maybe  you 
 had  that  perception  of  me  like  coming  to
[181:08] uni  or  going  to  uni 
 because  of  the  perception  you  had  of  me 
 when  we  first  met  which  is  this  [ __ ]
[181:13] girl  persona 
 whereas  that  like  it  couldn't  ever  have 
 been  further  from  the  truth  for  me
[181:19] so  i  feel  like  you  i  feel  like  maybe 
 like 
 this  has  just  clicked  maybe  you  thought
[181:24] that  me  going  to  uni  is  going  to 
 put  me  into  like  being  like  that  because
[181:29] of  when  we  first  met  i 
 you  had  this  like  football  perception  of 
 me  yeah  that's  exactly  what  it  is  but
[181:34] that  isn't  me 
 that's  never  ever  ever  been  me  no  but
[181:39] that's 
 i  mean  you  know  it's  nice  for  you  to  say 
 that  but  it's  like
[181:44] that's  how  you  interact  with  me  it's  not 
 about  believing  you  because  it's  not
[181:49] like  i 
 disbelieve  you  it's  just  that  i  can  only 
 obviously  see  you  how  i've  seen  you 
 and  that  was  you  like  the  [ __ ]  girl
[181:55] obviously  is  like 
 the  wrong  word  because  you're  not  you're 
 not  even  a  [ __ ]  girl  and
[182:00] but  whatever  word  we  would  say  is  is 
 not  my  eve  not  like
[182:06] we  both  had  like  two  versions  where  it 
 was  like  i  was  your  hamza  you  were  my 
 eve  and  then  we  also  had  the  one  where
[182:11] we  were  like  the  tinder  version  like 
 we'll  say 
 yeah  number  two  he's  the  one  who  gets
[182:17] all  the  [ __ ] 
 and  so  you  were  like  that  that  was  like
[182:23] i 
 automatically  in  my  mind  is  like  you're 
 gonna  be  like
[182:28] basic  [ __ ]  like  social  media  eve  or 
 tinder  eve  when  you  go  and  to  be  honest 
 the  thing  is
[182:33] it  it  happened  that  was  exactly  like  one 
 hundred  percent  of  what  happened  is  you 
 went  it  happened  but  i  showed  to  you
[182:39] that  i  was  that  i 
 i  it  didn't  happen  but  my  behavior  made 
 it  seem  as  though  it  had
[182:44] someone  so  it  happened  john  mean  let's 
 just
[182:52] but  no  like  the  instagram  thing  like 
 [ __ ]  stupid  like 
 that's  right  literally  what
[182:59] i  kind  of  knew  would  happen  and 
 you  didn't  go  as  far  as  i  thought  you'd
[183:05] you  would  have  with  something  like  that 
 but  if  again  it's  the  situation  if  that 
 was  coupled  with  you  drinking  and  you
[183:10] were  all  out  for  drinks  and 
 there  was  a  couple  of  guys  that  you  were 
 all  speaking  it's  like  it  can  add  up 
 especially  when  you  vote  yeah  of  course
[183:15] but  it  would  have  never  happened 
 so  i  can  understand  why
[183:21] for  them  it  did  happen  how  i  expected  it 
 is 
 you  you  reverted  back  to
[183:29] tinder  girl  or  like  social  media  eve 
 which 
 but  you  only  saw  that  one  point  you  only
[183:35] saw  that  one  point  where 
 i  was  stupid  and  i  went  and  looked  at 
 who  you  were  following  on  instagram
[183:40] you  didn't  see  all  the  other  time  when  i 
 was  sat  in  my  room  meditating  and 
 journaling  and 
 that  they're  thinking  about  you  like
[183:46] when  i'm  at  uni  i  spend 
 a  very  small  amount  of  time  with  my 
 friends  the  most  the  most  part  of  the
[183:51] time  i  spend  on  my  own  and 
 you  can  say  i  remember  i  told  that  to 
 you  and  you  were  like  oh  why  do  you  want 
 to
[183:56] go  back  to  uni  but  i  like  the  routine  i 
 have  here  like 
 my  housemates  have  moved  out  i'm  still 
 here  on  my  own  for  two  weeks
[184:04] i  do  understand  that  a  lot  more  now 
 after  i  think
[184:09] when  we  were  like  fully  together  i 
 didn't  have  a  negative  perception  of 
 your  family  at  all  like  i  really  liked 
 them
[184:14] and  i  didn't  see  any  kind  of  negativity 
 from  them  so  when  you  would  say  like  oh 
 you  didn't  exactly  want  to  be  home  you'd
[184:19] rather  do  your  dissertation  here  because 
 it's 
 peaceful  and  everything  i  couldn't 
 really  understand  it  cause  i  was  just 
 thinking  let's  do  it  at  home
[184:25] obviously  whilst  everything  was  kicking 
 off  i  was  like  [ __ ]  this  is  like 
 why  she  actually  liked  being  there  and
[184:30] it  reminded  me  of  a  few  years  ago  when 
 i  really  liked  being  in  my  student
[184:35] accommodation  because  it'd  be  like 
 just  yelling  and  [ __ ]  in  my  house  and  i 
 thought  oh  yeah  that
[184:40] it  makes  sense  now  like  why  should  she 
 enjoys 
 living  out  because  she's  still  like  20
[184:45] something  in  it  she's  like  21  like 
 yeah  like  you're  what  three  twenty  four
[184:50] twenty  fours 
 yeah  how  was  your  birthday  huh
[184:56] was  your  birthday  yeah  it was  real  good 
 got  cake  kickboxing
[185:03] all  the  boys  were  like  messaging  me  like 
 happy  birthday  and  everything  that  i  got 
 a  little  bit  you  just  lay  that  card  into
[185:09] your  pillow  like 
 [Laughter]
[185:16] not  exactly
[185:29] yeah  we  just  like  checking  your  phone 
 waiting  for  me  to  reply 
 yeah  like  once  or  like  50  times
[185:39] yeah  i  don't  think  i  don't  think  i'm 
 shocked  by  your  reply
[185:44] put  him  i  don't  think  i've  fully  moved 
 on  from  you 
 no  i  haven't  i  found  it  difficult  to
[185:49] like  interact  i  was  speaking  to  some 
 about  this  like  the  last  few  days 
 especially  like  i've  been  trying  to  get 
 back  out  there  and  speak  to  girls
[185:55] and  i  literally  i  find  it  so  difficult 
 and  i  was  trying  to  think  why  and  i was
[186:00] thinking  i  was  like  am  i  [ __ ]  am  i 
 ugly  now  like  what  the  [ __ ]  like 
 and  i  didn't  even  like  have  it  in  my
[186:05] mind  at  all  up  until  this  call  and  i 
 just  realized  it  yeah  it's  because
[186:10] how  [ __ ]  my  soccer  and  how  can  you 
 like  try  and  speak  to  new  girls  when 
 you're  like  still  in  love  with  someone
[186:17] you  know  i  think  that's  like
[186:22] why  i've  been  the  way  i  have  been  just 
 kind  of  like  no  interest  in
[186:27] hmm  asexual 
 yeah  like  i've  been  in  like  situations
[186:34] and  stuff 
 and  i  was  just  like
[186:40] that's  just  not  that's  what  girls  they 
 have  to  get 
 pounded  they're  like  oh  don't  know
[186:45] whether  no
[186:50] what  situation  is  that  um
[187:00] i'm  sorry  harry  was  calling  me  oh  [ __ ]  i 
 didn't  realize  the  times
[187:08] three  hour  podcasting  the  [ __ ]  gonna 
 watch  this 
 three  hours  yeah  what  time  did  you  start
[187:16] for  [ __ ]
[187:23] didn't  realize  it  was  a  sign  um
[187:35] do  you  miss  me
[187:48] so  mad  like  all  these  poems  do  you  miss 
 me
[187:53] um  yeah 
 i  just  miss  like  the  the  good  times
[188:03] i'm  not  sat  here  like  ah  oh  when  she 
 makes  me  cry  again 
 i  miss  that  [ __ ]
[188:09] the  good  times  like 
 yeah  i  kind  of  wish  i  could  re-lift  them
[188:16] sometimes  but 
 i  don't  feel  like  it  would  have  been 
 like  that  forever
[188:23] i  think  without  without  the  bad  times 
 it  would  have  and  i  don't  know  if  that
[188:29] like  makes  it  invalid  or  not  but  we 
 would  have  been  like 
 as  cute  together  forever  in  that  sense
[188:35] like 
 if  there  wasn't  a  bad  thing  then  we 
 would  have  still  been  like  how  cute  we 
 were
[188:40] even  when  we  were  like  something 
 still  going  on  drives
[188:50] finally  [ __ ]  finish  that  hike 
 [Laughter]
[188:56] for  like  10  minutes  let's  take  a  break 
 it  was  so  stumbling  oh  my  god  i  went  to
[189:02] the  beach  the  other  day  and  no  joke 
 burned  my 
 entire  body  like  i'm  so  sunburned  still
[189:08] i  think  i've  got  a  bit  of  a  tan  though 
 how  could  that
[189:13] go  over  time  but  um
[189:20] sorry  i  need  to
[189:33] sorry  harriet's  going  to  visit  me  so 
 she's  just  texting  me  um
[189:41] should  i  ask  my  questions  that  i  have 
 um  those  ones  yeah
[189:47] why  did  you  want  to  do  this  podcast
[189:53] i'd  be  lying  if  i  said  that 
 i  knew
[190:00] i'd  be  lying  if  i  said  that  i  didn't  do 
 this 
 knowing  that  it'd  get  better  views
[190:05] because  that's  like  it's  such  an 
 interesting  topic  to  see 
 two  exes  speak  especially  because
[190:10] they've  seen  me  on  the 
 um  videos  talking  about  you  they're 
 seeing  little  clips  of  you  throughout
[190:15] the  last  few  months 
 and  so  honestly  that  was  like  one  of  the 
 main  reasons
[190:20] but  also  it  was  like  my  own  curiosity  of 
 of
[190:28] you  know  like  it's  not  so  much  that  i've 
 wanted  to  actually  speak  about  our 
 relationship  in  the  sense  that  oh
[190:33] like  what  did  you  think  of  this  it 
 wasn't  even  that  it  was  literally  that
[190:38] i  just  felt  interested  in  speaking  to 
 you 
 and  i  just  knew  that  it  would  be  like  a
[190:43] good  conversation  even  if  it  was  a  bad 
 conversation  it  would  be 
 good  for  at  least  yeah  like  for  me  like
[190:49] yeah  just  i  was 
 hoping  that  you'd  come  on  here  and  just
[190:54] be  a  massive  dick  so  i  could  just  like 
 fully  just  be  like  oh  [ __ ]  that  guy  just 
 me  i  thought
[190:59] you  were  going  to  be  you  know 
 yeah  i  thought  you  were  going  to  be  like 
 full  on  like  like  i  had  some  [ __ ]
[191:05] good  comebacks  and  everything  like  i 
 would  [ __ ] 
 dropped  you  like  i  was  telling  them  to 
 simon  even  he  was  like  oh  my  god  i'm  so
[191:11] you  just  can't  read  anyone 
 they're  gone  no  god
[191:19] once  we're  good  oh  my  god  it's  that 
 hurtful 
 [ __ ]  yeah  just  in  case  if  you  wanted  to
[191:26] get  onto  the  hostility 
 i'll  just  go  through  the  four  four  point 
 combo
[191:33] okay  what  made  you  want  to  come  on  to 
 here
[191:38] i  think  i  kind  of  said  it  before  like  i 
 was  really  hesitant  to  speak  to  you
[191:43] right  after  we  broke  up  but  then 
 obviously  it's  been  like  one  month  now 
 like  just  over  a  month  probably  so  i
[191:50] think 
 it's  i've  realized  that  i  do  need 
 to  have  a  last  conversation  with  you
[191:57] like  talking  about  everything  and  like 
 was  both  getting  everything  off  our 
 chest  for  closure  that's  why  i  did
[192:03] how  did it  feel  news  isn't  even  a  part 
 of  it  for  me 
 yeah  where  did  you  feel  when  you
[192:09] messaged  because  i  was 
 you  know  it  disappeared  from  my  mind  but
[192:14] i  remember  you  messaged  me  saying  like 
 you  were  really  in  pain  and  you  really 
 missed  me  i 
 actually  felt  like  i  didn't  feel  that  at
[192:20] all  at  that  point  because  i  went  fully 
 into  like  i'm  not  thinking  about  girls 
 so  i  remember  messaging  you  like  oh  no
[192:26] i'm  good  i'm  happy  like  i  don't  want  to 
 speak  to  you  or  something  yeah 
 no  you  i  think  you  said  you've  already
[192:32] i'm  feeling  good 
 yeah  i  think  you  put  um  i'm  feeling
[192:38] much  happier  this  will  hurt  to  read  i 
 know  this  will  hurt  to  read  but  you 
 deserve  the  truth  and  i  was  like
[192:45] my  heart  but  um
[192:55] what  were  you  gonna  say  for  them  did  it 
 hurt  to  read
[193:00] yeah  i  was  already  in  a  mess  but  i  sent 
 you  that  message
[193:05] what  were  you  hoping  for  be  honest  like 
 completely  honest  and  unfiltered  were 
 you  hoping  for  me  to  say  like
[193:10] [ __ ]  me  too  huh
[193:16] i  wasn't  hoping  to  get  anything  from  it 
 i  just  wanted  to  let  you  know  how  i  felt 
 because  i  mean  like  going  from  sharing
[193:22] every  single  thought  that  came  into  my 
 brain  with  someone  to  having  absolutely 
 no  contact  as  i  would  [ __ ] 
 yeah  true
[193:29] i'm  glad  that  we're  both  on  like  pretty 
 much  the  same  page  now
[193:34] because 
 yeah  i  think  that's  what  you  wanted  like
[193:39] i  didn't  i  had  already  kind  of  moved  on 
 not  like  at  that  point  i  had  moved  on
[193:44] but  it  lasted  for  like 
 a  couple  of  weeks  whilst  i  wasn't  really 
 thinking  about  you  i  was  just  kind  of
[193:50] thinking  negatively  about  you 
 and  for  the  last  like  probably  week  week 
 and  a  half
[193:55] i  thought  like  a  quite  a  lot  more  about 
 you 
 and  i  think  i  will  think  a  lot  more
[194:00] about  you 
 yeah  but  more  in  life  you  think  got  me 
 every  day
[194:05] yeah  like  i  don't  know  like 
 20  something  times  a  day  probably
[194:13] yeah  it's  probably  about  the  same  amount 
 for  me  to  be  honest  what  like  what  are 
 you  doing  when  you  think  of  me
[194:20] oh  snap
[194:25] it's  not  like  it's  not  it's  nothing  like 
 that  is  there  like  certain  things  that 
 remind  you  of  me
[194:31] like  i'll  be  brushing  my  teeth  i 
 remember  the  video 
 of  oh  looks  like  around  the  video  of  me
[194:36] and  you  like  in  the  toilet  brushing  our 
 teeth  and  you  like  doing  a little 
 dance  and  everything
[194:44] remember  that  and  then  a lot  of  the 
 times  it's  just  me  kind  of 
 um  waking  up  like  the  moment  i  wake  up
[194:51] or  in 
 sure  yeah  now  when  i'm  sleeping  it's
[194:56] obvious  i'm  cuddling  my  pillow  thinking 
 about  you  and  [ __ ] 
 um  do  you  still  do  that  yeah
[195:05] every  now  and  then  i'll  throw  the  pillow 
 away  and  i'm  like  nah  i'm  not  gonna 
 leave  you  [ __ ]  off 
 like  halfway  through  the  night  i  just
[195:10] like  reach  back  for  it 
 i'm  sorry  is  it  always  thinking  about  me
[195:18] no  i  won't  lie  to  you  it  is  like  it  does 
 change 
 so  sometimes  i  do  think  about  like  my  ex
[195:24] before  you  sometimes  i  think  about  like 
 like  i've  spoke  to  like  a  couple  of 
 girls  over  the  last  month  or  so  so  i
[195:29] think  about  them  sometimes 
 but  i'd  say  it's  you  like  probably
[195:35] eighty  percent  of  the  time  no  it 
 it's  hard  to  say  because  you  can't  go
[195:40] back  now  eighty  percent  that's  what  it 
 is 
 no  i  was  gonna  say  it's  like
[195:45] it  would  be  100  but  it's  like  the  20  of 
 the  time  i've  like  purposely  thought
[195:50] like 
 oh  no  it's  probably  not  like  good  for  me 
 to  like  keep  thinking  about  it  yeah 
 so  it's  like  because  otherwise  it's  like
[195:56] if  there  is 
 like  i  love  you  right  now  more  than  i 
 love  anyone  else  and  so 
 it  is  going  to  be  like  if  i'm  going  to
[196:02] think  about  someone  in  a  sense  like  a 
 girl  like  you  know 
 i'm  cuddling  as  i  go  to  sleep  i'm  going
[196:07] to  think  about  you  in  it 
 yeah  of  course  do  you
[196:12] did  you  love  me  more  than  you  loved  the 
 other  girls  in  the  past 
 it's  not  even  close
[196:22] next  question  next  question 
 see  ya  um
[196:31] one  of  my  questions  i  mean  you've 
 answered  it  already  but  it  was 
 did  you  really  feel  the  way  you  said  you
[196:37] did  i  think  we  both  know 
 did  you  ever  feel  like  i  didn't  like  you
[196:42] can't  fake  that  [ __ ] 
 i  think  you  might  have  like  sometimes 
 gotten  the  idea  like  oh  wait  he  couldn't
[196:47] have  like  loved  me  if  he  was  being 
 controlling  or  something  or  manipulative 
 if  it  weren't  for  the  tears  yeah  but
[196:53] you've  got  to  think 
 okay  even  if  i  was  at  everything  you  say 
 manipulative  abusive  is  like
[196:59] that  wasn't  out  of  hate  that  was  that 
 was  like  my  [ __ ]  version  of  love 
 yeah  of  course  that's  a  hundred  percent
[197:05] like  that's  what  i've  always  said  is 
 you  loved  me  but  maybe  it's  in  your  own
[197:11] weird  way  yeah 
 did  you  feel  genuine  towards  everything
[197:17] you  said 
 to  you  what  do  you  think
[197:28] i've  had  in  my  mind  recently  like  i 
 don't  know  if  i've  tried  to  like 
 convince  myself  or  not  but  i  haven't  had 
 in  my  mind  like
[197:34] she  couldn't  have  meant  all  that  stuff 
 if  this  is  like  how  it  ended  if  this  is
[197:39] yeah  like  her  reaction  if  we  ended  and 
 and  she  didn't  even  message  me  properly 
 like  to  say  goodbye
[197:44] i  you  know  i  wrote  her  like  a  letter  and 
 i  even  wrote  on  it  like  i  would  be 
 grateful  if  you  wrote  me  one
[197:49] and  she  didn't  do  and  i  was  going  to  i 
 was  going  to 
 i  was  going  to  after  my  dissertation  i
[197:55] just 
 i  wrote  i  wrote  so  many
[198:00] letters  to  you  but  i  just  never  sent 
 them  some  of  them
[198:05] never  like  crumpled  them  always 
 i  mean  not  handwritten  ones  i've  written 
 on  my  notes  on  my  phone
[198:11] you  still  got  them  yeah  send  me  them
[198:16] right  now  yeah  okay  are  you  going  to 
 block  me 
 right  now  no  i  won't  do  it  right  now
[198:22] because  i've  got  to  go  kind  of  soon 
 because  um  harriet's  on  her  way 
 to  meet  me  um  but  i'll  i'll  send  it  to
[198:29] you  after 
 after  the  call  yeah  are  you  gonna  block
[198:34] me 
 why  would  you  say  that
[198:41] i  just  assumed  that  you  would  i  don't 
 think  it's  like 
 everyone's  been  telling  me  to  block  you
[198:47] but  i  don't  think  it's 
 necessary  like  although  we  ended  on  bad
[198:52] terms  like  i  don't  want  us  to  look  back 
 and  be  like 
 resentful  towards  each  other  and  i  think 
 when  you
[199:00] oh  i  think  your  audio  is  just  cut  out
[199:05] yeah  what  do  you  say  um  i  said 
 like  although  obviously  we  ended  on  like
[199:10] very  bad  terms  like 
 i  don't  i  feel  like  when  you  block 
 someone  that  shows  like  resentment  and
[199:16] like 
 i  don't  know  it's  just  kind  of  like  i 
 don't  know  i  don't  know  what  my  opinion
[199:21] is  of  it  but 
 um  it's  easier  to  move  on  when  you  do 
 that
[199:26] and  that's  why  i  did  it  yeah  it  wasn't 
 out  of  like  like  i  didn't  have 
 resentment  towards  you  but 
 it  was  honestly  more  of  like  a  practical
[199:32] way  like  i  deleted 
 everything  off  you  like  i  was  on  the 
 call  with  the  boys  and  i  literally  went
[199:37] through  like 
 500  pictures  or  something  in  videos  and 
 then  she  deleted  them  and  even  showed  it
[199:42] to  the  boys  and  said  like  i've  deleted 
 them  from  the 
 recently  deleted  and  then  a  few  of  them
[199:48] did  yeah  yeah  but  i  left  them  i  recently 
 deleted 
 and  then  they  left  my  recently  deleted
[199:53] the  other  day 
 i  was  actually  hoping  you  didn't
[199:58] actually  wanted  them  back  because  i  was 
 hoping  you  didn't  because  i  wanted  them
[200:03] it's  so  mad  like  all  these  things  that  i 
 think  like  my  assumption  was  after  we 
 broke  up  like  you  just  went  back  to  like
[200:09] just  seeing  loads  of  people  like  just 
 didn't  give  a  [ __ ]  like  just  completely 
 shut  your  emotions  off  but  like  but  then
[200:14] i'm  like  oh  what  if  he  is  thinking  this 
 and  like  this  chord  made  me  realize  that 
 you  were 
 thinking  all  the  things  i  thought  you 
 were  like  i  forget  that  we're  like
[200:21] we  are  very  similar  yeah  that's  why  we 
 like  we  got  something 
 like  the  same  person
[200:28] because  it  makes  me  feel  like  it  didn't 
 even  exist 
 like  we  do  obviously  we've  got  those
[200:33] memories  and  we  will  look  back  with  a 
 bit  more  positivity  after  this  call 
 but  there's  just  so  much  like  substance
[200:38] when  you've  actually  got  videos  and 
 pictures  and  you  can  actually  still  got 
 some  of  them 
 i  think  i  kept  a  few  but  i  hid  them  in
[200:44] my  camera  roll 
 a  good  few  yeah  i  am  kind  of  sad  that  i
[200:50] deleted  them 
 because  like  it's  literally  all  of
[200:56] pretty  much  all  of  like  both  of  our 
 memories  from  the  last  like  eight  months 
 gone  because  most  of  them  were  together
[201:03] i  have  like 
 a  very  very  limited  amount  of  them  like 
 and  they  they're  not  the  ones  where  it's
[201:09] so  clear  that  it's  lost  you  know  in  like 
 the  the  picture  of  if  you  were  scrolling 
 you  can't  see  it  so
[201:14] it's  maybe  just  like  a  dark  rectangle 
 and  i'd  like  i  saw  it  and  i  was  like  i 
 know  what  this  is  i  clicked  on  it  or
[201:19] freestyling 
 oh  is  it  have  you  kept  that  one  or  did 
 you  complete  it  yeah  i've  got  like
[201:25] five  freestyle  videos  of  us  i've  got  one 
 i  was  hoping  that  you  i  was  thinking 
 about  the  freestyle  videos  like  a  couple
[201:30] of  weeks  ago  and  i was  like 
 i've  still  got  all  the  things  that  you 
 sent  me  on  like  text  because  i've  still
[201:36] got  our  text  conversation  i  didn't 
 delete  that 
 oh  there's  like  we  i  sent  you  like  bare
[201:41] pictures  of  us  something 
 since  we  got  all  them  oh  i  sent  me  them
[201:47] i'm  gonna  save  them  this  time  okay
[201:53] i  feel  like  this  has  been  good  for  both 
 of  us  i  feel  like  it's  probably  going  to 
 hurt  a  little  bit  more  afterwards  but
[201:59] it's  like  a  good  pain  though  yeah  it's 
 like
[202:04] i  feel  like  i'm  like  obviously  i  do  i 
 still  have  negative  feelings  towards  you 
 like  i'm  not  going  to  say  that  i  don't
[202:09] because 
 i  do  think  that  you  have  had  a  negative 
 you've  had  a  very  positive  influence  on
[202:14] me  but  you've  also  had  a  negative 
 impact  on  me  yeah  um
[202:19] so  i  do  hold  some  bad  feelings  of  course 
 and 
 but  i  think  just  hearing  what  you  have
[202:25] to  say  and  also  like  hearing  you  say 
 that  you  agree  with  some  of  the  things 
 i've  said  and  like 
 i  hope  it's  changed  your  perspective
[202:32] into  some  extent 
 i  know  obviously  i  can't  fully  change 
 your  mindset  i  wish  i  could  but
[202:38] we'll  be  in  this  situation  if  we  could
[202:48] [Music]
[203:00] um  was  actually  thinking 
 i  would  be  gonna  do  that  nah  that's  too
[203:06] much 
 it's  too  much  you  can't  leave  me  hanging
[203:17] [Laughter]
[203:27] it's  nice  to  be  that's  nice  speaking  to 
 you  too
[203:32] i  mean  it's  not  so  far  away  i  couldn't 
 even  like  fully  recognize  you 
 yeah  i  couldn't  fully  recognize  you  but
[203:38] we've  both  done  that  like 
 subconsciously  but
[203:43] i'm  like  i  can't  i  can't  even  like 
 see  you  like  how  i  see  you  like  it's  not
[203:52] i  don't  know  like  when  i  was  even 
 looking  at  your  instagram  pictures  the 
 other  day  when  i  messaged  you 
 to  come  onto  the  podcast  i  was  trying  to
[203:59] think  of  like  which  picture  actually 
 like 
 looked  like  you  because  i  said  this  to 
 you  before  it's  like  that's  not  like
[204:04] that's  not  eve  i  found  your  pictures 
 it's  like  that's  not  how  you  look  like 
 to  me 
 really  is  this  not  how  i  look  like  you
[204:12] it  kind  of  is  but  it's  like  it's  a 
 different 
 i  think  what's  ingrained  in  my  mind  is
[204:20] like  when  we  when  we're  like 
 fully  fully  like  like  we  look  at  each 
 other  different
[204:25] when  we're  like  vulnerable  and  we're 
 connected  to  each  other  and  we're  like 
 fully  in  love  with  each  other  and  that's
[204:31] what's  like  the  image  of  who  eve 
 is  like  right  now  you  look  like  your
[204:36] instagram  pictures  which  is  still  like 
 is  it's  acceptable
[204:42] i  like  that  you've  still  got  me  tagged 
 in  that  picture 
 yeah  have  you  been  checking  if  i  haven't
[204:48] removed  you 
 i've  been  checking
[205:01] it's  like  almost  robotic  like  i'll  click 
 on  your  name  to  message  you  and  i'll  let 
 you  just  go  into  your  profile  click  on 
 that  picture  tap  on  it  once  okay  good
[205:06] i'm  still  there 
 i'm  good  so  we're  good  now  yeah  that's 
 what  i  that's  what  i  do
[205:14] like  how  often  do  i  check  it  yeah  put  in 
 like  10  15  times  of  like  last  month  like
[205:20] every  time  we're  speaking  if  you  go  onto 
 my  profile  you  checked  it 
 oh  i  was  doing  it  every  day  at  one  point
[205:26] multiple  times  a  day 
 yeah  i  think  the  last  time  i  did  it  was
[205:32] like 
 probably  like  a  week  ago  or  something 
 probably  not  even  that  to  be  honest  it's
[205:37] probably  like 
 [Laughter]
[205:43] will  you  untag  me 
 yeah  i  don't  think  i'll  untuck  you  even
[205:49] though  like  we're  still  not  together 
 they  were  like  memories  that  we  had 
 together  and 
 you  were  there  yeah  oh  we  took  the
[205:55] pictures  of  each  other 
 yeah  credit  to  the  photographer
[206:03] yeah  you're  the  person  who  takes  the 
 best  pictures  of  me  which  is  so  [ __ ] 
 annoying
[206:09] i  got  you  the  only  reason  i was  with  you 
 photographer 
 just  got  a  picture  that  you  took  with  me
[206:23] i  see  you  pretending  to  look  away  and 
 you're  like  look  at  the  corner  like 
 is  he  stuff  like  screen  shot  quick
[206:37] [Laughter]
[206:45] i  won't  be  surprised  if  i  just  get 
 attacked  soon  drive  one  day
[206:51] do  it  do  it  because  i'll  be  so  funny 
 obviously  i'm  not  going  to  come  but
[206:56] just  do  it  so  i  can  reject  you  um 
 for  me  she  loved  me  he  was  i  think
[207:01] you're  just  biting  me  into  doing  it 
 you're  actually  going  to  say  like 
 7  14.
[207:10] oh  [ __ ]  math  freedom
[207:15] i  have  a  feeling  like  we're  gonna  see 
 each  other  again  at  some  point 
 in  what  way  like  not  accidentally
[207:23] like  one  time  we're  gonna  like  either 
 one  of  us  is  gonna
[207:28] send  that  message  out  and  we  are 
 actually  gonna  meet  i  don't  know  if  we 
 probably  won't  like 
 get  into  a  relationship  but  i  don't
[207:34] think  we're  never  gonna  see  each  other 
 again 
 i  don't  know
[207:41] right  now  i  don't  feel  like  we'll  ever 
 see  each  other  again
[207:47] that's  completely  i  mean  we  live  in  the 
 same  time  we're  going  to  bump  into  it 
 not  even  that  it's  like  it's  gonna  be
[207:54] not 
 yeah  no  no  it  is  it's  going  to  be  like
[208:00] both  of  us  just  messaging  and  just 
 the  world  doesn't  want  us  to  do  that
[208:05] [ __ ]  but  it's  like  [ __ ]  yeah 
 the  only  way  it  would  happen  is  safe 
 like  you  messaged  me  and  we  were
[208:11] actually  like 
 messaging  and  stuff  and  getting  on  and 
 then  it  happened
[208:16] but  i  like  i'd  never  reach  out  for  you 
 for  that 
 to  you  for  that  to  happen
[208:21] [Music] 
 i  won't  be  surprised  if  you  did  yeah  i 
 have  a  feeling  like  i  will
[208:29] are  you  waiting  by  my  phone
[208:35] i'm  glad  you  said  that
[208:40] you  just  laughed  exactly  like  how  i 
 remember
[208:50] really 
 you  think  you  love  me  more  because  of
[208:55] this  call 
 yeah  definitely
[209:01] yeah  me  too  what  are  we  doing
[209:06] and  then  [ __ ]  like  i'm 
 right  now  i'm  like  oh  i  feel  good  like
[209:11] it's  it's  fine  like  this  has  actually 
 helped  but 
 i'm  on  the  call  with  you  right  now  yeah
[209:17] is  that  how  you  feel  what  do  you  mean 
 like  right  now  i  feel  better  about
[209:23] everything  and  i'm  like  oh  like  this  is 
 really  like  this  call's  really  helped 
 like  i  feel  really  fine  about  it  now 
 but  i'm  i'm  like  talking  to  you  right
[209:29] now  yeah 
 but  this  like  i  was  expecting  that 
 though  because
[209:34] like  we  always  felt  better  when  we'd 
 like  speak  about  this  stuff  but  when 
 we'd  have  like  a little  bit  of  a 
 distance  or  whatever
[209:39] then  it'd  be  worse  than  it  it  was  like 
 like  the  whole  time  no  i  i  knew  it
[209:47] wouldn't  be  i  knew  like  i  had  a  feeling 
 that  either  it  would  be  like 
 hostile  as  [ __ ]  and  we'd  be  like  calling 
 each  other  out  or  something  or  it  would
[209:53] be  like 
 yeah  i  knew  it  would  be  one  way  or  the 
 other  yeah
[209:58] i'm  glad  it  went  this  way  yeah  me  too
[210:03] i  kind  of  wanted  you  to  be  a  dick  but 
 i'm  glad  that  it's 
 like  we're  both  going  to  take  it  away
[210:08] i'm  glad  that  you  still  love  me  so
[210:14] yeah  because  i  like 
 we  know  me  i  think  about  worst  case 
 scenario  so  i've  just  assumed  that  after
[210:20] this  breakup  you  were  just  like 
 fully  just  like  forgot  that  i  existed 
 and  we  just  like  seeing  loads  of  girls
[210:26] and  stuff 
 um  yeah  i  mean  it 
 honestly  it  was  kind  of  like  the  plan
[210:31] but  it  was  it  was  like 
 it  was  such  a  yeah  huh  you  just  too  sad
[210:38] it's  not  even  that  is  it  it's  not  so 
 much  like  this  it  was  just  like
[210:44] i'm  not  going  to  go  get  girls  whilst  i'm 
 in  love  with  someone
[210:49] essentially  i  was  like  taking  like  a 
 month  off  dating  and 
 and  you  know  just  being  a  monk  and
[210:54] celibate  and  stuff 
 and  i  thought  maybe  even  longer  than 
 that  and  i  just  realized  like  the  reason 
 why
[210:59] i  feel  so  uncomfortable  speaking  to 
 girls  right  now 
 is  because  it's  like
[211:06] it's  not  even  what  i  want 
 i'm  not
[211:14] i'm  not  over  you
[211:22] i  know  that  it's  like  it's  a  tricky  as 
 [ __ ]  situation  and  it's  probably  not 
 even 
 good  for  us  or  anything  i  don't  know
[211:28] that  it's 
 jo  i mean  it's  it's  all  of  my  like 
 conscious  like
[211:33] good  brain  is  saying  like  what  the  [ __ ] 
 are you  doing  bro  just  go  [ __ ]  some 
 [ __ ]  like  just  go  back  to  normal  like
[211:38] i  mean  but  it's  like  we  have  that 
 attachment 
 yeah  do  you  think  you  ever  will  fully
[211:45] move  on 
 yeah  at  some  point  but  right  now
[211:50] i  think  i  can't  like  i  can  see  myself 
 moving  on  but  i  still  like  we'll  always
[211:57] have  a  bit  of  love  for  each  other 
 like  it's  always  going  to  be  like  like  i 
 said  it's  like  once  it  turns  like  once
[212:02] the  love  turns  on  it  never  fully  can 
 fully  go  off  it's  just  like  one  percent
[212:07] and  it's  always  going  to  be  at  least  one 
 percent  and  i  think  after  this  call  it's 
 like 
 just  went  straight  up  like  10  or
[212:12] something 
 i'm  glad  that  it  has  even  if  yeah
[212:17] me  too  consciously  or  whatever  it's  like 
 all  the  problems  we've  had  is  like
[212:22] you  know  that  but  it's  i'm  actually  i'm 
 glad  like  i  said  i'm  grateful  that  we've 
 had  this  conversation  that
[212:28] we  both  seem  to  have  like  the  same 
 feelings  i  know  for  a  fact  like 
 although  you're  kind  of  reserved  about
[212:33] this  like  you  kind  of  want  it  as  much  as 
 i  do
[212:38] i  want  what  as  much  as  you  do  like 
 how  this  callers  went  yeah  of  course
[212:47] that's  what  i  wanted
[212:54] interesting 
 that's  interesting  i  wasn't  expecting
[213:00] well  i  mean 
 kind  of  was  blue
[213:07] i  feel  like  we're  both  like  carrying 
 over  talking  about  the  same  things  that 
 we've  been  able  to  avoid  ending  the
[213:16] course
[213:25] [Laughter]
[213:30] vodka  that  would  be  us
[213:36] you  have  like  a  feeling  right  now  like 
 you  don't  want  to  stop  speaking  to  me
[213:43] yeah  well  me  too 
 i  don't  want  to  stop  speaking  to  me
[213:48] either 
 sometimes  i  just  forget  that  like  the 
 other  half  of  my  screen  has  got  you
[213:54] i  was  like  staring  at  myself  like  i  knew 
 you'd  be  doing  that
[214:05] i  wish  i  could  just  make  myself  go  full 
 screen 
 you  can  on  my  phone  i'm  full  screen  now
[214:12] yeah 
 let  me  just  reply  to  harriet
[214:40] um
[214:51] [Music] 
 sorry
[215:04] sorry  she's  literally  just  like  on  her 
 way 
 to  meet  me  and  i  was  meant  to  uh
[215:10] like  you  know  didn't  plan  on  being  this 
 cool  being  on  this  call  this  long
[215:15] i  had  plans  between  this  call  and 
 meeting  harriet 
 but  at  last  here  we  are  and  harriet's
[215:21] getting  to  the  train  station  in  10 
 minutes 
 20  minutes  but  um
[215:34] like  i  think  it's  going  to  happen  after 
 this
[215:42] give  it  like  a  couple  of  days  before  i 
 message  you
[215:48] didn't  you  all  message  me  yeah
[215:53] i  will  yeah
[216:05] i  do  but  i  shouldn't 
 [Music]
[216:11] this  is  why  we  couldn't  melt  up  well 
 that's  why  your  parents  stopped  us  from 
 speaking
[216:18] i'm  just  like  literally  i can't  want  to 
 call  it  you're  abusive  and  now  i'm  like 
 i  was  just  speaking  to  you
[216:24] [Laughter] 
 everyone  was  scared  of  yeah  no  i  think
[216:30] it  would  be  good  like  i  don't  want  to 
 like  i  don't  want  to  leave  the  situation
[216:36] with 
 bad  feelings  like  i've  had  a  lot  of  bad 
 feelings  towards  you 
 i  don't  want  to  feel  bad  because  i'm
[216:42] very  grateful  for  you  like  i'm 
 so  grateful  like
[216:47] half  of  me  is  like  i  wish  none  of  it 
 ever  happened  but  the  other  half  of  me 
 is  like  really  grateful  i  did
[216:52] i  really  only  wish  it  didn't  happen 
 because  it's  painful  but  it  isn't 
 yeah  but  it's  not  like  on  the  good
[216:57] points 
 yeah  yeah  i  feel  the  same  way  but  i 
 think  it
[217:02] for  me  now  after  having  this 
 conversation  has  changed  and  it's  like 
 i'm  just  i'm  just  positive  now  i'm  not
[217:07] gonna  lie  i'm  not  even  like 
 i've  realized  like  i  i  don't  want  that
[217:13] negativity  and  in  fact  i  can  see  so  much 
 positivity  in  the  fact  that  we're  still 
 like 
 on  the  same  level  with  everything  that
[217:19] we're  doing  with  how  we've  like  been 
 interacting  and  how  we've  been  thinking 
 and  everything  it's  just  reminded  me  of
[217:24] like  how  compatible  we  were  and  how  much 
 connection  we  had 
 and  it's  just  made  me  like  i  think  you
[217:31] what  sorry  what  were  you  gonna  say 
 it  was  amazing  but  we  had  like  a  lot
[217:36] like  i  have  not  been  thinking  about  the 
 positive  sides  of  what  we  had 
 up  until  right  now  well  we  had
[217:43] but  it  was  very  special 
 it's  not  even  what  we  had  honestly  it's 
 what  we  have  because  it's  not
[217:49] it  still  hasn't  went  away  let's  be 
 honest 
 yeah  that's  true
[217:56] why'd  you  have  to  be  like  this
[218:04] fix  yourself 
 go  interview  with  me
[218:12] self-improvement  coach  together
[218:17] go  from  being  each  other 
 self-improvement  coach  to  getting  one 
 together
[218:23] [Music]
[218:29] you're  gonna  cuddle  your  pillow  extra 
 hard  tonight 
 absolutely  i'm  gonna  grab  your
[218:38] toothbrush 
 i  don't  have  it  anymore
[218:47] okay 
 there's  a  boyfriend
[218:56] [Laughter]
[219:03] i'm  glad  you're  not 
 well  i'm  not  dating  anyone
[219:11] yeah  i  mean  i'm  not  going  to  start 
 dating  someone  when  i'm  still
[219:21] would  you  classes  dating
[219:29] yeah  to  be  honest  i  wouldn't  expect  you 
 to  be  like  fully  like
[219:34] fully  fully  going  out  with  someone  right 
 now 
 but  at  least  like  fancying  someone  i
[219:41] like  and  some  i  mean  i  don't  know  you 
 could  like  someone  right  now  as  well 
 actually
[219:46] yeah  i  think  it's  possible  you  don't
[219:55] there's  a  bit  of  hesitation  in  there 
 i  didn't  there  was  a  bit  of  hesitation
[220:00] in  that 
 in  what  and  you're  like 
 [Music]
[220:07] what  do  you  mean  no  it  doesn't  matter 
 whatever 
 i  don't  want  to  get  into  details  about
[220:12] like  because 
 i  think  if  either  of  us  say  i  mean  i
[220:18] don't  know 
 i  don't  fancy  anyone  else
[220:29] is  that  anyone  else
[220:34] i  don't  can't  see  anyone 
 that's  bullshitting  you  fancy  anyone
[220:46] there's  this  one  girl
[220:52] i'm  not  in  as  [ __ ]
[220:57] well  she  like
[221:04] she's  goofy
[221:10] that's  true
[221:19] i've  like  covered  it  with  negativity  you 
 know  so  instead  of  thinking  about  you  20 
 times  a  day  like 
 positively  we're  thinking  like  i  fancy
[221:26] her  and  i'm  interested  in  her  and  i'm 
 thinking  about  her  and  i'm  like
[221:32] like  sexually  into  her  and  everything 
 instead  of  that  i've  just  like 
 threw  a  negative  negative  blanket  over
[221:39] it 
 because  it  seemed  like  that  would  it 
 probably  has  helped  to  to  think  about  it 
 less
[221:44] yeah  of  course  i  don't  think  that's  like 
 truthful  i  think  that  was  me  literally 
 just  like
[221:49] trying  to  feel  less  pain  by  saying  like 
 okay  quick  full  like  i've  literally  you 
 know  wrote  26  things  that  i  don't  like
[221:55] about  you  purposely  so  like 
 i  like  you  less  yeah  and  it  hasn't
[222:00] really 
 like  i  mean  it's  kind  of  helped  in  the 
 sense  that  it's  made  me  feel  more 
 negative  about  you  but
[222:05] all  it  took  was  like  one  conversation  to 
 just  think  like  but  there's  so  much  to 
 be  positive  about
[222:11] yeah  there  is
[222:17] it's  just  so  much  like  we're  so 
 compatible  but  also 
 incompatible  at  the  same  time
[222:25] let's  say  the  compatibilities  outweigh 
 the  incompatibility
[222:30] in  combat  incompatibilities  and  more 
 serious 
 yeah  that's  a  good  way  to  put  it
[222:39] do  you  think  your  mindset  could  change 
 it  already  is
[222:48] like  i'm 
 you  know  i'm  into  that  like
[222:53] self-improvement  and  i'm  into  like 
 having  a  small  ego  and  and  seeing  what  i
[222:58] can  improve 
 and  i  do  have  like  somewhat  obviously  i 
 play  it  up  a  little  bit  with  you  like
[223:03] when  i'm  just  joking  but  i  do  have 
 obviously  a  little  bit  of  a  god  complex 
 and  i'm  like  i  do  think  i'm  like  [ __ ]
[223:08] sick 
 but  at  the  same  time  i  do  also  have  like 
 this  thing  of  like  i'm  a  student 
 and  i'm  always  willing  to  learn  and  i
[223:15] can  see  that 
 my  my  mindset  my  behavior  hasn't  been
[223:20] optimum 
 because  especially  when  i  say  it  in  like
[223:25] a  practical  like 
 sense  where  it's  literally  just  like 
 analytical  when  i  say
[223:31] is  there  any  benefit  to  having  that 
 trust  issue  kind  of  mindset  no
[223:38] is  it  going  to  lead  to  more  problems  yes 
 like 
 that  we'd  still  be  together  yeah
[223:53] i  don't  feel  sad  about  it  you  know 
 because 
 i  think  it's  easy  for  us  to  say  like  hey
[224:00] it  is  sad 
 i  don't  know  because  i  think  it
[224:07] it's  easy  to  say  oh  if  you  just  didn't 
 have  that  i'd  be 
 joining  but  it  wouldn't  have  been  me  at
[224:12] that  time 
 yeah  that's  true  that's  like  you  know
[224:17] everything  we  were 
 compatible  with  was  it  was  included  with 
 that  and  all  the  experiences  by  i've  all
[224:22] the  experiences  i've  had  and  have  the 
 person  i  am  and  the  person  that  you 
 are  that's  all  of  our  compatibility  like
[224:28] we  can't  say  oh  you  know  if  we  just  took 
 this  bit  because  it  what 
 it's  like  a  package  and  the  package  was
[224:33] like  you  said  more  compatible  than  it 
 was  incompatible 
 and  it  was  just  that  at  that  time  or
[224:39] even  probably  still 
 yeah  still  now  to  be  honest  it's  like 
 distal  areas  of  improvement
[224:44] which  yeah  we  could  look  at  as  like  sad 
 but  to  me  it's  honestly 
 it's  like  i'm  like  in  my  head  i'm
[224:49] thinking  all  right  relationship  coaching 
 and  okay  i  know  what  the  problem  is  like 
 let's  see  like  how  much  progress  i  can
[224:54] make  in  this  area  now 
 is  that  what  you're  gonna  do  i've
[224:59] already  like  been  looking  for  some  i'm 
 gonna  find 
 like  a  guy  or  a  girl  who's  like
[225:04] you  know  who's  compatible  with  me  in 
 that  sense  but  i  haven't 
 i've  known  for  a  while  but  i've  never
[225:09] actually  wanted  the  you've  never  wanted 
 to  admit  it 
 kind  of  thing  it's  not  that
[225:17] it's  that  i  i've  i've  known  it  i've 
 admitted  it  but  i've  also 
 thought  that  it's  just  better  to  be  like
[225:23] that 
 and  i  i've  started  like  being  around
[225:28] more  people  who  are  into  this  vibe  of 
 like  a  very  sort  of  like  healthy 
 honest  wonderable
[225:35] way  would  they  the  way  that  they 
 interact  in  relationships 
 and  i've  been  really  really  interested
[225:40] in  that  and  i  thought  like  that's  what  i 
 wanted  to  convey  myself  with  like  i  even 
 did  like
[225:45] kind  of  like  an  experiment  where  i 
 thought 
 like  i  went  on  tinder  like  two  weeks  ago
[225:52] and  i was  like  you  know  what  i'm  not 
 being  a  [ __ ]  boy  anymore  i'm  not  using 
 shirtless  pictures  or  anything  i'm 
 literally  just  gonna  like
[225:58] post  like  good  like  i  literally  made  a 
 folder  of  like  good  boy  pics 
 like  all  clothes  and  everything  and  it
[226:04] was  just 
 like  i  mean  yeah  like  that  i  was  just 
 thinking  like
[226:09] after  experiencing  what  what  i  had  from 
 you  and  obviously  comparing  that  to
[226:14] hookups  and  one  that  stands  and  like 
 friends  with  benefits  is  like 
 it  honestly  it  doesn't  even  compare  from
[226:20] what  i've  got  from  you  from  our  time 
 together  is  that  i  am  like  a 
 relationship  guy
[226:25] and  now  that  i'm  honest  with  that  it's 
 like  i  know  exactly  what  i'm  looking  for 
 and  because  of  that  i  don't  need  to  act
[226:31] in  a  certain  way  which 
 is  better  for  hookups  but  worse  for 
 relationships  because  that's  how  i've
[226:36] always  been 
 for  my  adult  life  i  want  to  go  the 
 opposite  way  around  now  where 
 i'm  better  in  a  relationship  but  worse
[226:42] in  a  hookup  which 
 that's  like  that's  negative  for  the  ego
[226:47] which  once  you  know  like  bear  girls  body 
 count  it  wants 
 loads  of  guys  to  know  that  i'm  shagging
[226:52] but  yeah 
 the  amount  of  fulfillment  i'd  get  from 
 you  was  just  insane
[226:58] i'm  gonna  [ __ ]  an  uber  if  i  go  off 
 the  zoom  will  it  go  off  no
[227:07] yeah  podcasts  gonna  be  four  hours

 go  and  see  those  videos
"
BNJbPdujbSs,"[00:00] Jeffrey  wants  to  increase  his 
 testosterone  I  must  have  three  low 
 levels  and  that's  why  I'm  not  seeing  any 
 progress  in  the  gym  that's  a  cope
[00:06] Jeffrey  and  you  know  it  don't  go  for  the 
 second  slice  of  pizza  oh  come  on  Jeffrey
[00:11] with  a  diet  like  that  habits  like  this 
 and  this  kind  of  mindset  well  of  course 
 you're  gonna  have  low  testosterone
[00:17] Jeffrey
[00:22] Adonis  doesn't  need  Fitness  YouTuber 
 juice  his  nuts  produce  all  the 
 testosterone  he  needs  naturally  all  of
[00:28] the  fitness  YouTubers  stare  at  Adonis 
 and  wonder  how  he  does  it  this  is 
 because  Adonis  has  optimized  his
[00:33] lifestyle  for  testosterone  production  he 
 gets  good  sleep  he  eats  clean  he  lifts 
 weights  he  does  all  those  things  but
[00:38] there  are  a  special  three  proven  ways 
 that  no  one  else  does  that  has 
 dramatically  increased  adonis's
[00:43] testosterone  levels  I'm  not  gonna  waste 
 your  time  in  this  video  and  tell  you  the 
 same  advice  that  everyone  else  is  going
[00:48] to  tell  you  oh  sleep  lift  heavy  weight 
 you've  heard  that  advice  50  times  I'm 
 not  gonna  waste  your  time  there's  three 
 other  ways  to  improve  your  testosterone
[00:53] that  you're  probably  not  doing  that 
 you've  probably  never  heard  of  before 
 because  most  people  don't  actually  speak 
 about  these  but  these  ways  are  actually
[00:59] more  effective  at  improving  your 
 testosterone  than  anything  else  you've
[01:04] ever  heard  what  I'm  about  to  tell  you 
 will  improve  your  testosterone  more  than 
 sleeping  will  the  testosterone  reduction
[01:10] of  poor  sleep  is  about  15  every  night  if 
 you've  got  a  testosterone  of  500
[01:15] nanograms  per  deciliter  it'll  go  down  to 
 around  430  with  a  bad  night  of  sleep  I'm 
 gonna  to  show  you  something  that  will
[01:20] have  double  to  Triple  that  impact  and  no 
 one  is  speaking  about  this  we'll  start 
 with  some  words  from  Adonis  on  the
[01:26] importance  of  having  high  testosterone 
 reaching  the  Pinnacle  of  masculinity  is 
 a  locked  door  high  testosterone  levels
[01:32] are  the  key  yet  most  men  never  find  this 
 key  these  three  are  actually  very 
 interesting  and  I'm  so  excited  to  bring
[01:38] this  to  you  the  first  proven  way  to 
 drastically  increase  your  testosterone 
 is  to  drastically  decrease  your  cortisol
[01:44] cortisol  it's  kind  of  like  our  stress 
 hormones  you  know  we  feel  stress  and 
 you've  heard  the  term  stress  before  but
[01:49] there's  a  real  like  scientific  like 
 hormone  thing  inside  of  us  that  goes  up 
 when  we're  stressed  when  that  goes  up
[01:55] testosterone  goes  down  so  what  we  need 
 to  do  is  we  need  to  decrease  cortisol 
 stress  which  then  will  naturally
[02:00] increase  our  testosterone  the  single 
 greatest  way  that  you  can  decrease 
 cortisol  is  through  regulating  your
[02:06] breathing  every  other  thing  that  you've 
 seen  like  supplements  antidepressants 
 therapy  anything  that's  for  you  know 
 stress  it's  all  a  secondary  tactic  that
[02:12] you  can  use  the  primary  tactic  for 
 improving  your  health  and  especially  for 
 lowering  stress  is  to  breathe  correctly
[02:17] most  people  are  [ __ ]  at  breathing  I  will 
 say  this  again  you  are  [ __ ]  at  breathing
[02:22] you  suck  at  breathing  so  much  that  it's 
 decreasing  your  health  and  this  is  one 
 of  the  most  important  things  I  can  tell
[02:27] you  the  correct  way  to  breathe  is  solely 
 through  your  nose  never  through  your 
 mouth  the  modern  world  isn't  set  up  for 
 us  to  breathe  correctly  so  there's  a  lot
[02:33] of  like  public  speaking  like  for  example 
 for  me  I'm  a  public  speaker  in  some 
 sense  and  when  you're  speaking  you  know
[02:38] full  sentences  and  you've  got  like  a 
 speech  to  give  to  someone  you  naturally 
 breathe  from  your  mouth  every  breath
[02:43] that  you  take  from  your  mouth  destroys 
 your  health  more  than  you  realize  you 
 need  to  breathe  from  your  nose  and  you 
 know  what  this  is  a  large  proportion  of
[02:49] people  who  can't  even  breathe  from  their 
 nose  because  it's  always  blocked  if 
 that's  you  this  is  gonna  seem  really 
 weird  but  the  way  to  unblock  your  nose
[02:54] isn't  any  of  the  [ __ ]  oh  do  this  do 
 this  thing  it's  not  any  of  that  the  way
[02:59] to  unblock  your  nose  is  just  to  use  your 
 nose  as  much  as  you  can  without 
 aggressively  fighting  how  blocked  it  is
[03:04] so  don't  be  sat  there  like 
 what  you're  going  to  do  is  just  breathe 
 silently  from  your  nose  as  much  as  you
[03:10] can  however  much  you  can  breathe  from 
 your  nose  it's  kind  of  like  how  much  you 
 should  breathe  from  your  nose  most 
 people  have  breathed  so  much  from  their
[03:16] mouth  or  they've  over  breathed  so  much 
 from  the  nose  and  now  the  nose  is 
 blocked  your  nose  almost  works  like  a 
 muscle  and  the  more  you  use  it  the  more
[03:21] that  you'll  actually  be  able  to  use  it 
 when  I  first  learned  this  my  nose  was 
 always  stuffy  and  I  always  had  like  a
[03:26] runny  nose  and  I  thought  that  was  just 
 me  I  thought  you  know  I  just  constantly 
 had  a  [ __ ]  cold  it  turns  out  that  I 
 just  de-trained  my  nose  to  actually  be
[03:32] able  to  breathe  so  I  prioritizing  nasal 
 breathing  throughout  the  day  and  now 
 it's  improved  significantly  that's  the
[03:37] first  and  major  step  to  improving  your 
 breathing  which  will  then  lower  your 
 cortisol  which  will  then  increase  your 
 testosterone  and  then  the  second  thing
[03:43] you  can  do  is  a  breathing  exercise  what 
 we'd  like  to  do  is  slow  down  and  calm 
 our  breathing  as  much  as  possible  and  we
[03:49] do  this  through  something  called  deep 
 breathing  I  have  a  10  minute  video  which 
 is  a  deep  breathing  follow  along  so  you 
 literally  just  stick  on  the  video  and
[03:54] follow  along  to  what  I  say  it'll  be 
 linked  as  a  card  in  the  description  go 
 follow  that  every  single  morning  and
[03:59] every  single  night  and  you  will  actually 
 feel  a  decrease  in  like  the  stress  that 
 you've  been  carrying  in  your  body  which
[04:04] then  will  increase  your  testosterone  you 
 can  get  get  up  to  a  55  zero  percent
[04:09] increase  in  your  testosterone  with  this 
 deep  breathing  exercise  number  two 
 sunlight  now  you've  probably  heard  of  so
[04:14] many  guys  in  the  testosterone  space  tell 
 you  to  supplement  vitamin  D  and  that's 
 pretty  good  advice  but  the  reason  why  we
[04:19] have  to  supplement  this  this  little  pill 
 is  because  we're  not  getting  enough 
 sunlight  anyway  I'm  very  fortunate  now
[04:24] that  I've  moved  to  UAE  I've  moved  to 
 Dubai  and  it's  literally  sunny  every 
 single  day  the  best  thing  that  you  can
[04:29] do  is  be  out  in  the  sun  for  as  many 
 hours  as  possible  you  can't  really 
 overdo  it  in  the  sun  you  know  all  those
[04:34] shitty  products  about  like  sun  cream  and 
 all  the  sun  cream  just  gives  you  cancer 
 and  I  don't  know  if  that's  a  conspiracy
[04:39] theory  but  like  literally  imagine  Primal 
 natural  humans  were  they  putting  on  sun 
 cream  no  they  were  literally  out  in  the
[04:45] Sun  every  single  day  for  most  of  the  day 
 if  you  imagine  our  hunter-gatherer 
 ancestors  the  true  like  Primal  high
[04:51] testosterone  humans  they  were  out  in  the 
 sun  all  day  every  day  they  weren't 
 wearing  clothes  they  had  direct  sunlight
[04:56] to  their  balls  and  there  was  a  recent 
 study  which  was  so  interesting  literally 
 all  they  did  was  tell  participants  to  go
[05:01] out  into  the  sun  three  times  a  week  for 
 half  an  hour  with  just  wearing  shorts 
 right  so  just  wearing  underwear  just 
 that  three  times  times  a  week  for  half
[05:07] an  hour  of  the  sunlight  not  even  like 
 you  know  in  a  very  hot  country  or 
 anything  but  just  literally  just  going 
 outside  and  just  you  know  staying
[05:12] outside  in  daylight  drastically 
 increased  not  just  testosterone  but
[05:17] romance  this  study  found  that  these 
 people  who  did  this  literally  became 
 more  romantic  and  sex  obsessed  why  do
[05:24] you  think  that  happened  you  might  think 
 wait  sunlight  increases  testosterone 
 that's  what  we  think  isn't  it  that's 
 what  the  title  of this  video  it
[05:29] increases  testosterone  no  no no  no 
 sunlight  doesn't  increase  testosterone  a 
 lack  of  sunlight  kills  it  you  clicked  on
[05:35] this  video  because  you  think  you've  got 
 the  symptoms  of  low  testosterone  you've 
 got  little  man  boobs  your  dick's  kind  of 
 small  your  balls  are  kind  of  small
[05:40] you're  not  very  masculine  you've  got  a 
 high-pitched  little  voice  you're  a 
 little  [ __ ]  you  clicked  on  this  video 
 because  you're  a  little  [ __ ]  and  you
[05:45] don't  want  to  hear  this  advice  to  you 
 you  don't  want  to  be  told  to  go  outside 
 do  you  and  yet  one  of  the  worst  things 
 that's  actually  happening  to  you  is  a
[05:51] lack  of  sunlight  if  you're  a  total 
 Jeffrey  you've  already  started 
 complaining  of  and  you've  already 
 started  coping  but  I'm  in  this  country
[05:56] and  there  isn't  much  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  no 
 no  no  we  don't  cope  around  the  edge 
 coping  is  for  Jeffrey's  we  try  to
[06:01] maximize  as  much  as  we  can  do  to  improve 
 ourselves  so  if  you  start  coping  and 
 you're  like  oh  well  you  know  in  my 
 country  know  getting  sunlight  getting
[06:07] daylight  doesn't  mean  that  the  sun  is 
 right  there  shining  directly  at  you  it 
 means  that  you  are  outside  in  the  middle
[06:13] of  the  day  because  if  you  can  see 
 outside  you  know  if  there's  light 
 outside  that  means  that  there's  sunlight 
 most  people  don't  understand  this  most
[06:18] people  think  sunlight  is  a  direct  sun 
 shining  right  at  you  that's  not  really 
 true  sunlight  is  what  happens  in  most
[06:23] countries  from  6  7  A.M  to  around  5  6  7 
 PM  if  you  can  see  outside  without  the
[06:28] use  of  like  street  lights  it's  daylight 
 so  even  if  you  live  in  the  UK  and  it's 
 like  a  gray  day  you  know  with  clouds  and
[06:34] there's  a  few  guys  there  stabbing  each 
 other  you  can  still  go  out  onto  your 
 garden  or  balcony  at  daytime  even  though
[06:39] there's  not  direct  sun  and  still  even 
 though  it's  a  bit  cold  literally  just 
 sit  there  shirtless  for  half  an  hour  go 
 on  your  phone  read  a  book  or  something
[06:45] and  that  will  still  increase  your 
 testosterone  because  if  you  don't  do 
 that  you  will  have  a  decrease  to  your 
 testosterone  levels  you  right  now  and  me
[06:51] and  every  other  guy  we  don't  even  know 
 how  much  testosterone  we're  supposed  to 
 have  because  we  spent  all  days  indoors 
 and  finally  we  need  to  discuss  the
[06:58] single  biggest  reported  testosterone 
 increase  out  of  every  study  so  far  there
[07:03] is  one  practice  that  has  been  shown  it's 
 a  400  your  testosterone  that  means  that
[07:08] four  times  increase  that  means  if  you 
 have  a  500  nanograms  of  testosterone
[07:13] this  practice  has  been  reported  to 
 increase  it  up  to  2  000.  that  is  a
[07:18] steroid  level  increase  I'm  surprised 
 that  this  hasn't  like  taken  over  the 
 Internet  with  this  study  because  some
[07:23] guys  have  spoke  about  this  but  not  not 
 enough  and  what  is  it  it's  semen 
 retention  but  not  just  semen  retention
[07:29] not  just  Nova  there's  a  very  special  way 
 to  do  this  that  most  people  never  even 
 think  of  that  if  you  did  it  and  it's
[07:34] [ __ ]  hard  but  if  you  could  do  it  you 
 will  get  this  like  steroid  level  boost 
 to  your  testosterone  level  so  first  of
[07:39] all  semen  retention  and  nofap  are  two 
 different  things  I'm  not  sure  if  you 
 actually  know  the  difference  no  fat  is 
 not  watching  porn  anymore  not  jacking
[07:44] off  like  Anonymous  semen  retention  is 
 specifically  not  ejaculating  so  for 
 example  I  was  on  nofap  age  17  to  22  23
[07:52] 24  right  I  was  on  nofap  but  I  was  still 
 having  sex  so  I  was  on  Nova  I  wasn't 
 masturbating  I  wasn't  much  important  but
[07:57] I  was  still  having  sex  and  with  sex  I 
 was  ejaculating  right  sex  and 
 ejaculation  are  usually  mixed  together 
 aren't  they  so  you  have  sex  you  know  you
[08:02] build  up  a  little bit  10  minutes 
 whatever  you  edge  a  little  bit  Go  Down 
 You're  Gonna  Change  positions  okay  we 
 all  know  that  and  Boston  up  right  that's
[08:07] normal  right  you've  always  seen  this 
 important  if  you're  old  enough  you've 
 had  sex  yourself  you  know  how  this  works 
 right  there  was  a  study  that  showed  that
[08:12] if  you  do  semen  retention  but  not  just 
 normal  semen  retention  if  you  do  semen
[08:17] retention  whilst  having  sex  the 
 testosterone  can  go  up  by  400  what  this
[08:22] means  essentially  you  have  sex  you  don't 
 not  you  have  sex  you  don't  ejaculate 
 this  has  been  shown  to  have  a  400 
 increase  in  testosterone  why  really
[08:28] think  all  this  why  the  researchers  can 
 improve  this  because  you  know  they  want 
 to  talk  about  sciencey  [ __ ]  so  they
[08:33] prove  to  us  the  science  right  they  prove 
 to  us  that  you  know  with  scientific 
 terms  if  a  man  and  a  woman  have 
 intercourse  and  the  man  stops
[08:38] preemptively  before  ejaculation  then  his 
 tests  are  shortly  they've  done  the 
 science  [ __ ]  right  but  they  weren't  able
[08:43] to  explain  why  it  skyrocketed  his 
 testosterone  and  I'm  so  glad  that  I've 
 got  my  sort  of  understanding  of
[08:48] psychology  Evolution  and  the  concept  of 
 like  sort  of  caveman  days  you  know  I'm 
 very  aligned  with  like  evolutionary  [ __ ]
[08:54] right  the  reason  why  you  will  get  the 
 biggest  Improvement  to  your  testosterone 
 level  similar  to  taking  steroids  when
[08:59] you  do  semen  retention  whilst  having  sex 
 you  have  sex  or  you  don't  nut  and  you 
 stop  before  you  ejaculate  it's  because
[09:04] something  in  your  primal  brain  realizes 
 that  you  were  so  close  to  achieving  the
[09:09] point  of  life  and  you  stopped  your 
 Primal  caveman  alpha  male  brain  gets
[09:14] turned  on  and  starts  to  think  [ __ ] 
 everything  of  Our  Lives  was  to  get  us  to 
 this  moment  to  ejaculate  or  reproduce
[09:20] that's  the  whole  point  that  is  the 
 mission  of  a  species  why  did  we  stop 
 when  we  were  literally  right  there  maybe 
 there's  enemies  maybe  it's  not  safe
[09:25] there's  got  to  be  a  reason  why  our 
 brains  think  in  this  so  let's  pump  him 
 full  of  testosterone  let's  make  him  four
[09:30] times  as  strong  four  times  as  masculine 
 that  is  the  single  greatest  reported
[09:35] increase  of  testosterone  ever  and  almost 
 no  one's  talking  about  this  I  explain 
 more  about  this  semen  retention  thing  in
[09:41] my  alpha  male  sex  course  it's  linked  in 
 the  description  next  to  the  three 
 bedroom  mistakes  that  you're  making  go 
 click  on  that  link  right  now  click  and
[09:46] watch  this  full  masculinity  guide  do  the 
 hard  work  especially  when  you  don't  feel 
 like  it
"
A_xBQFiuXHk,"[00:00] your  biggest  problem  is  your  lizard 
 brain 
 you're  probably  not  gonna  believe  me  but 
 i  don't  even  hear  mine  anymore
[00:06] i  can't  even  tell  you  the  last  time  that 
 i  heard  the  voice  in  my  head 
 trying  to  give  me  an  excuse  to  not  go  to
[00:12] the  gym  i  can't  remember  the  last  time 
 when  my  lizard  brain  tried  to  convince 
 me  to  play  video  games  to  watch  porn  to
[00:17] waste 
 time  life  is  amazing  when  you  destroy 
 your  lizard  brain
[00:22] everything  that  you  want  in  your 
 self-improvement  benefits  from 
 overcoming  your  lizard  brain  so  i'm
[00:27] going  to  teach  you  exactly  how  i've  done 
 it  let's  cover  some  sciency  [ __ ]  first 
 because  understanding  this
[00:32] is  half  the  battle  the  lizard  brain  is 
 the  amygdala 
 the  amygdala  is  one  of  the  oldest  parts
[00:37] of  our  brain  the  amygdala 
 is  the  reason  why  we  are  alive  today  it 
 is  the  reason  why  humans  are  still
[00:43] in  existence  because  that  was  the  part 
 of  our  brain  that  allowed  us  to  overcome 
 the  saber-toothed  tiger  that  attacked
[00:49] the  tribe  we  were  given  the 
 fight-or-flight  message  by  the  amygdala 
 it  kept  us  safe  it  is  an  amazing  strong
[00:56] part  of  our  brain  but 
 it's  not  as  strong  as  the  modern  day 
 addictions  the  software  developers
[01:01] and  the  food  companies  they  know  exactly 
 how  your  amygdala  works 
 and  so  they're  going  to  manipulate  that
[01:07] have  you  ever  felt  fomo 
 fear  of  missing  out  that  is  your 
 amygdala  lighting  up
[01:13] fear  of  missing  out  pretty  much  always 
 means  in  terms  of  social  experiences  and 
 it's  especially  experienced  in  people
[01:19] who  quit  social  media 
 they  want  you  to  feel  like  that  they 
 want  your  amygdala  to  give  you  that
[01:24] feeling  of  fomo  that  is  the  feeling  that 
 kept  people  alive  because  if  you  felt 
 that  fear  of  missing  out  there  was  a
[01:29] chance  that  you  would  be  banished  from 
 the  tribe  that  the  tribe  might  leave 
 without  you 
 that  is  what  kept  people  alive  again  the
[01:36] software  developers  know  that 
 they've  done  everything  in  their  power 
 to  make  sure  that  you  feel  that  fomo
[01:41] before  you  quit  social  media  just  know 
 that  most  of  your  problems  right  now 
 comes  from  your  amygdala  either  being
[01:46] manipulated  by 
 the  modern  day  society  that  we've  got  or 
 just  in  general  with  your  amygdala
[01:52] lighting  up  when  it's  not  supposed  to 
 this  is  also  how 
 anxiety  works  anxiety  is  just  when  your
[01:57] amygdala  is  overactive 
 the  amygdala  is  countered  by  the 
 prefrontal  cortex
[02:03] this  pfc  this  is  the  newest  part  of  our 
 brain  the  most  evolved  part  of  our  brain
[02:08] this  is  what  makes  humans  humans 
 if  you  can  remember  your  goals  if  you 
 can  remember  the  law  of  the  country  that
[02:14] you're  in 
 if  you  can  remember  that  it's  it's  bad 
 to  steal 
 to  punch  someone  that's  your  pfc  and
[02:21] what  we  want 
 in  every  endeavor  that  we're  trying  to 
 get  we  want  our  pfc  to  be  as
[02:26] active  as  possible  because  that  is  what 
 reminds  us  of  our  goals  you  can  probably 
 remember  sometimes  right  now  where  you
[02:31] had  an  internal  battle  the  words  in  your 
 mind  were  fighting  each  other  one  side 
 was  telling  you  to  do
[02:37] a  bad  activity  to  eat  the  junk  food  and 
 the  other  side  was  saying  no  no  but  if  i 
 eat  it  i  feel  guilty  and  you  know  i
[02:43] don't  want  to  eat  it  because  i've 
 already  broken  my  diet  once  this  week 
 this  clash  is  the  amygdala  fighting  the
[02:48] pfc 
 you  can  literally  hear  the  different 
 sides  of  your  brain 
 arguing  and  that's  a  good  thing  that  is
[02:55] at  least  you  having  a  decent  level  of 
 awareness  so  if  you  felt  this  before 
 you're  already  halfway  to  curing
[03:01] yourself  let  me  tell  you  my  personal 
 transformation 
 story  so  you  can  better  understand  this
[03:06] what  was  life  like  for  me 
 let's  say  a  year  or  two  ago  i  definitely
[03:11] although  i  didn't  have  any  kind  of 
 brain  scans  i  had  at  least  the  symptoms 
 of  someone  who  has  an
[03:16] overactive  amygdala  i  had  major  anxiety 
 i  genuinely  believed
[03:21] that  i  was  in  danger  every  single  day  no 
 no  that  that  is  me  literally 
 sugarcoating  it  i  believe  that  i  was  in
[03:27] danger  every  few 
 seconds  every  few  seconds  a  thought 
 would  pop  into  my  head
[03:32] that  guy  over  there  might  stab  you  that 
 guy  over  there  might  run  behind  you  and 
 put  you  into  a  chokehold
[03:37] don't  step  on  that  it  might  break  scary 
 do  you  think  i  was  focused  during  this 
 time  do  you  think  i  was  mindful  and
[03:42] grateful  of  the  moments  do  you  think  i 
 was 
 thinking  about  my  goals  no  i  was 
 thinking  about  skipping  the  gym  because
[03:48] on  the  way  to  the  gym 
 there  might  be  a  group  of  guys  who  tried 
 to  stab  me  so  i  missed  the  gym  i  missed 
 the  gym  quite  a  lot  now  i  have
[03:54] always  had  a  binge  eating  disorder  for 
 as  long  as  i  can  remember  i  have  over
[03:59] ate  even  when  i  am  sickly  full  to  the 
 point  that  i 
 my  stomach  genuinely  is  painful  with  how
[04:05] much 
 it's  been  pressed  and  i  feel  sick  and 
 disgusted  by  myself  but 
 i'd  continue  i  can  now  describe  this  as
[04:11] the  feeling  of  of  needing  to  eat  to 
 counter  the  thoughts  of  the  amygdala 
 it's  it's  kind  of  hard  to  explain  and  i
[04:17] know  that 
 someone  in  this  position  would  be  able 
 to  relate  if  you've  got  a  binge  eating
[04:22] disorder  you'll  know  exactly  what  i  mean 
 it  feels  like  there's  a  part  of  your 
 brain  that  you  have  to  satisfy  and
[04:29] only  when  it's  satisfied  do  you  move 
 into  the  pfc 
 in  which  then  you're  just  left  with  the
[04:34] guilt  and  disappointment  of  of 
 forgetting  about  your  goals  another 
 reason  why  i  believe  i've  always  had  a
[04:40] overactive  amygdala  is  because  i  am 
 prone  to  addiction 
 i  am  prone  to  overdoing  any  kind  of
[04:47] substance 
 including  drugs  including  video  games  i 
 found  that  when  i 
 get  into  something  and  i  seem  to  enjoy
[04:53] it  i  do  it  until  i  can't  do  it 
 anymore  the  drugs  that  i  talk  i  was 
 doing  them  every  day  including  ones  that
[04:59] you  wouldn't  even  believe  that  people 
 were  doing  every  day  like 
 mdma  is  reasonable  to  take
[05:05] let's  say  three  four  times  a  year  i  was 
 doing  it  twice  a  week  weed  obviously
[05:10] a  lot  of  people  smoke  weed  but  i  was 
 smoking  weed  not  just 
 every  day  but  all  day  i  was  waking  up
[05:16] smoking  it  and  smoking  until  it  was 
 bedtime 
 pretty  much  every  day  i  felt  powerless
[05:22] and  constantly  anxious  about  this  that 
 i  felt  anxious  until  i  had  that  thing
[05:27] that  cured 
 the  thought  of  the  amygdala  it's  truly 
 been  such  a  detriment  in  my  life
[05:32] and  now  that  i'm  at  this  stage  of 
 overcoming  the  lizard  brain
[05:37] i  look  back  and  i  get  quite  sad  because 
 to  cure  this  problem  all  it  really  took
[05:43] was  two  steps  of  education  and  just 
 doing  some  practical  steps  that  i'm
[05:48] going  to  tell  you 
 if  i  watched  this  video  10  years  ago  my 
 life  would  have  been  very  very  different
[05:53] of  course  you  know 
 i  can  say  i'm  grateful  for  this  stuff 
 now  so  it  doesn't  really  count  because 
 obviously 
 the  worst  things  that  have  happened  to
[05:58] me  that  you  know  the  addictions  and  all 
 this 
 is  why  i'm  here  today  so  i'm  grateful
[06:03] for  it  but 
 at  least  if  you're  watching  this  and 
 you're  currently  trying  to  quit  weed  if
[06:08] you're  watching  this  and  you  keep  binge 
 eating  if  you  keep  going  on  to  video 
 games  or  all  the  addictions  that  you've 
 got
[06:13] if  you  feel  like  that  lizard  brain  the 
 amygdala  is  just  [ __ ]  your  life 
 i  hope  to  give  you  that  value  that  will
[06:19] change  that  so  how  do  i  feel  now 
 after  around  eight  months  of
[06:24] actively  trying  to  destroy  this  lizard 
 burying  the  amygdala 
 how  do  i  feel  life  is  amazing
[06:31] i  i  am  being  honest  i  don't  hear  the  the 
 lizard  brain  in  my  mind  anymore  there  is
[06:36] no  clash 
 you  know  before  there  would  be  a  clash 
 where  you  know  you  should  go  you  should
[06:41] go  to  the  gym  you  want  to  make  muscle 
 you've  only  been  four  times  this  week 
 you  should  go  to  no  no  don't  go 
 don't  go  it's  comfy  right  now  you're
[06:46] comfy  in  bed  let's  go  play  video  games 
 no  don't  play  video  games  because  you've 
 been  playing  so  much  and  it's  not  good
[06:51] for  you 
 go  eat  the  junk  food  make  sure  you  eat 
 it  right  now  because  your  brother  might 
 eat  all  the  food  instead  so  if  you  don't
[06:57] eat  it  someone  else  will  eat  it  no 
 because  you're  in  a  calorie  deficit 
 you're  trying  to  cut  and  you've  been 
 bulking  up  whilst  on  this  cut  imagine
[07:03] that  being  in  your  mind  every  day  and 
 now  imagine  that  it's  not 
 at  all  that  when  i  wake  up  it's  like
[07:08] there's  only  one 
 source  of  thoughts  and  it's  coming  from 
 my  pfc  that  i  wake  up  yeah 
 it's  it's  the  gym  days  just  training  day
[07:15] and  it's  leg  day 
 i  don't  even  debate  it  there's  no  debate 
 and  now 
 it's  like  i  can  do  so  much  that  it  seems
[07:23] ridiculous  that  i  don't  just  go  and 
 train  once  in  the  gym  upper  body 
 just  today  this  this  is  i'm  gonna  be
[07:29] honest  this  is  not  a  special 
 day  at  all  i  woke  up  i  went  and  trained
[07:34] upper  body  for  about  one  hour  and  ten 
 [Music]
[07:42] minutes
[07:48] [Music]
[08:10] so
[08:17] i  then  put  on  my  gym  rings  let  me  show 
 you  my  gym  rings  bag 
 which  has  got  quite  a  lot  of  stuff  in
[08:23] this  bag  weighs  at  least 
 let's  say  five  kilograms  that's  probably 
 even  sugarcoating  it's  probably  a little
[08:28] bit  heavier  five  kilograms  and  then  i 
 ran 
 four  kilometers  with  that  to  my  gym  ring 
 spot  or  two  kilometers  to  my  gym  ring
[08:34] spot 
 hit  an  hour  of  gym  rings  training  here's 
 a  few  clips  as  well  we  also 
 tried  hitting  the  back  lever  for  the
[08:40] first  time  and  this  is  what  it  looked 
 like
[08:50] i  said  brace  that  core
[08:55] straight 
 bring  your  upper  body  a  little  bit
[09:00] higher  up  your  neck  and  your  upper  back
[09:20] uh 
 hold  up  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it 
 hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it
[09:25] hold  it 
 hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it  hold  it 
 hold  it
[09:43] nice  nice  holy  [ __ ] 
 [Applause]
[09:48] what  the  [ __ ]
[09:55] all  right  yeah  go  down  right  then  bring 
 them  back  up  squeeze  squeeze  squeeze 
 squeeze  squeeze  squeeze  squeeze  squeeze
[10:00] squeeze 
 squeeze  man  that  is  it  that  is  it  that 
 is  it  that's  the  line
[10:05] that's  awesome  that's  the  line  that  is 
 the  line  there's  no  doubt  about  that  man 
 that  was  intense 
 pretty  sick  and  then  i  ran  another  two
[10:11] kilometers  back  this  was  first  thing  in 
 the  morning  so 
 essentially  i  did  three  training
[10:16] sessions  the  gym  session 
 the  weighted  run  and  the  gym  ring 
 session  and  i
[10:21] smiled  through  it  genuinely  i  smiled 
 through  it 
 it's  like  it  was  obviously  tough
[10:27] physically 
 but  honestly  it  was  it  was  pleasant
[10:32] emotionally  and  psychologically  and  this 
 has  never  been  the  case  before  these 
 last  few  months  where  i've  put  all  my
[10:37] intention 
 into  destroying  this  weak  part  of  my 
 brain  in  a  practical  sense  that  means
[10:42] that  i  don't 
 think  about  eating  the  chocolate  there 
 is  literally 
 two  bags  full  of  crisps  and  chocolate
[10:49] right  there  i  don't  touch  them 
 it  it's  not  even  that  you  know  that  i've 
 got  the  willpower  it's  like  willpower
[10:54] isn't  even  needed  it's  like 
 imagine  willpower  being  that  debate 
 between  the  pfc  and  the  amygdala  and  the
[10:59] pfc  winning 
 there  is  no  longer  a  debate  it  is 
 literally  just  the  thought  of  the  the
[11:04] prefrontal  cortex 
 and  honestly  it's  barely  even  the 
 thoughts  of  the  prefrontal  cortex  it's
[11:09] like 
 it's  not  even  in  my  mind  thinking  no 
 don't  eat  it  because  you've  got  goals 
 it's  like
[11:14] it's  nothing  it's  just  an  entity  in  this 
 world  that  means 
 nothing  to  me  how  sick  is  that  as
[11:20] someone 
 like  i  want  to  be  proud  of  myself  here 
 as  someone  who's  been  a  binge  eater  for 
 all  of  his  life
[11:25] there  is  the  the  stuff  that  i  would 
 binge  eat  right  there 
 and  it  does  nothing  to  me  anxiety  this
[11:32] is  probably  the  biggest  part  of  this 
 transformation 
 i  genuinely  had  severe  anxiety  and  here
[11:37] is  my  mental  health  score  when  i  took 
 the  nhs  test  now  i'm  gonna  be  honest  i
[11:42] don't  completely  believe  that  it  would 
 be  exactly  zero  zero 
 it  definitely  is  zero  for  depression  i
[11:47] feel  absolutely  no  depressive  symptoms 
 but  i'd  say  for  anxiety  realistically  if
[11:52] you  know  on  this  scale  of  zero  to  twenty 
 i  think  i'd  be  around  four  or  five  the
[11:57] reason  why  my  score  is  so  low 
 for  anxiety  on  this  test  is  just  because
[12:02] i  haven't  really  been  in  the 
 situations  much  where  anxiety  would 
 flare  up 
 my  anxiety  always  used  to  flare  up  when
[12:08] i'd  be  outside  and  especially 
 on  public  transport  now  it  was  active  in 
 the  house  as  well  but  either  way  you  can
[12:14] see  it's  been  a  terrific 
 progress  whether  or  not  you  know  the 
 scale  is  completely  accurate  or  whatever 
 but
[12:19] a  huge  progress  my  mind  is  so  still
[12:24] that  i  don't  feel  like  i'm  in  danger  how 
 amazing  is  that 
 and  personally  i  haven't  really  seen
[12:31] anyone 
 give  you  a  specific  guide  on  how  to  do
[12:36] this  or  at  least  you  know  tell  their 
 story  of  okay 
 this  is  the  lizard  brain  it  is  the  cause 
 of  your  problems  this  is  how  to  crush
[12:42] that  lizard  and  so 
 there  is  two  things  i  did  you're  already 
 gonna  know  what  they  are  meditation
[12:48] dopamine  detox  don't  click  away  just 
 because  i  said  meditation  there's  two 
 types  of  people  watching  this
[12:53] some  people  have  already  tried  to 
 meditate  because  i've  told  them  to  and 
 they're  like  oh  yes  like  meditation  is
[12:58] so  good 
 fair  enough  and  the  other  people 
 watching  this  tried  to  meditate  twice 
 it  didn't  work  for  them  so  now  they  get
[13:04] annoyed  anytime  someone  mentions 
 meditation  if  you're  that  person  know 
 that  you  are  truly  missing  out  and
[13:09] you've  just  got  this  dumbass  ego  that's 
 stopping  you  because  oh 
 you  tried  it  three  times  and  it  didn't
[13:14] have  an  effect  on  you  the  analogy  i 
 always  give  is  that  meditation  will  work 
 for  you
[13:19] just  stop  being  like  that  dumbass  who 
 goes  to  the  gym 
 three  days  and  says  oh  but  it  didn't
[13:24] even  work  i'm  still  fat 
 no  sh  you  have  been  doing  the  actions 
 that  have  polluted  your  brain
[13:30] with  the  internet  for  10  years  20  years 
 25  years 
 to  counteract  that  it's  not  going  to  be
[13:35] three  meditation  sessions  of 
 you  know  15  minutes  of  meditation  isn't 
 going  to  counter  that  you're  not  going 
 to  feel  that  at  all  but  five  minutes
[13:41] every  single  day  for  six  months 
 you  will  feel  it  and  when  you  feel  it 
 you  will  be  making  these  videos  just
[13:46] like  i  am  you'll  be  going  up  to  friends 
 and  family  and  almost  getting  a  little 
 bit  aggressive  thinking
[13:51] how  is  it  possible  that  other  people 
 don't  want  this  benefit  how  is  it 
 possible  that  other  people  refuse  to
[13:56] meditate  that  is 
 insane  like  you  have  to  genuinely  be 
 crazy
[14:01] to  not  want  these  benefits  i  feel  like 
 i'm  just  going  on  a  rant  but  at  least 
 that's 
 it  shows  how  much  meditation  has
[14:06] transformed  my  life  and 
 for  the  people  that  i've  put  onto  it 
 it's  the  exact  same  i'm  not  special
[14:11] they're  not  special  meditation  does  that 
 for  you  if  you  just 
 open  your  mind  up  to  it  and  stop  being
[14:16] so  ignorant  and  you  know  oh  but  it 
 didn't  even  work  for  me  shut  up  bro 
 didn't  even  work  for  me  oh  yeah  i 
 meditated  for  five  minutes  and  i  didn't
[14:22] counteract 
 20  years  of  internet  addiction  it  didn't 
 even  work  for  me 
 dumbass  so  on  a  lighter  note  okay  here
[14:27] is  my  meditation  stats 
 using  the  two  apps  that  i  use  i  forgot 
 what  it  is  exactly  but  it's  more  than
[14:33] 300  sessions  on  just  one  of  the  app 
 and  the  other  one  i  believe  is  about  35 
 at  total  hours  maybe  a  little  bit  more
[14:39] so 
 fantastic  this  is  over  eight  months 
 meditation 
 has  scientific  proof  that  it  alters  your
[14:45] brain  states 
 not  many  things  do  that  in  fact  only 
 from  what  i  know  only  a  few  a  handful  of
[14:52] things  do  that 
 and  that's  the  things  that  i  preach  to 
 you  guys  meditation  gratitude  journaling 
 daily  exercise  generosity
[14:58] kindness  loving  relationships  with 
 friends  and  family  meditation  has  that 
 proof
[15:03] that  it  reduces  activity  in  the  amygdala 
 and  increases  activity  in  the  prefrontal 
 cortex
[15:08] amazing  that  is  exactly  what  we're 
 trying  to  do  here 
 so  the  practical  advice  i  want  to  give
[15:13] to  you  is  to  think  of  meditation  as  a 
 lifelong  habits  to  stop  thinking  that  oh
[15:18] you  know  it's  something  you're  going  to 
 try  no  no 
 it  is  going  to  be  like  sleeping  and 
 eating  you're  going  to  be  sleeping  and
[15:23] eating  and  breathing 
 for  the  rest  of  your  life  every  single 
 day  well  i  want  you  to  now  consider
[15:28] meditation  as  part  of  one  of  those 
 baseline  activities  the  non-negotiable
[15:33] of  course  you're  going  to  be  sleeping 
 of  course  you're  going to  be  meditating 
 part  of  your  day  i  want  you  to  imagine
[15:38] being  65 
 still  meditating  every  single  day  that's 
 all  you  got  to  do  two  minutes  a  day
[15:43] one  minute  a  day  just  focus  on  that  stop 
 trying  to  think  oh  but  i  can't  feel  it 
 yeah  it  does  nothing  for  me  bro  it  does
[15:49] nothing  shut  up  bro  it  does  nothing  for 
 you  you've  done  it  for  like  two  weeks 
 or  you've  done  it  for  like  three 
 sessions  of  course  it  does  nothing  for
[15:55] you  if  you're  watching  my  videos  and 
 we're  a  few  minutes  into  this  now 
 put  your  trust  in  me  your  brain  what
[16:01] you're  hearing  in  your  mind  telling  you 
 that  it  doesn't  work 
 is  literally  the  amygdala  anytime 
 someone  tells  me  oh  meditation  doesn't
[16:07] work  that  is  your  amygdala 
 fighting  against  what  would  kill  it  so
[16:12] stop  listening  to  it  start  listening  to 
 my  brain  because 
 right  now  your  pfc  is  too  weak  for  you 
 to  even  listen  to  it  for  you  to  even
[16:18] hear  it 
 so  you've  got  to  listen  to  the  brain  of 
 someone  who's  putting  more  intention 
 into  this 
 and  if  i'm  telling  you  meditation's  good
[16:24] and  you've  been  watching  my  channel  and 
 [ __ ] 
 literally  what  do  i  gain  from  telling 
 you  to  meditate  meditation  is  is
[16:29] completely  free 
 no  one  gains  anything  from  you 
 meditating  i  want  to  be  recommending  it
[16:34] if  it  didn't  help 
 and  again  it's  got  to  be  a  daily  effort 
 it's  going  to  be  something  you  try  and 
 do 
 every  single  day  and  you  don't  hold  any
[16:41] kind  of  judgment  you  have  like 
 you  practice  a  bit  of  stoicism  and  you 
 don't  do  it  with  the  expectation  like  oh
[16:47] i  hope  to  clear  my  mind  of  thoughts 
 no  no  all  i  want  you  to  do  is  just  show 
 up  to  practice
[16:53] stop  thinking  about  clearing  your 
 thoughts  stop  thinking  about  does  it 
 work  it  doesn't  work  whatever 
 just  show  up  to  the  meditation  practice
[16:59] each  and  every  day 
 and  there'll  be  a  moment  where  it  just 
 hits  your  dumb  ass  and  you're  like  oh
[17:04] this  is  what  it  does  that's  amazing  i 
 wish  everyone  else  would  do  this  i  wish 
 i  started  this  earlier  that  hamza  guy
[17:09] was  right  i  shouldn't  have  been  a 
 dumbass  who  said  that  meditation  doesn't 
 work 
 and  finally  dopamine  detox  i  want  you  to
[17:15] think  right  now  that  all  those  easy 
 dopamine  those  instant  gratification 
 activities  that  we're  trying  to  avoid
[17:21] they  are  causing  your  amygdala  to  to  get 
 louder 
 so  severely  reducing  or  even  eliminating
[17:28] those  behaviors 
 would  then  at  least  stop  their  effect  on 
 your  amygdala  and 
 usually  when  you  go  onto  something  like
[17:34] the  dopamine  detox  and  you're 
 spending  most  of  your  day  on  delayed 
 gratification  like  exercise  and
[17:39] journaling 
 automatically  the  habits  that  you  then 
 choose  to  level  up 
 are  also  the  habits  that  level  up  your
[17:45] pfc  so  i  found 
 a  direct  correlation  between  how  much  of
[17:50] the  bad  habits  someone  does 
 and  how  loud  their  amygdala  is  that's 
 how  it  was  for  me  that's  how  it
[17:55] is  for  100  of  the  people  that  i've  that 
 i've  ever  met  in  my  life  so
[18:00] i  think  that  this  is  a  fact  these 
 average  bad  behaviors  netflix  video 
 games  porn 
 youtube  junk  food  drugs  it  strengthens
[18:07] your  amygdala  and 
 weakens  your  pfc  do  the  opposite  of  that 
 cure  yourself
[18:12] of  these  addictions  and  hop  on  the 
 dopamine  detox  not  the  clickbait  version 
 not  the  24  hour
[18:17] on  a  sunday  like  that's  going  to  do 
 anything  it's  a  lifestyle  change  this  is 
 something  you  just
[18:22] follow  each  and  every  day  and  we're  not 
 doing  it  for  a  challenge  we're  not  doing 
 it  to  tell  people  like  hey  guys  i'm  on  a
[18:27] dopamine  detox  i  shut  up  bro  i'm  on  a 
 dopamine  dish 
 what  the  [ __ ]  you  dumb  ass  oh  i'm  gonna
[18:32] do  a  dopamine  detox  tomorrow  no 
 a  dopamine  detox  isn't  something  you  do 
 it's  not  something  you  try  it's  not
[18:38] something  that  is  like  a  challenge  that 
 you  tell  people  about  when  you're  acting 
 proud  no  it's  just  a  lifestyle  change 
 that  you  no  longer
[18:43] indulge  in  those  easy  dopamine 
 activities  or  at  least 
 severely  reduce  to  the  point  that  you
[18:49] only  keep  like  the  absolute  most 
 fun  instant  gratification  activities 
 that  is  it  these  two  behaviors
[18:55] meditation  and  dopamine  detoxing 
 that  is  what  has  killed  my  lizard  brain
[19:00] in  the  last  eight  months 
 i  urge  you  if  you  want  the  benefits  of 
 someone  with  a  reduced
[19:05] lizard  brain  a  reduced  amygdala  to  to 
 really  consider  this 
 and  start  with  education  start  with
[19:11] learning  so  much 
 about  meditation  and  dopamine  detoxing 
 learn  about  instant  gratification  i've
[19:16] got  like  the  whole  playlist 
 learn  about  mindfulness  the  benefits  of 
 meditation  just  know  that  every  time  you
[19:22] learn  something  about  these  things 
 you're  just  more  likely  to  do  it  because 
 you're  more  motivated  you  won't  really
[19:27] see  much  educational  stuff  about  the 
 dopamine  detox  because  it's  mostly  full 
 of  the  big  youtubers  who  are  just  lying
[19:32] to  you  for  clickbait  like  i'll  reset 
 your  mind  in  24  hours  uh 
 they  say  that  stuff  because  it's  far
[19:38] more  marketable  obviously  saying  you  can 
 reset  your  mind  in  24  hours  just  do  this 
 on  a  sunday
[19:43] it's  far  more  marketable  even  though 
 it's  not  valuable  to  people 
 so  if  you  search  for  dopamine  detoxing
[19:48] personally 
 i  never  found  anything  of  value  i  had  to 
 go  experiment  it  by  myself  and  that's
[19:53] why 
 i'm  here  today  on  this  eight  month 
 dopamine  detox 
 i  did  a  class  on  it  so  if  you  want  to
[19:59] learn  directly  from  me  i  did  a  one  hour 
 class  where  i  explained  the  differences 
 between  the  24  hour  version
[20:05] and  the  lifestyle  change  that  i'm  on  the 
 lifestyle  dopamine  detox  is 
 in  my  opinion  it's  absolutely  necessary
[20:11] for  everyone  who's  on  the 
 self-improvement  i  feel  like  your 
 self-improvement  is 
 is  hindered  it's  it's  handicapped
[20:19] if  you're  still  addicted  to  the  instant 
 gratifications  so  i  made  a  skillshare 
 class  of  how  to  do  the  detox  just  like  i
[20:25] do 
 the  skillshare  link  is  in  the 
 description  you  can  watch  it  for  free 
 using  their  free  trial 
 so  you  should  probably  go  and  watch  that
[20:30] if  you  want  some  education  on  this  so 
 think  of  these  two  meditation  and 
 dopamine  detoxing  think  of  them
[20:36] as  the  twenty  percent  of  activities  that 
 get  you  eighty  percent 
 of  the  lizard  brain  killing  results
[20:42] there  probably  is  some  other  things  that 
 would  help  but  these  two  at  least  for  me 
 has  made  a  very very  drastic
[20:48] life-changing  difference  in  just  a 
 couple  of  months  you  might  think 
 but  perhaps  a  couple  of  months  is  a  lot
[20:53] shut  up  bro  a  couple  months  is  a long 
 time  bro 
 the  time's  gonna  pass  anyway  it's 
 january  right  now  let's  say  that  you
[20:59] could  have  a  significant  difference  in 
 your  you  know  your  decision  making  your 
 amygdala  versus  pfc  argument  in  your
[21:05] head 
 you  could  have  a  significant  difference 
 in  that  before  june 
 the  time  is  going  to  pass  anyway  you  can
[21:10] hop  onto  this  right  now  you  can  think 
 right  now  this  is  going  to  be 
 an  intention  that  i  set  myself  that  i
[21:15] want  to  reduce  my  lizard  brain 
 or  you  can  just  forget  about  this  video 
 and  either  way  when  june  comes  around
[21:21] that  version  of  you  the  older  version  of 
 you  is  gonna  look  back  at  you  in  january 
 and  just 
 either  be  proud  or  look  back  with  some
[21:28] self-hatred  it's  your  choice  and  i  look 
 back  at  my  younger  self 
 with  pride  and  gratitude  it's  a  good  way
[21:34] to  be  i  think  you  should  try  that  you 
 can  book  a  30-minute  call  with  me  for 
 free 
 using  the  first  link  in  the  description
[21:40] you  can  let  me  know  what  your  main 
 struggle  is  in  life  and  we'll 
 have  the  chat  and  i'll  just  give  you  my 
 best  advice  for  it  go  to  that  top  link
[21:46] in  the  description  now  if  you  like  this 
 video  and  especially  the  topic 
 of  you  know  instant  gratification  the
[21:51] modern  day  addictions  ruining  your  brain 
 and  how  to 
 overcome  that  then  my  channel  is

"
NlXPiHArsDE,"[00:00] he  wakes  up  late  and  does  it  all  wrong 
 guess  what  the  first  thing  Jeffrey  does 
 after  he  wakes  up  he  grabs  his  phone  and
[00:06] proceeds  to  scroll  on  Instagram  Tick 
 Tock  and  Snapchat  and  Reddit  and  Twitter 
 and  what  the  [ __ ]  else  does  Jeffrey  use
[00:12] bro  he  spends  over  an  hour  in  bed  just 
 sweaty  wasting  his  time  and  you  know
[00:17] what's  even  worse  than  that  what  do  you 
 think  Jeffrey  does  when  he  stumbles  upon 
 a  fitness  model  on  Instagram  he  breaks
[00:23] his  nofap  streak  Day  Zero  again  Jeffrey 
 no  Jeffrey  no  ah  it's  too  late  Jeffrey's
[00:29] already  fixated  on  the  mindset  that 
 since  he's  reset  his  nofap  streak  and 
 it's  Day  Zero  anyway  you  may  as  well
[00:34] bust  another  two  times  before  he  gets 
 out  of  bed  he  brushes  his  teeth  for  like 
 30  seconds  instead  of  two  minutes
[00:40] Jeffrey  your  breath  stinks  bro  how  about 
 some  meditation  no  it's  too  late  he's
[00:46] already  hopped  on  his  computer  chair 
 ready  to  play  video  games  he  repeats 
 this  morning  routine  day  in  day  out  what
[00:52] kind  of  Life  do  you  think  that  would 
 lead  you  to  Adonis 
 Adonis  is  the  CEO  of  morning  routines
[00:59] just  like  my  friend  Bill  he  rises  with 
 the  sun  and  Sprints  out  of  his  cave  the 
 people  are  watching  what  is  he  gonna  do
[01:05] time  for  some  exercise  how  do  you  think 
 Adonis  has  built  this  physique  he 
 exercises  first  thing  in  the  morning
[01:10] which  makes  him  feel  so  healthy  a  nice 
 nutritious  meal  in  the  morning  sunlight 
 fuels  his  muscles  it's  time  for  the  most
[01:17] important  part  of  the  day  Adonis 
 journals  he  meditates  he  contemplates  he 
 spends  time  making  the  most  important
[01:23] decisions  you  can't  help  but  look  up  to 
 someone  who  has  a  morning  routine  just 
 like  this  I  wake  up  between  5  30  and  6
[01:30] a.m  using  an  app  called  sleep  cycle  as 
 my  alarm  I'll  never  go  back  to  using  the 
 normal  alarm  that's  on  phones  you're  the
[01:35] one  that  you  said  okay  wake  me  up  at  6am 
 and  then  you're  dreaming  and  you 
 literally  hear  that  like  cancerous
[01:40] trauma  bro  I've  got  Trauma  from  I  need 
 therapy  after  hearing  that  in  my  dreams
[01:45] the  Sleep  Cycle  app  is  completely  free 
 it  wakes  you  up  in  like  a  half  an  hour 
 block  and  it  wakes  you  up  specifically
[01:50] when  you've  been  like  tossing  and 
 turning  a  little  bit  which  actually 
 means  that  you're  almost  awake  anyway 
 it's  so  much  better  to  use  that  the
[01:56] first  thing  that  I  do  as  soon  as  I  wake 
 up  is  take  off  the  tape  that  I  have  on 
 my  lips  let  me  show  you  this  is  micro 
 pore  tape  and  I  put  it  on  my  lips  every
[02:03] single  night  for  like  literally  years 
 when  I  go  to  sleep  I've  made  a  video 
 just  recently  titled  how  to  mute
[02:08] properly  so  you've  probably  heard  of 
 mewing  it  gives  you  like  a  better 
 jawline  makes  you  more  attractive  a  way 
 to  supercharge  your  mewing  progress  is
[02:13] to  tape  your  mouth  shut  it's  completely 
 safe  and  you  can  just  go  watch  my  video 
 like  the  full  explanation  but  it's
[02:18] completely  safe  it  keeps  your  mouth  shut 
 which  forces  you  to  breathe  through  your 
 nose  so  I  wake  up  after  keeping  this 
 tape  on  overnight  and  I've  just  been
[02:24] nasal  breathing  through  the  night  which 
 is  so  healthy  for  you  I  take  off  the 
 tape  and  I  have  my  supplements  I  take 
 vitamin  D  every  single  morning  and  I
[02:30] also  take  a  first  man  male  Advantage 
 supplements  I  make  my  bed  drink  some 
 water  go  to  the  toilet  after  I'm  done
[02:36] having  my  morning  after  I'm  done  having 
 my  morning  poop  I  step  on  the  scale 
 check  my  weight  I  check  my  weight  every
[02:42] single  morning  I  don't  recommend  this  if 
 you're  somewhat  of  like  an  emotional 
 person  I'm  very  emotionally  detached
[02:47] away  from  like  the  data  that  the  scale 
 shows  and  this  way  I  have  like 
 consistent  data  to  input  into  like  the
[02:52] MyFitnessPal  app  to  see  my  weight  Trend 
 I  also  take  a  shirtless  progress  picture 
 sure  every  single  morning  after  checking
[02:58] my  weight  and  upload  that  to  my  My 
 Fitness  Pal  look  my  name  on  MyFitnessPal 
 is  Hamza  97  armored  you  can  see  like
[03:04] I've  been  logging  every  single  day  for  a 
 while  next  I  brush  my  teeth  and  very 
 very  importantly  very  importantly  I
[03:10] brush  my  tongue  do  you  know  the  amount 
 of  people  who  don't  actually  brush  their 
 tongue  okay  let  me  tell  you  something  if 
 you  don't  know  this  already  bad  breath
[03:16] actually  comes  from  the  back  of  your 
 tongue  not  your  teeth  the  most  important 
 thing  if  you  want  to  have  nice  smelling
[03:21] breath  if  you  don't  want  to  like  Revolt 
 people  and  girls  from  like  bad  breath 
 maybe  you've  never  done  this  so  it's 
 like  sounds  weird  brushing  your  tongue
[03:26] is  like  as  important  as  brushing  your 
 actual  teeth  is  and  you  need  to  go  far 
 enough  that  you  literally  gag  and  I  know
[03:31] it  sounds  silly  and  sexual  uh  because 
 you're  [ __ ]  Jeffrey  you're  so 
 immature  but  literally  like  with  my 
 normal  toothbrush  and  toothpaste  brush
[03:36] the  back  of  your  tongue  and  your  breath 
 will  smell  so  much  better  next  I  hop  in 
 a  cold  shower  and  I  don't  really  do  this 
 for  the  meme  of  like  you  know  CEO
[03:42] morning  like  you  know  morning  routine  I 
 do  it  just  because  it  literally  just 
 feels  nice  I  think  most  people  have  cold 
 showers  wrong  they  have  them  in  like
[03:48] quite  a  discipline  kind  of  like  oh  you 
 know  here  I  am  I'm  about  to  step  into 
 the  cold  shower  guys  you  know  they  do  it
[03:53] in  quite  a  dramatic  way  and  I  see  them 
 on  like  the  YouTube  morning  routine 
 videos  I  don't  think  that's  good  for  you 
 I  think  if  you  have  to  like  hype
[03:58] yourself  up  you  know  it's  a  discipline 
 thing  to  like  get  in  the  cold  shower  I 
 think  you're  already  like  sapping  some 
 of  like  your  mental  sort  of  willpower
[04:04] and  discipline  in  the  morning  I  don't 
 think  that's  a  good  thing  the  way  that  I 
 do  it  is  that  I  turn  on  the  hot  water 
 get  in  there  you  know  clean  myself  use
[04:09] some  shampoo  some  body  wash  and  stuff 
 and  I  slowly  just  start  turning  on  the 
 cold  shower  to  the  point  that  it's
[04:14] actually  very  refreshing  and  it's  not 
 like  a  painful  thing  that  I'm  doing  for 
 like  oh  David  Goggins  [ __ ]  next  and
[04:20] very  importantly  I  learned  this  from 
 Andrew  huberman  I  go  outside  into  my 
 back  garden  and  I  literally  just  kind  of 
 stand  around  my  backyard  and  I  walk
[04:26] around  specifically  just  looking  at  like 
 the  sky  and  into  the  not  really  into  the 
 Sun  but  like  you  know  getting  sunlight
[04:32] into  my  eyes 
 Andrew  huberman  is  like  a  very  famous 
 scientist  he  has  a  big  Channel  on
[04:37] YouTube  almost  a  million  subscribers  and 
 he  said  this  is  one  of  the  best  things 
 that  you  can  do  to  improve  your  sleep  is 
 to  wake  up  and  get  sunlight  almost
[04:42] immediately  whilst  I'm  outside  getting 
 sunlight  into  my  eyes  I  open  up  notion 
 which  is  kind  of  like  a  documents  like
[04:48] you  know  a  place  like  write  notes  and  in 
 there  I  have  a  gratitude  Journal  so  I 
 just  write  things  that  I'm  grateful  for 
 on  my  phone  I  have  an  actual  paper
[04:54] gratitude  Journal  which  I  use  as  well 
 but  in  the  morning  morning  was  some 
 stood  outside  I  just  write  it  like  five 
 ten  things  that  I'm  grateful  for  let  me
[05:00] read  you  one  of  them  let's  see  what  I 
 was  grateful  for  this  morning  I've  done 
 a  nice  thing  with  gratitude  journaling 
 I've  just  set  myself  the  goal  to  journal
[05:06] 1  000  things  that  I'm  grateful  for  till 
 the  rest  of  the  year  I  wrote  103  so  far
[05:11] this  morning  I  wrote  down  the  95th  thing 
 I'm  grateful  for  my  back  Garden  a 
 beautiful  peaceful  place  I  love  spending
[05:17] time  in  96.  I'm  grateful  for  hugging  on 
 me  like  which  means  mom  in  like  Urdu  I'm 
 grateful  for  hugging  my  mom  and  kissing
[05:23] her  on  the  forehead  like  a  man  of 
 character  who  loves  his  family  I'm 
 grateful  for  the  little  chat  we  just  had 
 this  morning  about  my  friend  wishing  her
[05:29] a  happy  birthday  so  it  was  my  mom's 
 birthday  two  days  ago  and  I  told  her 
 about  that  I  posted  like  a  Instagram 
 reel  of  like  a  few  clips  of  me  and  her
[05:35] and  everything  and  she  doesn't  like 
 really  use  Instagram  she  didn't  see  it 
 but  I  told  her  about  it  told  her  that  it
[05:40] got  like  11  000  likes  and  she  like  got 
 proper  Impressions  she  was  like  oh  like 
 I'm  famous  too  now  probably  cute  I'm
[05:45] grateful  for  nature  the  plants  are  my 
 back  Garden  the  beautiful  color  of  the 
 trees  in  the  UK  gratitude  journaling  and
[05:51] expressing  gratitude  it's  literally  the 
 most  beautiful  thing  you  can  do  in  my 
 opinion  this  is  probably  the  best  part
[05:56] of  my  morning  routine  I  finished 
 gratitude  journaling  and  getting 
 sunlight  into  my  eyes  for  a  few  minutes 
 I  come  back  upstairs  meditate  from
[06:02] anywhere  from  5  to  20  minutes  depending 
 on  like  what  my  day  is  like  but  I  always 
 try  and  commit  myself  to  at  least  five
[06:08] minutes  that's  my  rule  okay  five  minutes 
 of  meditation  every  single  morning  for 
 the  rest  of  your  life  and  the  last  and 
 final  thing  that  I  do  just  before  I
[06:14] begin  working  for  the  day  is  visualizing 
 my  goals  so  I  open  up  my  goals  it's  all 
 on  notion  and  I  just  kind  of  read  my
[06:20] goals  and  I  visualize  myself  just 
 achieving  them  here's  my  goals  for  this 
 year  I'm  gonna  hit  1.5  million
[06:25] subscribers  on  the  main  Channel  I  also 
 want  to  get  30  million  views  over 
 December  on  the  main  Channel  and  I  want
[06:31] to  bulk  up  to  200  pounds  body  weight  by 
 the  end  of  the  year  and  then  I  also  have 
 goals  for  like  the  next  three  years  as 
 well  and  those  are  like  some  big  ones  as
[06:37] well  I  finished  visualizing  I've  had  a 
 fantastic  morning  and  now  I'm  ready  for 
 my  deep  work  that's  my  full  current
[06:42] morning  routine  as  of  July  2022  putting 
 myself  Improvement  my  development  My 
 Success  on  The  Fast  Track  I  know  morning
[06:48] routines  have  this  kind  of  like  cringe 
 like  thing  of  like  you  know  almost  like 
 a  circle  jerk  and  a  lot  of  people  say
[06:53] like  oh  you  know  you  don't  overlook  them 
 whatever  like  my  life  transform  forever 
 when  I  first  got  onto  a  morning  routine
[06:58] about  two  years  ago  I've  really  leveled 
 it  up  since  then  don't  worry  if  this 
 feels  like  really  overwhelming  you  don't
[07:03] have  to  do  like  as  much  as  I'm  doing 
 you've  got  to  see  it  almost  like  a  skill 
 like  a  level  in  a  video  game  I've  been
[07:08] leveling  it  up  for  a  while  I  have  a 
 video  which  is  titled  a  realistic 
 morning  routine  that  you  can  try  I
[07:14] highly  recommend  you  just  go  find  that 
 on  YouTube  maybe  we'll  have  like  a  card 
 pop  up  on  screen  if  this  feels  a  bit 
 overwhelming  and  you're  thinking  wait
[07:19] this  is  way  too  much  stuff  there's  a 
 guide  that  I've  made  for  like  a  very 
 very  realistic  morning  routine  which  you 
 could  literally  do  tomorrow  and  it  would
[07:25] start  to  transform  your  life  subscribe 
 right  now  turn  on  the  post  notifications 
 click  the  like  button  and  all  the
[07:30] YouTube  metric  [ __ ]  which  helps  with  it 
 I'll  give  it  a  [ __ ]  hate  saying  that 
 do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it
"
wKhu86LC0lc,"[00:00] Jeffrey  neurotically  cares  what  other 
 people  think  of  him  he  keeps  posting 
 support  on  his  social  media  for  the
[00:05] current  thing  even  though  he  doesn't 
 even  believe  in  it  if  I  don't  show  my 
 support  for  this  trend  then  people  will
[00:10] stop  talking  to  me  but  Jeffrey  those 
 people  don't  even  like  you  anyway  now 
 fair  enough  if  you  are  gonna  change
[00:15] yourself  for  those  that  love  you  like 
 your  family  or  your  close  friends  fine 
 but  caring  so  much  about  these  random
[00:21] strangers  who  not  only  don't  even  like 
 you  some  of  them  actually  dislike  you 
 you're  wasting  your  time  Jeffrey  Adonis
[00:29] I  thought  I  just  couldn't  care  less  what 
 a  stranger  thinks  of  him  he  is  only 
 concerned  with  the  criticism  and
[00:34] feedback  of  his  tribe  a  fat  ugly  British 
 man  shouted  Adonis  from  the  pub  but  why 
 would  Adonis  care  that  man  has  achieved
[00:40] nothing  he  keeps  on  walking  I  don't  know 
 about  you  bro  but  I've  gave  far  too  many 
 to  my  life  and  this  is  how  we're  gonna
[00:46] organize  it  because  you  know  there's 
 like  this  community  online  of  guys  who 
 don't  care  you  know  Sigma  male  guys 
 obviously  they're  like  they're  [ __ ]
[00:51] cringe  bro  there's  a  way  to  not  care 
 about  what  people  think  and  most  people 
 haven't  done  this  right  most  people  try
[00:56] to  think  like  oh  yeah  I  want  to  stop 
 caring  what  the  people  think  that's 
 psychotic  that's  actually  like  there's 
 got  to  be  something  wrong  with  you  this
[01:01] seems  weird  for  this  video  but  it's  got 
 to  be  something  wrong  with  you  if  you 
 have  this  desire  to  not  care  what  anyone
[01:06] thinks  of  you  in  this  video  is  not  that 
 we're  trying  to  not  care  about  what 
 anyone  thinks  of  us  it's  that  we're 
 trying  to  not  care  of  what  these  random
[01:12] quite  frankly  irrelevant  Strangers  think 
 of  us  you  will  always  and  you  should 
 always  care  about  what  the  people  in
[01:18] your  tribe  think  of  you  and  that's  a 
 fantastic  mechanism  built  inside  of 
 humans  we're  naturally  just  aligned  to
[01:23] what  our  tribe  our  family  friends  our 
 close  people  think  of  us  and  with  that 
 we  calibrate  and  start  becoming  more
[01:28] valuable  to  the  try  right  that's  a 
 really  good  thing  never  ever  get  upset 
 that  you  care  about  someone  in  your
[01:34] tribe  the  reason  why  like  I've  built 
 this  success  is  because  I  genuinely  care 
 what  you  think  of  me  I  might  be  the
[01:39] first  like  man  that  you've  ever  seen  say 
 this  I  genuinely  care  what  my  like 
 YouTube  viewers  think  of  me  so  I  may  be
[01:45] an  exception  to  this  because  I  care 
 about  what  like  a  million  guys  think  of 
 me  but  that's  a  part  of  my  tribe  that
[01:51] I'm  leading  if  I  wasn't  like  the 
 YouTuber  that  I  am  and  I  was  more  like 
 you  know  a  guy  who  worked  like  a  normal 
 job  for  example  you  know  like  not  with
[01:57] the  masses  watching  him  my  tribe  who  I 
 would  care  about  would  be  some  of  my 
 co-workers  you  know  the  guys  that  I
[02:02] really  liked  and  you  know  the  girls  who 
 work  there  and  you  know  you're  close  to 
 them  my  family  my  friends  maybe  some
[02:07] important  people  from  my  childhood  you 
 know  some  good  friends  or  something  the 
 thing  is  most  likely  that's  relatable  to
[02:12] you  right  now  most  likely  they're  the 
 people  that  you've  built  this  desire 
 from  this  like  Jeffrey  propaganda  that
[02:17] spreads  around  which  is  that  you  know 
 you  shouldn't  care  what  anyone  thinks  of 
 you  I  just  want  to  give  you  this  warning 
 because  too  many  guys  get  into  this
[02:23] pathway  and  you  might  be  one  of  them  who 
 don't  want  to  care  what  anyone  thinks 
 and  trust  me  if  that  actually  happens 
 the  reason  why  I'm  giving  you  this  one
[02:29] is  because  because  I've  been  there  was  a 
 time  when  I  didn't  care  about  what 
 anyone  in  my  tribe  thoughts  I  blocked
[02:34] each  and  every  one  of  my  family  on 
 WhatsApp  like  I  blocked  all  their 
 numbers  I  took  a  taxi  like  an  Uber  from
[02:39] my  family  house  back  to  the  city  so  I 
 moved  home  and  I  was  home  for  you  know  a 
 few  days  and  I  didn't  like  my  family  but
[02:44] this  was  bad  times  for  me  and  after  we 
 had  like  this  massive  argument  and  I 
 swore  on  my  dad's  face  you  know  he's
[02:49] screaming  at  me  everything  it's  just 
 aggressive  you  know  maybe  20  years  old 
 21  22  years  old  and  I'm  pissed  off that
[02:54] you  know  my  family  is  still  like  this 
 and  still  being  abusive  I  just  left  an 
 apartment  in  Manchester  UK  where  I  was
[02:59] living  like  a  degenerate  just  smoking 
 weed  all  day  and  everything  and  you  know 
 moved  back  home  for  trying  to  fix  my 
 life  and  this  was  before  I  officially
[03:05] moved  back  home  and  after  having  this 
 shitty  like  argument  with  my  family  I 
 remember  literally  just  packing  one  bag 
 like  one  big  duffel  bag  got  into  an  Uber
[03:11] on  the  way  back  to  Manchester  unless  she 
 went  on  my  phone  blocked  all  of  their 
 numbers  you  know  on  WhatsApp  on  phone 
 numbers  everything  right  I  get  to
[03:17] Manchester  and  like  I  had  no  one  like  I 
 had  this  one  girl  who  I  lived  with  who 
 you  know  was  like  kind  of  like  my
[03:22] girlfriend  but  we  didn't  even  get  along 
 that  nicely  honestly  and  so  hopefully 
 you  can  believe  this  when  I  tell  you 
 that  I  may  be  one  of  the  only  people
[03:28] that  you've  actually  persons  who 
 genuinely  did  not  care  what  anyone  in 
 this  tribe  thoughts  because  I  had  no  one
[03:35] in  my  tribe  because  at  this  moment  when 
 I  moved  back  home  for  a  solid  one  year  I 
 spoke  to  no  one  for  one  year  I  had  my
[03:41] family  blocked  I  did  not  speak  to  them 
 for  one  year  the  only  person  I  had  to  my 
 side  was  this  girl  that  like  it  was  a
[03:46] toxic  relationship  I  was  constantly 
 anxious  that  she  was  cheating  on  me  we 
 weren't  even  like  Partners  in  a  sense
[03:51] for  one  year  I  spoke  to  no  one  for  one 
 year  I  had  no  one  in  my  tribe  for  one 
 year  I  didn't  give  a  [ __ ]  just  exactly
[03:56] what  you  wanted  right  I  didn't  give  a 
 [ __ ]  and  guess  how  good  my  life  was  I 
 smoked  weed  every  single  day  I  went  to
[04:02] the  gym  Max  two  times  a  week  Max  when  I 
 was  on  a  possible  leg  like  six  days  a 
 week  split  and  I'd  go  two  times  a  week
[04:07] Max  I  cheat  on  my  diet  every  single  day 
 I'd  eat  junk  food  every  single  day  bro
[04:12] with  a  girl  with  a  [ __ ]  girlfriend 
 that  I  was  in  love  with  in  the  same 
 apartment  I  had  a  porn  addiction  when
[04:17] you  don't  care  what  people  in  your  tribe 
 think  you  become  sub-human  please 
 understand  this  if  there  is  a  person  out
[04:23] there  who  doesn't  give  a  [ __ ]  what 
 anyone  thinks  that  person  is  subhuman 
 because  the  human  part  of  us  is  tribal
[04:28] the  human  part  of  us  is  so  like 
 consciously  connected  to  each  other  like 
 the  fellow  man  that  we're  supposed  to
[04:33] care  and  cooperate  with  each  other  and 
 so  many  young  guys  are  on  this  Pursuit 
 wanting  to  care  less  without  actually 
 hearing  this  from  anyone  else  now  having
[04:39] said  that  at  the  same  time  so  many  young 
 guys  need  to  be  on  this  Pursuit  because 
 they  care  too  much  about  what  that
[04:44] random  [ __ ]  in  high  school  says 
 about  them  and  you're  probably  like  that 
 too  I  just  wanted  to  give  you  that
[04:49] warning  I  know  for  a  fact  that  by  me 
 telling  you  that  instead  of  just  jumping 
 straight  into  number  one  number  two  the 
 YouTube  retention  has  went  down  I've
[04:55] literally  just  sacrificed  some  like 
 performance  and  like  revenue  and  [ __ ] 
 for  this  video  but  I  really  wanted  to 
 just  say  that  let's  move  on  to  the 
 actual  video  before  I  tell  you  about
[05:01] these  seven  ways  to  stop  giving  up  but  I 
 want  to  start  with  some  words  of  Adonis 
 your  time  is  limited  do  not  waste  it
[05:08] living  someone  else's  life  the  first  way 
 to  stop  giving  a  [ __ ]  is  to  realize  that 
 most  people  don't  actually  care  about
[05:14] you  they're  not  even  thinking  about  you 
 this  may  be  slightly  hard  to  believe  in 
 you  may  be  so  sure  that  people  are
[05:19] thinking  about  you  why  really  question 
 this  right  now  because  you've  probably 
 never  done  this  question  why  most  of  us
[05:24] think  that  everyone  else  is  looking  and 
 thinking  about  us  why  is  that  such  a 
 common  trait  these  days  in  these  modern
[05:30] times  maybe  because  of  the  conditioning 
 that  we've  been  brought  up  with  you're  a 
 superstar  yay  oh  here  you  go
[05:35] participation  trophy  you're  so  important 
 you're  so  special  oh  look  the  nerd  who's
[05:40] exactly  like  you  in  the  Hollywood  movie 
 everyone's  looking  at  him  oh  my  God  he 
 keeps  getting  bullied  everyone's 
 thinking  about  him  bro  news  flash  unless
[05:46] you're  like  Andrew  take  no  one's  really 
 thinking  about  you  honestly  and  you 
 might  not  believe  this  because  you've 
 got  this  like  huge  inflated  ego  and  it's
[05:52] not  your  fault  that  you  have  that  the 
 modern  times  is  really  [ __ ]  it's  like 
 the  things  that  sound  like  good  ideas 
 like  you  know  inflating  kids  Egos  and
[05:57] telling  them  yeah  you're  really  special 
 like  it  hasn't  really  turned  out  that 
 well  because  now  these  kids  are  just 
 like  brain  dead  and  they  just  think  that
[06:02] they  don't  need  to  work  hard  anymore  at 
 the  same  time  you  probably  agree  you've 
 been  conditioned  to  think  that  you're  so 
 important  to  everyone  else  and  the  thing
[06:07] is  like  they  don't  care  guess  why 
 because  they're  thinking  about 
 themselves  because  they've  went  through
[06:12] the  same  conditioning  as  you  so  we're 
 all  sat  here  thinking  about  ourselves 
 and  also  thinking  that  everyone  else  is 
 thinking  about  us  when  everyone  else  is
[06:18] just  thinking  about  themselves  you're 
 not  that  important  once  you  realize  that 
 most  people  don't  actually  care  about 
 you  or  don't  even  think  about  you  that
[06:23] much  you  start  to  feel  a  little  bit  more 
 free  and  say  okay  [ __ ]  it  like  they're 
 not  even  thinking  about  me  anyway  so  I 
 can  live  the  way  that  I  want  to  live  the
[06:29] second  way  to  stop  giving  a  [ __ ]  my 
 favorite  which  changed  my  life 
 personally  improve  your  mental  health  I
[06:34] have  a  full  mental  health  guide  it's 
 like  two  hours  long  where  I  literally 
 sat  down  and  I  walked  through  like  the
[06:39] exact  process  of  improving  your  mental 
 health  they'll  be  linked  as  a  card  and 
 in  the  description  I  highly  recommend  if 
 you  haven't  already  just  go  watch  that
[06:44] when  you  improve  your  mental  health  you 
 stop  getting  these  neurotic  anxious 
 thoughts  that  you  know  people  are
[06:49] thinking  about  you  that  people  are 
 judging  you  basically  that  thought  that 
 we  get  that  you  know  people  are  judging 
 us  and  that's  why  we  care  too  much  right
[06:54] it's  a  symptom  of  poor  mental  health 
 that's  why  we  get  it  because  it's  in  the 
 mind  so  why  don't  we  just  go  through
[06:59] this  step-by-step  process  of  improving 
 our  mental  health  and  you  can  do  this  by 
 yourself  for  free  there's  nothing  to  buy
[07:05] you  can  do  it  completely  for  free  today 
 and  it  takes  literally  just  two  weeks  to 
 improve  your  mental  health  I  promise  you
[07:10] if  you  follow  the  advice  in  that  big 
 guide  that  I've  just  linked  on  Mental 
 Health  guide  for  two  weeks  you'll 
 actually  be  so  amazed  of  how  much  just
[07:16] better  your  mind  feels  so  you're  no 
 longer  getting  these  [ __ ]  negative 
 hateful  thoughts  in  your  mind  that
[07:21] you'll  be  spreading  the  word  of  mental 
 health  to  everyone  else  around  you  just 
 like  I  am  once  you  realize  that  it  takes 
 two  weeks  to  improve  your  mental  health
[07:27] you'll  be  like  a  missionary  honestly 
 just  like  I  am  just  wanting  to  spread 
 this  message  because  you  realize  how
[07:32] quick  it  is  and  you  realize  that 
 everyone  else  has  been  living  with  poor 
 mental  health  for  years  and  all  they've 
 got  to  do  is  meditate  for  like  half  an
[07:37] hour  over  the  next  two  weeks  click  on 
 that  full  mental  health  guide  right  now 
 and  add  it  into  one  of  your  YouTube 
 watch  later  playlists  I'm  not  sure  if
[07:43] this  one's  going  to be  relatable  to  you 
 because  you're  already  on 
 self-improvement  so  you've  probably 
 already  done  this  but  it  will  be
[07:48] valuable  for  us  to  discuss  and  hopefully 
 you'll  want  to  just  take  an  act  of 
 leadership  and  just  tell  one  of  your 
 friends  about  this  the  third  way  to  stop
[07:53] caring  so  much  and  stop  giving  a  [ __ ] 
 get  off  social  media  now  YouTube  is 
 technically  a  social  media  every  time
[07:58] bro  every  single  time  I  say  get  off 
 social  media  so  many  people  comment  oh 
 perhaps  if  you're  on  social  media  right 
 now  I  thought  it  was common  sense  or
[08:04] maybe  it's  not  but  I'd  say  educational 
 content  like  this  on  YouTube  is 
 different  wouldn't  you  I'd  say  that  what 
 you're  watching  right  now  where  I'm
[08:09] literally  just  giving  you  life  advice 
 and  maybe  your  life  is  literally  getting 
 improved  from  this  this  is  very 
 different  from  Tick  Tock  isn't  it  I
[08:15] thought  that  was  common  sense  to  begin 
 with  so  I  never  explained  like  oh  yeah 
 like  when  I  say  I  get  off  social  media 
 it  doesn't  really  include  you  know 
 podcasts  or  like  country  videos  on
[08:21] YouTube  stop  watching  Mr  Beast  video 
 stop  watching  like  [ __ ]  uh  I  turned 
 the  penny  into  that  just  shut  the  [ __ ]
[08:26] up  stop  watching  that  entertainment 
 videos  on  YouTube  bro  stop  watching  that 
 and  start  watch  actually  just  [ __ ] 
 mindless  content  on  Tick  Tock  and
[08:31] Instagram  there  is  kind  of  one  that  I 
 have  and  that's  Discord  so  I  don't  know 
 if  you've  joined  already  but  we  have  a 
 big  Discord  server  that's  Linked  In  the
[08:37] description  it's  got  like  150  000  of  our 
 bullies  in  there  talking  about 
 self-improvement  talking  about  like  oh
[08:42] how  I  got  to  date  90  of  novap  and 
 everything  you  can  go  join  completely 
 for  free  I  don't  think  it's  like  totally 
 a  social  media  but  it  pretty  much  is
[08:47] because  you  know  it's  a  chat  Forum  thing 
 right  I  don't  really  use  it  that  much 
 but  when  I  do  use  it  especially  when  I
[08:53] look  into  more  of  the  moderator  admin 
 kind  of  things  of  it  you  know  you've  got 
 a  big  server  so  I'll  go  see  what  the
[08:58] mods  are  saying  everything  it  makes  me 
 give  a  [ __ ]  in  the  worst  way  possible 
 there'll  be  a  random  guy  who's  like  not
[09:04] followed  one  of  our  rules  and  I'll  be 
 pissed  off  for  hours  later  and  you  know 
 I  have  to  recalibrate  myself  and  say  bro
[09:09] it's  probably  like  a  [ __ ]  13  year  old 
 who  didn't  even  read  like  The  Rules  page 
 who  cares  that  sounds  like  a  dick  bro
[09:14] but  one  hour  of  my  thinking  one  hour  of 
 me  just  you  know  having  good  mental 
 health  is  worth  about  ten  thousand 
 dollars  honestly  like  one  hour  of  me
[09:19] just  thinking  of  brainstorming  ideas 
 because  it's  literally  worth  tens  of 
 thousands  of  dollars  if  I've  wasted  an
[09:24] hour  thinking  about  some  [ __ ]  I've 
 just  lost  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars 
 honestly  like  I  know  that  seems  silly 
 for  like  an  hour  times  worth  thousands
[09:30] now  right  and  I  literally  sometimes  I'll 
 spend  an  hour  just  like  triggered  over 
 like  some  random  13  year  old  who's  like
[09:35] not  followed  one  of  our  rules  like  you 
 know  who's  posted  some  [ __ ]  and  I'm 
 just  I  have  to  stop  myself  I'm  like  well 
 what's  wrong  with  you  and  then  I
[09:40] realized  I  know  this  sounds  silly  maybe 
 it's  not  really  self-improvement  I 
 realize  that  the  problem  isn't  me 
 honestly  I  realize  that  this  is  like  a
[09:46] defect  in  the  human  brain  that  we  aren't 
 supposed  to  feel  okay  on  these  platforms
[09:51] that  connect  us  with  someone  who's  far 
 across  the  world  we're  not  supposed  to 
 be  fine  with  that  there's  a  book  I've
[09:56] been  reading  recently  called  sapiens  and 
 it  talks  about  the  history  of  humans  you 
 know  especially  from  like  the  early 
 caveman  Neanderthal  days  and  it  tells
[10:02] the  story  of  the  transition  from  us 
 being  hunter-gatherers  so  that  you  know 
 the  kind  of  human  who  literally  just
[10:07] kept  on  walking  trying  to  like  hunt  some 
 [ __ ]  or  set  up  camp  for  the  night  then 
 we'll  walk  them  all  to  try  and  find  more 
 food  and  stuff  the  transition  from  that
[10:12] to  the  transition  of  the  Agricultural 
 Revolution  and  becoming  farmers  and  you
[10:17] know  I  actually  said  that  Mankind's 
 biggest  mistake  was  planting  a  seed 
 because  as  soon  as  we  did  that  as  soon
[10:22] as  we  planted  seeds  even  though  we  were 
 able  to  become  more  successful  sexually
[10:27] because  you  know  we  reproduce  so  much 
 more  in  the  human  population  really  grew 
 so  much  when  we  became  Farmers  because 
 you  know  we  had  more  food  instability
[10:33] human  misery  skyrocketed  because  I  don't 
 humans  are  not  really  supposed  to  live
[10:38] in  like  big  cities  what  happened  at  this 
 point  if  you're  interested  you  know 
 after  the  first  human  planted  the  seed 
 and  we  started  farming  instead  of  you
[10:44] know  like  it's  so  much  easier  to  just 
 Farm  instead  of  going  to  hunt  right  it's 
 safer  right  then  we  totally  rely  on  luck 
 on  the  elements  on  the  drought  or  the
[10:51] famine  or  the  you  know  the  Reigns  we 
 need  that  [ __ ]  now  now  we  need  to  stay 
 right  here  on  this  Farm  all  of  our 
 family  needs  to  come  and  help  us  let's
[10:56] go  have  more  children  and  since  we're 
 all  living  in  tight-knit  communities 
 disease  is  going  to  spread  like  crazy
[11:01] sure  we  got  to  breed  more  and  have  more 
 children  and  you  know  that's  led  us  to 
 the  Modern  Life  that  we're  in  now  but  we
[11:06] became  miserable  kind  of  because  we  got 
 more  social  now  fair  enough  you  know 
 there  was  like  tribes  of  roaming  bands
[11:11] beforehand  and  that  was  like  the  kind  of 
 healthy  community  that  we  needed  as  like 
 Hunters  but  the  advancements  of  huge
[11:18] communities  especially  those  with 
 randomers  who  don't  even  share  any 
 interest  with  you  may  just  care  too  much
[11:24] and  it  just  [ __ ]  our  minds 
 psychologically  that's  why  there's  a  new 
 update  coming  to  my  server  we're  gonna 
 set  separate  everyone  into  tribes  tribes
[11:31] of  150  500  like  a  small  amount  the 
 surface  got  150  000  people  right  a  small
[11:36] amount  of  tight-knit  people  and  you're 
 in  like  a  tribe  that  you're  actually 
 dedicated  to  there's  a  tribe  leader  that
[11:41] I've  elected  and  with  that  we're  going 
 to  do  challenges  and  I  want  I  actually 
 want  there  like  I  said  this  to  Sam  who's 
 organizing  you  know  all  the  like  Discord
[11:47] [ __ ]  with  this  I  said  this  to  him  in 
 this  Discord  update  coming  to  our  server 
 where  we're  gonna  make  tribes  right  I 
 actually  wanted  to  get  a  little  bit
[11:52] toxic  I  know  like  all  the  mods  my 
 complainers  when  they  brought  I  wanted 
 to  get  a  little  bit  tribal  because 
 that's  what  human  nature  is  supposed  to
[11:58] be  like  we're  gonna  start  to  compete 
 with  each  other  but  it's  gonna  be  some 
 big  movements  in  our  Discord  server  and 
 as  soon  as  you  get  put  into  a  tribe  that
[12:04] you  actually  care  about  and  a  tribe 
 leader  you  actually  respect  and  you're 
 thinking  oh  [ __ ]  you  know  are  the  three 
 tribe  Alpha  is  so  sick  like  tried  betas
[12:10] like  oh  yeah  they're  all  trash  you're 
 actually  gonna  get  a  feeling  of  what 
 it's  supposed  to  be  like  being  like  a
[12:15] natural  human  again  where  you  have  a 
 tribe  of  people  that  you  care  about  the 
 other  tribes  they  might  not  be  that
[12:20] friendly  that's  how  humans  are  supposed 
 to  live  and  I'm  so  glad  that  we  can 
 recreate  that  that's  in  the  Discord  Link
[12:25] in  the  description  just  go  join  right 
 now  the  fourth  way  to  stop  giving  a  [ __ ] 
 and  actually  one  of  them  the  most 
 practical  ways  which  I  got  from  the  book
[12:31] this  was  a  lot  of  not  giving  a  [ __ ]  by 
 Mark  Manson  have  something  else  to  give
[12:36] a  [ __ ]  about  now  the  thing  is  you're 
 most  likely  always  gonna  have  something 
 to  think  about  aren't  you  like  the  human
[12:41] mind  doesn't  really  switch  off  even  with 
 meditation  and  stuff  like  the  thing  is 
 you  usually  do  think  60  000  thoughts
[12:47] every  single  day  you're  gonna  think 
 about  things  you're  gonna  care  about 
 something  why  don't  we  just  choose  what
[12:52] to  care  about  because  right  now  we're 
 caring  about  [ __ ]  aren't  we  we're 
 caring  about  what  that  [ __ ]  in  our 
 class  or  you  know  our  workplace  said  to
[12:58] us  three  weeks  ago  and  we're  still 
 thinking  about  it  we're  thinking  about 
 this  and  that  it's  things  that  aren't 
 actually  serving  us  right  so  why  don't
[13:03] we  flip  this  around  understand  that 
 we're  gonna  think  about  something  so  why 
 don't  we  choose  something  important  to 
 think  about  why  don't  we  have  some  big
[13:09] masculine  Mission  a  purpose  to  think 
 about  you  want  to  know  the  biggest  thing 
 that  really  helped  me  is  to  stop  like
[13:14] being  a  little  [ __ ]  and  just  caring  so 
 much  about  every  little  thing  about 
 these  Randomness  starting  this  movements
[13:19] leading  this  movement  my  brain's  too 
 full  of  the  thoughts  here  that  now  like
[13:24] what  some  [ __ ]  in  high  school  thinks 
 of  me  like  it  doesn't  even  cross  my  mind 
 anymore  maybe  you're  not  like  yeah  maybe
[13:29] you  don't  really  have  a  priority  and  in 
 your  mind  you've  already  started  coping 
 thinking  oh  yeah  well  you  know  my 
 studies  are  like  the  thing  is  you  need
[13:35] something  where  your  brain  is  actively 
 just  thinking  about  it  all  day  if  that 
 is  your  studies  fantastic  but  for  me
[13:40] personally  it  couldn't  have  been  even 
 though  that  might  have  been  the  right 
 thing  it  couldn't  have  been  because  I 
 simply  didn't  care  enough  for  that  I
[13:45] didn't  care  enough  for  school  it's 
 actually  like  give  a  [ __ ]  about  that 
 instead  of  something  else  you  need 
 something  that  you  genuinely  care  so
[13:50] much  about  that  you  can  start  to 
 prioritize  that  over  other  things  the 
 first  thing  for  me  was  weight  lifting  I
[13:55] would  literally  go  about  my  day  thinking 
 about  weightlifting  and  building  muscle 
 in  my  diet  and  stuff  instead  of  the
[14:00] [ __ ]  that  was  happening  day  to  day 
 that  gave  me  something  to  think  about 
 and  it  was  practical  it  was  valuable  it
[14:05] was  growth  orientated  it  was  going  to 
 serve  me  you  need  something  important  in 
 your  life  right  now  and  honestly  like
[14:10] this  can  go  to  a  deeper  issue  because  I 
 know  for  a  fact  the  reason  why  most 
 young  men  are  struggling  is  because  your
[14:15] lives  are  worthless  I  know  that  that 
 seems  so  harsh  but  most  young  men  are 
 struggling  because  they  have  nothing  to
[14:20] live  for  they  don't  care  about  their 
 studies  they  don't  care  about  some  like 
 shitty  future  job  that  they  might  be 
 eligible  to  get  if  they're  a  good  boy
[14:26] for  five  to  ten  more  years  they  don't 
 even  feel  connected  to  their  own 
 families  anymore  their  friends  are
[14:31] [ __ ]  most  young  men  have  nothing  to 
 live  for  and  so  all  they  do  is  just 
 scroll  mindlessly  and  watch  porn  and
[14:36] play  video  games  if  you  really  want  to 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  the  right  things  you 
 need  something  important  in  your  life
[14:42] you  need  something  that  makes  you  feel 
 valuable  to  the  world  it  has  to  be 
 something  that's  like  giving  to  the
[14:48] world  to  someone  else  it  has  to  be  we're 
 supposed  to  be  connected  with  each  other 
 it  can't  be  the  solo  Journey  trust  me
[14:53] when  I  say  you  need  to  do  something  that 
 serves  the  world  and  Entrepreneurship  is 
 the  best  way  to  do  that  because  then  you 
 get  paid  whilst  doing  it  you  can  do
[14:59] charity  work  and  that's  nice  but  the 
 thing  is  in  my  opinion  the  best  thing  to 
 do  is  just  to  be  an  entrepreneur  who 
 really  thinks  like  value  service  to  the
[15:05] people  you're  trying  to  serve  and  also 
 get  like  a  good  amount  of  money  back 
 because  I  want  to  do  it's  also  fun  to 
 just  make  money  and  then  you  know  to
[15:10] hire  people  and  to  keep  scaling  up  and 
 now  it's  like  I've  got  so  much  to  think 
 about  that  I  don't  give  a  [ __ ]  about 
 anything  small  bro  I've  got  like  more
[15:16] than  10  employees  I'm  thinking  about 
 them  instead  of  like  some  random  you 
 know  person  or  some  [ __ ]  happened 
 you  know  yesterday  we  wanted  to  go
[15:22] skydiving  and  the  weather  like  the  guy 
 said  the  weather  was  like  oh  yes  it's 
 really  dangerous  we  look  outside  there 
 was  a  bit  of  wind  bro  it  wasn't  that  bad
[15:28] right  I  could  have 
 I  could  have  been  so  upset  I  could  have 
 cared  so  much  I  could  have  given  such  a
[15:33] big  [ __ ]  guess  what  I  was  okay  fair 
 enough  I'll  just  go  home  and  just  work 
 again  I'll  go  home  and  work  on  the  thing 
 that's  really  important  to  me  that  I
[15:39] actually  give  a  [ __ ]  about  you  need  to 
 develop  something  of  this  yourself  I've 
 got  videos  on  my  channel  which  tells  you 
 how  to  develop  a  purpose  go  watch  those
[15:44] right  now  number  five  know  that  no  one 
 really  remembers  the  awkward  or
[15:49] embarrassing  things  that  you  did  a  lot 
 of  people  live  in  the  past  and  so  if 
 you're  like  this  bro  you're  probably
[15:54] constantly  thinking  about  this  time  that 
 you  [ __ ]  up  and  everyone  like  you  know 
 laughed  at  you  and  you're  thinking  that 
 everyone  else  is  judging  you  based  on
[15:59] that  in  the  presence  I  realize  one  day  I 
 think  I  read  it  somewhere  no  one 
 remembers  the  shitty  things  that  we  did
[16:05] previously  no  one's  thinking  about  them 
 we  are  but  only  because  we  think  that 
 other  people  are  and  I  realized  that  I
[16:10] had  this  belief  myself  and  maybe  you  do 
 maybe  you've  been  living  in  the  past  too 
 much  and  you've  been  literally  worrying 
 about  something  that  you  did  a  little
[16:16] while  ago  days  ago  weeks  ago  maybe  years 
 ago  and  the  reason  why  you're  taking  it 
 so  important  why  you're  caring  so  much
[16:21] while  you're  giving  a  [ __ ]  about  it  is 
 because  you  think  other  people  are  too 
 but  again  just  like  the  first  point  that 
 we  made  here  they're  probably  not  if  we
[16:27] really  did  you  know  if  we  like 
 investigated  them  brains  and  we  really 
 could  see  it  okay  how  many  times  they 
 thought  about  you  over  the  last  year
[16:32] it'd  probably  literally  be  like  five 
 honestly  I  want  you  to  think  about  this 
 do  you  wake  up  and  think  about  that
[16:37] cringe  thing  that  random  guy  from  your 
 class  two  years  ago  did  you  don't  like 
 you  might  have  just  remembered  something
[16:42] now  and  be  like  oh  yeah  well  I  just  did 
 now  but  like  on  average  in  a  normal 
 day-to-day  life  without  a  prompt  you
[16:47] don't  think  about  that  random  thing  that 
 that  guy  did  oh  you  know  that  kid  when 
 he  was  seven  years  old  he  fired  like  if
[16:52] you're  living  in  the  past  you're  gonna 
 just  care  about  too  much  [ __ ]  which 
 you  can't  even  change  anyway  now  it  is 
 great  to  investigate  the  past  to  journal
[16:59] to  write  out  about  your  mistakes  and 
 think  to  yourself  okay  how  can  I  escape 
 that  mistake  next  time  how  can  I  learn 
 from  that  fantastic  I'm  constantly  just
[17:05] replaying  negative  memories  that  doesn't 
 even  make  you  feel  good  or  anything  that 
 doesn't  even  help  you  to  perform  better
[17:10] next  time  it's  absolutely  useless  isn't 
 it  and  I  don't  know  if  anyone's  told  you 
 this  but  you  can  literally  choose  what
[17:16] to  think  and  how  to  feel  this  is  like 
 the  greatest  superpower  that  men  have 
 you  can  choose  what  to  think  and  how  to
[17:21] feel  so  why  don't  you  just  feel  great 
 you  can  literally  turn  on  the  feeling  of
[17:26] Happiness  like  this  you  just  need  to 
 choose  to  right  now  you  may  be  feel  with 
 limiting  beliefs  and  say  no  no  I  can't 
 you  can  choose  right  here  right  now  to
[17:32] stop  thinking  about  the  past  simple  as 
 that  you  literally  just  have  to  make  the 
 conscious  choice  but  first  you  have  to 
 start  with  the  belief  that  yep  I  can
[17:37] control  my  emotions  too  many  guys  think 
 that  their  emotions  their  feelings  are 
 dictated  by  something  else  and  so  they
[17:42] go  and  pop  [ __ ]  pills  and  medication 
 and  [ __ ]  instead  of  just  realizing  like 
 you  can  literally  just  control  your  mind 
 as  a  man  that's  your  greatest  like
[17:48] god-giving  gift  just  control  your  mind  I 
 know  it's  like  it's  condescending  but 
 it's  that  simple  if  you've  been  getting 
 negative  thoughts  for  a  while  just
[17:53] decide  not  to  think  negatively  if  you've 
 been  feeling  [ __ ]  decide  not  to  feel 
 [ __ ]  that  you  can  control  everything
[17:58] about  like  your  mind  and  your  brain  so 
 why  wouldn't  you  the  reason  why  quite 
 frankly  is  because  so  many  guys  actually
[18:03] enjoy  living  and  wallowing  pity  so  many 
 guys  just  are  happy  there  because  that 
 means  that  that's  their  excuse  this  is
[18:08] why  I  respect  it  even  though  I  speak  so 
 much  about  the  issues  of  mental  health  I 
 respect  when  he  said  that  depression
[18:13] isn't  real  because  the  thing  is  it  does 
 not  even  serve  you  to  think  that  it  is 
 the  amount  of  guys  limiting  beliefs  that
[18:18] I've  had  to  destroy  to  tell  them  that 
 all  this  [ __ ]  that  you've  been  [ __ ] 
 taking  from  your  doctor  you  don't  even 
 have  to  all  you  need  is  two  weeks  of
[18:23] meditating  actually  going  outside  into 
 the  sunlight  picking  a  leaf  from  a  tree 
 climbing  a  tree  people  don't  realize
[18:28] that  the  king  sure  to  mental  health  and 
 feeling  [ __ ]  it's  just  climbing  a  tree 
 like  you  used  to  as  a  kid  you've  not
[18:33] done  that  in  years  and  then  you  expect 
 why  you're  so  depressed  and  why  why 
 you're  so  anxious  when  all  you  do  is 
 just  go  on  to  [ __ ]  Twitter  and  get
[18:38] into  arguments  with  people  about 
 religion  and  politics  you  care  so  much 
 because  you're  living  like  a  sub-human
[18:43] you  care  so  much  because  you're  so 
 paranoid  and  anxious  and  neurotic  about 
 the  past  and  also  the  future  when  in  the
[18:49] presence  nothing  is  happening  other  than 
 you're  just  watching  a  guy  on  YouTube  in 
 the  present  I'm  sat  there  in  an  empty
[18:54] room  just  recording  this  video  for  my 
 boys  in  the  present  there's  nothing 
 wrong  happening  almost  ever  maybe  maybe
[18:59] once  every  couple  of  weeks  there's 
 something  bad  that  happens  maybe  every 
 couple  of  days  one  of  your  parents  are
[19:04] just  being  mean  to  you  okay  fine  but 
 that  negative  thing  that  we  obsess  over 
 that  was  in  the  past  of  the  future  that
[19:09] negative  thing  happens  for  just  a  blimp 
 of  time  for  a  couple  of  minutes  your 
 parents  get  angry  at  you  for  a  couple  of
[19:14] minutes  this  guy's  been  a  [ __ ]  for 
 you  and  yet  we'll  allow  our  own  brains 
 to  think  about  that  thing  and  make  us
[19:19] feel  like  [ __ ]  for  days  after  you're 
 holding  resentments  for  something  that 
 your  parents  did  a  year  ago  why  because
[19:25] you're  being  a  dick  to  yourself  right 
 now  you  may  the  kind  of  person  I'm 
 talking  to  you  may  feel  the  resentment
[19:31] towards  me  and  anger  towards  me  as  if 
 it's  me  virtue  and  yet  what  I'm  saying 
 would  serve  you  what  you're  doing  to
[19:36] yourself  does  not  serve  you  holding 
 resentment  for  something  that  happened 
 in  the  past  embarrassing  awkward  being
[19:41] neurotically  anxious  for  something  in 
 the  future  it  doesn't  help  you 
 whatsoever  and  so  many  guys  will  just
[19:46] stay  here  anyway  just  because  it's  like 
 oh  but  that's  the  way  to  live  like  no  no 
 no  just  because  your  default  brain  goes
[19:51] there  doesn't  mean  that  you  can't 
 manually  force  your  brain  to  just  not 
 think  of  this  [ __ ]  thought  again
[19:56] this  accidentally  led  us  to  the  six 
 points  of  not  giving  a  [ __ ]  which  is  to 
 practice  stoicism  now  stoicism  is  a
[20:02] philosophy  which  I'm  not  gonna  lie  it's 
 so  broad  that  I  I  don't  really  like  it 
 so  much  though  I  think  it's  important
[20:07] but  I  think  the  most  important  part  of 
 it  is  actually  the  emotional  stability 
 the  emotional  control  the  emotional
[20:13] resilience  once  you  research  stoicism 
 you  look  into  it  at  least  for  me 
 personally  bro  I  could  never  really  get 
 into  it  I  think  being  stoic  is  deeply
[20:19] important  but  I  think  the  philosophy  of 
 stoicism  it's  just  too  like  I  don't 
 personally  understand  too  much  of  it  you
[20:24] know  it's  emotional  stability  yeah 
 fantastic  that's  masculine  okay  I'm  down 
 for  it  but  the  rest  of  it  when  they 
 start  talking  about  random  [ __ ]  and  it's
[20:29] like  oh  go  read  Marcus  or  Aurelius 
 meditations  well  I've  tried  I've  tried 
 so  many  times  I've  literally  tried  to
[20:34] Flat  down  read  the  entire  book  twice  did 
 not  even  [ __ ]  understand  it  bro 
 honestly  like  half  of  that  [ __ ]  I  didn't 
 understand  it's  just  me  maybe  you'd  be
[20:40] better  for  you  but  the  best  part  of 
 stoicism  is  the  emotional  control  that 
 you  get  from  it  essentially  you  don't
[20:45] need  to  be  a  stoic  for  this  you  just 
 need  to  practice  emotional  stability 
 emotional  resilience  that's  what  we've
[20:50] just  covered  before  it's  understanding 
 with  this  belief  that  you  can  choose 
 what  emotions  to  have  you  can  literally 
 just  choose  to  be  angry  like  this  as  a
[20:55] man  you  can  do  that  you  can  choose  to  be 
 depressed  like  this  quite  frankly  you're 
 allowing  yourself  to  feel  like  [ __ ]  most
[21:02] guys  I  will  say  that  again  most  guys  are 
 allowing  themselves  to  feel  like  [ __ ]  as 
 a  man  you  have  a  superpower  you  can
[21:07] choose  how  to  feel  that  means  that  if 
 you  feel  bad  you  chose  to  feel  bad  maybe
[21:12] you  disagree  with  this  right  now  because 
 you're  not  that  masculine  so  you  haven't 
 tapped  into  this  god-given  superpower 
 that  we  have  but  I'm  telling  you right
[21:17] now  that  any  masculine  man  who  hasn't 
 been  castrating  his  masculine  Sexual 
 Energy  through  [ __ ]  spraying  the  seed
[21:23] for  [ __ ]  disgusting  porn  star  oh  but 
 protect  sex  workers  any  man  who  hasn't 
 been  depleting  his  masculine  energy  has
[21:29] total  control  over  his  emotions  if  you 
 feel  bad  it's  because  you're  making 
 yourself  feel  bad  if  you  feel  depressed
[21:34] because  you  are  making  you're  choosing 
 to  be  depressed  I  need  to  make  a  whole 
 video  on  this  and  I  know  it's  going  to 
 trigger  so  many  [ __ ]  people  but  it's
[21:40] so  [ __ ]  important  they  want  you  to 
 feel  bad  they  want  you  to  feel  depressed 
 they  want  you  to  be  triggered  at  what  I
[21:45] say  even  though  what  I'm  saying  is 
 serving  you  and  what  they're  saying  is 
 destroying  you  and  they  want  you  to
[21:50] think  that  I'm  the  enemy  but  I  am  saying 
 the  thing  that's  going  to  help  you  more 
 and  they're  saying  the  thing  that's
[21:55] going  to  destroy  you  so  who's  your  real 
 enemy  and  finally  the  seventh  way  to 
 stop  giving  a  [ __ ]  is  to  not  compare
[22:01] yourself  to  other  people  but  instead  to 
 choose  to  compete  there's  a  subtle 
 difference  between  these  and  most  people
[22:07] get  this  wrong  most  of  like  the 
 castrated  men  of  the  modern  generation 
 they  say  that  they're  not  going  to
[22:12] compete  against  anyone  else  and  you've 
 probably  said  this  yourself  haven't  you 
 be  honest  you've  probably  said  that  oh  I 
 don't  compete  against  anyone  else  you
[22:17] probably  said  that  most  guys  have  said 
 this  and  they  don't  even  realize  where 
 this  thought  has  come  from  because  your 
 ancestors  when  you  say  oh  I'm  not
[22:22] competing  against  anyone  else  your 
 ancestors  are  looking  down  at  you 
 thinking  what  the  [ __ ]  the  Gladiator  in 
 your  bloodline  is  looking  at  you  and
[22:28] thinking  what  a  [ __ ]  he's  probably 
 saying  it  in  Latin  they're  seeing  you 
 right  now  with  [ __ ]  man  boobs  saying
[22:33] I  don't  compete  with  anyone  else  the 
 [ __ ]  Hunters  of  your  bloodline  that 
 could  run  20  miles  to  chase  down  a  Borah
[22:38] looking  at  you  and  thinking  what  a  [ __ ] 
 all  of  the  men  of  our  Bloodlines  of  our 
 previous  generations  are  looking  down  at
[22:44] us  with  shame  when  we  say  [ __ ]  like  oh 
 but  I'm  not  masculine  I  don't  compete 
 with  anyone  else  yes  we  do  as  a  man  life
[22:49] is  a  competition  of  course  it  is  that's 
 all  we  do  all  we  do  is  compete  with  each 
 other  for  status  and  for  women  if  you
[22:55] don't  tap  into  this  energy  if  you  don't 
 realize  this  if  this  isn't  consciously 
 in  your  mind  that's  because  you're  not 
 the  competition  that's  because  we
[23:00] defeated  you  myself  and  other  men  have 
 literally  overtaken  you  miles  ago  so 
 that's  why  you  don't  feel  like  you're
[23:05] competing  against  anyone  else  because 
 you've  already  lost  but  men  who  are 
 actually  doing  well  in  life  know  every
[23:10] second  of  the  day  is  a  competition  and 
 this  has  been  destroyed  from  men  this 
 has  been  called  toxic  there  is  a  way  to
[23:16] compete  in  a  healthy  way  and  to  not 
 compare  yourself  which  it  [ __ ]  your 
 brain  a  little  bit  right  there's  a  way
[23:21] to  do  this  and  I've  realized  this  now 
 competing  is  when  you  and  another  man 
 are  going  for  the  same  goal  and  you  want
[23:27] to  get  there  first  or  or  do  it  better 
 than  him  comparing  because  when  you  see 
 someone  else  and  you  just  think  okay  he
[23:32] has  this  thing  that  I  don't  that  makes 
 me  a  bad  person  most  people  compare  just 
 because  that's  what  the  nature  of  social
[23:37] media  you  know  you  scroll  you  see 
 someone  who's  got  so  many  followers  oh 
 you  know  he's  better  than  me  because 
 he's  got  more  followers  or  he's  got  a
[23:42] better  six-pack  than  me  so  he's  he's 
 better  than  me  oh  that  [ __ ]  your  mind 
 we  don't  want  to  do  that  this  is  why  you 
 don't  want  to  use  social  media  to
[23:47] consume  content  we  don't  want  to  compare 
 but  we  want  to  compete  competing  comes 
 with  a  goal  it  comes  with  a  mission  it
[23:53] comes  going  for  that  medal  going  for 
 first  place  wanting  to  hit  1  million 
 subscribers  the  thing  is  Right  me  and 
 Iman  you  know  Iman  got  you  me  and  him
[23:59] didn't  even  speak  about  this  me  and  him 
 did  not  have  one  single  conversation 
 with  this  talking  about  who's  gonna  hit 
 one  million  first  we  were  both  getting
[24:05] very  very  close  did  he  hit  I  think  I  I 
 hit  the  first  year  we  me  and  him  did  not 
 have  one  single  conversation  but  I'm 
 telling  you  right  now  he's  a  masculine
[24:11] man  I  know  for  a  fact  that  he  was 
 looking  at  some  of  our  numbers  looking 
 at  his  and  actually  thinking  okay  we're 
 in  some  kind  of  subtle  competition  here
[24:16] a  masculine  man  will  always  think  that 
 and  then  I  saw  I  was  already  further 
 ahead  and  you  know  like  I  said  first
[24:21] when  he  hits  after  me  but  his  rate  of 
 growth  was  faster  I  saw  a  video  of  his 
 where  he  said  oh  yeah  and  this  is  the 
 fastest  growth  of  anyone  in  this  space
[24:27] on  YouTube  before  I  was  like  oh  is  it 
 just  away  from  just  wait  me  and  him  have
[24:34] not  even  spoke  about  this  but  we  are  in 
 a  social  competition  to  1.5  2  million 
 subscribers  on  YouTube  a  masculine  man
[24:40] always  competes  because  we  know  one  that 
 the  rewards  are  amazing  but  two  what 
 else  are  you  gonna  do  with  your  life  you
[24:46] can  see  like  my  biggest  smile  in  this 
 entire  video  is  at  the  thoughts  of 
 competing  for  another  guy  like  racing
[24:51] ahead  like  we  both  have  the  same  goal 
 growth  on  YouTube  and  maybe  there's  a 
 particular  Milestone  right  we  both  have 
 the  same  goal  but  who's  gonna  reach
[24:56] there  first  competition  is  what  brings 
 men  alive  it's  the  thing  that  we  should 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  comparing  yourself  to
[25:02] someone  else  purely  toxic  hope  I've 
 explained  the  difference  quite  well 
 because  I've  never  really  went  into  it
[25:07] as  much  detail  before  click  and  watch 
 this  video  right  now  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 mwah
"
tEpMSVerhME,"[00:00] jeffrey's  breathing  so  heavily 
 [Music]
[00:05] close  your  goddamn  mouth  jeffrey  and 
 breeze  from  your  nose  does  geoffrey  not 
 realize  the  negative  consequences  of
[00:10] mouth  breathing  a  recessed  jawline  and 
 ill  health  jeffrey  needs  to  learn  how  to
[00:15] mew  adonis 
 adonis  breeds  like  a  king  through  his
[00:20] nose  deeply  his  tongue  is  pressed 
 against  the  roof  of  his  mouth  to  create 
 the  perfect  breathing  posture  this
[00:26] results  in  adonis  having  the  perfect 
 sharp  jawline  that  all  men  want  i  don't
[00:31] want  to  waste  your  time  like  most 
 youtubers  do  the  way  to  mute  properly  is 
 to  first  start  off  with  nasal  breathing
[00:36] breathing  through  your  nose  literally  24 
 7  even  when  you're  in  the  gym  and  even 
 when  you're  asleep  to  do  this  you'll
[00:42] literally  have  to  tape  your  mouth  shut 
 when  you  go  to  bed  i've  done  this  every 
 single  night  for  years  and  you  can  see 
 the  progress  of  my  jawline  because  of
[00:48] this  as  a  kid  and  teenager  i  was  always 
 a  mouth  breather  because  i  would 
 struggle  breathing  from  my  nose  i  always
[00:53] had  like  allergies  we  always  had  pets  we 
 had  hamsters  and  rabbits  and  so  i  would 
 always  have  like  a  nasally  blocked  nose
[00:59] which  made  it  hard  to  breathe  i  was  the 
 kind  of  kid  who  would  sneeze  like  10 
 times  in  her  you  know  like  most  normal
[01:04] people  literally  go  like  a  chew  when 
 they  sneeze  like  one  sneeze  maybe  two  i 
 was  the  kind  of  one  who  would  have  like
[01:10] like  10  times  everyone's  just  looking  at 
 you  weird  in  your  class  and  perhaps 
 because  of  this  mouth  breathing  and
[01:15] these  allergies  that  i  had  i  had  quite 
 weak  features  so  even  when  i  was  like  16 
 years  old  i  had  these  like  big  puffy
[01:21] childish  cheeks  weak  recessed  jawline 
 doesn't  look  sharp  at  all  i  remember 
 being  maybe  18  or  19  years  old  and
[01:27] searching  for  advice  on  youtube  like  how 
 to  make  your  jawline  better  that's  when 
 i  stumbled  upon  mewin  and  i'm  going  to
[01:32] teach  you  right  now  the  single  best 
 mindset  that's  going  to  help  you  to  go 
 forward  from  this  the  mindset  that
[01:37] really  helped  me  that  got  me  to  like  the 
 progress  that  i've  made  so  far  was 
 convincing  myself  that  this  is  the  right
[01:42] way  to  breathe  and  live  for  the  rest  of 
 my  life  so  it  doesn't  have  to  be  perfect 
 right  now  i  simply  have  to  start  making
[01:48] some  progress  using  the  concept  of 
 progressive  overload  right  now 
 understanding  that  six  months  from  now
[01:53] or  a  year  from  now  or  five  years  from 
 now  i'm  gonna  get  better  and  better  at 
 mewing  so  i  didn't  obsess  over  it  or  the
[01:59] results  that  you  know  like  a lot  of 
 people  try  and  do  these  like  mewing 
 challenges  or  anything  i  never  had  that 
 cringe  goal  of  like  90  day  mewing  that
[02:04] kind  of  [ __ ]  i  literally  just  said 
 to  myself  okay  this  is  how  i'm  gonna 
 breathe  for  the  rest  of  my  life  and  i 
 started  visualizing  myself  as  being  like
[02:10] a  nasal  breather  especially  when  i  was 
 in  the  gym  as  well  you  can  see  pictures 
 of  my  jawline  and  the  progress  that
[02:15] seems  to  have  come  from  ewing  over  the 
 years  body  fat  percentage  definitely 
 plays  a  big  part  in  like  you  know  your
[02:21] jawline  and  the  progress  pictures  that 
 i've  got  but  you  can  almost  see  that  my 
 skull  seems  to  have  been  reshaped  it
[02:27] said  that  with  mewing  it  will  cause  like 
 forward  growth  of  your  skull  and  that's 
 literally  what  it  looks  like  in  these 
 pictures  i  remember  people  from  high
[02:33] school  saying  that  i  look  so  different  i 
 left  my  hometown  looking  like  this  at 
 age  18  and  came  back  like  one  or  two
[02:39] years  later  with  almost  a  different  face 
 oh  bubba  hamza  but  hamza  this  this  might 
 not  work  for  me  it's  only  genetics  maybe
[02:46] you  know  what  i'm  not  gonna  lie  to  you 
 genetics  probably  do  play  a  part  but  is 
 there  any  progress  that  we  can  make  yes
[02:51] and  so  we  may  as  well  continue  doing 
 this  and  it's  also  the  healthier  way  to 
 live  and  breathe  so  you  may  as  well
[02:56] implement  this  advice  and  just  brainwash 
 yourself  to  believe  like  yep  this  isn't 
 genetics  and  i  can  definitely  make  a
[03:01] difference  in  my  jawline  in  the  book 
 oxygen  advantage  by  patrick  mcewen  he 
 says  that  breathing  through  your  nose  is
[03:06] the  correct  healthy  way  to  breathe  at 
 all  times  so  this  is  exactly  how  you 
 meal  with  like  no  bs  like  very  easy  to
[03:12] understand  explanation  because  a  lot  of 
 those  videos  i  watched  didn't  really 
 help  me  they  over  complicated  it  simply
[03:18] we  need  to  first  start  with  just 
 breathing  to  our  nose  so  this  is  already 
 like  progressive  overload  for  a  lot  of 
 people  close  your  mouth  breathe  your
[03:24] nose 
 you  might  be  watching  this  thinking  like 
 okay  what  the  [ __ ]  like  tell  me  how  to 
 actually  move  but  for  a  lot  of  people
[03:29] they  will  literally  just  struggle  with 
 breathing  through  their  nose  normally 
 you'll  hear  them  like
[03:34] like  making  weird  noises  like  this 
 they'll  be  struggling  they'll  get  out  of 
 breath  if  you  struggle  with  literally
[03:39] just  breathing  through  your  nose  this  is 
 like  level  one  and  you  have  to  practice 
 level  one  before  we  can  go  on  forward 
 now  try  this  close  your  mouth  and
[03:45] swallow  the  spit  that's  in  your  mouth 
 and  however  your  mouth  ends  up 
 especially  your  tongue  keep  it  like  that
[03:51] as  soon  as  you  swallow  that  spit  or 
 maybe  some  water  whatever  has  happened 
 so  you  know  your  tongue  will  be 
 automatically  pressed  at  the  roof  of
[03:57] your  mouth  this  is  the  correct  viewing 
 posture  keep  it  like  that  so  this  is  the 
 easy  cue  to  get  into  the  muting  posture
[04:06] you  swallow  and  you  keep  everything 
 there  anytime  you're  unsure  if  you're 
 mew  incorrectly  all  you  have  to  do  is 
 literally  just  swallow  your  spit  swallow
[04:12] some  water  and  you'll  automatically  be 
 in  the  correct  position  have  the 
 discipline  to  hold  that  position  of  your 
 mouth  and  especially  your  tongue  most
[04:18] people  stop  here  and  wonder  why  they 
 don't  make  much  progress  that's  because 
 they  may  be  removing  best  case  scenario
[04:23] for  half  of  the  day  if  you  really  want 
 to  speed  up  the  results  you  have  to  be 
 mewing  at  night  time  to  and  most  people
[04:28] don't  so  most  people  because  of  our 
 modern  world  because  of  like  pollution 
 and  soft  food  and  you  know  like  the
[04:33] modern  [ __ ]  that  makes  us  weak  we 
 automatically  start  mouth  breathing  at 
 night  time  this  is  gonna  sound  crazy  but
[04:38] the  way  to  mew  at  night  time  you  have  to 
 force  your  lips  closed  so  that  your  body 
 automatically  just  makes  you  breathe
[04:43] from  your  nose  so  it  does  sound  crazy 
 but  start  going  to  sleep  tape  in  your 
 mouth  the  majority  of  people  will  never
[04:49] do  this  and  they'll  complain  and  say 
 like  our  mewing  doesn't  work  but  this  is 
 the  true  way  there  is  a  certain  kind  of 
 tape  that  you  can  get  which  is  totally
[04:55] safe  to  use  that  book  that  i  mentioned 
 before  patrick  mcewen's  oxygen  advantage 
 he's  recommended  it  there  that's  where  i
[05:00] got  it  the  tape  is  called  my  [ __ ]  what's 
 it  called  micropore  tape  in  fact  let  me
[05:05] show  you  mine  here  it  is  so  it's  called 
 micropore  tape  search  it  up  on  like
[05:10] amazon  or  ebay  or  go  to  some  shops  they 
 should  just  buy  it  from  amazon  i  don't 
 have  like  an  affiliate  link  or  anything 
 but  like  just  buy  it  like  this  safe  to
[05:16] put  on  it's  very  like  thin  tape  like  you 
 can  almost  see  through  it  get  like  a 
 little  bit
[05:22] so  i  go  to  sleep  every  single  night  with 
 a  little  bit  of  tape  like  this  just  over 
 my  lips  you  can  see  like  at  first  it
[05:27] sounds  kind  of  scary  you're  like  wait 
 you're  gonna  tape  your  mouth  shut  what 
 if  you  like  suffocate  or  anything  but 
 you  can  see  when  it's  like  this  you  can
[05:33] break  free  if  you  did  need  to  like  you 
 know  actually  breathe  through  your  mouth 
 you'd  automatically  be  able  to  like  open
[05:38] it  up  no  problem 
 you  might  think  okay  well  then  that's 
 not  gonna  do  anything  that  small  bit  of
[05:44] resistance  on  your  lips  actually  causes 
 your  body  to  somehow  automatically  just
[05:49] be  okay  with  nasal  breathing  this  is  the 
 single  best  thing  that  i've  done  to  like 
 automatically  adjust  to  nasal  breathing
[05:55] and  mewing  more  often  just  keeping  my 
 mouth  up  at  night  time  it's  like  i'm 
 just  better  at  being  able  to  breathe
[06:00] from  my  nose  now  now  the  one  final  piece 
 of  advice  that  i  want  to  leave  you  with 
 is  that  it's  very  easy  to  you  know  think
[06:05] about  mewing  and  think  oh  well  it's  not 
 going  to  work  it's  not  going  to  work  for 
 me  and  i  did  have  that  mindset  for  a
[06:10] little  while  but  i  want  to  help  you 
 counter  it  with  the  power  of  belief  so 
 the  power  of  belief  the  way  you  think  is
[06:16] extremely  extremely  powerful  it's  the 
 placebo  effect  if  we  think  like  you  know
[06:22] when  you  take  like  a  pill  the  placebo 
 effect  is  that  we  could  take  a  pill  that 
 doesn't  have  any  kind  of  medication  but
[06:28] the  doctor  tells  us  it's  got  medication 
 in  and  it  will  literally  work  so 
 whatever  we  believe  ends  up  happening
[06:34] so  why  not  just  believe  for  your  benefit 
 why  not  just  say  to  yourself  you  know  if 
 you're  having  doubts  and  you're  thinking
[06:39] wait  this  isn't  gonna  work  it's  not 
 gonna  work  for  me  why  not  just  think  in 
 terms  of  your  benefit  instead  of  against
[06:44] you  why  not  just  arrogantly  think  like 
 yep  yes  it  is  it's  gonna  work  viewing  is 
 gonna  give  me  a  fantastic  jawline  it's
[06:50] gonna  improve  my  health  i'm  gonna  see 
 visible  gains  in  my  jawline  three  weeks 
 from  now  why  not  convince  yourself  of
[06:55] that  and  then  just  see  what  happens 
 because  when  when  you  add  the  power  of 
 leaf  i  know  it  sounds  kind  of
[07:00] wishy-washy  spiritual  and  stuff  and  i'm 
 not  usually  that  kind  of  guy  i'm  usually 
 like  a  very  like  practical  no  bs  telling
[07:05] me  the  facts  and  figures  and  type  of 
 [ __ ]  but  this  the  way  you  think 
 something  will  happen  what  you  expect
[07:10] will  happen  it  often  does  happen 
 visualize  mewing  working  for  you  and 
 that  you'll  live  like  this  forever
[07:16] visualize  yourself  old  and  you're 
 exercising  and  you're  still  muting  at 
 that  point  you're  literally  50  years  old
[07:21] 60  70  years  old  still  mu  and  still 
 breathing  from  your  nose  and  you're 
 actually  really  good  at  breathing  from 
 your  nose  at  that  point  whereas  everyone
[07:27] else  your  age  is  like  panting  and  their 
 mouth  breathing  like 
 just  going  up  a  flight  of  stairs  i  hope
[07:32] that  helps  you  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it

Q-UeDVuYf28,"[00:00] i'm  gonna  start  this  video  by  giving  the 
 viewer  that  means  you  dumbass  some 
 motivation  so  listen  up  it's  actually
[00:07] better  to  be  somewhat  unattractive 
 naturally  to  experience  ugly  duckling
[00:12] syndrome  because  you  enjoy  the  trials 
 and  tribulations  of  being  unattractive 
 and  that  coupled  with  self-improvement
[00:19] is  the  best  of  both  worlds  you'll 
 improve  your  physical  attractiveness 
 with  ways  that  you'll  learn  by  the  end
[00:24] of  this  video  and  by  experiencing  both 
 sides  to  life  you  become  more  grateful
[00:29] and  appreciative  for  your  increased 
 attractiveness  with  that  being  said  let 
 me  briefly  tell  you  my  story  and  then
[00:35] we'll  move  on  to  the  practical  guide 
 which  will  improve  your  physical 
 attractiveness  and  seriously  this  is
[00:40] very  important  when  i  was  growing  up 
 people  used  to  say  that  i  was  cute  but  i
[00:45] always  thought  i  was  pretty  ugly  i  was 
 short  i  had  these  adorable  chubby  cheeks 
 skinny  fat  you  know  the  deal  however  i
[00:52] always  had  a  great  positive  mindset 
 that's  what  you're  gonna  learn  in  this 
 video  i  knew  that  all  it  would  take  to
[00:58] look  better  was  effort  so  after  high 
 school  i  started  putting  some  effort 
 into  my  looks  by  lifting  weights  doing
[01:04] some  bits  of  optimization  to  my  hair  and 
 my  skin  and  i'm  gonna  be  honest  almost
[01:09] straight  away  people  started  treating  me 
 better  it  was  like  i  went  from  being 
 invisible  to  most  people  to  suddenly
[01:15] getting  a  lot  more  attention  and  quite 
 positive  attention  this  made  all  of  life
[01:21] better  because  think  for  a  second  about 
 the  positive  feedback  loop  of  improving
[01:26] your  attractiveness  people  treat  you 
 better  when  you  get  treated  better  by 
 other  people  you  feel  more  confident
[01:32] more  happy  more  positive  this  makes  your 
 life  better  and  serves  as  a  loop  because 
 confident  happy  people  are  even  more
[01:39] attractive  you're  more  likely  to  make 
 friends  get  invited  to  social 
 experiences  you're  more  likely  to  get
[01:44] more  tips  in  your  job  get  more 
 opportunities  let  me  remind  you  that 
 this  is  not  the  result  of  being
[01:50] attractive  the  specific  word  that  we're 
 using  is  improving  attractiveness  any
[01:56] improvements  to  your  physical 
 attractiveness  will  improve  the  rest  of 
 your  life  and  the  overwhelming  majority
[02:03] of  us  can  make  some  simple  improvements 
 to  our  physical  attractiveness  and  we 
 could  start  today  the  mentality  of  this
[02:09] is  that  there's  lots  of  things  about  our 
 looks  that  we  can't  change  you  can't 
 change  any  physical  deformities  that
[02:15] make  you  feel  insecure  you  can't  change 
 your  height  you  can't  change  your  race
[02:20] you  can't  change  lots  of  things  about 
 you  but  that's  okay  because  there  are 
 some  things  that  we  can  just  devote  our
[02:25] focus  to  which  we  can  make  improvements 
 in  and  for  men  the  biggest  most
[02:30] important  thing  is  our  body  and  i'm  not 
 talking  about  dieting  and  doing  cardio
[02:36] to  get  slim  i'm  talking  about  resistance 
 training  to  build  a  muscular  aesthetic
[02:41] body  your  body  is  a  symbol  a  sign  of  how 
 much  work  you've  put  into  your 
 self-improvement  how  much  intention
[02:47] you've  put  into  pushing  past  the  burn 
 and  how  much  you  have  invested  into  a 
 healthy  diet  your  body  is  the  physical
[02:55] indicator  of  the  amount  of  delayed 
 gratification  you  have  invested  in  the 
 entire  world  can  see  that
[03:01] that's  powerful  quick  side  note  this  is 
 also  why  i  don't  trust  any
[03:06] self-improvement  youtubers  unless  they 
 are  fit  and  muscular  if  they  haven't 
 trained  their  body  they're  missing  a
[03:11] vital  pillar  of  self-improvement  they're 
 speaking  about  self-improvement  for  the 
 sake  of  growing  a  self-improvement
[03:17] youtube  channel  not  for  the  sake  of 
 providing  real  authentic  value  to  the
[03:22] audience  building  muscle  and  improving 
 your  body  also  makes  your  face  look  more 
 attractive  do  not  believe  that  in  cell
[03:29] black  pill  that  you  see  online 
 getting  muscular  will  undoubtedly 
 improve  your  face  too  your  face  looks
[03:35] more  masculine  and  strong  when  you've 
 got  a  muscular  body  and 
 my  theory  is  that  the  positive  feedback
[03:41] loop  of  increased  attractiveness  also 
 improves  your  testosterone  because  it 
 makes  sense  increased  attractiveness
[03:46] would  probably  mean  that  you'd  get  more 
 girlfriends  and  dates  in  your  life  that 
 would  increase  your  testosterone  and
[03:51] increase  testosterone  would  improve  your 
 face  as  well 
 train  hard  with  different  styles  of
[03:56] exercise  i  like  weightlifting  and  using 
 the  gymnastic  rings  if  you've  been
[04:01] watching  the  clips  of  the  gymnastic 
 rings  and  thinking  that  that  looks  like 
 a  cool  style  of  training  they  seriously
[04:06] are  i've  never  been  this  strong  or 
 jacked  before  and  i  think  that's  due  to 
 the  gymnastic  rings  training  that  i've
[04:12] been  doing  seriously  fun  style  of 
 training  a  card  will  pop  up  on  screen 
 right  now  click  on  it  to  watch  a  20
[04:18] minute  video  on  the  gymnastic  rings  diet 
 is  extremely  important  in  physical
[04:23] attractiveness  we  used  to  say  that  you 
 are  what  you  eat  and  that  was  the 
 correct  sentence  the  fitness  industry  is
[04:30] now  essentially  lying  to  you  and  saying 
 it  doesn't  matter  what  you  eat  it  only 
 matters  how  much  you  eat  that  isn't
[04:35] exactly  true  i  would  have  to  go  into  so 
 much  more  detail  but  if  you  can  just 
 blindly  trust  me
[04:41] just 
 stick  to  the  unprocessed  low  sugar  high 
 fiber  high  fat  foods  it's  those  foods
[04:48] that  will  fill  you  up  keep  you  so 
 satiated  keep  you  full  of  energy  and 
 feeling  strong  and  that  in  turn  will
[04:54] lead  to  better  performance  in  the  gym 
 which  will  lead  to  better  muscle  and 
 physical  attractiveness  you  of  course
[05:00] can  lose  fat  by  going  in  a  calorie 
 deficit  by  whatever  you  eat  but  don't 
 trust  the  fitness  industry  that  is  one
[05:05] of  the  worst  ways  to  lose  fat  there's  no 
 such  thing  as  unhealthy  food
[05:10] i  feel  healthier  than  i've  ever  been 
 before  and  i  literally  just  had  like  a 
 binge  yesterday  and  i  had  the  binge  the
[05:16] night  before  and  the  night  before 
 i  went  to  mcdonald's  three  days  in  a  row
[05:21] for  some  reason  taking  pride  in  your 
 appearance  and  wanting  to  improve  it  is 
 seen  as  vain  especially  in  our
[05:27] generation  if  that's  the  case  then  i 
 don't  care  i  am  vain  and  i  suggest
[05:32] anyone  watching  this  to  be  vain  because 
 the  benefit  of  being  a  vain  person  who 
 takes  pride  in  their  appearance  is  far
[05:38] better  than  someone  who  doesn't  care 
 about  how  they  look  take  a  look  at 
 yourself  right  now  and  be  honest
[05:44] what  cannot  be  changed  chances  are 
 you're  over  thinking  about  things  that 
 you  can't  change  your  skin  color  your
[05:50] height  how  something  about  you  looks  if 
 you  can't  change  it  it  isn't  even  worth
[05:55] having  the  thought  in  your  head  focus  on 
 what  you  can  change  what  can  you  make
[06:00] improvements  on  as  a  guy  your  body  is 
 the  number  one  do  not  underestimate  how 
 important  a  muscular  physique  is  in
[06:07] terms  of  physical  attractiveness  do  not 
 believe  the  the  media  and  the
[06:12] that  you  know  women  were  saying  that 
 they  prefer  dad  birds  it's  not  true  the 
 girls  who  say  that  they  prefer  dad  bods
[06:18] are  the  ones  who 
 like  the  muscular  bodies  the  most  from 
 my  experience  when  you  build  up  some
[06:24] muscle  you'll  find  the  same  thing  that 
 those  are  the  girls  who  stare  at  your 
 muscles  the  most  and  look  with
[06:30] lust 
 if  you  want  to  see  more  videos  from  a 
 somewhat  unconventional  small  youtuber
[06:37] then  turn  on  the  post  notifications 
 right  now  finally  here's  my  most  viewed 
 video  on  my  channel  it's  a  guide  on
[06:42] building  an  aesthetic  body  it's  one  of 
 the  first  videos  i  made  and  if  you've

qQ53A6SN-ak,"[00:00] he's  finally  texted  me  after  four  days 
 yes  I'm  gonna  respond  straight  away 
 that'll  get  her  I'll  do  it  Jeffrey  don't
[00:05] do  it  no  response  yet  and  so  Jeffrey 
 starts  to  stalk  her  Instagram  story 
 she's  with  another  guy  oh  yeah  he  he's
[00:12] just  they're  just  friends  yeah  they're 
 just  friends 
 oh  [ __ ]  that  just  that  just  gave  me  a
[00:19] [ __ ]  redfill  bro  I'm  gonna  stop  the 
 [ __ ]  intro  right  here  there  was  a 
 girl  like  I  sound  horrible  by  saying 
 this  but  she  had  like  more  of  a  beta
[00:25] male  version  of  me  like  he  looked  like 
 me  but  less  attractive  and  less 
 confident  and  he  and  her  had  a  48  day
[00:32] Snapchat  streak  like  story  thing  like  so 
 they  had  texted  each  other  every  single 
 day  for  48  days  which  is  like  what  two
[00:38] months  almost  and  every  single  time  she 
 would  put  me  on  her  story  at  night  time 
 in  the  back  of  her  car  he  would  start
[00:44] blown  up  if  I  was  there  and  every  single 
 time  I  would  see  her  even  be  repulsed  by
[00:49] this  guy's  messages  and  send  him  the 
 same  messages  back  what  tanza  he's  just 
 my  friend  I  was  just  her  friend  and  she
[00:54] was  naked  when  she  sent  that  message  to 
 him  Adonis 
 Adonis  notices  Anastasia  walking  past
[01:00] him  he  gives  her  a  confident  smile  even 
 a  little  wing  and  then  he  goes  right
[01:05] back  to  his  work  Anastasia  is  left 
 wondering  why  he  isn't  running  up  to  her 
 like  all  of  the  Jeffries  but  it  makes
[01:11] sense  he  is  the  ultimate  male  after  all 
 and  work  is  his  priority  she's  waiting
[01:16] and  waiting  and  waiting  for  his  text 
 message  and  when  it  finally  comes  my  God 
 what  a  text  that  is  instantly  she  is  so
[01:22] excited  to  see  him  how  did  Adonis 
 command  this  much  attraction  from
[01:27] Anastasia  just  from  his  singular  text 
 message  that's  what  Adonis  is  going  to 
 teach  us  today  before  we  begin  you  need
[01:33] to  admit  that  you  are  someone  who 
 probably  needs  this  advice  in  this  video 
 you  need  to  hold  your  hand  up  right  now
[01:38] because  most  guys  can't  do  this  most 
 guys  are  Jeffries  and  they  can't  even 
 admit  that  they're  not  like  excellent  in 
 a  certain  area  you  need  to  hold  your
[01:44] hand  up  and  say  you  know  what  I  often  do 
 get  into  dry  conversations  through  text 
 I  often  do  text  the  girl  and  the
[01:49] attraction  that  we  may  have  had  just 
 diminishes  because  I'm  not  amazing  at 
 texting  before  I've  never  really
[01:54] actively  improved  my  texting  game  I  just 
 text  however  my  default  Jeffrey  brain
[01:59] tells  me  to  do  and  it's  not  been  that 
 effective  so  far  if  you  can  relate  to 
 that  experience  you  need  to  hold  your
[02:04] hand  up  and  just  kind  of  say  like  yeah 
 you  know  what  I  kind  of  need  this  video 
 most  guys  will  never  do  this  they've  got 
 this  arrogant  sense  of  like  yeah  I'm  so
[02:10] sick  a  girl  should  like  me  and  they're 
 lonely  they  stay  like  that  forever  when 
 I  was  17  18  19  21  22  I  totally  admitted
[02:16] to  myself  that  I  wasn't  good  with  girls 
 and  that  I  need  to  constantly  keep 
 improving  so  that  I  could  get  what  I
[02:21] want  which  was  love  and  relationships  I 
 had  that  humility  to  hold  my  hand  up  and
[02:26] say  I  need  to  improve  this  area  of  my 
 life  and  that's  why  I  made  progress  the 
 three  secrets  that  we're  gonna  cover  and
[02:31] one  of  these  is  my  best  one  my  personal 
 one  that  no  one  has  ever  told  you  about 
 because  it's  gonna  seem  so  silly  that
[02:37] every  other  YouTuber  every  other  person 
 you've  ever  asked  for  dating  advice 
 they'll  think  that  it's  weird  you  try  it 
 once  and  you'll  be  like  oh  [ __ ]  okay
[02:42] this  is  how  I'm  gonna  text  for  the  rest 
 of  my  life  my  friend  Sam  has  done  this 
 and  every  single  time  he  uses  this
[02:47] certain  like  tactic  that  I  taught  him  he 
 always  comes  to  me  like  we  always  laugh 
 about  how  stupid  it  is  but  how  it  just 
 has  worked  to  actually  get  what  we  want
[02:54] most  guys  will  never  have  the  confidence 
 to  do  it  because  it  seems  a  bit  weird 
 but  first  of  all  the  first  secret  to 
 avoiding  dry  conversations  and  this  was
[03:00] something  that  I  did  so  many  times  stop 
 asking  boring  ass  questions  never  ever 
 will  you  ever  ask  a  girl  trust  me  never
[03:06] ask  a  girl  ever  again  what  are  you  up  to 
 haha  that  used  to  be  my  first  message
[03:11] that  I  would  send  to  girls  on  Tinder  I 
 remember  that  I  finally  got  two  matches 
 on  Cinder  bro  I  made  my  account  it  took 
 me  like  three  days  this  was  you  know  16
[03:17] 17  years  old  I  got  two  matches  of  girls 
 that  weren't  even  attractive  and  I  sent 
 them  both  what  you  up  to  haha  both  of
[03:23] them  disappeared  the  next  time  I  opened 
 the  app  and  I  was  like  no  no  you  know  if 
 one  disappeared  she  could  have  unmatched
[03:28] me  but  there's  no  way  that  both  of  them 
 would  match  me  broke  I  went  on  to  the 
 other  little  Cog  icon  I  clicked  on  that
[03:33] went  on  to  the  help  I  sent  their  tech 
 support  a  ticket  saying  that  I've 
 mysteriously  lost  my  matches  I'm  gonna
[03:39] say  that  again  my  texting  was  so  dry 
 that  I  lost  both  of  my  matches  in  an
[03:44] event  that  felt  like  there  was  a  tech 
 issue  never  ever  will  you  ever  ask  the 
 girl  hey  what  you  doing  haha  there  was
[03:50] another  girl  that  I  met  from  Tinder  I 
 told  this  story  just  recently  and  my 
 friend  helped  me  to  get  her  phone  number 
 like  I  asked  them  what  to  say  I  got  a
[03:55] phone  number  and  our  conversation  like 
 it  actually  like  you  know  was  very  for  a 
 long  period  of  time  because  she  kept  she
[04:00] never  rejected  me  she  just  you  know  gave 
 me  dry  conversation  and  every  single  day 
 I  would  message  her  hey  what  are  you 
 doing  and  she  would  literally  reply  TV
[04:06] space  you  the  letter  U  question  mark 
 XXX
[04:12] do  you  think  I  ever  even  met  her  in 
 person  never  mind  even  dating  her  or 
 sleeping  with  her  obviously  not  the  guy
[04:18] that  these  girls  are  sleeping  with  are 
 not  asking  them  these  boring  ass 
 questions  like  taking  an  interest  in 
 their  lives  I  know  that  seems  silly
[04:23] because  I  know  that  every  other  piece  of 
 advice  that  you've  probably  seen  online 
 what's  like  that  the  blue  pill  good  boy
[04:28] feeling  that  all  these  other  people  have 
 told  you  on  how  to  attract  girls 
 no  absolutely  not  I'm  telling  you right
[04:34] now  that's  not  the  way  to  attract  a  girl 
 at  all  think  about  it  what  is  the  usual 
 common  experience  of  a  girl  who's  kind
[04:39] of  annoyed  at  the  guy  who  keeps  [ __ ] 
 her  and  won't  commit  that  kind  of  guy  is 
 he  there  like  taking  an  interest  oh  my
[04:44] God  okay  so  you've  got  science  class  and 
 then  Matt's  class  and  then  you've  got  to 
 watch  Steve  no  he's  literally  just
[04:49] taking  an  interest  in  himself  that  kind 
 of  guy  is  quite  selfish  and  the  thing  is 
 women  will  ever  be  able  to  openly  admit
[04:54] these  things  this  is  why  we  don't  ever 
 take  advice  from  women  in  terms  of 
 dating  because  most  women  I  say  about  99 
 can't  really  pinpoint  what  they're
[05:00] actually  attracted  to  women  will  say  oh 
 you  know  I  really  want  the  guy  who  cares 
 about  me  every  guy  that  they're  [ __ ] 
 is  quite  selfish  and  self-interested  so
[05:06] asking  these  questions  to  take  an 
 interest  in  their  life  it's  not  what  the 
 guys  are  doing  that  she's  actually 
 falling  for  so  what  are  they  doing  well
[05:11] they're  using  secret  number  two  which  is 
 to  be  playful  flirty  and  sexual  these
[05:16] guys  are  not  asking  her  these  dry 
 questions  like  oh  wait  what  are  you 
 gonna  do  after  science  club  the  kind  of 
 guys  that  are  actually  sleeping  with
[05:22] these  girls  actually  dating  these  girls 
 these  girls  are  obsessed  with  these 
 girls  are  like  crying  because  this  guy's 
 not  replying  guess  what  these  guys
[05:27] actually  are  like  they  don't  care  about 
 what  she's  doing  they're  just  having 
 like  a  fun  time  messaging  her  and  like
[05:32] playing  around  with  her  so  so  far  we've 
 covered  that  you're  not  gonna  act  like 
 the  guys  who  get  left  on  red  which  are 
 taking  an  interest  in  life  because
[05:37] that's  not  attractive  even  though  every 
 girl  will  tell  you  it  is  it's  so  weird 
 because  it's  like  I'm  telling  you  to  do 
 something  which  girls  will  tell  you
[05:42] doesn't  work  and  yeah  it  will  work 
 you'll  never  find  a  girl  who's  totally 
 obsessed  with  the  guy  who  takes  an 
 interest  in  their  lives  just  as  simple
[05:47] as  that  if  there  is  anyone  like  that  if 
 there  is  any  relationships  like  that 
 it's  usually  that  the  guy's  really 
 feminine  the  girl's  really  masculine  and
[05:52] the  guy's  just  obsessed  with  her  and 
 while  she  wants  to  go  and  do  her  career 
 and  [ __ ]  which  probably  isn't  the  kind 
 of  relationship  that  you  want  if  you're
[05:57] a  masculine  guy  when  a  feminine  woman  if 
 you  want  a  woman  who's  more  taking  an 
 interest  in  you  whilst  you  take  an 
 interest  in  your  work  so  the  way  to  then
[06:03] text  the  girl  is  to  always  hold  this 
 kind  of  like  funny  flirty  playful 
 attitude  when  you  text  that  there's  no
[06:09] dry  oh  what  are  you gonna  do  it's  more 
 like  I  bet  you're  stepping  on  snails 
 right  now  that's  a  [ __ ]  random  one  I
[06:14] bet  like  that's  let's  just  just  try  that 
 bro  instead  of  ever  asking  to  go  oh  what 
 are  you  doing  right  now  literally  just
[06:19] send  another  message  I  bet  you're 
 stepping  on  snails  right  now  I'm  gonna 
 send  that  as  your  first  Tinder  message  I
[06:24] guarantee  you'll  get  more  responses  then 
 hey  how  are  you  doing  to  attract  a  woman 
 it  isn't  even  about  making  her  like  you
[06:30] every  guy  who's  actually  successful  with 
 women  knows  this  and  every  guy  who's  not 
 good  with  women  maybe  you  doesn't  know 
 this  every  [ __ ]  boy  every  player  the
[06:37] guys  who  have  been  Ultra  successful  with 
 women  know  what  it  is  you  don't  have  to 
 make  a  woman  like  you  you  just  have  to 
 make  a  woman  emotionally  invested  into
[06:43] you  you  have  to  Simply  make  her  think 
 more  about  you  and  she  will  fall  for  you
[06:48] it's  as  simple  as  that  you  have  to  take 
 up  more  brain  space  for  her  the  little 
 chump  who's  one  dimensional  and  takes  an
[06:53] interest  in  her  and  just  asks  her  how 
 she's  doing  well  he  doesn't  take  up  that 
 space  because  she's  just  thinking  oh 
 yeah  it's  boring  Chomp  he's  not
[06:58] mysterious  is  yep  that's  what  I  expected 
 him  to  say  I  expected  him  to  send  me  a 
 chumpy  message  he  did  okay  sweet  so 
 you're  not  confirmed  no  need  to  think
[07:04] about  him  anymore  but  Chad  why  won't  he 
 reply  back  and  why  did  he  just  reply 
 back  with  like  a  seemingly  insult  now
[07:10] she's  thinking  about  this  Chad  guy  and 
 she's  taking  a  screenshot  sending  it  to 
 her  friends  like  what  does  this  mean  did 
 she  say  he  said  that  I'm  stepping  on
[07:15] snails  what  does  he  mean  you  make  her 
 think  about  something  you  act  playful 
 and  flirty  and  a  little  bit  sexual  I  bet
[07:21] you're  watching  step  brother  porn  right 
 now  now  obviously  you've  got  to  kind  of 
 know  your  audience  and  you  don't  want  to
[07:26] do  this  with  some  girls  offended  or 
 something  but  the  thing  is  the  guy  who's 
 actually  getting  this  girl  doesn't  even
[07:31] give  a  [ __ ]  if  she's  offended  you  don't 
 need  to  like  steal  my  lines  but  you  need 
 to  just  come  up  with  something  that 
 actually  makes  you  laugh  the  whole  point
[07:36] of  this  is  that  you're  this  like 
 authentic  high  value  guy  who's  literally 
 just  doing  whatever  you  want  so  don't
[07:41] just  completely  copy  my  sentences  but 
 find  something  that  literally  makes  you 
 laugh  like  you  can't  stop  laughing  as
[07:46] you're  about  to  send  it  to  her  like 
 you're  just  playing  with  it  you're  just 
 teasing  her  and  when  you've  done  that  I 
 guarantee  that  if  this  girl  is  actually
[07:51] attracted  to  your  normal  natural 
 masculine  energy  she's  gonna  be  totally 
 into  you  she's  gonna  text  you  back
[07:56] something  great  and  she's  gonna  take  an 
 interest  in  you  and  this  is  actually 
 where  most  guys  [ __ ]  up  so  you  may  have
[08:01] done  this  before  you  may  have  actually 
 been  quite  attractive  to  a  girl  she's 
 actually  texting  you  she's  interested  in 
 you  it  seems  all  great  you  might  even  go
[08:07] meet  up  and  then  she  just  kind  of 
 disappears  she  stops  replying  she  starts 
 ghosting  you  so  many  guys  have  been
[08:12] through  this  and  they  don't  realize  the 
 most  important  secret  that  we  need  to 
 cover  which  is  my  special  one  which  will
[08:17] save  you  from  this  experience  of  you 
 know  actually  doing  well  with  a  girl  and 
 then  falling  off  the  guys  who  know  what
[08:22] to  do  at  this  point  usually  won't  tell 
 you  because  you  know  if  I  tell  you  this 
 you're  gonna  start  like  taking  more 
 girls  and  I  don't  want  you  to  do  that 
 but  you  know  what  I'm  gonna  tell  you  and
[08:28] it's  gonna  seem  weird  and  you're  not 
 going  to  implement  it  but  maybe  one 
 percent  of  people  who  watch  this  video 
 are  gonna  implemented  actually  think 
 okay  [ __ ]  I'm  gonna  use  this  tactic  for
[08:33] the  rest  of  my  life  and  are  you  ready 
 secret  number  three  and  the  most 
 important  most  weird  that  you're 
 probably  not  going  to  implement  because
[08:38] you're  too  soft  for  this  do  not  let  her 
 burn  the  conversation  to  the  ground
[08:43] quite  frankly  a  lot  of  girls  are  boring 
 as  [ __ ]  most  guys  will  let  a  woman  take
[08:48] the  lead  a  girl  will  take  interest  in 
 them  you  know  the  guy  said  something 
 nice  so  the  guys  look  attractive  and  the
[08:53] girl  will  send  them  a  message  like  also 
 what  are  you  up  to  right  now  hey  how  you 
 doing  the  girl  will  ask  these  questions 
 and  guys  will  get  they  oh  my  God  guys
[08:59] she's  asking  me  a  question  well  she's 
 taking  it  inside  yeah  I'm  good  how  are 
 you  no  reply  she  sent  you  a  message
[09:04] asking  how  you  are  you  reply  because  you 
 know  she's  just  taking  an  interest  in 
 you  and  then  she  doesn't  reply  to  you
[09:09] what  most  guys  don't  understand  what  the 
 [ __ ]  just  happened  because  some  girls 
 when  they  start  to  lead  the  text  message
[09:14] conversation  and  they  start  to  ask  you 
 the  question  and  it's  natural  for  you  to 
 answer  and  then  ask  them  oh  what  are  you
[09:19] what  do  you  think  about  the  same  topic 
 it  is  boring  guess  what  most  guys  would 
 do  and  it's  the  worst  thing  possible  to
[09:24] do  to  maintain  or  even  grow  her 
 attraction  it's  something  that  you  do 
 all  the  time  even  though  it  seems  Common 
 Sense  she  asks  a  question  guess  what
[09:30] most  guys  do  they  answer  the  question 
 most  guys  by  answering  her  shitty  boring
[09:35] question  will  make  the  conversation  just 
 die  out  because  now  you're  in  this 
 boring  conversation  about  oh  how  are  you
[09:40] do  you  want  to  know  what  secret  number 
 three  actually  looks  like  in  a  practical 
 sense  and  you  might  not  even  have  the 
 confidence  to  do  this  because  it  seems
[09:45] quite  socially  abnormal  she  will  ask  you 
 a  boring  ass  question  this  will  come  up 
 it's  almost  a  trap  and  you  move  on  as  if
[09:50] she  hasn't  even  said  that  you  just  move 
 on  to  the  next  thing  that  you  wanted  to 
 say  what  are  you doing  tonight  are  you 
 free  at  6pm  it's  gonna  seem  a  little  bit
[09:56] like  you're  autistic  this  is  why  most 
 guys  don't  have  the  confidence  for  this 
 she's  going  to  ask  you  a  question  and 
 the  normal  social  thing  to  do  is  to
[10:01] respond  to  the  question  and  move  on  no 
 no  she's  going  to  ask  this  boring  ass 
 question  and  you're  going  to  reply  with
[10:06] something  that's  just  instantly  more 
 exciting  and  attractive  even  though  it 
 seems  like  it's  so  weird  like  you've  not
[10:11] answered  this  question  girls  are  so 
 attracted  to  a  guy  who  does  this  that 
 they  don't  even  usually  pick  up  on  this 
 sometimes  a  girl  will  play  oh  you  didn't
[10:17] ask  my  question  secret  number  three 
 which  I'm  sure  that  most  guys  are  never 
 going  to  use  because  you  need  a  level  of
[10:22] confidence  for  this  most  guys  are 
 [ __ ]  honestly  it's  probably  you  I'm 
 not  gonna  lie  it  probably  is  you  right 
 just  probably  this  but  if  you  weren't  a
[10:28] [ __ ]  and  if  you  really  wanted  to  get 
 this  girl  you  wouldn't  allow  her  to  burn 
 the  conversation  to  the  ground  and  she
[10:33] doesn't  really  mean  to  do  this  when  a 
 girl  takes  an  interest  in  you  and  asks 
 you questions  that's  a  good  sign  but 
 most  guys  take  that  good  sign  and  they
[10:38] ruin  it  by  answering  her  question  and 
 then  the  conversation  just  stands  out 
 the  best  thing  you  can  do  when  she  asks 
 you  a  question  that's  gonna  lead  to  a
[10:44] boring  part  of  the  conversation  just 
 ignore  it  completely  ignore  it 
 completely  send  a  message  as  if  you've
[10:49] not  even  seen  that  straight  away  when 
 she  sent  you  some  boring  ass  [ __ ]  a 
 question  you  reply  with  the  secret 
 number  two  like  a  quick  statement
[10:54] accusation  like  a  little  playful  thing 
 like  hey  how  are  you  I  bet  you're 
 watching  Step  Brothers  porn  right  now
[10:59] just  because  it's  literally  she's  gonna 
 remember  you  so  much  more  than  the 
 [ __ ]  Dewey  who  replies  yeah  I'm  good
[11:05] how  are  you  honestly  you  want  the  best 
 secrets  for  getting  girls  secret  number 
 four  bonus  secret  just  make  her
[11:10] emotionally  invested  in  you  do  whatever 
 it  takes  to  make  her  think  about  you  the 
 most  most  guys  most  girls  will  never  be
[11:16] able  to  tell  you  this  even  the  guys  who 
 do  this  themselves  don't  even  know  what 
 they're  doing  I'm  telling  you  right  now 
 there  is  one  secret  way  one  absolute  way
[11:21] to  make  a  girl  obsessed  with  you  just 
 make  her  think  about  you  all  the  time 
 most  guys  are  too  impossy  for  this  and
[11:26] they'll  only  want  her  to  think  about 
 them  in  the  positive  sense  the  real 
 Chads  the  real  [ __ ]  boys  the  real 
 players  the  guy  who  gets  so  many  girls
[11:31] because  they're  just  [ __ ]  good  at 
 navigating  women  they  know  for  a  fact 
 it's  not  just  about  her  thinking
[11:36] positive  things  in  her  mind  it's  about 
 making  her  angry  making  her  upset  making 
 her  emotional  making  her  excited  every
[11:42] spectrum  of  the  emotion  for  guys  for  us 
 to  like  a  girl  it's  only  one  Spectrum 
 it's  just  like  attraction  it's  just
[11:47] liking  them  for  a  girl  to  like  us  it's 
 this  whole  spectrum  of  like  the  more 
 emotions  excitement  horror  anxiety
[11:53] stress  happiness  all  these  ones 
 literally  there's  hundreds  of  motions 
 the  more  that  you  can  tap  into  the  more
[11:58] that  she's  gonna  be  be  into  most  guys 
 are  going  to  be  too  afraid  to  do  this 
 they're  going  to  struggle  with  girls  for 
 the  rest  of  their  lives  but  if  you  can
[12:03] just  somewhat  agree  with  this  message 
 and  just  try  it  next  time  obviously 
 don't  get  put  in  jail  or  anything  but 
 just  remember  this  concept  of  okay  you
[12:09] want  to  hit  the  spectrum  of  emotions 
 you'll  realize  the  truth  behind 
 attracting  girls  is  so  simple  it's  just 
 that  we  as  men  have  been  trying  to
[12:15] attract  girls  in  the  way  that  we  would 
 be  attracted  to  a  girl  which  is  okay 
 like  we've  got  to  like  him  for  a  girl  to 
 be  attracted  to  you  and  actually  want  to
[12:21] [ __ ]  you  it's  not  even  about  just 
 attraction  it's  just  about  emotional 
 Investments  this  is  why  the  guy  like  the
[12:27] Chads  Drive  women  insane  crazy  this  is 
 why  you  often  see  girls  complaining  and 
 get  angry  about  the  guy  that  they're
[12:33] [ __ ]  they're  [ __ ]  them  and  they're 
 not  even  thinking  positively  about  them 
 and  so  here's  you  the  one-dimensional

 hit  one  one  little  part  of  the  emotional 
 Circle  that's  the  one  overpowered

 you  don't  even  know  where  you've  went 
 wrong  do  you  picture  your  personality  in
[00:05] terms  of  how  feminine  or  masculine  you 
 are  you're  a  modern  young  man  that 
 probably  means  you're  way  more  feminine
[00:10] than  you'd  like  to  be  jeffrey  and  jess 
 says  that  it's  okay  that  you  should  be 
 even  more  feminine  but  they  don't
[00:15] realize  that  quite  frankly  one  of  your 
 biggest  goals  is  to  attract  more  women 
 to  have  more  sex  and  to  eventually  have
[00:20] an  amazing  wife  and  children  you  will 
 only  get  to  that  point  if  you  rebalance 
 your  masculine  and  your  feminine  energy
[00:25] jeffrey  and  jess  are  gonna  get  offended 
 at  this  pursuit  of  ours  select  them
[00:30] adonis  on  the  other  hand  understands  the 
 importance  of  this  pursuit  for  young  men 
 to  be  less  feminine  he  looks  around  at
[00:35] you  and  your  friends  and  wonders  why  are 
 men  so  emotional  these  days  why  do  men 
 spend  so  much  time  playing  and  enjoying
[00:41] themselves  with  this  weird  stimulating 
 rectangle  screen  instead  of  conquering
[00:46] the  mission  like  men  are  supposed  to 
 there's  no  short  supply  of  insecure  men 
 with  [ __ ]  tits  these  days  and  you  know
[00:52] that's  [ __ ]  broke  i've  got  a  [ __ ] 
 gyno  do  you  know  what  that  is  i've  got 
 [ __ ]  gyno  gynecomastia  it's  like  a
[00:57] somewhat  of  a  medical  condition  that  can 
 happen  to  like  10  20  30  of  of  teenagers
[01:02] of  boys  who  will  have  elevated  levels  of 
 estrogen  through  puberty  and  they'll 
 develop  like  titty-like  substance  we're
[01:09] not  supposed  to  talk  about  this  [ __ ]  you 
 know  this  is  weird  as  [ __ ]  to  talk  about 
 right  how  weird  is  that  that  a  large 
 number  of  young  male  teenagers  literally
[01:15] develop  breasts  we  live  in  a  time  where 
 like  males  are  a  lot  more  feminine  than
[01:20] they  should  be  your  testosterone  is 
 about  30  less  than  what  it  would  have 
 been  if  we  were  born  20  30  years  earlier
[01:27] your  sperm  count  is  50  percent  less 
 there's  a  shockingly  high  number  of  men 
 who  are  no  longer  fertile  imagine  that
[01:33] bro  imagine  you  go  your  entire  life 
 thinking  that  you're  going  to  be  a 
 father  that  you  know  you're  going  to 
 have  children  you're  going to  have  a 
 wife  and  then  you  realize  that  your
[01:38] sperm  are  all  like  deformed  and  they 
 can't  even  like  swim  properly  men  being
[01:43] less  masculine  and  more  feminine  is 
 deeper  than  we  think  it  is  and  it  starts 
 with  our  societal  conditioning  because
[01:49] when  you  were  a  little  boy  and  you  went 
 to  school  and  you  were  raised  secondhand 
 by  these  female  teachers  who  didn't
[01:54] understand  masculinity  you  were  raised 
 in  the  feminine  structure  of  the 
 education  system  this  sounds  like  really
[01:59] dark  so  we're  talking  about  conspiracy 
 theories  and  stuff  but  it's  the  truth  if 
 you're  raised  by  a  bunch  of  women  who 
 don't  really  research  you  know  your
[02:04] female  teachers  in  primary  school  in 
 high  school  didn't  read  books  on 
 masculinity  they  didn't  think  how  can  i 
 develop  these  men  to  be  more  masculine
[02:10] they  thought  okay  how  can  i  silence  this 
 class  so  that  i  can  talk  uninterrupted 
 how  can  i  make  sure  none  of  the  boys  are
[02:15] playing  too  aggressively  how  can  i  make 
 sure  they're  not  fighting  each  other  but 
 that's  what  we  do  as  men  the  words  that
[02:20] i'm  saying  here  in  this  video  and  the 
 way  that  this  video  is  packaged  it's 
 titled  how  to  be  less  feminine  i 
 literally  have  to  take  a  minute  before
[02:25] recording  this  video  just  thinking  ah  is 
 it  worth  it  because  the  message  is  kind 
 of  important  but  i  might  get  cancelled
[02:30] for  this  we're  not  allowed  to  speak 
 about  this  topic  that  like  men  should  be 
 less  masculine  that  you  haven't  been
[02:36] raised  in  the  best  way  and  the  truth  is 
 as  a  young  man  you  know  that  you  don't 
 even  need  me  to  tell  you  you  know  that
[02:41] you  have  this  like  ill  balance  of  energy 
 inside  of  you  and  it  literally  seeps 
 outwards  into  the  way  that  you  look  why
[02:47] are  so  many  young  men  so  fluffy  like  you 
 can  say  this  this  is  body  dysmorphia  or 
 body  shaming  or  something  but  why  are  so
[02:52] many  young  men  literally  starting  to 
 shape  like  women  without  even  meaning  to
[02:57] the  majority  of  young  men  have  like  fat 
 hips  like  breast  fat  soft  voices  low
[03:02] testosterone  higher  estrogen  what  does 
 that  lead  to  well  it  leads  to  a  young 
 man  who's  way  more  emotional  and  the
[03:07] modern  day  will  tell  you  well 
 men  should  be  more  emotional  but 
 you  know  100  the  thing  is  i  promote
[03:14] positive  emotions  i  promote  gratitude 
 love  mindfulness  100  that's  amazing  but
[03:20] telling  people  you  should  be  more 
 emotional  especially  their  lens  of 
 emotions  is  the  negative  ones  it's  about 
 like  crying  it's  about  like  feelings  of
[03:26] insecurity  like  why  would  you  want  to 
 feel  more  negative  emotions  why  do  they
[03:31] want  to  normalize  weakness  inside  of  you 
 because  that  is  not  allowed  in  adonis's 
 tribe  if  you  want  to  join  our  cult  of
[03:36] young  men  on  holistic  self-improvement 
 striving  to  be  more  like  adonis  you  can
[03:41] be  weak  but  there  is  one  requirement  to 
 join  this  cult  you  must  want  to  improve
[03:46] you  can  be  weak  but  you  must  strive  for 
 strength  the  only  thing  that  we  care 
 about  in  this  cult  this  brotherhood  is
[03:51] that  we  all  want  to  improve  ourselves 
 saying  that  it's  okay  to  be  weak  saying 
 that  you  know  you  should  you  should  be
[03:56] fine  just  how  you  are  you  should  love 
 yourself  it  doesn't  work  for  us  as  many 
 times  as  these  jeffries  want  to  say  to
[04:02] young  man  like  oh  you  know  he  just  be 
 yourself  it's  like  bro  that  advice  has 
 never  worked  for  us  we  don't  feel  good
[04:07] when  we  follow  it  because  just  being 
 ourselves  is  being  a  pathetic  loser 
 who's  addicted  to  video  games  who's
[04:12] watching  porn  who's  literally  watching 
 porn  watching  some  other  man  have  sex 
 with  the  woman  that  we're  attracted  to
[04:18] with  negative  thoughts  in  our  mind  and 
 these  people  are  telling  us  well  just  be 
 yourself  that's  okay  well  no  it's  not
[04:24] okay  we  are  not  happy  living  like  that 
 anymore  so  we  need  to  be  more  masculine 
 and  so  we  need  to  be  less  feminine
[04:30] explained  in  my  how  to  be  more  masculine 
 video  you  should  watch  that  on  my 
 channel  that  the  masculine  energy  is  all
[04:35] about  the  mission  the  objective  the  goal 
 it's  all  about  striving  to  conquer  the 
 goal  and  then  move  on  to  the  next  one
[04:40] and  the  next  one  and  the  next  one  the 
 feminine  energy  is  all  about  the  flow  of 
 love  of  joy  community  empathy  nurturing
[04:46] now  we  all  have  both  energies  inside  of 
 us  but  what  matters  is  the  split  the 
 ratio  inside  of  us  i  found  that  on
[04:52] average  like  most  men  my  age  in  this 
 modern  day  have  about  a  50  50  split 
 sometimes  it's  60  40  sometimes  it's  40
[04:58] 60  but  it's  about  50  50  for  most  men  but 
 i  found  with  the  men  who  really  feel 
 actualized  the  men  who  really  feel  like
[05:03] happy  with  themselves  who  feel  like 
 they're  conquering  goals  that  are 
 worthwhile  who  like  who  are  sleeping
[05:08] with  a  good  amount  of  like  beautiful 
 girls  bro  they're  more  like  80  20.  we're 
 always  gonna  have  some  feminine  energy
[05:13] inside  of  us  and  that's  like  that's  a 
 good  thing  our  ability  to  love  and  to  be 
 loved  our  ability  to  be  empathetic
[05:18] towards  other  people  that's  actually 
 very  very  important  what  you  see  in 
 front  of  you  right  now  you  might  think 
 oh  yeah  like  hums  is  a  masculine  man
[05:23] like  he  has  a  good  body  and  he  sounds 
 really  confident  but  the  truth  is  i 
 actually  have  a  fair  amount  of  feminine
[05:29] energy  and  i  wouldn't  even  change  that 
 because  the  amount  that  i  have  is  very 
 like  controlled  it's  very  like  i've  set
[05:34] it  with  intention  the  work  that  you  see 
 which  i'm  doing  in  front  of  you  is  quite 
 feminine  because  i'm  using  empathy  to
[05:39] understand  your  problems  and  to  give  you 
 advice  for  that  so  feminine  energy  is 
 valuable  but  you  don't  want  a  surplus  on
[05:44] it  you  don't  want  an  excess  of  feminine 
 energy  inside  of  you  so  how  do  you  be 
 less  feminine  and  i  want  to  give  you
[05:50] advice  which  is  better  than  just  saying 
 oh  well  be  more  masculine  how  do  you 
 specifically  reduce  the  feminine  parts
[05:55] inside  of  you  this  is  going  to  sound 
 crazy  because  pretty  much  no  one  in  the 
 modern  world  will  actually  tell  you  this 
 you  need  to  devalue
[06:01] love  and  joy 
 love  and  joy  are  kind  of  like  the  two 
 like  most  but  you know  love  is
[06:06] everything  that's  that's  what  the  modern 
 day  like  that's  the  the  dynamic  we  have 
 that's  what  these  hollywood  movies  have
[06:11] always  tried  to  convince  you  and  we've 
 believed  it  love  is  everything  it's  it's 
 the  most  important  force  in  the  world  if
[06:16] you're  not  having  fun  then  it  doesn't 
 happiness  is  the  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  next 
 time  you  see  those  movies  trying  to 
 brainwash  you  tell  them  shut  the  [ __ ]  up
[06:21] i  don't  want  to  be  feminine  anymore 
 that's  what  all  these  books  that's  all 
 all  these  jeffries  with  skinny  necks  and
[06:26] skinny  wrists  will  tell  you  is  like  oh 
 happiness  is  the  most  no  it's  not  not 
 for  a  masculine  man  the  most  important
[06:31] thing  in  the  world  is  the  mission 
 happiness  is  just  a  fleeting  emotion  if 
 you've  ever  looked  into  stoicism  you
[06:36] know  that  we  cannot  base  our  big 
 decisions  our  like  our  life  of  emotions 
 happiness  and  joy  our  emotions  they  are
[06:41] nice  to  have  this  isn't  saying  like  oh 
 yeah  we're  going  to  be  dark  oh  we're 
 trying  to  feel  like  [ __ ]  like  no  we're
[06:46] not  trying  to  feel  like  [ __ ]  we'd  like 
 to  feel  good  if  we  could  but  if  we  don't 
 feel  good  we  are  still  going  to  conquer
[06:51] that  mission  trying  to  prioritize  love 
 joy  and  happiness  oh  yeah  you  know  good 
 vibes  like  that's  the  modern  [ __ ]  that
[06:57] people  talk  about  like  good  vibes  only 
 trying  to  just  prioritize  those  emotions 
 will  keep  you  kind  of  like  fleeting  to
[07:02] substances  to  instant  gratification  to 
 people  that  you  shouldn't  be  around 
 masculine  men  are  more  like  rocks  they
[07:07] don't  budge  easily  you  need  to  devalue 
 these  like  feel  good  emotions  that 
 you've  been  told  are  the  most  important
[07:12] things  in  the  world  and  instead  you  need 
 to  start  valuing  goals  the  mission  your 
 objective  what  is  okay  what  is  the
[07:18] current  goal  right  now  maybe  for  you 
 it's  to  finish  watching  this  video  and 
 have  a  good  understanding  of  masculine
[07:23] feminine  energy  then  that  goal  will  be 
 checked  off  the  next  goal  is  oh  i'm 
 running  late  on  my  muscle  protein
[07:28] synthesis  let  me  go  downstairs  and  make 
 that  food  conquer  that  goal  then  the 
 goal  is  okay  let  me  eat  this  conquer 
 that  goal  then  the  next  goal  is  let  me
[07:34] read  for  two  hours  conquer  that  goal  you 
 focus  on  the  goal  the  objective  the 
 mission  you  focus  on  these  tasks  that
[07:39] need  to  be  checked  off  you  focus  on 
 purpose  the  greater  vision  for  your  work 
 you  focus  on  being  a  man  instead  of  just
[07:45] feeling  the  flow  i've  really  noticed 
 like  the  feminine  energy  inside  one  of 
 my  best  friends  sam  he's  my  first  video
[07:50] editor  for  this  channel  and  i'm 
 traveling  with  him  we're  in  thailand 
 right  now  i'm  traveling  with  him  and 
 another  best  friend  nabeel  and  there's  a
[07:56] key  moment  i  didn't  really  say  this  too 
 much  to  him  but  we  were  all  bringing 
 back  like  bags  of  like  heavy  stuff  like
[08:01] heavy  water  bottles  and  everything  and 
 it  was  kind  of  annoying  because  there 
 was  a  lot  of  flies  like  big  ass  [ __ ]
[08:06] flies  just  flying  everything  like  a  lot 
 of  them  imagine  like  they're  like 
 literally  everywhere  we  get  out  of  the 
 taxi  here  we're  walking  up  we  come  up  to
[08:12] our  villa  and  i  saw  the  masculine  energy 
 inside  of  me  and  nabil  it  was  like  i 
 could  so  clearly  see  that  inside  of  our
[08:18] minds  was  okay  it's  uncomfortable  here 
 grab  like  the  bags  and  take  them  inside 
 that's  the  current  mission  whereas  i  saw
[08:24] the  feminine  energy  inside  of  sam 
 because  we  walk  in  and  he  sees  like  how 
 beautiful  this  place  is  he  sees  like  how
[08:29] like  beautiful  the  sunset  is  and  the 
 first  thing  he  does  is  like  drop  the 
 bags  and  he's  like  just  like  in  or  he's 
 like  enjoying  the  view  and  like  taking  a
[08:35] picture  of  it  and  everything  that's 
 quite  a  specific  example  wanting  to  take 
 a  picture  of  the  sunset  it doesn't  just 
 automatically  make  you  feminine  but
[08:40] being  too  feminine  is  one  of  sam's  like 
 biggest  problems  that  he's  really 
 journaled  about  he's  really  been  talking
[08:45] to  us  about  and  so  i  really  saw  this 
 inside  of  him  and  why  do  you  think  that 
 is  you  may  not  know  my  friend  sam  you
[08:50] may  have  seen  him  in  some  of  my  videos 
 but  why  would  a  young  man's  biggest 
 problem  be  too  much  feminine  energy
[08:56] inside  of  him  well  sam  says  it's  because 
 he's  been  raised  by  a  single  mother  he 
 hasn't  really  had  that  much  of  his  like
[09:01] father's  masculine  guidance  around  him 
 and 
 truthfully  like  me  too  i  wasn't  raised
[09:06] by  a  single  mother  my  father  was  always 
 in  the  home  but  like  i  wasn't  that  close 
 to  him  so  i  didn't  have  like  a  masculine
[09:11] role  model  to  really  look  up  to  to 
 imitate  you  may  have  not  had  one  either 
 see  this  is  where  it  gets  like  really
[09:17] deep  and  controversial  to  talk  about 
 masculinity  and  femininity  in  like  more 
 of  a  political  situation  i  am  not  like  a
[09:23] political  guy  at  all  i'm  totally  like 
 ignorant  on  these  things  but  it  does 
 seem  to  me  that  there  is  more  of  like  a
[09:28] political  stance  against  masculinity  and 
 especially  against  fatherhood  there's  a
[09:34] lot  of  like  social  justice  against 
 fathers  and  four  mothers  i  believe
[09:39] fathers  get  custody  of  their  children 
 only 
 nine  percent  of  the  time  and  that  means
[09:44] that  we  are  the  first  generation  of  boys 
 without  fathers  so  is  it  any  wonder  that 
 our  generation  of  boys  are  so  feminine
[09:51] that's  something  for  you  to  decide  if 
 you  want  to  like  you  know  look  into  this 
 politically  i  don't  really  care  for  that 
 thing  i  don't  really  care  for  that  but
[09:56] there  is  a  salvation  to  this  join  a 
 tribe  be  surrounded  by  a  brotherhood  of
[10:01] masculinity  be  surrounded  by  a 
 brotherhood  of  like-minded  men  who  want 
 to  improve  themselves  in  adonis's  tribe
[10:07] you  will  find  a  place  where  you  feel 
 important  this  is  the  first  and  only
[10:12] modern  cult  that  is  holistically  good 
 for  you  you  have  in  front  of  you  that 
 offer  to  join  a  cult  of  young  men  who
[10:18] are  no  longer  fine  with  being  weak  and 
 feminine  this  doesn't  mean  like  you  know 
 we're  toxic  and  we  hate  women  and  [ __ ]
[10:23] like  [ __ ]  no  bro  bro  i  love  women  maybe 
 a  little  bit  too  much 
 but  this  is  a  cult  like  a  brotherhood  a
[10:28] group  of  men  who  say  you  know  what  bro 
 i'm  tired  of  watching  porn  and  feeling 
 like  [ __ ]  because  of  it  and  i  think  you
[10:33] should  stop  as  well  you  know  what  like 
 i've  seen  you  recently  bro  like  you're 
 looking  a  bit  weak  let's  go  to  the  gym
[10:38] let's  go  eat  some  my  protein  bro  let's 
 read  let's  let's  develop  ourselves  let's 
 start  business  together  me  and  my  best
[10:44] friend  nabeel  he's  downstairs  right  now 
 we're  going  to  start  a  business  together 
 we're  going  to  make  a  product  that  we're 
 both  going  to  sell  together  how  fun  is
[10:49] that  we've  literally  all  three  of  us 
 have  been  going  to  muay  thai  in  the  gym 
 together  since  we  got  to  thailand  i've
[10:54] seen  these  guys  they  see  punch  bags  like 
 we  all  have  like  some  scars  on  you  see 
 that  we  all  have  like  some  form  of  like
[10:59] scars  of  like  blood  and  like  tears  are 
 on  us  i  can't  tell  you  how  important 
 that's  been  for  our  growth  you  need  to
[11:05] surround  yourself  with  brothers  who  will 
 test  your  masculinity  and  there's  one 
 final  thing  that  will  make  you  a  lot
[11:10] less  feminine  and  way  more  masculine  and 
 that  is  to  enjoy  your  friends  criticism 
 there  is  a  book  that  is  like  the
[11:15] absolute  bible  for  masculinity  i  promise 
 you  that  this  book  will  change  your  life 
 it  is  called  the  way  of  the  superior  man
[11:21] by  david  dieter  and  one  of  the  chapters 
 in  this  book  is  titled  enjoy  your 
 friends  criticism
[11:26] i  was  always  way  too  sensitive  for  this 
 when  i  was  growing  up  i  didn't  realize 
 that  this  was  a  part  of  masculinity  i
[11:31] thought  my  friends  were  just  being  mean 
 to  me  i  realized  now  that  masculinity 
 and  brotherhood  we  constantly  test  each
[11:36] other  we  constantly  criticize  and  tease 
 each  other  can  you  guess  why  can  you 
 guess  why  a  group  of  guys  who  are
[11:41] masculine  would  tease  each  other  because 
 that  seems  like  a  little  bit  of  like  a 
 little  [ __ ]  move  or  something  why  would
[11:46] like  a  friend  of  yours  who  cares  about 
 you  tease  you  well  he  would  do  it  to 
 test  your  security  in  that  thing  so  sam
[11:53] puts  on  a  shirt  and  i  will  tease  him  and 
 say  like  oh  bro  like  you're  kind  of 
 skinny  in  that  shirt  because  i'm  testing
[11:58] to  see  is  he  securing  himself  because  if 
 he  goes  oh  am  i  looking  am  i  looking 
 skinny  i  might  change  how  am  i  changed
[12:03] that  shows  okay  well  he's  got  no 
 confidence  he's  not  securing  himself  i 
 can't  be  around  a  man  who's  not  securing 
 himself  if  i  say  sam  you  look  skinny  in
[12:09] that  shirt  i  want  him  to  be  like  go  go 
 [ __ ]  yourself  hamza  and  give  me  a  front 
 double  bicep  you  need  to  be  surrounded 
 by  men  who  test  you  and  hold  you  to  a
[12:15] higher  standard  that  is  the  best  thing 
 that  you  can  do  to  be  less  feminine  be 
 more  masculine  you  can  subscribe  to  our
[12:20] channel  if  you  want  to  welcome  to  the 
 cult  do  the  hard  work  especially  when 
 you  don't  feel  like  it
"
Ohv-wFtSmd4,"[00:00] Jeffrey  would  love  to  have  people 
 thinking  about  him  invested  into  him 
 obsessed  with  him  and  so  he  tries  the
[00:07] creepiest  weirdest  ways  to  make  this  a 
 reality  but  all  it  does  is  just  scare 
 off  the  people  that  Jeffrey  actually
[00:12] wanted  in  his  life  the  girl  that  Jeffrey 
 wants  to  attract  is  Obsession  about 
 someone  else  Adonis
[00:19] Adonis  has  a  natural  aura  about  him 
 everyone  in  his  tribe  can't  help  but  be
[00:25] obsessed  with  him  not  only  is  he  the 
 tribe  leader  but  he's  sexy  not  only  is
[00:30] he  the  best  hunter  but  he's  empathetic 
 he  brings  the  full  package  and  he  even
[00:35] uses  special  tricks  to  make  sure  that  he 
 stays  in  his  people's  minds  do  you  think
[00:40] it  sounds  controversial  to  make  people 
 obsessed  with  you  using  psychological 
 tricks
[00:45] yes  do  you  want  to  do  it  anyway  yes  in 
 my  second  year  of  University  I  was  a  boy
[00:51] and  I  used  certain  tricks  that  you're 
 going  to  learn  here  but  I  need  to 
 explain  okay  first  I  use  certain  tricks 
 to  make  girls  obsessed  with  me  I  went
[00:57] from  being  a  kissless  virgin  literally 
 kissless  virgin  about  two  three  years 
 prior  to  this  and  when  I'm  age  21  I  was
[01:03] using  these  tricks  to  the  point  of 
 having  three  girls  in  love  with  me  at 
 the  same  time  and  two  of  them  knew  about 
 each  other  and  they'd  often  like  saw
[01:09] fight  and  argue  with  each  other  when 
 they  see  children  in  the  club  they  were 
 constantly  thinking  about  me  and  they
[01:14] were  free  whenever  I  wanted  to  [ __ ]  I 
 would  literally  just  text  them  come  to 
 my  room  and  boom  literally  20  30  minutes
[01:19] later  she  would  be  there  and  I  wasn't  a 
 good  person  then  so  this  was  four  or 
 five  years  ago  I  was  just  like  a 
 degenerate  [ __ ]  boy  going  to  clubs
[01:25] taking  drugs  and  you  know  sleeping  with 
 lots  of  girls  and  stuff  I  wasn't  like  a 
 nice  person  back  then  but  I  do  remember 
 one  thing  I  did  which  I'm  not  proud  of
[01:30] but  like  one  of  the  girls  that  was 
 obsessed  with  not  even  one  honestly  I 
 was  gonna  say  one  of  the  girls  but 
 honestly  most  of  the  girls  who  were
[01:36] obsessed  with  me  who  I  was  sleeping  with 
 in  University  I'd  often  just  look 
 through  their  phones  like  they'd  usually 
 just  show  me  their  passcodes  and  stuff
[01:41] and  so  when  they'd  be  like  asleep  next 
 to  me  I  just  like  they're  doing  this 
 because  like  it's  just  interesting 
 actually  been  chatting  [ __ ]  she's  been
[01:46] [ __ ]  anyone  else  let's  just  find  out 
 but  I  don't  recommend  doing  this  bro 
 this  isn't  like  it's  not  good  for  your 
 mental  health  at  all  and  it  just  yeah
[01:52] it's  just  not  good  for  you  but  like  let 
 me  tell  you  the  story  of  what  I  did  this 
 girl's  asleep  next  to  me take  a  phone  I 
 know  the  passcode  I'd  answer  and  I  start
[01:58] looking  through  the  text  and  bro  this 
 happened  more  than  once  with  like 
 different  girls  I'd  look  through  the 
 text  and  the  best  text  to  look  through
[02:03] if  you  are  like  a  bad  person  you  want  to 
 look  through  with  girls  but  I  don't 
 recommend  doing  this  plus  if  you  are 
 going  to  do  it  the  best  text  to  look
[02:08] through  her  not  to  look  for  guys  it's 
 actually  to  click  on  her  female  friends 
 and  actually  to  see  like  has  she  been 
 talking  about  like  oh  yeah  [ __ ]  this  guy
[02:14] yesterday  I  click  on  this  girl's  female 
 friends  on  her  text  messages  and 
 literally  they're  all  just  about  me
[02:19] they're  even  like  the  cutest  saddest 
 [ __ ]  of  like  oh  my  God  Hamza  just  text 
 me  and  he's  in  the  club  he's  thinking
[02:25] about  me  yes  this  was  quite  a  long  time 
 that  I  was  using  like  certain  tricks  to
[02:30] make  girls  obsessed  with  me  and  honestly 
 I've  used  similar  tricks  but  now  in  a 
 good  way  from  what  you're  seeing  right
[02:35] now  years  later  I've  used  psychology  to 
 say  more  than  relevant  to  be  in  the
[02:40] minds  of  thousands  of  men  around  the 
 world  there  are  thousands  of  guys  who 
 are  seemingly  obsessed  with  and  that  has
[02:46] led  them  to  change  their  lives  or 
 perhaps  changing  their  lives  has  made 
 them  obsessed  with  me  it's  the  same 
 psychology  either  way  I've  just  used  it
[02:51] differently  in  a  positive  way  now  you 
 want  to  make  people  obsessed  with  you 
 this  is  exactly  what  you  do  you  get  them
[02:57] to  emotionally  invest  into  you  emotional 
 investment  simply  just  means  the  time
[03:02] energy  and  effort  someone  spends 
 thinking  about  you  and  how  much  of  their 
 emotions  is  influenced  in  any  way  by  you
[03:09] if  you  are  let's  say  a  stoic  guy  who's 
 focused  on  your  purpose  and  you  have 
 like  a  girl  you're  probably  not  that
[03:14] emotionally  invested  into  her  because 
 you  don't  spend  all  day  thinking  about 
 it  but  if  you're  more  of  like  a  feminine 
 guy  a  younger  guy  you're  less  successful
[03:19] you're  more  of  like  a  normal  guy  you're 
 probably  quite  heavily  emotionally 
 invested  in  not  just  your  girlfriend  but 
 maybe  even  just  a  like  a  girl  that
[03:25] you've  got  a  crush  on  you  so  emotionally 
 thinking  about  her  all  the  time  you  know 
 you're  so  excited  when  she  sends  you  a 
 text  message  flip  this  around  and  the
[03:31] more  that  someone  else  thinks  about  you 
 cares  about  you  feels  things  because  of 
 you  the  more  that  they  are  obsessed  with
[03:36] you  and  there's  five  tricks  five  things 
 we  can  do  to  spike  how  much  they  are
[03:41] emotionally  invested  into  you  Number  One 
 Polarized  polarized  means  to  push  people 
 to  the  extreme  dreams  of  loving  you  or
[03:46] hating  you  too  many  guys  are  so  soft  and 
 so  weak  that  they'll  keep  people  near 
 the  middle  that  they  don't  want  to
[03:51] offend  anyone  the  only  way  that  you'll 
 find  who  is  real  the  only  way  that 
 you'll  find  people  who  really  [ __ ]  with
[03:56] you  is  by  pushing  people  to  the  extremes 
 and  like  really  showing  almost  quite 
 extreme  versions  of  your  personality  and
[04:02] your  viewpoints  because  when  you  show 
 those  like  extreme  viewpoints  that  you 
 have  that's  when  anyone  else  who's
[04:07] similar  to  that  will  be  like  oh  wow  I 
 love  that  guy  I  love  his  takes  or  some 
 people  will  say  wait  I  hate  him  either
[04:13] way  whether  they  love  you  or  hate  you 
 they're  obsessed  with  you  the  second 
 psychological  trick  that  you  can  use  to
[04:18] make  people  obsessed  with  you  is  to  be 
 relatable  and  you  can  see  that  so 
 clearly  with  this  channel  if  you  are
[04:23] relatable  if  you  are  just  like  that 
 person  they'll  think  about  you  more 
 because  they're  able  to  like  put
[04:28] themselves  in  your  shoes  and  if  you're 
 able  to  be  relatable  but  slightly  ahead 
 of  them  especially  in  the  things  that
[04:34] matter  they'll  be  so  like  you  know 
 emotional  they'll  be  thinking  like  well 
 like  that  guy's  so  similar  to  me  but 
 he's  done  something  different  for
[04:40] example  let's  use  me  when  I'm  10  years 
 old  and  I'm  a  little  brown  kid  right 
 specifically  Brown  okay  and  I  see  some
[04:46] millionaire  walk  past  and  the 
 Millionaire's  an  old  white  guy  oh  wow 
 that's  really  interesting  he's  a  million 
 oh  imagine  if  I  then  see  a  millionaire
[04:52] who's  a  brown  guy  who's  only  slightly 
 older  than  me  maybe  he's  like  20  years 
 old  which  one  am  I  able  to  relate  to
[04:57] more  well  of  course  the  younger  Brown 
 guy  he's  going  to  be  in  my  mind  a  lot 
 more  than  [ __ ]  Colonel  Sanders  if
[05:03] he's  in  my  mind  more  than  I'm  more 
 obsessed  with  him  I'll  be  going  home 
 thinking  he  seems  similar  to  me  how  did 
 he  make  so  much  money  the  third  thing
[05:08] you  can  do  to  get  people  obsessed  with 
 you  is  to  get  them  to  open  up  and  this 
 is  perhaps  like  the  one  that  I  use  quite
[05:14] like  negatively  and  maybe  manipulate  I 
 didn't  I  mean  I  don't  know  for  just 
 obviously  a  few  years  ago  back  in  the 
 [ __ ]  boy  days  like  it's  you  know  girls
[05:20] are  in  love  with  me  she's  next  to  me 
 sleeping  and  stuff  and  you  know 
 obviously  being  sexual  and  stuff  it 
 opens  up  and  so  if  she's  gonna  open  up
[05:26] emotionally  to  me  more  and  tell  me  like 
 you  know  deeper  things  or  experience 
 deeper  emotions  with  me  and  of  course
[05:32] she's  going  to  be  more  obsessed  with  me 
 and  again  this  is  what  I've  been  able  to 
 do  in  a  more  positive  way  with  what  I'm 
 doing  now  because  the  nature  of  the  work
[05:38] that  we  do  here  talking  about 
 self-improvement  the  deep  [ __ ]  that 
 we've  been  through  usually  when  I'm 
 speaking  to  my  boys  who  follow  me  you'll
[05:43] end  up  opening  up  and  telling  me  some 
 stuff  and  when  you  open  up  to  someone 
 you  start  thinking  about  them  more  you
[05:48] start  obsessing  over  them  all  because 
 you've  kind  of  shared  a  piece  of  your 
 experiences  feelings  and  maybe  traumas
[05:54] the  four  psychological  trick  that  you 
 can  use  to  get  people  obsessed  with  you 
 and  perhaps  my  favorite  which  is  ah  I
[06:00] feel  like  a  bad  person  talking  about  my 
 [ __ ]  buddies  but  it's  like  it's  a  part 
 of  me  um you  know  I'm  grateful  for
[06:05] everything  expressed  the  fourth  thing 
 you  can  do  is  create  an  enemy  we  have  an
[06:10] enemy  don't  we  and  you  know  some  people 
 think  it's  Jeffrey  not  really  Jeffrey's 
 like  the  younger  version  of  us  who's 
 just  not  really  on  self-improvement  but
[06:16] he's  not  like  a  bad  person  the  enemy  is 
 the  modern  addictions  the  modern  sort  of 
 system  that  has  bred  us  and  conditioned
[06:21] us  to  be  weak  it's  the  social  media 
 companies  the  porn  companies  only  fans 
 that  is  the  enemy  if  you  create  an  enemy
[06:27] for  yourself  and  the  person  that  you 
 want  to  obsess  over  you  it  will  create 
 the  psychological  term  what's  called  in
[06:32] group  and  out  group  people  will  identify 
 with  you  and  want  to  be  on  your  side 
 it's  like  you're  fighting  a  war  and  that
[06:38] is  so  Primal  so  animalistic  that  people 
 will  just  automatically  think  about  you 
 and  our  side  more  which  is  emotional
[06:44] Investments  I  I  use  this  in  a  quite 
 negative  way  to  be  honest  I  never 
 started  doing  this  purposefully  when  I
[06:49] was  like  a  [ __ ]  boy  you  know  creating  an 
 enemy  meant  that  there  was  like  two 
 girls  who  were  arguing  with  each  other  I 
 didn't  do  that  like  on  purpose  thinking
[06:54] oh  yeah  if  I  create  an  enemy  a  little 
 it'll  be  psychological  trivia  it  was 
 just  more  that  like  I  was  [ __ ]  two 
 girls  and  like
[06:59] I  didn't  really  do  it  on  purpose  but  it 
 ended  up  achieving  what  I  wanted  at  the
[07:04] time  and  now  it's  very  clear  that  I'm 
 doing  it  purposefully  I  have  created  an 
 enemy  for  us  because  it's  causing  us  to
[07:10] rise  up  and  actually  take  this  so  much 
 more  seriously  and  the  fifth  thing 
 you're  really  gonna  like  this  one  the 
 fifth  thing  that  you  can  do  to  make
[07:15] people  obsessed  with  you  stay  mysterious 
 a  lot  of  guys  don't  have  the  confidence 
 for  this  and  they'll  spill  everything
[07:21] about  them  straight  away  and  so  once  the 
 mystery  is  gone  it's  kind  of  like  yeah 
 well  I  don't  need  to  think  about  you
[07:26] anymore  do  I  so  when  you  meet  a  new  girl 
 for  example  are  you  the  kind  of  guy  who 
 just  opens  up  and  just  talks  and  talks
[07:31] and  talks  and  talks  or  do  you  maintain 
 like  almost  a  level  of  mystery  because 
 if  you  keep  some  mystery  if  you  don't
[07:36] reveal  everything  about  you  it  will  make 
 the  other  person  think  about  you  more 
 not  less  more  because  there's  more  that
[07:42] they  want  to  piece  together  they  want  to 
 like  solve  you  they  want  to  like  figure 
 you  out  if  you  tell  someone  everything
[07:47] there  is  about  you  which  most  guys  they 
 are  my  favorite  color  my  favorite  type 
 of  music  what's  your  favorite  type  of
[07:52] music  yeah  I  play  video  game 
 today  but  today  I  did
[07:57] until  3  P.M  and  then  I  most  guys  aren't 
 mysterious  at  all  so  it's  obvious  that 
 like  most  girls  aren't  going  to  be 
 obsessed  with  that  guy  the  girls  are
[08:02] obsessed  with  the  guy  who  stays 
 mysterious  maybe  you're  watching  this 
 right  now  thinking  wait  this  is 
 controversial  as  [ __ ]  I  don't  want  to  be
[08:07] a  bad  person  you  can  use  these 
 psychological  tricks  for  good  psychology 
 is  not  inherently  a  bad  thing  it  can  be
[08:13] used  negatively  and  I  hold  my  hand  up  I 
 hold  like  responsibility  for  this  and 
 say  yes  I  use  it  in  a  negative  way  but
[08:19] it  can  also  be  used  positively  and  again 
 I  hold  my  hand  up  and  say  yes  I  take 
 responsibility  I  have  used  it  in  this
[08:25] way  it  sounds  kind  of  bad  to  learn  and 
 to  utilize  you  know  tricks  to  use  on 
 people  but  I  think  it's  better  to  learn
[08:31] this  stuff  and  use  it  in  a  good  way  than 
 it  is  to  just  like  blindly  navigate  in 
 the  dark  we  are  in  a  new  age  of  business
[08:37] and  success  and  we're  in  the  age  where 
 the  new  currency  is  attention  if  you  can 
 make  people  obsessed  with  you  you  can
[08:42] become  extremely  wealthy  extremely 
 successful  and  you  can  make  huge
[08:47] movements  so  you  can  use  these 
 psychological  tricks  that  will  make 
 people  obsess  with  you  for  good  do  the
[08:52] hard  work  especially  when  you  don't  feel 
 like  it  mwah
"
ivn4fOi4o7o,"[00:00] you've  been  making  really  good  progress 
 on  your  nofap
[00:05] but  your  jeffree  friend  keeps  making  fun 
 of  you 
 adonis
[00:10] however  congratulates  you  on  your 
 progress  towards  the  golden  point  of
[00:15] nofap  it's  not  as  easy  as  it  seems  not 
 at  all  yeah  so  now  you  know  why  i
[00:20] started  so  much  and  you  always  make  fun 
 of  me  i'm  still  going  to  piss  look  this 
 isn't  my  job
[00:25] this  is  all  you  have  to  do  bro 
 what  was  your  selfie  was  like  when  you 
 used  to  jack  off
[00:31] jesus 
 so  when  i  was  jacking  off  there  was  a
[00:36] massive  combination  of  geoffrey 
 activities  that  i  would  participate  in
[00:41] mainly  you  know  video  games  not  leaving 
 the  house  wasting  a  disgusting  amount  of
[00:48] time  on  [ __ ]  that  didn't  matter 
 generally  my  self-image  was  incredibly
[00:53] low  i  was  doing  that  since  the  age  of 
 like  15  to  about  21  to  22  years  old  with
[01:01] no  awareness  of  improvements  that  could 
 be  made  and  i've  only  just  recently
[01:06] started  to  actually  improve  that  mental 
 self-image  of  myself  because  it  was  so
[01:11] deeply  ingrained  in  me  that  i  was  this 
 weird  pale  bad  posture  addicted  to  video
[01:18] games  zero  social  skills  sort  of  this 
 weird  fellow 
 so  it's  taken  me  a  really  long  time  to
[01:24] actually  sort  of  break  out  that  still 
 very  much  so  a  work  in  progress  so  yeah 
 no  my  self  image  was  horrible  i  can
[01:30] relate  to  what  you're  saying  about  it 
 mixing  with  the  other  jeffrey  activities 
 because  like  you  don't  fap  in  a  vacuum
[01:36] by  itself  usually  if  you're  a  guy  who 
 faps  you  watch  porn  you  also  do  a  bunch 
 of  other  things  and  i'd  say  the  most
[01:41] common  one  is  staying  up  late  having  a 
 [ __ ]  up  nighttime  routine  morning 
 routine  for  me  i  never  used  to  stay  up
[01:46] actually  no  i  did  i  remember  like  i  just 
 got  a  flash  of  like  feeling  sweaty  as 
 [ __ ]  underneath  the  covers  just  like
[01:51] going  for  round  three  literally  waking 
 up  with  like  a  raw  dick  and  then  [ __ ] 
 my  bed  sheets  and  then  she's  just  like
[01:57] busting  all  over  [ __ ]  sake 
 i  bro  i  did  that  a  lot  i  remember 
 there's  multiple  times  i'd  wake  up  and
[02:03] literally  go  three  rounds  without 
 getting  out  of  bed  you  don't  realize  a 
 bit  much  of  a  problem  that  is  how
[02:09] just  practically  it  loses  a lot  of  time 
 i've  always  said  personally  because  as  a 
 guy  who  values  my  time  a  lot  i've  said
[02:15] one  of  the  worst  things  of  fapping  so 
 much  is  that  you  lose  time  but  i'm 
 realizing  today  with  the  title  of  this
[02:20] video  that  probably  the  worst 
 consequence  of  fapping  and  watching  porn
[02:25] is  what  it  does  to  your  self-image  and 
 probably  the  best  benefit  of  nofap  which 
 so  many  people  don't  really  talk  about
[02:30] because  a  lot  of  people  talk  about  these 
 shallow  improvements  which  is  like  oh 
 well  you  know  women  will  hold  eye 
 contact  with  you  and  all  this  but  it's
[02:35] the  self-image  it's  what  you  think  about 
 yourself  because  what  do  you  think  about 
 yourself  when  you  kind  of  deep  down  know
[02:41] you're  the  this  is  gonna  sound  crazy 
 like  you're  the  beta  male  who  has  to 
 [ __ ]  his  own  hand  instead  of  like  having
[02:46] a  woman  around  to  do  it  what  does  that 
 say  about  yourself  and  like  what 
 thoughts  attitudes  and  beliefs  will  you
[02:52] have  about  yourself  because  i've  said 
 previously  that  the  most  important  part 
 of  self-improvement  if  you  want  to
[02:57] improve  your  life  if  you  want  to  make 
 progress  the  most  important  part  is  like 
 those  internal  psychological  things  and
[03:03] i  know  this  seems  like  really 
 wishy-washy  but  i  promise  you  the  most 
 effective  way  of  improving  yourself  is
[03:08] all  mental  it's  all  about  how  you  see 
 yourself  and  you  see  yourself  as  a 
 [ __ ]  loser  when  you're  jacking  off 
 that's  why  when  you  get  onto  nofap  if
[03:14] you  do  nofap  the  right  way  which  i'll 
 briefly  explain  but  like  most  people 
 actually  like  with  all  the  videos  you've
[03:19] watched  on  nofap  they're  all  trash  most 
 videos  most  creators  online  who  talk 
 about  nofap  they  do  worse  for  you  than
[03:25] actually  help  you  because  they  make  you 
 obsess  over  it  and  then  your  self-image 
 instead  of  it  becoming  a  guy  who  checks
[03:31] off  it  becomes  that  of  a  guy  who  can't 
 stop  jacking  off  so  it's  as  bad  if  not
[03:36] even  worse  most  people  actually  worse  on 
 no  fap  than  they  are  like  just  jacking 
 off  normally  the  quick  way  just  i  don't
[03:42] want to  waste  your  time  so  the  quick  way 
 to  do  norfolk  properly  is  to  essentially 
 not  really  care  that  much  about  it  or
[03:48] not  even  keep  it  much  in  your  mind  and 
 when  you  do  relapse  which  is  absolutely
[03:53] normal  if  you  don't  beat  yourself  up  if 
 you  have  a  goal  in  mind  for  nofap  like
[03:58] you  want  to  get  to  x  days  you  want  to 
 get  to  90  days  or  30  days  or  three  days 
 or  nine  days  you're  doing  it  the  wrong
[04:03] way  and  i  really  i  know  that  you'll  want 
 to  keep  the  same  goal  but  i  really 
 really  if  you  could  just  take  any  advice
[04:08] from  me  abandon  all  goals  with  nofap  and 
 just  make  it  your  intention  to  jack  off
[04:13] less  with  this  mindset  that  you've  been 
 building  this  habit  of  jacking  off 
 watching  porn  for  years  since  you  were
[04:18] like  13.  and  so  it's  going  to  take 
 months  if  not  years  to  get  to  the  golden 
 point  of  nofap  which  is  where  you  just
[04:24] literally  it's  not  even  that  you  just 
 don't  jack  off  you  know  you  get  those 
 urges  and  stuff  it's  weird  like  you 
 don't  even  get  the  urge  to  jack  off  like
[04:30] you  still  get  horny  i  get  horny  as  [ __ ] 
 all  the  time  i've  really  i've  increased 
 my  testosterone
[04:35] it  does 
 and  it's  like  it's  disassociated  from 
 wanking  does  that  make  sense  it's  like 
 when  you're  a  normal  like  loser  guy  when
[04:41] you  get  an  urge  you  automatically  relate 
 horniness  to  watching  pawn  and  jacking
[04:47] off  the  best  part  of  nofap  is  to  get  to 
 the  point  where  like  fapping  isn't  even 
 in  your  mind  at  all  and  you  get  that  by
[04:53] not  obsessing  over  it  and  having  that 
 sort  of  like  loose  mind  where  you're 
 just  like  yep  since  i've  been  leveling 
 up  the  fapping  skill  for  [ __ ]  five
[04:59] ten  years  it's  gonna  take  me  like  two  to 
 five  years  to  get  to  the  point  where  i'm 
 not  jacking  off  at  all  anymore  have  that
[05:04] like  sort  of  like  stress-free  mindset  i 
 started  nofap  at  age  17  and  i  struggled
[05:09] every  the  exact  same  thing  of  like  day 
 two  i'd  relapse  and  then  you  know  i'm 
 trying  to  go  for  day  ten  and  then  day 
 three  i'd  relapse  then  then  i'd  jack  off
[05:15] four  times  in  one  day  because  you  know 
 i'm  already  on  day  zero  you  get  worse 
 when  you  count  the  days  you  shouldn't
[05:20] count  the  days  you  should  literally  just 
 have  like  the  overlying  intention  in 
 your  mind  for  this  next  few  years  of
[05:25] just  like  nope  i'm  not  a  fapper  anymore 
 and  really  that's  that's  what  we  should 
 talk  about  is  the  correct  self  image  and
[05:30] look  i  could  give  you  the  [ __ ]  click 
 bait  advice  that  you  want  we  could  be 
 sat  here  right  now  to  get  a  better  video
[05:35] to  perform  well  on  youtube  we  could  tell 
 you  the  exact  same  thing  that  all  these 
 other  [ __ ]  youtubers  do  which  is  like 
 oh  the  nofaps  benefit  timeline  i  know
[05:41] i'm  on  i'm  on  day  1000  and  this  is  the 
 benefits  of  day  night  shut  the  [ __ ]  up 
 anyone  get  more  testosterone  anyone
[05:47] who's  made  a  video  like  that  i  promise 
 you  right  now  that  they  are  [ __ ] 
 trash  i  promise  you  right  now  that  your
[05:52] mental  health  has  gotten  worse  by 
 watching  videos  like  oh  but  at  day  seven 
 i'll  i'll  get  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  shut  the
[05:58] [ __ ]  up  do  you  know  how  heartless  this 
 advice  is  i  said  this  to  chris 
 williamson  he  does  the  modern  wisdom
[06:03] podcast  so  i  was  a  guest  on  there  and  i 
 said  i  said  it  to  him  really  opened  my 
 eyes  imagine  telling  an  obese  guy  who's
[06:08] addicted  to  junk  food  imagine  telling 
 him  of  all  of  the  life-changing  benefits
[06:13] he  will  get  from  going  to  the  gym  hyping 
 him  up  for  it  and  then  telling  him  that 
 if  he  misses  one  day  all  of  those
[06:18] benefits  will  disappear 
 how  [ __ ]  heartless  is  that  that  these 
 youtubers  tell  you  this  [ __ ]  it  doesn't
[06:23] work  on  a  [ __ ]  streak  your  body 
 doesn't  think  like  oh  he's  on  day  90 
 guys  pumping  full  of  tests  oh  no  oh  no
[06:29] he  fapped  once  like  oh  back  to  days  your 
 body  isn't  thinking  that  about  yourself 
 it's  more  how  many  times  have  you  jacked
[06:35] off  in  the  last  three  to  six  months 
 decrease  that  number  by  saying  right  now 
 okay  oh  day  90  okay  i'm  gonna  go  for  day
[06:42] 90.  it  shows  that  you've  got  this  like 
 [ __ ]  up  perception  of  like  success  and 
 if  you  can  relate  to  the  other  [ __ ]  i'm
[06:47] saying  which  is  like  oh  you  go  for  day 
 90  go  for  streaks  i  guarantee  correct  me 
 from  wrong  i  don't  know  this  is  going  to
[06:52] sound  like  an  insult  i  guarantee  you 
 have  less  than  2  000  pounds  in  your  bank 
 account  guarantee  you're  broke  i 
 guarantee  you're  unsuccessful  and  i  know
[06:58] that  hurts  but  the  reason  why  nofap  and 
 success  is  linked  together  is  because 
 when  you  actually  don't  jack  off  as  much
[07:03] you  kind  of  understand  the  process 
 behind  it  which  is  to  like  stop  thinking 
 about  these  stupid  details  i'm  like  oh
[07:09] let  me  do  nine  days  in  a  row  let  me  do 
 this  you  look  at  it  this  overlying 
 mindset  which  is  just  like  yep  i'm  no
[07:15] longer  fap  you  start  taking  control  of 
 your  [ __ ]  self-image  and  that's  how 
 you  reach  any  level  of  success  with  any
[07:20] goal  yeah  so  hamza  mentions  obsessing 
 over  nofap  the  easiest  way  to  stop
[07:25] obsessing  over  nofap  is  to  get  [ __ ] 
 busy  guys  start  thinking  about  things
[07:30] which  will  actually  have  a  much  higher 
 roi  such  as  the  four  pillars  of
[07:35] self-improvement  which  are  reading 
 exercise  gratitude 
 meditation  and  meditation
[07:42] those  things  obsessing  over  those  things 
 are  going  to  give  you  an  incredibly  high 
 return  on  investment  and  it's  also  not
[07:48] coming  with  this  weird  defeatist  binary 
 thinking  of  like  oh  if  i  don't  meditate
[07:53] for  one  day  then  all  of  my  progress  on 
 meditation  is  just  demolished  destroyed
[07:59] it's  worthless  i  have  to  meditate  every 
 single  day  for  the rest  of my  life 
 otherwise  i  will  go  back  to  this
[08:04] horrible  state  of  no  mental  clarity  it 
 doesn't  work  like  that  that  mindset  that
[08:09] binary  thinking  isn't  going  to  get  you 
 anywhere  apart  from  feeling 
 very  depressed  and  miserable  and  have  a
[08:15] very  low  self-esteem  because  the  fact  is 
 you're  jacking  off  ten  times  a  week  for
[08:20] example  okay  if  you  manage  to  jack  off 
 eight  times  a  week  instead  that  is 
 progress  but  these  like  no  fap  streak
[08:27] andes  are  going  to  like  sort  of  implant 
 this  thought  in  your  brain  of  just  like 
 if  you  jack  off  even  once  then  all  of
[08:33] your  progress  is  just  demolished  and  it 
 is  absolutely  ridiculous  it  doesn't  work
[08:38] like  that  it's  just  very 
 marketable  to  young  people  who  want  the
[08:43] fix  all  answer  just  like  if  you  don't 
 touch  your  dick  for  x  amount  of  time  you 
 will  be  gigger  chad  you  will  be  adonis
[08:48] it  doesn't  work  like  that  guys  the 
 reality  is  these  things  take  a  lot  of
[08:53] work  and  a  lot  of  discipline  in  many 
 different  areas  of  self-development 
 there  is  no  if  you  don't  touch  your  dick
[08:59] for  x  amount  of  days  you  will  become 
 adonis  it  doesn't  work  like  that  guys 
 it's  just  marketable  and  these  youtubers
[09:05] are  selling  you  [ __ ]  complete 
 [ __ ]  yeah  100  on  nofap  and  also  just
[09:10] living  the  normal  life  of  jacking  off 
 your  self-image  is  going  to  be  decreased
[09:15] and  that's  completely  unacceptable  it's 
 one  of  the  worst  things  that  can  ever 
 happen  to  you  what  you  need  to  do  is  get 
 on  to  the  part  of  know  like  the  kind  of
[09:22] nofap  which  increases  your  self-image  so 
 i  want  to  take  you  almost  through  like  a 
 visualization  like  a  practice  like  an
[09:27] affirmation  exercise  right  now  maybe 
 just  close  your  eyes  just  see  yourself 
 and  do  no  longer  see  yourself  as  the  guy
[09:34] who  jacks  off  no  longer  even  see 
 yourself  as  the  guy  who's  on  nofap
[09:41] just  see  yourself  as  the  guy  who  simply 
 doesn't  fap  does  that  make  sense  you 
 need  to  start  like  this  is  the  best
[09:47] advice  i  could  give  you  for  nofap  and 
 trust  me  when  i  say  like  i'm  a  youtuber 
 and  i  could  make  so  many  videos  about
[09:52] getting  so  many  views  and  like  these 
 videos  get  a  [ __ ]  lot  of  views  when 
 you  make  a  video  on  nofap  that's  why  all
[09:57] these  [ __ ]  dumbass  creators  make  them 
 and  they  make  videos  that  [ __ ]  up  your 
 mental  health  and  you  know  which  ones 
 i'm  talking  about  even  though  they're
[10:02] like  they're  like  to  my  community  and 
 [ __ ]  and  they  don't  know  what  the  [ __ ] 
 they're  talking  about  but  what  you  need
[10:07] to  do  is  to  start  seeing  yourself  not  as 
 the  man  who  is  on  nofap  but  as  the  guy
[10:12] who  simply  doesn't  jack  off  i'm  not  on 
 nofap  i've  checked  off  maybe  once  in 
 like  [ __ ]  three  years  i'm  not  on
[10:18] nofap  i  just  don't  jack  off  there's  a 
 difference  because  when  you're  on  nofap 
 you're  a  [ __ ]  loser  this  is  like  the
[10:23] difference  between  a  guy  saying  to  you 
 oh  i'm  trying  to  quit  alcohol  you're  a 
 little  [ __ ]  visualize  your  standard
[10:29] sort  of  person  just  like  a  really 
 standard  dude  right  and  then  go  up  to
[10:34] him  and  say  like  oh  yeah  i'm  actually  on 
 nofap  guys  i'm  on  day  x  or  y  and  then 
 visualize  the  sort  of  response  that
[10:40] would  elicit  you  would  look  like  a 
 [ __ ]  weirdo  and  the  truth  is  it's 
 pretty  [ __ ]  weird  guys  to  obsess  over
[10:46] not  touching  your  dick  it's  not  a  good 
 luck  it's  just  strange  nah  i  disagree 
 because  although  that's  true  we
[10:52] shouldn't  be  basing  the  things  we  do 
 based  on  like  how  normal  people  would 
 react  because  a  lot  of  the  [ __ ]  we  do
[10:57] would  be  perceived  as  strange  anyway 
 that  is  trim  yeah  i'd  say  more  it's  how 
 you  perceive  it  and  how  it  affects  your
[11:03] own  psychology  so  as  i  was  saying  it's 
 before  sam  [ __ ]  brutally  interrupted
[11:09] what  you  need  to  do  is  see  yourself  as 
 the  guy  who  simply  just  doesn't  jack  off 
 and  watch  porn  anymore  you're  not  on
[11:14] nofap  you're  not  trying  not  to  you  just 
 simply  don't  see  yourself  as  that  guy 
 write  down  yep  i  don't  watch  porn  i
[11:20] don't  jack  off  it's  just  not  something  i 
 do  i  feel  horniness  i  feel  like  the  urge 
 is  the  desire  for  sex  and  intimacy  and  i
[11:26] feel  those  urges  they  are  disassociated 
 away  from  [ __ ]  wanking  my  meat  like  a
[11:31] monkey 
 it's  the  difference  between  a  guy  coming
[11:36] up  to  you  and  saying  oh  well  i'm  trying 
 to  quit  drinking  that's  the  guy  on  nofap 
 compared  to  the  guy  who  just  says  i
[11:42] don't  drink  which  one  of  those  is 
 definitely  not  going  to  drink  in  this 
 party  well  the  guy  who  said  i  don't
[11:47] drink  because  the  guy  who  says  well  i'm 
 trying  not  to  drink  everyone's  going  to 
 be  oh  god  yeah  get  it  down  your  son  and
[11:52] it's  the  same  for  you  if  you're  saying 
 oh  well  i'm  on  don't  no  fap  day  63  the 
 thing  is  right  i  have  full  confidence
[11:57] that  you  are  going  to  fail  you  tell  me 
 you're  on  nofap  i  have  full  confidence 
 you're  going  to  fap  again  you  tell  me 
 you're  on  day  x  i  have  full  confidence
[12:03] that  you're  going  to  relapse  you  tell  me 
 you  don't  watch  porn  and  that  you  don't 
 masturbate  you  probably  won't  for  the
[12:09] next  year  multiple  years  you  need  to 
 have  this  self-image  of  the  upgraded 
 version  of  yourself  in  your  mind  at  all
[12:15] times  because  too  many  young  men  are 
 living  with  this  pathetic  self-image  of 
 like  uh  oh  fapping  is  a  problem  for  me
[12:20] and  i'm  really  trying  to  prove  it  like 
 why  the  [ __ ]  would  you  like  would  you 
 place  limitations  on  your  own  self 
 belief  about  yourself  i  hope  this  is
[12:25] like  making  sense  it  might  not  do 
 because  if  i  was  watching  this  when  i 
 was  17  years  old  and  and  ohanka  i
[12:31] wouldn't  have  understood  it  personally  i 
 would  have  thought  okay  this  is  wishy 
 washy  just  tell  me  which  which  pawn 
 blocker  to  download  onto  my  phone  or
[12:37] some  [ __ ]  you  want  the  easy  answer  and 
 you  want  these  like  clickbait  videos  of 
 these  dumbass  youtubers  talking  about  90
[12:42] day  benefits  timeline  i  [ __ ]  hate 
 them  so  much  bro  there's  one  kind  of 
 youtuber  i  hate  the  most  it's  the  nofap
[12:47] ones  day  1000  updates  [ __ ]  you  uh  the 
 better  [ __ ]  you  they  don't  realize  what
[12:52] they're  doing  to  your  mind  and  and  you 
 watching  this  right  now  you  are 
 suffering  from  this  [ __ ]  that  these  guys
[12:57] have  done  to  you  by  by  putting  you  on  to 
 like  this  sort  of  like  fixated  of  this 
 obsessive  belief  about  getting  to  day
[13:03] 90.  i'm  telling  you  right  now  that  guy 
 that  you're  looking  up  to  the  [ __ ] 
 chad  that  you're  thinking  oh  you  know  i 
 want  to  be  more  like  him  i'm  telling  you
[13:08] right  now  he's  not  on  [ __ ]  day  90. 
 you  need  to  take  this  like  this  weird 
 obsession  away  from  streaks  from  nofap
[13:15] from  semen  retention  and  just  live  your 
 life  as  if  you're  a  guy  who's  just 
 totally  ingrained  it  that  is  how  you  get
[13:20] to  the  best  part  of  nofap  that  is  how 
 you  improve  your  self-image  it's 
 important  to  say  this  but  at  the  same
[13:25] time  we  do  need  to  also  speak  about  the 
 self-image  you  have  when  you're  just  a 
 normal  guy  and  you're  watching  porn  and 
 like  you  feel  okay  with  that  it's  like
[13:31] it  does  seem  cringe  to  talk  about  like 
 alpha  male  and  beta  male  but  if  there's 
 any  action  of  the  alpha  and  any  action
[13:37] which  symbolizes  the  beta  it  is  that  the 
 alpha  is  the  one  sleeping  like  having 
 sex  and  the  beta  is  the  one  masturbating
[13:44] you  can  say  it's  hard  to  cringe  to  talk 
 about  this  but  it  is  the  truth  if  you 
 really  thought  about  it  right  now  what 
 is  like  the  one  action  that  symbolizes
[13:50] an  alpha  male  it  is  having  sex  with  the 
 woman  or  you  know  the  female  primates  or 
 some  [ __ ]  in  like  some  some  animal
[13:56] kingdom  and  the  baiters  jack  off  it's 
 not  good  for  your  mental  health  for  your 
 self-image  to  say  like  oh  well  you  know
[14:02] it's  okay  to  like  just  wank  every  now 
 and  then  you  can  live  life  not  jacking 
 off  a  lot  of  guys  don't  actually
[14:07] understand  this  and  it  really  comes  from 
 like  a  long-term  disassociation  from  the 
 horniness  that  arises  as  you're  a  normal
[14:14] man  and  disassociating  detaching  that 
 from  the  desire  to  jack  off  does  that
[14:19] make  sense  so  most  guys  get  that  feeling 
 that  okay  i'm  horny  my  dick  is  hard  and 
 they  automatically  think  that  means  that
[14:24] they  have  to  jack  off  you  need  to  detach 
 that  relationship  so  again  i  get  horny
[14:29] all  the  time  my  dick  gets  hard  all  the 
 time  but  i  just  don't  really  do  anything 
 with  it  maybe  i'll  go  have  sex  with  a
[14:34] woman  when  i'm  not  gonna  have  sex  it's 
 like  it's  there  and  i'm  just  kind  of 
 enjoying  the  thing  of  like  yup  like  my 
 dick's  hard  and  i'm  honey  boom  it
[14:39] doesn't  mean  oh  i'm  horny  so  i  should  go 
 jack  off  you  need  to  detach  that  and 
 you've  got  this  like  it's  a  habit  you've
[14:44] got  you've  built  this  habit  for  for  what 
 years  the  average  guy  starts  checking 
 off  like  13  years  old  yeah  i  was  gonna
[14:50] ask  you  hamsa  why  were  we  told  that 
 jacking  off  is  like  normal  and  okay  and 
 it's  somewhat  like  weirdly  encouraged  to
[14:57] like  you  know  oh  it's  not  it's  healthy 
 like  why  why  was  that  it's  the  same  as
[15:02] like  every  week  jeffrey  activity  being 
 encouraged  to  young  men  these  days  maybe 
 the  conspiracy  theories  like  the  society
[15:08] wants  like  weaker  men  that  can't  create 
 like  a  revolution  or  quite  frankly  it's 
 just  like  the  weaker  all  the  people  who
[15:14] just  are  coping  so  hard  that  they  want 
 other  men  other  people  to  follow  in 
 their  footsteps  literally  crabs  yeah
[15:19] [ __ ]  crabs  yeah  most  most  people 
 especially  older  like  40  40  year  old 
 people  their  ignorance  and  their  crabs
[15:25] this  is  no  disrespect  to  some  like 
 successful  like  educated  40  year  old  but 
 the  truth  is  you  want  to  know  the
[15:30] [ __ ]  raw  truth  your  teachers  are 
 unsuccessful  broke  and  uneducated  your 
 parents  are  probably  unsuccessful  broke
[15:36] and  uneducated  it's  the  [ __ ]  truth 
 it's  a  hard  to  swallow  pill  but  when  you
[15:41] look  at  like  research  and  data  and  you 
 read  books  and  then  you  just  see  how 
 wrong  all  of  like  the  adults  were  when
[15:47] we  were  growing  up  and  they  told  us  like 
 all  this  like  this  [ __ ]  you  can't 
 take  advice  from  people  who  are  fine
[15:53] living  in  mediocrity  i  hope  this  helps 
 you  and  i  sincerely  hope  you  can  find 
 ways  to  improve  your  self-image  and
[15:59] detach  away  from  like  the  nofap  identity 
 that's  like  you  know  that's  part  of  your 
 your  self-image  because  you'll  do  so
[16:05] much  better  you'll  get  to  higher  streaks 
 if  you  don't  think  about  streets  do  the 
 hard  work  especially  when  you  don't  feel
[16:11] like  it's

mi26aXyUbuQ,"[00:00] finally  the  end  of  year  bonus  has 
 arrived  and  Jeffrey  is  Overjoyed  he  can 
 finally  afford  the  down  payment  on  the
[00:06] brand  new  Tesla  he's  gonna  show  people 
 how  successful  he  is  the  girls  are  gonna
[00:11] notice  him  now  on  the  other  hand  Adonis 
 was  sent  forth  into  the  World  by  his 
 father  to  fend  for  himself  he  would  have
[00:16] little  to  no  extra  cash  as  he  was 
 constantly  reinvested  into  his  business 
 The  Lads  around  him  would  have  the
[00:22] newest  laptops  and  fancy  cars  not  Adonis 
 Adonis  was  an  Empire  Builder  he  was  a
[00:27] young  lion  who  would  burn  with  passion 
 when  he  worked  on  his  mission  it  was 
 Adonis  that  the  women  always  noticed
[00:32] even  if  he  didn't  have  a  car  even  if  he 
 didn't  have  fancy  expensive  clothes  the 
 women  knew  Adonis  was  going  places  and
[00:38] they  wanted  to  come  along  for  the  ride 
 gather  around  little  bro  I'm  gonna  walk 
 you  through  six  reasons  why  girls  think
[00:43] that  you  are  quite  unattractive  the 
 first  reason  why  women  are  unattracted 
 to  you  is  because  you  are  broke  and  also
[00:50] unambitious  now  here  is  the  truth  that  a 
 lot  of  like  all  these  red  pill 
 successful  guys  won't  ever  tell  you  the 
 thing  is  you  can  still  get  a  lot  of
[00:56] girls  when  you're  broke  I'll  just  be 
 totally  honest  and  I  will  go  with  you 
 bro  I  [ __ ]  a  lot  of  women  when  I  was
[01:01] totally  broke  I'm  just  going  to  be 
 totally  honest  I  was  like  a  degenerate 
 [ __ ]  boy  and  stuff  and  I  was  broke  as 
 [ __ ]  as  well  I  was  like  I  was  just
[01:06] shooting  with  like  maybe  100  pounds  200 
 pounds  in  my  bank  account  bringing  these 
 women  up  to  my  shooting  Flats  you  can  be
[01:11] broke  honestly  you  can  be  broke  and 
 still  be  attracted  to  women  but  you  must 
 be  ambitious  at  the  same  time  now  being
[01:17] broke  and  unambitious  is  totally  and 
 utterly  [ __ ]  unattractive  and 
 repulsive  to  women  women  are  totally
[01:23] unattracted  to  the  guy  who's  broke  and 
 just  seems  okay  with  it  he's  just 
 playing  video  games  he's  just  smoking
[01:28] weed  although  he's  a  loser  but  the  broke 
 guy  who's  very  ambitious  he's  got  a  big 
 stream  to  for  example  build  a  business
[01:33] or  something  women  still  have  a  lot  of 
 Attraction  if  not  even  more  for  a  guy 
 like  that  because  that  seems  so  exciting 
 she  wants  to  see  your  burning  desire  for
[01:40] success  and  there's  a  way  that  we  can  do

[01:56] like  a  ten  thousand  dollar  giveaway  that 
 iman's  doing  as  well  go  to  that  top  Link 
 in  the  description  right  now  click  on  it
[02:01] and  sign  up  the  second  reason  why  girls 
 think  you're  unattractive  and  a  lot  of 
 like  guys  who  are  newer  to  dating  must
[02:06] understand  this  because  this  is 
 something  that  you're  not  really  taught 
 you're  not  mysterious  girls  are  very 
 very  much  attracted  to  guys  that  they
[02:12] don't  totally  know  even  through  marriage 
 let's  say  even  through  a  40-year 
 relationship  you  want  to  have  some
[02:17] elements  of  mystery  about  you  guys  who 
 aren't  good  with  girls  do  the  exact 
 opposite  of  this  they  destroy  all  their
[02:22] Mystery  by  telling  the  girl  up  front 
 like  to  a  face  of  all  of  the  boring 
 stuff  that  they  do  with  their  lives  she
[02:27] asks  like  oh  hey  like  did  you  have  a 
 good  day  what  did  you  do  today  and  the 
 boring  guy  who's  unattractive  to  girls
[02:32] will  answer  her  questions  seriously 
 because  he's  never  been  taught  this  by 
 like  an  older  brother  the  third  reason
[02:37] why  you  may  be  unattractive  to  girls  is 
 that  you're  not  very  present  now  this  is 
 something  that  a  lot  of  girls  don't
[02:42] actually  consciously  think  they  don't 
 think  the  words  in  their  mind  like  oh  he 
 doesn't  meditate  but  subconsciously  it
[02:48] becomes  very  hard  to  like  and  be 
 attracted  to  someone  who  isn't  present 
 now  what  do  I  mean  by  being  present
[02:54] being  present  is  kind  of  like  a  state 
 when  you  aren't  overthinking  about 
 something  now  the  shy  guy  who's  not  very
[03:00] great  with  girls  won't  be  present  when 
 he's  around  a  girl  he'll  be  overthinking 
 of  like  what  to  do  what  to  do  with  his
[03:05] hands  or  like  what  to  say  next  like  as 
 the  girl's  talking  to  him  he'll 
 literally  be  thinking  words  in  his  brain 
 of  like  what  to  say  next  and  that  he
[03:11] just  looks  like  a  little  bit  AFK  like 
 you  know  that  phrase  AFK  away  from 
 keyboard  people  who  aren't  present  look
[03:16] AFK  like  you  literally  see  them  like 
 zone  out  a  little  bit  and  you'll  just 
 see  them  like  their  eyes  will  just  be
[03:21] blank  and  then  they'll  like  say 
 something  because  you  can  see  they've 
 been  deep  in  thoughts  and  when  you're 
 overthinking  like  this  and  you're  not
[03:26] present  and  you're  speaking  to  a  girl 
 the  thing  is  she's  gonna  notice  because 
 she  will  ask  you  a  question  like  that
[03:32] question  we  just  said  like  she'll  ask 
 you  like  oh  you  know  what  did  you  do 
 today  and  because  you're  not  conscious 
 because  you're  not  present  your  brain's
[03:37] just  gonna  quickly  just  like  tell  the 
 truth  and  destroy  all  mystery  to  that 
 kind  of  question  the  fourth  reason  why
[03:42] girls  think  you're  unattractive  and  I'm 
 just  gonna  be  brutally  honest  it's 
 literally  you're  physical  attractiveness
[03:48] like  you're  not  actually  a  physically 
 attractive  guy  and  there's  many  reasons 
 for  this  I'd  say  the  number  one  reason
[03:53] that  you  have  control  over  is  your 
 physique  how  your  body  looks  are  you 
 muscular  are  you  in  shape  are  you  do  you
[03:59] have  a  low  body  fat  percentage  do  you 
 look  athletic  strong  or  sexy  you're 
 going  to  do  something  right  now  and  you 
 might  need  to  pause  the  video  go  in
[04:05] front  of  a  mirror  take  your  shirt  off 
 and  you  know  what  take  your  pants  off 
 literally  I  know  this  is  weird  as  [ __ ] 
 but  literally  just  go  get  naked  in  front
[04:10] of  like  your  bathroom  mirror  and  just 
 look  at  your  body  and  just  ask  yourself 
 this  question  is  this  the  kind  of  body
[04:15] that  women  lust  over  is  this  the  kind  of 
 body  that  women  write  like  erotica 
 novels  about  is  this  the  kind  of  body
[04:22] that  a  girl  may  want  a  screenshot  to 
 send  to  a  friend  in  a  good  way  that  like 
 oh  [ __ ]  look  at  look  how  how  hot  this
[04:28] guy  is  look  how  sexy  he  is  or  is  it  the 
 opposite  way  around  that  girl  would  like 
 screenshot  to  send  to  a  friend  like  oh 
 yeah  this  guy  looks  like  a  little  Trump
[04:33] like  look  oh  like  which  one  is  it  bro 
 now  you  might  be  very  young  and  you 
 don't  need  to  make  this  like  sexual  but
[04:38] just  ask  yourself  is  this  the  kind  of 
 body  that's  attractive  to  girls  because 
 honestly  if  100  of  guys  did  this  over  90
[04:43] of  them  would  have  to  answer  no  and  you 
 they  they  just  sink  their  heads  down
[04:49] towards  like  they're  weirdly  flabby 
 weirdly  skinny  bodies  just  feeling  kind
[04:54] of  sad  about  themselves  now  we  can  be 
 sat  here  and  be  really  sad  honestly  we 
 can  you  know  oh  like  life's  so  hard  you
[05:00] have  the  ability  to  mold  your  body  into 
 the  kind  of  physique  that  you  want  and 
 building  muscle  whilst  keeping  a  low
[05:06] body  fat  percentage  will  do  wonders  for 
 you  perhaps  the  core  reason  why  women
[05:11] think  you're  unattractive  is  just 
 because  you  don't  have  a  good  body  now 
 the  thing  is  your  face  is  different  it's
[05:16] a  lot  harder  to  change  your  face  there's 
 still  things  you  can  do  you  can  grow  a 
 beard  you  can  groom  you  can  like  you 
 know  improve  your  teeth  you  can  Mew  you
[05:22] can  all  you  can  still  do  these  things 
 but  they're  a  lot  like  less  impactful 
 than  literally  just  bulking  the  [ __ ]  up
[05:28] building  a  lot  of  muscle  and  then 
 cutting  down  so  you  have  that  muscle  but 
 now  you're  lean  again  it's  the  single 
 greatest  thing  you  can  do  to  become  more
[05:34] attractive  in  the  description  of  this 
 video  there's  a  link  titled  how  you  can 
 get  girls  you  might  be  interested  in
[05:39] that  the  fifth  reason  why  girls  think 
 you're  unattractive  now  this  is  kind  of 
 like  a  debated  reason  online  a  lot  of
[05:44] people  don't  really  agree  with  that  this 
 is  a  reason  so  I  might  be  wrong  here  but 
 it's  your  personality  now  a  lot  of  guys
[05:49] and  you  know  the  online  space  on  YouTube 
 on  like  red  pill  self-improved  all  this 
 stuff  there's  all  these  debates  of  like
[05:54] what's  the  most  important  is  it  looks  is 
 it  personality  is  it  game  status  money 
 the  thing  is  personality  seems  to  always
[06:01] be  overlooked  people  say  like  it's  not 
 really  important  as  long  as  you're 
 attractive  and  the  thing  is  you  can  be 
 an  [ __ ]  or  an  upstanding  citizen  of
[06:08] you  know  your  society  and  both  of  them 
 are  quite  nice  but  there  is  a  certain 
 kind  of  personality  that  is  inherently
[06:13] unattractive  to  girls  and  it's  not 
 really  spoken  about  online  can  you  guess 
 what  it  is  the  personality  of  a  weirdo
[06:18] the  personality  of  a  guy  who  just 
 doesn't  have  good  social  mannerisms  it's
[06:23] like  the  kind  of  guy  who  just  doesn't 
 get  like  what  is  somewhat  normal  you 
 probably  had  one  in  your  like  high
[06:28] school  or  something  you  know  like  did 
 you  have  like  a  guy  who  like  who  like 
 gallops  through  the  [ __ ]  hallways  or
[06:33] like  the  guy  who  like  makes  cat  noises 
 or  something  even  if  he  was  attractive 
 bro  imagine  that  same  guy  imagine  if  you
[06:38] look  like  a  tick  tock  boy  the  thing  is 
 he  could  be  really  attractive  but  if  he 
 still  did  this  weird  [ __ ]  there's  no
[06:43] girl  thinking  oh  like  I  hope  you  [ __ ] 
 me  they're  like  he'd  instantly  seem
[06:48] unattractive  and  finally  the  sixth  and 
 perhaps  worst  reason  why  girls  think 
 you're  unattractive  and  this  goes  for  a
[06:54] lot  of  young  guys  watching  this 
 especially  you  bro  you  are  needy  you 
 have  the  actions  of  an  needy  guy  who
[07:01] doesn't  have  many  other  options  the 
 majority  please  believe  this  this  is  so 
 easy  for  you  to  right  now  just  think  yep
[07:07] he's  not  really  talking  about  me  bro  I'm 
 talking  to  you  the  overwhelming  majority 
 of  guys  are  needy  when  it  comes  to  sex
[07:13] and  love  and  relationships  because  the 
 thing  is  we  can't  be  blamed  for  this  sex 
 love  and  relationships  are  a  fundamental
[07:19] need  of  like  you  know  they  are  a  need 
 how  interesting  is  that  like  love  is
[07:24] something  that  we  absolutely  need  as 
 human  beings  but  if  you  express  that 
 need  if  you  act  like  you  need  it  you
[07:30] don't  get  it  because  girls  aren't 
 attracted  to  guys  who  are  needy  how  do 
 you  come  across  as  needy  well  you  reply
[07:35] too  fast  to  a  text  messages  you  just 
 care  too  much  about  this  one  particular 
 girl  because  the  thing  is  like  bro  girls
[07:41] know  where  they  stand  honestly  like  a 
 lot  of  guys  say  like  girls  are  very 
 delusional  like  girls  kind  of  know  what
[07:46] their  value  is  and  they  know  that  if 
 you're  kind  of  like  desperately  trying 
 to  get  them  they  know  that  like  it's
[07:52] it's 
 unequal  and  so  it  becomes  really  deeply 
 unattractive  when  you  treat  a  girl  like
[07:57] better  than  you're  supposed  to  and 
 you're  like  you're  you  need  her  more 
 than  she  thinks  that  she's  actually  were
[08:02] and  with  so  many  guys  on  social  media 
 and  Snapchat  and  Tinder  it  becomes  so
[08:07] easy  to  be  that  kind  of  needy  guy 
 because  you  know  it  doesn't  seem  that 
 harmful  for  you  to  just  send  another
[08:13] text  to  the  girl  who's  not  replied  you 
 know  just  just  seeing  like  maybe  she'll 
 reply  to  this  one  now  you  might  have 
 gotten  to  this  far  of  the  video  feeling
[08:18] pretty  upset  with  you  on  the  things  that 
 we've  covered  here  and  just  thinking 
 like  this  feels  a  little  bit  hopeless  I
[08:25] feel  unattractive  how  attractive  you  are 
 to  women  is  actually  very  controllable  I
[08:31] am  certain  of  this  there  are  spaces 
 online  where  like  a  bunch  of  guys  get 
 together  and  literally  like  just  argue
[08:37] this  out  and  say  like  no  like  there's  no 
 way  to  become  more  attractive  to  girls 
 like  however  attractive  you  are  to  girls
[08:42] is  just  fixed  and  the  thing  is  I'm 
 personally  living  proof  that  this  is  not 
 the  case  like  if  you've  seen  pictures  of
[08:48] me  when  I  was  like  16  17  18  years  old 
 bro  like  I  wasn't  attractive  just 
 physically  I  wasn't  horribly  you  know
[08:54] ugly  or  anything  but  I  wasn't  like  a  hot 
 guy  also  just  with  my  personality  and  so 
 literally  I  was  not  getting  any  girls  no
[08:59] attraction  from  girls  whatsoever  if  you 
 followed  my  story  for  the  last  few  years 
 you  know  that  especially  near  the  start
[09:04] of  this  year  in  2022  like  I  don't  want 
 to  sound  like  you're  not  like  a  dick  or 
 like  you  know  [ __ ]  boy  or  something  but 
 like  the  biggest  problem  in  my  life  at
[09:10] the  start  of  this  year  was  that  I  was 
 sleeping  with  too  many  girls  and  it  was 
 actually  like  damaging  me  spiritually 
 and  I  know  there's  so  many  guys  who
[09:16] would  watch  this  and  think  oh  he's 
 boasting  or  he's  lying  it's  like  if  you 
 have  watched  a  bunch  of  my  videos  and 
 you  remember  those  times  when  I  would
[09:21] post  videos  literally  saying  like  I  keep 
 sleeping  with  too  many  girls  it's  become 
 a  problem  now  and  it's  like  it's 
 actually  hurting  my  soul  I  went  from
[09:27] being  that  kind  of  like  little  virgin 
 kissless  guy  who  was  just  weird  around 
 girls  who  no  girl  was  like  really
[09:33] interested  in  to  having  a  problem  like 
 that  all  these  people  online  who  doubt 
 that  a  young  man  can  improve  himself  to
[09:39] get  to  the  point  that  he  has  an 
 abundance  of  women  after  him  I  believe 
 they're  wrong  and  I  think  I'm  living 
 proof  of  that  and  maybe  you  could  be
[09:45] living  proof  of  it  too  do  this  right  now

"
CC2FESkbFUQ,"[00:00] jeffrey  hates  girls  why  wouldn't  he  they 
 hate  him  too  they  are  the  enemy  guys 
 they're  they're  all  hoes  and  we  should
[00:05] just  [ __ ]  them  and  throw  them  out  to  the 
 streets 
 they  do  the  same  to  you  if  you're  under 
 six  foot  tall  no  it's  not  my  personality
[00:12] i  have  an  awesome  personality  girls 
 don't  like  me  just  because  i'm  not  rich 
 or  six  foot  four  younger  hamza  was  fed
[00:17] up  of  not  having  a  girlfriend  one  of  his 
 friends  had  one  he  wanted  one  too  and  so 
 he  had  the  choice  be  better  or  be  bitter
[00:23] and  he  chose  better  he  started  going  to 
 the  gym  going  out  to  clubs  and  parties 
 and  going  on  tinder  and  instagram  and  he
[00:28] actually  started  getting  more  attention 
 soon  enough  hamza  got  himself  a 
 girlfriend  yay  but  they  broke  up  no  but
[00:34] younger  hamster  became  a  degenerate  and 
 started  getting  more  girls  than  ever  yay 
 he  learns  pickup  and  game  and  went  out
[00:39] to  nightclubs  three  times  a  week  and 
 started  consistently  hooking  up  with 
 girls  but  all  this  effort  all  this  time
[00:44] all  of  the  bad  habits  that  were  coupled 
 with  this  late  night  alcohol  and  drugs 
 and  low  quality  friends  if  only  he  knew
[00:50] that  there  was  a  better  way  adonis 
 adonis  has  no  trouble  attracting  women 
 sure  he's  made  some  mistakes  when  he  was
[00:56] younger  but  he  quickly  learned  that  the 
 best  way  to  get  girls  was  not  by 
 following  the  advice  of  everyone  else
[01:01] adonis  witnessed  the  jeffrey  uprising  he 
 saw  the  masses  spend  their  lives  on 
 social  media  he  looked  in  shame  at  the
[01:06] degenerates  in  the  dirty  nightclubs  he 
 wondered  why  so  few  men  attract  women  in 
 the  right  way  looking  [ __ ]  a  huge  cut
[01:13] porn  has  conditioned  young  men  that  they 
 can  have  it  all  that  you  don't  need  to 
 put  in  the  work  into  your  looks  your 
 money  your  lifestyle  you  can  just  hop  on
[01:19] your  favorite  website  find  millions  of 
 girls  who  want  to  [ __ ]  you  straight  away 
 and  so  we  need  to  recalibrate  our  minds
[01:24] because  you  have  to  understand  as  a 
 young  man  you're  not  really  supposed  to 
 be  attracting  women  right  now  you're 
 young  and  women  date  upwards  and  as  men
[01:30] it's  usually  easier  for  us  to  date  a 
 girl  who's  a  few  years  younger  than  us 
 because  let's  say  when  you're  16  years
[01:35] old  and  there's  a  16  year  old  girl  in 
 your  class  who  you're  attracted  to  well 
 the  chances  are  that  she  likes  a  17  or
[01:40] 18  year  old  guy  why  well  think  about 
 what  our  attractiveness  is  based  on  it's
[01:45] confidence  looks  gym  money  status 
 lifestyle  and  all  of  those  things  come 
 with  time  and  so  the  18  year  old  that
[01:51] your  princess  likes  probably  drives  a 
 car  has  a  better  life  than  you  he's 
 probably  got  more  muscle  from  the  gym 
 than  you  probably  has  more  money  than
[01:56] you  more  social  and  sexual  experiences 
 and  he's  all  around  just  more  confidence 
 and  this  shouldn't  depress  you  it  should
[02:01] give  you  hope  dating  is  supposed  to  take 
 time  for  men  and  so  how  do  you  actually 
 get  girls  do  your  thing  and  let  them
[02:06] come  focus  on  building  your  life  first 
 focus  entirely  on  hitting  these  six 
 milestones  and  you'll  find  that  women
[02:11] will  naturally  enter  your  life  without 
 much  effort  from  you  one  go  to  the  gym 
 lift  weights  build  muscle  okay  you  could
[02:16] be  exercising  for  sport  fantastic  but 
 specifically  you  need  to  be  building  an 
 aesthetic  muscular  body  i've  put  the
[02:21] workout  routines  that  i  recommend  in  the 
 description  for  free  start  a  good  career 
 or  business  now  this  potentially  could
[02:26] mean  studying  and  getting  a  degree  it 
 could  mean  becoming  an  entrepreneur  and 
 trying  some  business  ideas  have  a
[02:31] vibrant  social  circle  and  this  is 
 probably  one  of  the  most  important 
 milestones  for  young  men  to  actually  get 
 some  girls  because  if  you  come  home  from
[02:37] school  and  you  spend  your  entire  time 
 watching  my  videos  and  just  like  sat 
 there  on  across  the  computer  eating  your 
 food  whilst  on  your  computer  you're  not
[02:43] gonna  attract  girls  because  girls  won't 
 want  to  enter  your  life  they  want  to 
 enter  the  life  of  a  man  who's  actually 
 having  fun  of  course  they  do  like  what
[02:48] date  could  you  even  take  her  out  on  if 
 all  you  do  is  come  home  and  go  on  your 
 computer  and  the  vibrant  social  circle
[02:53] is  just  so  important  for  your  own  life 
 and  your  own  development  and  having 
 friends  that  you  can  rely  on  you  can  all
[02:58] like  lift  weights  together  and  go  to 
 parties  together  the  fourth  thing  you 
 should  work  on  is  confidence  and 
 confidence  is  kind  of  like  a  weird
[03:03] concept  that  we  all  want  it  but  we  don't 
 really  know  exactly  what  it  is  or  how  to 
 get  it  it's  literally  a  skill  that  you
[03:08] can  level  up  and  the  way  that  we  level 
 up  skills  is  that  we  literally  just  go 
 search  online  for  books  or  methods  on
[03:14] that  skill  we  read  the  book  we  learn 
 about  how  to  like  improve  your 
 confidence  we  go  out  there  and  practice 
 and  it's  a  bit  awkward  but  we  get  better
[03:19] and  better  over  time  the  confidence  gap 
 is  the  book  that  i'm  reading  the  fifth 
 and  very  important  milestone  to  focus  on
[03:25] instead  of  focusing  on  girls  focus  on 
 this  is  to  make  sure  that  you  have  no 
 mental  health  issues  that's  social 
 anxiety  and  depression  so  many  young
[03:31] guys  have  like  way  bigger  problems  than 
 a  lack  of  girls  in  their  lives  they've 
 literally  got  depression  they've  got 
 anxiety  but  they  focus  on  the  wrong
[03:37] thing  depres  like 
 honestly  it  sounds  horrible  but 
 depression  makes  you  ugly  anxiety  makes
[03:42] you  it's  just  how  it  works  you  could  be 
 like  an  attractive  guy  but  if  you  have 
 anxiety  you're  not  going  to  end  up 
 showing  yourself  to  the  real  world  if
[03:47] you  truly  have  depression  right  now  and 
 you're  not  trying  to  solve  it  in  any  way 
 you're  not  getting  therapy  for  it  or 
 you're  not  at  least  like  doing  some
[03:52] healthy  practices  like  eating  right  and 
 exercise  and  sleeping  more  then  you're 
 gonna  be  literally  just  a  downer  to  be
[03:57] around  and  i  know  that  this  sounds  quite 
 insensitive  but  this  is  coming  from 
 someone  who  had  pretty  severe  anxiety
[04:02] and  i  can't  believe  that  people  wanted 
 to  like  some  people  stayed  around  me  it 
 was  so  common  for  a  girl  and  even  like
[04:07] guys  to  get  around  me  no  it's  not  you 
 know  there's  something  wrong  with  me  i'm 
 anxious  all  the  time  i'm  uncomfortable
[04:12] about  stuff  and  then  they  just  slowly 
 like  start  like  you  know  getting  away 
 from  it  because  you  don't  really  want  to 
 be  around  someone  like  that  and  the  six
[04:18] milestone  to  work  on  is  to  learn  some 
 games  and  pick  up  and  some  red  pill 
 fundamentals  you  can  definitely  overdo
[04:23] it  with  this  one  you  can  become  like  a 
 full-on  red  pill  to  generate  full-on 
 like  pick-up  artist  who  goes  they  gave 
 in  and  [ __ ]  but  just  reading  maybe  a
[04:29] couple  of  the  books  watching  a  couple  of 
 the  youtube  videos  but  like  keep  like  a 
 distance  from  this  community  you  don't 
 want  to  get  like  too  like  drawn  into  it
[04:35] like  i  did  you  don't  want  to  dive  deep 
 into  it  but  if  you  can  understand  some 
 of  the  fundamentals  of  game  and  red  pill 
 for  example  push  and  pull  and
[04:41] demonstrating  high  value  that'll  be  very 
 very  helpful  for  you  these  are  things 
 that  normal  healthy  men  do  just
[04:46] naturally  but  us  cave  dwellers  on  our 
 internet  and  you  know  our  technology  we 
 kind  of  forgotten  how  to  do  it  and  so
[04:51] for  example  the  red  pill  and  some  game 
 stuff  will  teach  you  how  to  stop  being 
 creepy  and  needy  and  in  fact  that's  an
[04:56] article  by  this  guy  i  don't  know  how  you 
 pronounce 
 something  but  i'll  link  it  below  to  like 
 a  [ __ ]  big  ass  article  but  that's
[05:01] like  this  is  a  guy  from  the  red  pill 
 spirit  who's  made  a  fantastic  guide  how 
 to  stop  being  creepy  and  needy  and 
 that's  something  that  you'd  hugely
[05:07] benefit  from  because  you  are  a  [ __ ] 
 creep 
 and  that  right  there  is  the  framework  to 
 actually  get  girls  focus  on  these  six
[05:13] things  and  just  enjoy  the  women  who 
 really  want  to  enter  your  life  the  women 
 who  don't  want  to  enter  your  life  the
[05:18] women  that  you  have  to  run  after  they 
 should  be  invisible  to  you  because 
 instead  of  focusing  on  those  girls 
 you're  going  to  focus  on  these  six
[05:23] milestones  and  you  might  say 
 how  am  i  supposed  to  attract  girls  if 
 i'm  focused  on  something  else  and  that
[05:28] shows  me  that  you  don't  go  outside  much 
 because  girls  who  are  into  you  girls  who 
 are  attracted  to  you  they  make  it 
 obvious  they're  literally  like
[05:34] they'll  look  at  you  you'll  catch  them 
 looking  at  you  like  three  times  they'll 
 smile  they'll  follow  you  on  instagram 
 they'll  start  liking  your  pictures  now
[05:39] the  point  of  the  six  milestones  was  to 
 give  you  something  to  focus  on  above 
 women  and  the  sixth  milestone  teaches
[05:44] you  what  to  do  when  women  show  a  bit  of 
 interest  to  you  attracting  girls  is 
 about  attracting  pull  pull  don't  push
[05:51] don't  go  after  girls  let  them  gravitate 
 towards  you  be  a  magnet  not  a  repellent
[05:56] like  most  young  guys  do  your  thing  and 
 let  them  come  and  to  be  honest  you  do 
 need  to  know  what  to  do  to  you  know  what
[06:01] once  they've  come  to  you  once  they've 
 made  themselves  obvious  they  gave  you  an 
 indicator  of  interest  you  do  need  to
[06:06] know  what  to  do  and  the  thing  is  you 
 know  i  could  break  down  loads  of  things 
 like  you  should  touch  her  this  way  and 
 look  at  it  this  way  one  of  the  things
[06:11] that  no  one  really  tells  young  guys  is 
 that  you  just  kind  of  need  experience 
 every  guy  has  messed  up  so  many  times
[06:16] with  a  bunch  of  girls  like  any  guy  who 
 actually  gets  girls  will  tell  you  that 
 he's  been  rejected  so  many  times  he  says
[06:21] stupid  stuff  before  he  started  before 
 he's  just  like  weirdly  looked  at  a  girl 
 he  felt  like  a  creep  every  guy  will  tell 
 you  that's  what  like  you  just  have  to  go
[06:27] through  the  trials  and  tribulations  you 
 just  need  more  experiences  with  girls 
 but  the  issue  is  that  those  experiences
[06:32] with  girls  for  some  guys  are  so  rare 
 that  when  it's  about  to  come  for  example 
 you've  got  a  date  and  you  haven't  had  a
[06:37] date  in  a  while  then  of  course  you  you 
 place  like  a  a  big  value  you  put  it  on 
 the  pedestal  okay  then  you  know  i've  got
[06:42] to  make  sure  that  the  date  goes  right 
 the  issue  is  by  caring  so  much  you  lower 
 your  chances  of  success  in  the  date  if
[06:48] you  wanted  to  like  do  well  on  the  dates 
 so  before  you  go  on  the  date  or  before 
 you  text  a  girl  back  you  go  onto  youtube
[06:53] for  your  favorite  red  pill  youtuber  and 
 like  watch  three  of  his  videos  first  and 
 so  instead  of  that  instead  of  trying  to
[06:58] reach  for  perfection  not  wanting  to  lose 
 this  opportunity  you  should  have  almost 
 like  a  meta  thought  where  you  kind  of 
 like  think  like  huh  guys  like  you  know
[07:03] i'm  young  right  now  and  it's  not 
 supposed  to  be  good  but  i'm  just  gonna 
 try  and  be  mindful  and  grateful  of  the 
 experience  this  is  the  only  framework  of
[07:10] getting  girls  which  isn't  a  degenerate 
 waste  of  time  going  out  to  approach 
 hundreds  of  girls  constantly  going  to
[07:15] parties  and  nightclubs  and  taking  drugs 
 and  like  staying  up  late  and  constantly 
 just  being  on  tinder  and  [ __ ]  up  your
[07:21] mental  health  and  instagram  honestly  all 
 of  those  are  discussed  in  ways  to  get 
 girls  like  it's  like  a  very  instant
[07:26] gratification-y  way  of  trying  to  get 
 girls  not  only  for  the  habits  that  you 
 get  into  with  that  lifestyle  where
[07:31] you're  staying  up  late  you're  eating 
 like  dirty  food  you're  constantly  just 
 messing  up  your  mental  health  and  you're 
 going  to  clubs  taking  drugs  but  also  for
[07:37] the  tier  of  women  that  you  attract  now 
 you  can  have  physical  intercourse  with  a
[07:42] woman  that  you  like  meet  in  the 
 nightclub  but  did  you  literally  just 
 mess  up  your  entire  sort  of  nighttime
[07:47] routine  give  yourself  sleep  deprivation 
 drink  take  drugs  to  have  x  minutes  of 
 instant  gratification  pleasure  was  it
[07:53] really  like  that  was  like  the  height  of 
 your  night  like  you'd  really  really 
 wanted  this  to  happen  every  three  nights
[07:58] out  four  or  five  nights  out  you  get  to 
 like  sleep  with  a  drone  girl  who  like 
 doesn't  even  like  know  you  or  like  you 
 and  you  don't  even  like  her  you're  just
[08:03] kind  of  using  each  other's  bodies  if 
 you've  ever  found  yourself  focusing  on  a 
 girl  you've  lost  move  on  find  a  girl
[08:08] who's  focusing  on  you  adonis  focuses  on 
 himself  girls  focus  on  adonis  and
[08:13] jeffrey  focuses  on  the  girls  pick  which 
 one  you  want  to  be  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
"
mLZSk_gYCNo,"[00:00] Jeffrey  is  clueless  he  has  been  speaking 
 to  Jessica  for  ages  but  he  still  hasn't 
 made  his  move
[00:05] [Music] 
 come  on  Jeffrey  the  signs  are  right 
 there  she  likes  you
[00:12] oh  no  it's  too  late  Jeffrey  she  has  a 
 boyfriend  now
[00:18] he  cries  in  his  room  for  days  and  days 
 weeks  and  weeks  months  and  months  if
[00:23] only  he  could  have  seen  the  signs  Adonis 
 Adonis  has  seen  what  it's  like  when  a
[00:29] woman  is  infatuated  with  a  man  after  all 
 he  was  raised  by  parents  in  a  beautiful
[00:34] loving  marriage  and  he  saw  how  his 
 mother  acted  around  his  father  and  so 
 going  out  into  the  world  he  knows  with
[00:40] almost  perfect  accuracy  when  a  woman 
 likes  him  congratulations  Adonis 
 Anastasia  is  now  yours  a  worthy  Queen
[00:47] for  the  tribe  listen  to  this  there's  a 
 three-step  process  that  will  probably 
 eliminate  all  of  the  problems  you're
[00:53] having  with  your  date  in  like  Just  Three 
 Steps  step  one  improve  yourself  become 
 more  attractive  more  successful  be 
 better  with  girls  and  stuff  step  two  be
[00:59] aware  of  the  hidden  signs  of  when  a  girl 
 likes  you  which  we're  going  to  cover  in 
 this  video  and  then  step  three  know  how
[01:04] and  when  to  make  a  move  which  I've 
 covered  in  previous  videos  we  can  have 
 it  called  pop  up  on  screen  if  you  want
[01:09] to  watch  that  when  I  was  21  years  old 
 and  I  was  in  my  second  year  of 
 University  there  was  a  female  friend 
 that  I  had  who  was  in  the  same  like
[01:14] classes  as  me  so  we  both  studied 
 psychology  and  I  had  been  friends  with 
 her  like  you  know  like  friends  like  yo
[01:19] you  see  each  other  in  classroom  abuse 
 each  other  on  a  night  out  and  like  if 
 the  opportunity  arose  I  would  I  wouldn't
[01:24] ever  say  that  there  was  like  sexual 
 tension  because  I  wasn't  really  aware  of 
 it  I  was  almost  like  too  scared  to  you
[01:29] know  even  pursue  anything  even  though 
 like  I  didn't  really  have  feelings  for 
 her  but  like  you  know  I  would  have 
 smashed  but  like  it  wasn't  never  very
[01:34] clear  but  then  things  changed  on  her 
 birthday  and  she  invited  me  to  like  come 
 celebrate  in  a  club  with  her  and  her
[01:39] friends  and  I'm  out  there  we're  like 
 drinking  dancing  and  stuff  and  it's  out 
 of  nowhere  like  you  know  the  eye  contact 
 starts  and  just  suddenly  something
[01:45] clicked  and  I  was  like  oh  yeah  like  of 
 course  she  likes  me  like  I  had  missed 
 all  these  previous  signs  in  classic  you
[01:50] know  she's  texting  me  and  she  wants  to 
 like  hang  out  or  something  and  I'm  just 
 treating  her  like  a  friend  without 
 really  realizing  like  yeah  like  she  was
[01:55] sexually  interested  in  me  and  like  I 
 would  have  [ __ ]  bro  and  so  on  that 
 night  we  hook  up  it  was  like  one  of  the
[02:00] hottest  experience  I'm  not  gonna  lie 
 because  we  studied  in  the  same  class  and 
 so  what  would  happen  is  like  would  be 
 sat  in  our  lecture  just  you  know  paying
[02:06] attention  to  the  [ __ ]  lecturer  the 
 professor  or  something  sending  each 
 other  a  text  like  you  know  she  sat  maybe 
 10  meters  that  way  in  this  big  lecture
[02:11] hall  like  what  you're  doing  after  this 
 nothing  what  about  you  come  back  to  mine 
 we've  got  like  a  half  an  hour  break  one
[02:16] hour  break  between  lecture  and  the  next 
 lecture  we  go  back  to  my  place  which  is 
 nearby  I  start  having  sex  and  come  back
[02:21] like  it  was  a  very  like  nice  experience 
 to  have  with  this  girl  and  it  only 
 really  happened  because  eventually  I
[02:26] picked  up  the  hidden  in  the  signs  that 
 she  actually  liked  me  and  she  was 
 sexually  interested  in  me  so  right  now 
 there  might  be  a  girl  who's  actually
[02:31] into  you  but  your  brain  hasn't  even  like 
 comprehended  the  situation  so  there's 
 potentially  like  something  that  you
[02:37] could  get  out  of  this  there's  five 
 hidden  sides  that  a  girl  likes  you  and 
 number  one  and  my  favorite  is  that  she 
 makes  strong  eye  contact  now  once  you
[02:44] get  more  and  more  experience  with  girls 
 you  kind  of  realize  that  if  she  holds 
 your  eye  contact  chances  are  like  at
[02:49] least  you  know  you've  got  your 
 opportunity  to  like  shoot  your  shot  and 
 go  speak  to  it  but  when  you're  first 
 starting  off  and  you  know  you're  not  so
[02:54] confident  or  clued  up  with  girls  just  a 
 girl  kind  of  like  looking  at  you  as  she 
 talks  to  you  doesn't  feel  like  oh  yeah
[02:59] that's  her  invitation  saying  yeah  she 
 finds  you  hot  or  anything  but  genuinely 
 like  if  a  girl  holds  your  eye  contact
[03:04] with  like  really  good  strong  icons  like 
 it  gives  you  the  open  door  to  at  least 
 like  escalate  and  ask  things  further  now
[03:09] the  opposite  of  this  is  very  true  if  a 
 girl  has  like  very  fleeting  eye  contact 
 she  doesn't  really  look  at  you  imagine 
 she  walks  in  and  she  doesn't  even  look
[03:14] at  you  at  all  then  it's  like  well  she's 
 probably  not  interested  but  when  a  girl 
 for  example  walks  into  the  room  and
[03:19] literally  holds  your  eye  contact  with 
 like  a  big  smile  and  says  hello  it's 
 like  at  the  very  least  there's  something 
 going  on  there  the  second  sign  that  she
[03:25] might  be  interested  in  you  but  this  is  a 
 really  like  weird  one  that  we've  got  to 
 take  serious  and  a  lot  of  guys  [ __ ]
[03:30] this  one  up  actually  the  second  sign  is 
 that  she  sends  you  enthusiastic  replies 
 through  like  text  messaging  or  you  know
[03:36] Snapchat  or  whatever  the  reason  why  this 
 is  a  hidden  sign  that  she  likes  shoes 
 because  it  shows  the  level  of  interest
[03:41] that  you  know  she's  replying  to  you  and 
 obviously  if  she  wasn't  replying  to  you 
 at  all  then  that  would  be  very  clear 
 that  she's  not  into  you  but  we  need  to
[03:46] be  careful  here  because  a  lot  of  girls 
 will  just  reply  to  like  all  the  messages
[03:51] they  get  and  it's  very  easy  to  be  you 
 know  kind  of  like  a  young  guy  kind  of 
 Clueless  with  girls  to  have  like  some
[03:56] hot  girl  that  you're  interested  in  just 
 send  you  a  reply  and  you're  like  yes 
 well  you  know  she  might  oh  God  she  text 
 me  or  her  but  like  if  you  showed  it  like
[04:02] you  know  your  older  brother  who  was 
 better  with  girls  he'd  be  like  why  are 
 you getting  so  excited  like  she  sent  you 
 like  a  one-word  message  bro  there  was  a
[04:07] girl  one  of  the  first  girls  that  I  ever 
 matched  with  on  Tinder  when  I  was  like 
 literally  16  17  years  old  one  of  the
[04:12] first  girls  that  I  ever  even  like  didn't 
 fully  like  had  a  text  conversation  with 
 and  I  remember  this  girl  just  fully  like 
 strung  me  along  but  like  I  didn't  really
[04:18] know  what  was  happening  because  she 
 would  reply  to  my  messages  with  like  one 
 or  two  Word  answers  and  I  carried  you
[04:23] know  like  there's  a  lot  of  guys  do  like 
 carry  the  conversation  so  this  was  a 
 while  ago  but  I  I  literally  remembered 
 like  there  was  this  one  girl  that  was
[04:28] obsessed  with  and  I  would  literally  be 
 texting  her  stuff  like  oh  hey  Lego  what 
 have  you  been  up  to  and  she  just  replied 
 with  like  TV  comma  you  like  that  this
[04:35] was  our  conversation  like  every  day  and 
 I  was  like  so  happy  oh  my  God  she 
 replied  oh  wow  like  just  because  she
[04:40] replies  does  not  mean  that  she's  into 
 honestly  this  is  kind  of  like  [ __ ]  to 
 say  but  like  a  lot  of  girls  literally
[04:45] just  like  having  notifications  on  their 
 phone  honestly  like  a  lot  of  people  are 
 just  [ __ ]  up  in  the  head  and  so  a  lot 
 of  girls  and  guys  too  get  their  sense  of
[04:51] validation  from  just  the  amount  of 
 notifications  that  they  have  on  their 
 phone  and  you'll  know  this  is  the  case 
 where  if  you  kind  of  subtly  see  her  go
[04:57] onto  Snapchat  she'll  have  like  10 
 unopened  snaps  there  I've  not  used 
 Snapchat  in  a  while  and  like  I  don't
[05:02] date  any  women  who've  got  social  media 
 but  I  remember  when  I  was  back  in  that 
 sort  of  like  normal  people  scene  of 
 having  social  media  like  this  is
[05:07] offensive  to  say  but  like  the  girls  I 
 knew  instantly  who  weren't  [ __ ]  were  the 
 ones  who  had  Snapchat  and  Instagram  and
[05:12] everything  and  they  just  had  one  open 
 message  after  unopened  message  like  10 
 messages  that  they've  not  opened  for 
 like  two  days  and  what  it  essentially
[05:17] means  is  that  they're  just  stringing 
 along  some  chump  who's  like  waiting  for 
 his  reply  so  obviously  you  don't  want  to
[05:22] be  in  that  situation  but  you  also  don't 
 want  to  be  in  the  situation  when  a 
 girl's  texting  you  enthusiastically  and
[05:27] you  think  that  that's  like  the  sign  for 
 you  like  you  know  like  hopefully  oh  yeah 
 she  likes  me  it's  very  interesting  you
[05:32] know  I've  just  told  you  about  like  she's 
 got  a  tent  on  open  SnapChat  there  was  a 
 girl  like  I  was  hooking  up  with  through 
 the  lockdown  yeah  like  I  disobed
[05:37] lockdown  who  gives  a  [ __ ]  bro  I  was 
 [ __ ]  this  girl  in  the  woods  like 
 multiple  times  a  week  in  2021  and  you
[05:43] know  she  was  like  the  girl  who  I  saw 
 like  all  these  unopened  snapchats  on  her 
 phone  and  everything  I  just  thought  yeah 
 that's  like  some  DJ  and  [ __ ]  like  [ __ ]
[05:49] texting  this  way  I  remember  that  this 
 same  girl  had  a  guy  who  was  almost  like 
 this  is  kind  of  bad  today  but  almost
[05:54] like  the  beta  male  version  of  me  like 
 she  showed  me  pictures  like  me  and  her 
 were  just  hooking  up  right  so  I  was 
 literally  just  like  the  chat  in  this
[05:59] situation  but  he  looked  like  a  verse 
 version  of  me  but  he  just  wasn't  like 
 cool  about  it  he  was  getting  so  over
[06:04] excited  about  the  enthusiastic  messages 
 so  they  were  having  like  their  long  text 
 conversations  she'd  put  me  on  her
[06:09] Snapchat  story  like  us  doing  silly  [ __ ] 
 were  out  at  night  time  or  something  and 
 she's  like  pulled  up  my  shirt  like  I  was 
 very  lean  I  had  like  Rock  Solid  ads  so
[06:15] she'd  put  onto  a  Snapchat  story  like 
 pulling  up  my  hoodie  or  something  and 
 showing  my  abs  like  whoa  like  whatever 
 and  the  same  guy  would  reply  like  when
[06:20] me  and  her  were  out  like  literally  just 
 about  to  have  sex  in  like  the  woods  of 
 the  car  or  something  why  are  you  going
[06:25] out  with  this  guy  like 
 they  had  been  texting  for  a  while  they 
 had  I  believe  like  a  42-day  Snapchat
[06:30] streak  like  when  you  send  someone  a 
 message  every  single  day  on  Snapchat 
 it's  like  you  get  like  an  emoji  or  some 
 [ __ ]  so  this  hidden  sign  is  you  know  a
[06:36] girl  texts  you  back  enthusiastically  but 
 we  have  to  be  very  careful  because  it 
 can  mean  that  she's  into  but  it  can  also
[06:42] just  mean  that  she's  just  [ __ ] 
 playing  you  along  just  because  she  likes 
 like  just  having  some  validation  and 
 like  you  know  the  extra  notification
[06:47] dopamine  from  you  so  you've  got  to 
 figure  out  right  here  right  now  which 
 one  are  you  are  you  the  guy  who  she's 
 texting  enthusiastically  because  she
[06:52] actually  really  likes  you  and  she's  like 
 down  to  me  or  are  you  the  guy  who  she's 
 enthusiastically  texting  you  just
[06:57] because  she  likes  having  notifications 
 let's  move  on  and  talk  about  the  third 
 hidden  sign  that  a  girl  likes  you  and
[07:02] this  is  one  that  a  lot  of  guys  don't 
 actually  pick  up  on  and  it's  that  she 
 invades  your  personal  space  and  she 
 makes  almost  unnecessary  physical
[07:08] contact  so  in  other  words  like  she  gets 
 physically  just  close  to  you  maybe  she 
 like  touches  your  arm  and  she  talks  you
[07:13] know  you  make  her  laugh  and  she  goes 
 like 
 a  lot  of  guys  are  quite  jumpy  I'm  not
[07:18] gonna  lie  like  if  a  girl  or  even  like  a 
 guy  touches  like  most  guys  haven't 
 actually  been  touched  and  I  don't  say
[07:23] that  and  like  oh  you  said  touch  thing  oh 
 that's  funny  you're  beautiful  or  some 
 [ __ ]  like  I'm  actually  saying  like  most 
 guys  don't  get  enough  physical  touch  in
[07:29] their  life  something  just  like  [ __ ] 
 weirdly  like  stiff  and  just  like  weirdly 
 like  AFK  in  their  own  bodies  and  so  a
[07:34] lot  of  guys  when  a  girl  is  touching  them 
 and  stuff  that's  one  of  the  best  signs 
 you're  gonna  have  honestly  I  remember 
 when  I  used  to  go  to  clubs  you  know  I'd
[07:40] be  in  the  smoking  area  talking  to  girls 
 that  I  wanted  to  hook  up  with  there  and 
 then  in  that  night  and  I  would  know  for 
 certain  which  girl  I  was  eventually
[07:45] going  to  go  and  sleep  with  that  same 
 night  because  when  we'd  be  talking  she'd 
 be  like  way  more  touching  me  than  other
[07:50] girls  so  some  girls  will  talk  to  you 
 like  this  like  [ __ ]  masculine  ass 
 like  yeah  well  well  what  are  you
[07:55] studying  uni  yeah  like  you  know  some 
 girls  will  talk  to  you  like  that  and  all 
 the  girls  will  be  probably  cute  and 
 literally  like  touching  you  laughing
[08:00] like  you'll  make  them  laugh  they'll  like 
 put  their  hand  like  this  a  little  bit 
 like  that's  one  of  the  best  signs  you 
 can  have  but  a  lot  of  guys  don't  pick  up
[08:05] on  it  because  they're  just  so  [ __ ] 
 like  weird  and  their  bodies  bro  if  a 
 girl  is  touching  you  in  a  good  positive 
 way  and  she  just  finds  a  reason  to  get
[08:10] close  to  you  to  touch  you  until  I  put 
 her  hand  like  this  so  she  does  this  when 
 all  this  stuff  like  that's  such  a  good
[08:15] sign  that  she's  actually  more  into  you 
 than  you  realize  is  because  the  opposite 
 of  this  is  also  very  true  if  a  woman  is
[08:20] not  into  you  at  all  she  will  try  her 
 absolute  best  to  stay  a  little  bit
[08:25] further  away  from  you  and  like  not  touch 
 you  at  all  and  you  might  be  wondering  oh 
 wait  what  about  her  sort  of  you  know 
 personal  individual  differences  what  if
[08:30] oh  you  know  she's  you  were  she  told  me 
 that  she  just  doesn't  like  getting 
 hundreds  bro  I'm  telling  you  right  now
[08:35] some  girl  who  tells  you like  oh  I  don't 
 like  being  hug  is  like 
 she  doesn't  like  being  hugged  by  you  bro 
 oh  I  don't  like  being  touched  by  people
[08:41] she  doesn't  like  being  touched  by  you 
 honestly  like  I'm  sorry  to  say  that  bro 
 but  it's  the  truth  it's  like  yeah  you 
 know  people  can  be  very  different  some
[08:46] people  can  like  being  hugged  some  people 
 might  not  like  it  but  generally  if  she 
 like  doesn't  like  being  physical  around
[08:51] you  at  all  and  you  make  her  jump  when 
 you  accidentally  touched  her  or 
 something  she's  probably  not  that 
 interested  and  even  if  she  was  let's  say
[08:56] she's  just  got  this  like  weird  you  know 
 jumpy  physical  thing  where  like  she 
 can't  be  physical  with  someone  why  would
[09:01] she  be  interested  in  a  girl  like  that 
 anyway  man  like  I  think  being  physical 
 with  the  girl  that  you're  eventually 
 gonna  date  is  so  [ __ ]  important  and
[09:06] if  there  is  a  girl  who's  like  oh  well  I 
 don't  like  being  touched  by  people  it's 
 like  come  on  man  if  you  respect  yourself
[09:11] you  probably  get  out  of  that  situation 
 the  fourth  sign  that  a  girl  likes  you  is 
 the  kind  of  conversation  you'll  have  and 
 it's  that  she'll  share  some  intimate
[09:17] emotional  Parts  about  her  so  she'll  open 
 up  and  she'll  tell  you  things  about  like 
 her  dreams  her  failure  she'll  tell  you
[09:23] about  her  family  she'll  start  to  open  up 
 a  little  bit  and  I  remember  the  first 
 night  I  ever  met  my  girl  we  were  in 
 Thailand  so  we  were  both  like  traveling
[09:29] around  Thailand  separately  we  ended  up 
 meeting  up  and  she  came  over  to  my  Villa 
 on  like  literally  the  last  night  before
[09:34] me  and  my  friend  Sam  we're  gonna  fly  out 
 of  Thailand  so  you  know  it  was  like  a 
 little  leaving  party  of  like  5  five  six 
 people  she  came  over  and  I  remember  that
[09:40] our  first  conversation  did  so  well  just 
 because  you  know  we  started  opening  up  a 
 little  bit  and  we  spoke  about  like
[09:45] self-improvement  and  everything  you  know 
 she  was  like  so  interested  in  what  I  was 
 saying  and  then  I  remember  like  she  kind
[09:50] of  hinted  at  some  like  mental  health 
 issue  a  little  bit  like  not  like  of  now 
 but  like  obvious  you  know  something
[09:55] she'd  experienced  previously  when  she 
 was  a  little  bit  younger  I  feel  like 
 having  bad  mental  health  and  that's 
 something  I'm  very  interested  in  like  I
[10:01] love  speaking  about  mental  health  and 
 you  know  it  means  a  lot  to  me  so  when  I 
 asked  her  another  question  and  she  was 
 like  oh  no  like  I  don't  really  like  you
[10:06] know  like  I  don't  really  open  up  about 
 that  stuff  but  then  the  next  day  when  I 
 saw  her  again  and  she  literally  opened
[10:11] up  and  fully  told  me  like  deep  stuff  as 
 I  broke  him  on  I  knew  right  there  right 
 then  they're  like  okay  she's  got  to  be
[10:16] very  interested  in  me  if  she's  just 
 opened  up  about  something  serious  and  so 
 you  can  maybe  keep  that  story  in  mind  if
[10:21] there's  a  girl  who  opens  up  to  you  about 
 something  that  she  probably  wouldn't  you 
 know  broadcast  to  other  people  that  can
[10:26] be  a  sign  that  she  likes  you  and  she 
 trusts  you  and  she  sees  something  like 
 kind  of  secure  with  you  now  on  the  other
[10:31] hand  it  can  also  be  girls  who  are  just 
 quite  open  and  you  know  they're  just 
 loud  with  this  sort  of  intimate  moments 
 and  you  know  there's  the  kind  of  people
[10:36] who  will  openly  post  on  Instagram  about 
 their  family  problems  or  something  so 
 that's  a  person  who's  like  very  very
[10:41] open  so  maybe  then  opening  up  to  you  is 
 not  as  special  as  it  could  be  but  it's 
 just  something  to  keep  in  mind  if  she
[10:46] does  get  into  these  deep  conversations 
 with  you  chances  are  she  likes  you  more 
 than  just  like  an  NPC  that  she's  just
[10:51] met  the  fifth  hidden  sign  that  a  girl 
 likes  you  is  that  she  will  talk  about
[10:56] you  to  her  friends  her  female  friends 
 and  so  this  is  going  to  be  the  case 
 where  like  a  girl  likes  you  imagine
[11:01] she's  in  your  class  in  school  or  in  your 
 workplace  she  likes  you  you  know  she's 
 eyeing  you  up  a  little  bit  but  you  don't
[11:06] even  realize  she'll  speak  about  you  to 
 her  friends  like  oh  did  you  see  that  guy 
 but  you  won't  really  know  about  this
[11:11] because  her  friends  probably  won't  run 
 over  and  like  straight  away  tell  you 
 unless  if  you  get  a  little  bit  closer  to
[11:16] a  friend  so  I  remember  this  happening  I 
 remember  in  University  there  was  like  a 
 group  of  like  Pakistani  like  loud  girls
[11:22] who  came  in  late  and  everything  but  they 
 were  like  pretty  attractive  I  didn't 
 know  this  at  the  time  but  like  it  turned 
 out  they  were  almost  like  a  little  bit
[11:27] obsessed  with  me  and  I  didn't  really 
 know  this  but  I  literally  like  the  story 
 that  this  one  girl  told  me  I  was  like 
 holy  [ __ ]  these  girls  were  obsessed  with
[11:33] me  for  a  long  time  and  I  didn't  even 
 realize  so  hopefully  you  can  like  learn 
 from  my  mistakes  here  because  I  could 
 have  capitalized  on  this  way  better  but
[11:39] eventually  like  I  ended  up  messaging  one 
 of  the  girls  on  Instagram  she  comes  over 
 and  like  you  know  things  get  a  little 
 bit  heated  but  just  like  talking  like
[11:45] afterwards  she  tells  me  about  her 
 friends  and  everything  and  she's  like  oh 
 yeah  like  one  of  my  friends  was  telling 
 me  like  that  one  time  that  you  like
[11:50] dropped  a  pen  next  to  her  what  like  oh 
 yeah  like  you  know  like  essentially  she
[11:55] told  me  a  story  that  was  of  significance 
 to  her  and  her  friends  that  like  I 
 dropped  a  pen  next  to  them  and  I  like
[12:00] just  picked  it  back  up  and  they're  like 
 oh  my  god  oh  like  he  dropped  the  bed 
 next  to  us  oh  like  this  is  one  that  I
[12:05] missed  myself  so  maybe  it's  something 
 somehow  you  can  find  that  the  girl  that 
 you're  interested  in  has  been  talking
[12:10] about  you  to  her  female  friend  so  I 
 don't  know  how  you  do  this  maybe  you'll 
 go  speak  to  her  female  friends  or  become
[12:15] more  friendly  with  them  she 
 that  probably  won't  work  because  like
[12:20] the  girls  will  like  conserve  their 
 secrets  but  if  for  example  inhibitions 
 are  lowered  if  for  example  you're  like
[12:25] 18  21  you're  going  out  drinking  and  you 
 see  that  girl  that  you're  interested  in 
 you  see  her  friends  and  you  end  up  you
[12:30] know  just  vibing  with  them  they  will 
 probably  encourage  you  to  do  this  so 
 this  is  probably  the  more  realistic
[12:35] scenario  if  you  get  into  more  of  like  a 
 sexual  more  mature  environment  like 
 going  out  to  a  club  or  a  party  and  you
[12:40] see  for  example  there's  your  girl  in  her 
 group  of  friends  and  you  end  up  just 
 vibing  with  her  friends  you  may  be
[12:45] drinking  or  something  dancing  and  stuff 
 then  eventually  her  friends  might  be 
 like  oh  yeah  like  have  you  spoke  to 
 Sarah  today  like  that's  the  sign  bro
[12:50] that's  literally  him  saying  like  go 
 speak  to  her  stop  being  a  dumbass  go 
 speak  to  her  right  now  bro  come  on  now
[12:56] you've  heard  these  hidden  signs  that  a 
 girl  might  be  into  you  but  there  could 
 be  a  chance  that  you're  sat  here  and  you
[13:02] have  this  almost  limiting  belief  where 
 you  think  that  a  girl  who's  into  you  is 
 just  being  friendly  because  chances  are
[13:09] you've  grown  up  without  much  female 
 attraction  and  the  way  that  we've  been 
 conditioned  and  you  know  like
[13:14] brainwashed  and  you  know  like  influence 
 to  navigate  our  relationships  with  women 
 has  been  made  so  like  depolarized  and
[13:20] demasculine  you  know  it's  like  we're 
 kind  of  pushed  to  like  not  be  upfront 
 with  a  girl  that  we're  into  aren't  we
[13:25] we're  kind  of  pushed  to  be  more  like 
 passive  these  days  and  to  not  pursue 
 it's  almost  seen  as  a  bad  thing  to  go  up 
 and  speak  to  the  girls  it's  like  oh  wow
[13:31] looks  that's  like  socially  weird  or 
 anything  so  chances  are  you  might  even 
 have  like  this  [ __ ]  up  belief  in  your 
 mind  with  a  girl  who  is  into  you  you
[13:37] just  think  she's  just  being  friendly 
 just  because  you've  been  raised  in  a  way 
 to  believe  that  like  men  and  women  are
[13:42] supposed  to  be  friends  and  like  we  can 
 do  everything  each  other  can  or  maybe  an 
 even  sadder  notes  is  that  you  just  don't
[13:47] even  believe  that  women  could  be 
 attracted  to  you  maybe  you've  kept  in 
 mind  this  belief  that  you  are  just
[13:52] simply  not  attractive  to  girls  and  so 
 you  literally  have  convinced  yourself 
 that  any  of  these  signs  don't  mean
[13:57] anything  and  maybe  you've  been  watching 
 this  video  thinking  oh  the  last  sign 
 doesn't  mean  oh  this  one  doesn't  know 
 this  one  doesn't  women  are  attracted  to
[14:02] me  maybe  you've  just  convinced  yourself 
 that  you're  ugly  and  girls  aren't 
 attracted  to  you  and  I  did  the  exact
[14:07] same  thing  bro  I  fully  had  convinced 
 myself  when  I  was  growing  up  that  I  was 
 ugly  that  you  know  if  I  was  brown  skin
[14:12] I'm  Pakistani  so  I  thought  girls  weren't 
 attracted  to  like  Pakistan  oh  there's  no 
 way  like  every  girl  thinks  I'm  a 
 terrorist  these  were  dead  ass  real
[14:18] thoughts  that  I  had  about  myself  I 
 literally  thought  I  was  like  so  ugly 
 when  I  looked  back  and  I  was  like  when  I
[14:23] was you  know  15  16  17  18  like  I  wasn't 
 very  very  hot  but  I  wasn't  ugly  as  well 
 I  wasn't  like  you  know  two  out  of  ten  or
[14:28] some  [ __ ]  like  I  wasn't  ugly  but  I 
 had  this  false  belief  that  I  was  and  so 
 I  acted  like  it  and  so  when  there  were
[14:34] literally  was  you  know  girls  like  I 
 could  have  dated  when  I  was  in  high 
 school  or  a  little  bit  older  there  was 
 girls  who  were  into  me  who  I  found  out
[14:40] later  on  they  were  into  me  but  I  just 
 simply  didn't  even  see  the  signs  because 
 I  had  convinced  myself  that  no  girls 
 could  be  into  me  because  I  was  ugly  and
[14:46] you  know  I  was  brown  skinned  and  girls 
 don't  like  brown  guys  and  this  honestly 
 gets  so  much  deeper  than  just  you  know 
 this  like  surface  level  video  we  know
[14:51] this  video  is  going  to  perform  well 
 that's  why  I've  titled  it  and  the  five 
 hidden  signs  like  it's  a  very  like 
 clickbait  topic  you  know  this  video  it
[14:56] goes  so  much  deeper  because  so  many  guys 
 don't  even  realize  girls  could  be  into
[15:01] them  like  you've  been  totally  convinced 
 that  you're  just  one  of  those  guys  who's 
 never  gonna  get  lazy  who's  never  gonna
[15:06] get  girls  and  stuff  I  think  this  guy's 
 so  much  more  serious  when  you  start  to 
 think  like  this  is  probably  because  you
[15:11] haven't  had  like  a  very  masculine 
 present  father  because  if  you  really  had 
 like  a  masculine  prison  father  and  you
[15:16] know  he  was  very  loving  to  all  towards 
 his  wife  your  mother  then  you  would  have 
 like  seen  how  it  is  to  navigate
[15:21] relationships  with  women  but  we  don't 
 really  see  that  these  days  some  parts  of 
 the  world  are  so  messed  up  with  like  you
[15:27] don't  see  fathers  in  the  home  you  just 
 see  like  your  single  mother  struggling 
 to  raise  you
[15:32] and  then  at  school  you  don't  really  see 
 this  you're  not  promoted  to  be  like 
 quite  masculine  and  forward  with  your
[15:38] intentions  like  every  man  has  before  us 
 and  so  I  think  young  men  are  very 
 clueless  when  it  comes  to  dating  I  think
[15:43] this  is  such  an  important  topic  that  we 
 talk  about  because  I  wish  when  I  was  a 
 little  bit  younger  I  had  like  an  older
[15:49] like  you  know  role  model  like  a  big 
 brother  figure  that  like  actually  taught 
 me  these  things  from  his  experience  I
[15:55] think  it's  so  valuable  for  you  to  keep 
 these  kind  of  hidden  signs  in  mind  and 
 to  get  even  better  at  like  picking  up  on
[16:00] these  like  little  clues  that  girls  are 
 into  because  it  compounds  like  it  all 
 snowballs  and  gains  momentum  that  the
[16:05] better  you  get  at  navigating  your 
 relationships  with  women  then  the  better 
 women  you  start  to  attract  after  that
[16:11] and  so  I  think  this  is  such  a  valuable 
 skill  that  we  should  be  like  adding  into 
 our  self-improvement  journey  like  you
[16:17] know  we  go  into  the  gym  to  improve  our 
 fitness  we  meditate  to  improve  our 
 mental  health  I  think  a  pillar  of  our 
 self-improvement  should  be  dating  love
[16:23] and  relationships  and  the  skill  of  being 
 better  around  women  a  lot  of  guys 
 disagree  with  me  and  they  think  you
[16:29] should  just  forget  about  women  and  you 
 should  you  know  women  or  horrible  women 
 are  all  trash  like  focus  on  yourself 
 King  I  never  related  to  that  bro  because
[16:35] inside  of  me  I  have  this  authentic 
 desire  for  love  for  relationships  for 
 sex  for  dating  to  like  partner  up  with  a
[16:41] woman  I've  always  had  that  desire  and 
 those  times  when  I  listen  to  these  guys 
 of  these  Sigma  male  grind  set  type  of 
 guys  it's  like  oh  you  know  just  focus  on
[16:46] yourself  King  like  oh  women  aren't 
 worthy  it's  like  I  was  just  less  happy 
 less  productive  weirdly  like  obsessed
[16:53] over  girls  feeling  kind  of  [ __ ]  because 
 I  didn't  have  women  in  my  life  and 
 everything  I'm  way  happier  and  way  more 
 fulfilled  and  just  feel  like  free  now
[16:59] that  I've  gave  myself  permission  to  like 
 level  up  my  skill  with  women  and  it's 
 still  something  that  I'm  learning  right
[17:04] now  click  and  watch  this  video  right  now 
 do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah
"
lhn8aIfC5RU,"[00:00] jeffrey  doesn't  track  his  nutrition  he 
 eats  whatever  he  craves  and  that  usually 
 means  low  quality  junk  food  he  thinks
[00:06] people  who  care  about  their  health  are 
 weird  younger  hamza  was  scared  of 
 gaining  fats  he  had  just  done  a
[00:11] successful  diet  going  from  chubby  to 
 skinny  and  he  wanted  to  stay  lean  but 
 this  meant  slow  progress  in  the  gym  he
[00:17] constantly  kept  switching  from  bulk  to 
 cut  cut  to  bulk  scared  of  getting  fat
[00:22] but  also  annoyed  at  how  little  his 
 muscles  were  he  wasted  time  adonis 
 adonis  feasts  like  a  king  his  appetite
[00:29] and  diet  allow  him  to  grow  bigger  than 
 all  of  his  friends  and  enemies  because 
 of  that  adonis  is  fueled  with  confidence
[00:35] he  feels  better  than  good  enough  he's 
 looked  up  to  as  the  leader  of  his  tribe 
 when  a  guy  tells  me  how  many  calories
[00:41] he's  eaten  and  the  number  starts  with 
 one 
 i  feel  the  pain  right  here  you  want  to
[00:48] speed  up  your  body  transformation  you 
 want  to  go  from  a  skinny  fat  curry  cell 
 to  a  chad  pre  light  well
[00:54] you  got  a  bulk 
 huh 
 i'm  fat  already  i  can't  bulk  i'm  fat
[01:01] hamster 
 you  want  fat  fat  okay  this  is  fat  fat
[01:06] you  aren't  fat  fat  you're  just  skinny 
 fats  essentially  you  just  don't  have 
 enough  muscle  to  look  good  you've  got 
 the  asian  jeans  where  you've  got  the
[01:12] skinny  fat  look  instead  of  the  lean 
 white  boy  look  and  the  cure  to  the 
 skinny  fat  body  is  the  bulk  and  when  we
[01:19] say  bulk  we  mean  to  eat  more  when  we  eat 
 more  we  gain  more  muscle  and  strength  in 
 the  gym  that's  what  you  need  you  don't
[01:25] need  to  lose  fat  right  now  you  need  more 
 muscle  our  testosterone  goes  up  so 
 unless  you  want  to  be  a  little  [ __ ]
[01:30] you've  got  a  bulk  and  you're  going  to 
 learn  the  easiest  but  also  one  of  the 
 most  effective  ways  to  start  bulking
[01:36] because  i  didn't  i  wasted  so  much  time 
 when  i  first  started  weight  lifting  and 
 i  had  like  kind  of  like  the  skinny  fat
[01:41] body  that  you  probably  have 
 i  knew  that  i  should  be  bulking  to  gain 
 strength  and  muscle  and  everyone's
[01:46] telling  me  you  know  your  lift  should  be 
 going  up  in  the  gym  but  i  had  this 
 obsession  with  wanting  to  get  lean  and
[01:51] wanting  to  get  abs  i'd  train  in  the  gym 
 and  i'd  eat  like  1800  calories  a  day
[01:56] trying  to  cut  down  even  though  i  had  bit 
 i  hadn't  even  built  any  muscle  yellow 
 what  what  the  [ __ ]  are you  trying  to  cut
[02:01] down  to  bro  like  you've  got  to 
 understand 
 i  had  this  idea  that  if  i  lost  enough
[02:08] fat  i  would  look  like  a  smaller  version 
 of  a  shredded  guy  i  thought  i  thought
[02:13] that  you'd  have  those  muscles  it's  just 
 that  i  would  be  smaller  but  eventually 
 if  i  lost  enough  fat  i  would  begin  to
[02:19] look  like  a  shredded  person  but  just 
 kind  of  smaller 
 loud  ass  car  bro  [ __ ]  you
[02:26] honda  civic 
 i  don't  even  know  what  the  [ __ ]  a  honda 
 civic  is 
 it  doesn't  work  like  that  you  have  to
[02:31] build  the  muscle  first  before  you  can 
 cut  down  which  means  that  you're  being  a 
 little  bit  if  you  are  in  the  first  one
[02:37] maybe  even  two  years  of  your  lift  in 
 career  and  you're  you're  on  a  cutting 
 phase  right  now  like  how  many  times  do  i
[02:42] have  to  say  this  you  don't  deserve  to  be 
 lean  right  now  you  could  be  bulky  you 
 could  look  way  bigger  and  everyone's 
 gonna  notice  and  everyone's  gonna  be
[02:47] like  oh  my  god  did  you  go  to  the  gym 
 you're  getting  strong  you're  getting  big 
 masha'allah  or  you  can  just  cut  your
[02:52] calories  reduce  your  testosterone 
 increase  your  courses  i'll  [ __ ]  up  your 
 sleep 
 all  part  of  your  life  your  mental
[02:57] concentration  for  your  exams  for  the 
 pursuit  of  trying  to  get  abs  in  like 
 shreds  when  you're  like  three  months
[03:03] into  lifting  and  now  this  is  what  i  look 
 like  i  look  sick  because  i've  bulked 
 over
[03:08] 60  pounds  of  almost  lean  weight  since  i 
 first  started  that's  over  seven  years  i
[03:13] started  at  115  pounds  i'm  175  now  if  you 
 like  the  look  of  my  physique  and  you
[03:19] want  to  look  similar  to  me  i've  linked 
 the  workout  routines  that  i  recommend 
 below  in  the  description  oh  and  worst  of
[03:24] all 
 please  do  not  ever  get  onto  a  [ __ ] 
 maintenance  phase  a  maintenance  recom  oh
[03:30] shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  [ __ ]  jeff  nippon 
 had  to  go  make  this  viral  now  everyone  i 
 speak  to  he's  like  oh  yeah  like  sam
[03:36] [ __ ]  does  oh  i'm  gonna  do  it  why  the 
 [ __ ]  would  you  do  that  bro  like 
 ah  to  make  a  good  amount  of muscle
[03:42] you've  got  a  bulk  when  so  many  guys  are 
 starting  off  and  they've  got  this  idea 
 of  like  oh  but  you  know  i've  got  a  bit
[03:47] of  fat  right  now  so  uh  i'll  sacrifice 
 the  most  important  thing  which  is  muscle
[03:52] so  that  i  can  try  and  stay  like  how  did 
 it  go  sam  a  little  bit 
 like  you  gained  in  space  for  a  couple  of
[03:57] months  not  really  gaining  anything  sam's 
 been  on  a  solid  bulk  now  for  a couple  of 
 months  and  i  can  i  know  for  a  fact  that
[04:02] this  is  the  most  like  he  said  it  himself 
 like  he'll  start  to  go  like  way  more 
 often  he  enjoys  his  training  his
[04:07] strengths  going  up  and  he  actually  looks 
 like  he's  filling  out  like  sam  give  us  a 
 [ __ ]  double  biter  pump  he's  actually 
 getting  thick  now  which  is  [ __ ]  sick
[04:13] like  i  told  him  a  couple  of  times  you 
 don't  deserve  to  be  lean  now  you  can  get 
 bulky  which  is  what  he's  finally  doing
[04:19] or  you  can  just  stay  looking  weirdly 
 skinny  fat  and  the  thing  is  sam  you  tell 
 him  bro  you  worked  out  for  a  couple  of 
 months  how  did  they  go  go  out  for  you
[04:26] i  wasn't  necessarily  doing  as  well  i  was 
 doing  okay  but  i  wasn't  doing  as  well
[04:32] when  i  was  on  a  maintenance 
 now  the  only  times  that  i've  made  a  good 
 amount  of  progress  and  that  the  only
[04:38] times  that  you  will  make  a  good  amount 
 of  progress  is  when  you  clean  bulk  now 
 i'm  telling  you  to  bulk  but  you  better 
 not  be  a  bit  bro  you  better  not  be  a
[04:44] little  taking  advice  from  these  fitness 
 youtubers  doing  dirty  bulks
[04:49] off  bro 
 children  bro  full  day  of  eating  i'm 
 eating  300  grams  of  cocoa  off  bro  we
[04:55] don't  eat  that  [ __ ]  we  want  to  level  up 
 our  discipline  we  want  to  become  like 
 strong  men  we  don't  want  to  be  in  these
[05:00] fluffy  little  bodybuilders  when  we  bulk 
 we  only  bulk  with  clean  nutritious  food
[05:05] and  every  now  and  then  maybe  every  day 
 we  have  a  small  treat  just  as  like  you 
 know  just  to  be  mindful  of  like  a  one
[05:10] cube  of  dark  chocolate  one  cube  you  have 
 to  understand  and  take  what  i  say 
 seriously  because  i  say  this  in  every
[05:15] video  and  still  i  feel  like  too  many  of 
 my  boys  are  watching  fitness  youtubers 
 they  make  videos  for  views  and  what  gets
[05:21] views  is  the  shredded  guy  doing  this  and 
 he's  like  oh  look  at  all  the  junk  food 
 i'm  eating  that  gets  more  views  than  the
[05:27] shredded  guy  was  like  yeah  obviously  i'm 
 eating  [ __ ]  healthy  foods  bro  we're 
 gonna  eat  healthy  now  bulking  should  be
[05:32] difficult  repeat  with  me  bulking  should 
 be  difficult  you  shouldn't  be  excited  to 
 bulk  if  you're  excited  to  bulk  that 
 means  you're  a  little  [ __ ]  bro
[05:37] bulking's  like  it's  it's  so  much  harder 
 like  the  training  is  honestly  easy  the
[05:42] training  is  literally  just  like  once 
 you're  in  motion  you  just  train  you  go 
 lift  your  days  yeah  you  know  it's 
 challenging  and  stuff  and  it's
[05:47] physically  fatiguing  but  it's  like  you 
 get  it  done  no  problem  cutting  for  most 
 people  honestly  it's  fine  some  people
[05:52] with  mental  health  problems  struggle  but 
 it's  like  it's  not  that  difficult  reduce 
 your  calories  do  some  more  cardio  fine 
 bulking  with  clean  nutritious  food
[05:58] should  be  like  one  of  the  most  difficult 
 things  you  do  bro  like  i  i  feel  so  close 
 to  being  sick  in  my  kickboxing  sessions
[06:04] because  i've  added  down  for  like  3  800 
 calories  before  6  p.m  it  should  be  the
[06:09] most  difficult  part  of  your  regimens  and 
 this  is  exactly  what  you're  going  to  do 
 now  i'm  not  going  to  tell  you  the 
 standard  advice  okay  let's  go  on  to
[06:14] myfitnesspal  and  let's  check  our 
 calories  and  and  weigh  our  food  because 
 if  you  were  going  to  do  that  which  you
[06:19] should  it  is  the  best  way  to  go  about 
 your  nutrition  is  to  literally  just 
 weigh  and  track  every  gram  of  food  you 
 eat  that's  what  athletes  do  if  you  were
[06:25] going  to  do  that  then  you  probably  would 
 have  already  considered  it  like  it's  not 
 new  news  for  me  to  tell  you  like  oh  yeah 
 go  track  your  food  so  if  you're  watching
[06:31] this  right  now  and  you're  not  currently 
 in  the  flow  of  tracking  your  food  on 
 myfitnesspal  i'm  not  going  to  suggest
[06:37] that  to  you  and  instead  i'm  just  going 
 to  suggest  something  which  is  easier  and 
 it  is  still  pretty  effective  too  all  you
[06:42] have  to  do  is  just  have  a  simple  mindset 
 when  you're  eating  you're  eating  good 
 clean  foods  but  don't  knock  in  cocoa
[06:47] when  you're  eating  good  clean  foods  and 
 you  feel  full  eat  a  little  bit  more 
 that's  the  one  difference  i  want  you  to
[06:52] make  when  you're  first  starting  off 
 bulking  if  you're  a  young  guy  right  now 
 you're  like  a  16  year  old  you've  been
[06:57] overwhelmed  by  the  diet  advice  and 
 everything  you  want  to  build  muscle  you 
 want  to  get  testosterone  you  want  to 
 even  grow  taller  and  everything  eat
[07:03] clean  healthy  food  that  your  mum  makes 
 as  soon  as  you  feel  full  eat  a  little 
 bit  more  than  you  normally  would  i've 
 asked  your  mom  for  a  little  bit  more  and
[07:09] actually  think  to  yourself  it's  almost 
 like  the  workout  mindset  where  you're 
 thinking  okay  you  know  push  yourself  one 
 more  rep  and  everything  you've  got  to  do
[07:14] that  with  your  food  to  think  like  okay 
 come  on  one  more  spoonful  have  that  same 
 mindset  to  think  okay  this  plate  of  food
[07:19] is  like  a  challenge  now  it's  not  going 
 to  be  a  challenge  if  you're  eating  like 
 a  little  bit  if  you're  eating  pizza  if
[07:24] you're  eating  [ __ ]  sweeties  and  stuff 
 for  your  calories  you're  being  a  little 
 bit  now  if  you  want  to  eat  that  stuff 
 it's  like  a  nice  treat  to  be  mindful  of
[07:30] once  every  now  and  then  absolutely  fine 
 if  you  think  that  that  stuff  should  be 
 like  filling  up  your  calories  because  of
[07:35] these  [ __ ]  fitness  youtubers  then 
 bulking's  gonna  be  easy  you  won't  need 
 this  advice  that  means  you're  a  [ __ ]
[07:40] that  means  that  you're  gonna  look  like 
 in  a  couple  of  months  you're  gonna  be 
 fluffy  and  you're  going  to be  buying  the 
 [ __ ]  diet  plans  and  stuff  because
[07:46] nothing  else  is  working  for  you  we're 
 going  to  eat  clean  nutritious  food  and 
 if  you  want  the  perfect  diet  for  your 
 bulk  you  can  click  on  this  video  right
[07:52] here  in  short  the  foods  that  you  want  to 
 eat  are  the  ones  that  help  your  gut 
 microbiome  be  healthy  literally  the
[07:57] unsexy  advice  is  like  lots  of  a  variety 
 of  different  colored  fruits  and 
 vegetables  it's  just  that  bro  it's  a
[08:03] meat  with  whole  grains  like  wholemeal 
 bread  just  have  beef  and  bread
[08:10] bulking's  hard  bro  it's  not  supposed  to 
 be  easy  go  eat  your  [ __ ]  beef  bread 
 bro
[08:16] [Laughter] 
 honestly  you  know  the  healthy  food  that 
 your  mum  makes  which  you  don't  like  to
[08:21] eat  because  you  want  to  eat  your  [ __ ] 
 processed  food  eat  your  mom's  food  bro 
 and  maybe  your  mom  maybe  your  parents
[08:26] don't  make  healthy  food  and  if  they 
 don't  you  will  suffer  for  the  rest  of 
 your  life  i'm  not  going  to  give  you  the 
 like  a  lie  here  if  your  parents  are  fat
[08:32] if  your  parents  don't  make  like  they 
 don't  cook  healthy  food  you  will  suffer 
 for  the  rest  of  your  life  because  of
[08:37] that  not  only  is  it  setting  you  off  the 
 start  of  your  life  till  you're  an  adult 
 with  a  pretty  diet  but  generally  we  do
[08:44] imitate  the  behavior  that's  been  modeled 
 by  our  parents  and  if  our  parents  are 
 drinking  coke  then  we're  gonna  end  up
[08:49] drinking  coke  because  it's  normalized 
 now  of  course  you  don't  have  to  and  it 
 takes  like  a  big  change  180  of  your  life
[08:54] to  not  follow  your  biggest  sort  of  role 
 models  and  that's  kind  of  what  i've  done 
 but  you  it  does  certainly  set  you  down  a
[09:01] certain  trajectory  which  you  just  should 
 have  like  a  sense  of  compassion  in  your 
 mind  to  know  that  if  your  parents  are 
 unhealthy  if  for  example  in  your
[09:07] household  there's  no  like  healthy  food 
 being  cooked  you  are  like  fighting  an 
 uphill  battle  this  is  supposed  to  be
[09:12] difficult  it's  not  supposed  to  be  easy 
 but  having  said  that  if  you  are  fighting 
 this  uphill  battle  then
[09:18] you're  a  man  now  it's  time  to  put  in  the 
 action  and  you  take  charge  of  your  diet 
 so  here  is  exactly  the  practical  step  of
[09:24] exactly  what  you  do  after  this  video 
 from  now  on  every  single  day  have  one
[09:29] new  very  very  healthy  meal  and  the  meal 
 that  i  suggest  which  i  like  i  literally 
 i'm  gonna  totally  show  you  this  meal  and
[09:35] like  you'll  make  it  with  me  and 
 everything  just  make  this  meal  every 
 single  day  for  the  rest  of  your  life  and 
 it's  literally  just  roasted  vegetables
[09:41] and  the  main  part  of  the  vegetable  is 
 potatoes  so  this  is  what  you  do  you  get 
 some  potatoes  wash  them  cut  them  up  get
[09:46] your  oven  tray  with  some  tin  foil  put 
 some  olive  oil  and  this  is  very 
 important  that  the  fat  world  have  told
[09:51] you  that  oil  is  unhealthy  that  olive  oil 
 is  unhealthy  it's  [ __ ]  bulky  bro  oil 
 fats  are  very  very  good  for  you  it's  way
[09:57] better  than  a  lot  of  the  balls  that 
 these  people  are  recommended  to  you  so 
 we're  gonna  put  some  olive  oil  over  this
[10:02] tray  put  the  potatoes  over  and  then 
 literally  this  is  so  easy  for  the 
 vegetables  just  go  to  like  the 
 supermarket  they've  got  frozen
[10:07] vegetables  in  a  bag  bro  whatever  once 
 you  could  like  visualize  yourself 
 enjoying  grab  a  couple  of  them  literally
[10:13] just  cut  open  a  bag  unless  you  just  pour 
 them  in  i  don't  even  weigh  the 
 vegetables  you  can  eat  as  many 
 vegetables  as  you  want  just  pour  them
[10:18] all  in  a  bit  of  seasoning  a  bit  more 
 olive  oil  put  it  in  for  like  half  an 
 hour  come  downstairs  check  it  it's 
 probably  like  not  fully  cooked  yet  you
[10:24] look  around  at  it  set  another  timer  on 
 for  like  10  minutes  and  then  come  back 
 you've  got  like  a  peg  plate  of  roasted
[10:30] vegetables  roasted  potatoes  high  in 
 carbs  pretty  high  in  fiber  and  protein
[10:35] and  if  you  want  to  make  it  taste  even 
 better  just  sprinkle  some  mature  cheddar 
 don't  be  a  little  bit  like  mild  or  like
[10:41] oh 
 the 
 plastic  the  pla  i  saw  my  dad  trying  to 
 cook  with  that  like  literally  the
[10:46] plastic  oh  bro  i  want  to  slap  you  if  you 
 use  that  cheese  bro  you  know  which  one 
 i'm  talking  about  the  [ __ ]  square
[10:52] plastic  that  mcdonald's  uses  that  like 
 why  do  we  have  that  in  our  kitchen  bro  i 
 saw  my  dad  like  pull  it  out  the  kitchen
[10:58] and  he  was  like  looking  at  it  he  was 
 like  gonna  use  it  for  a  sandwich  i  was 
 like 
 stop 
 get  some  mature  cheddar
[11:07] so  that  is  a  meal  that  i  have  every 
 single  day  it's  helping  me  bulk  and  once 
 you've  been  doing  that  for  a  couple  of
[11:12] weeks  you  can  then  start  to  have  another 
 good  healthy  meal  on  top  of  that  this  is 
 how  you  structure  your  diet  skate  if
[11:17] you've  been  trying  to  reform  your  diets 
 all  in  one  day  and  you  failed  in  the 
 next  three  days  you  know  why  because 
 you're  supposed  to  do  it  one  meal  at  a
[11:23] time  change  one  meal  this  month  next 
 meal  to  change  the  second  meal  third 
 meal  and  eventually  after  like  four 
 months  you're  literally  that  guy  who's
[11:29] eaten  just  healthy  meals  in  the  entire 
 day  you  have  to  start  with  just  one  meal 
 make  that  consistent  make  it  the  same
[11:34] meal  just  roast  your  vegetables  bro

[00:06] out  there  and  builds  himself  up  as  a  man 
 to  acquire  these  things  or  do  you  think 
 jeffrey's  like  most  modern  young  men
[00:12] who'll  take  the  easy  path  porn  and  video 
 games  it's  no  wonder  why  jeffrey  feels 
 so  empty  so  unfulfilled  and  uncertain
[00:19] with  himself  why  he  has  no  confidence 
 just  look  at  his  habits  worst  of  all  he 
 isn't  even  aware  of  his  weaknesses
[00:26] adonis 
 adonis  wants  love  sex  and  intimacy  he
[00:31] wants  status  and  achievement  and 
 brotherhood  but  adonis  is  different  to 
 jeffrey  because  he  is  the  kind  of  man
[00:36] who  goes  out  there  and  acquires  these 
 things  in  the  real  world  we  see  adonis 
 hunt  we  see  him  train  we  see  him  feast
[00:43] he  works  hard  especially  when  he  doesn't 
 feel  like  it  and  that  is  exactly  why 
 adonis  has  built  up  such  a  good  life
[00:50] aren't  you  tired  of  living  life  like 
 jeffrey  you  see  you  have  this  huge 
 weakness  inside  of  you  you  have  the
[00:55] desire  of  these  healthy  needs  like  to  be 
 socially  included  amongst  your  peers  to 
 level  up  in  your  tribe  to  get  a
[01:01] girlfriend  experience  love  but  the 
 modern  world  is  riddled  with  traps  and
[01:06] the  biggest  issue  is  that  the  modern 
 world  will  serve  you  a  fake  version  of 
 the  thing  that  you  actually  wanted  you
[01:11] wanted  love  they'll  give  you  porn  you 
 wanted  brotherhood  they'll  give  you  call
[01:16] of  duty  or  whatever  [ __ ]  video  games 
 people  play  these  days  and  most  young 
 men  are  totally  content  living  like  this
[01:21] they  have  their  needs  fulfilled  in  the 
 modern  day  they  jack  off  multiple  times 
 they  wake  up  jack  off  before  they  go  to
[01:26] school  or  to  work  sometimes  some  of 
 these  creepy  [ __ ]  start  jacking 
 off  inside  of  school  and  work  in  class
[01:32] how  [ __ ]  is  that  like  i've  just 
 thought  about  my  time  in  high  school  it 
 was  totally  normal  for  all  of  the  boys
[01:38] to  watch  porn  and  jackoff  and  worst  of 
 all  we  were  told  by  like  the  elders  like
[01:43] the  teachers  and  this  common  narrative 
 like  this  weak  little  jeffrey  modern 
 media  narrative  that  porn  and
[01:48] masturbation  is  good  for  you  why  were  we 
 told  that  masturbating  would  be  good  for 
 us  you've  been  raised  all  of  your  life
[01:54] to  be  weak  chances  are  you  haven't  had  a 
 strong  father  figure  who's  made  you  more 
 masculine  who  put  you  through  trials  and
[01:59] tribulations  you  haven't  had  a  right  of 
 passage  that's  actually  made  you  into  a 
 man  you're  a  soft  little  boy  in  between
[02:05] the  stage  of  actual  boyhood  and  manhood 
 so  what  are  you
[02:10] we're  weak  but  we  don't  want  to  be 
 anymore  you  watch  videos  like  this  you 
 know  you  are  tears  above  like  we're  not
[02:16] supposed  to  say  this  thing  we're 
 supposed  to  compare  against  others  but 
 you  kind  of  know  your  tears  ahead  of
[02:21] everyone  else  who's  content  living  their 
 life  like  a  jeffree  but  if  you  don't 
 stay  consistent  on  self-improvement
[02:27] self-improvement  is  when  you  start  to  do 
 those  good  habits  that  you  always  hear 
 about  like  going  to  the  gym  consistently
[02:32] or  reading  good  books  or  meditating  and 
 journaling  or  being  productive  and  doing 
 your  schoolwork  or  your  business  work  or
[02:37] leveling  up  in  a  career  holistic 
 self-improvement  is  when  you  do  all  of 
 those  things  to  try  and  become  more  like
[02:42] adonis  the  ultimate  man  if  you  take  this 
 pathway  and  you  overcome  this  weakness 
 that  inflicts  most  young  men  the  future
[02:48] for  you  is  very  very  bright  you'll  stand 
 out  you'll  become  strong  you'll  become 
 successful  you'll  be  strong  and
[02:53] confident  attracting  more  women  than 
 ever  you'll  go  through  your  20s  with  a 
 sense  of  pride  that  you're  actually
[02:58] doing  the  right  things  whilst  you  see 
 everyone  else  playing  video  games 
 jacking  off  scrolling  on  social  media
[03:03] endlessly  just  looking  at  girls  it'll  be 
 slow  at  first  but  soon  you  will  realize
[03:08] that  there's  quite  a  big  gap  between  you 
 and  the  jefferies  of  the  world  you're 
 feeling  good  productive  successful  life
[03:13] is  going  so  well  and  the  ultimate  vision 
 of  this  why  are  we  doing  all  of  this 
 hard  work  because  there's  gonna  be  a
[03:18] time  when  you  have  children  and  to  be 
 the  kind  of  father  that  you  want  to  be 
 to  be  the  kind  of  father  that  your  child
[03:24] your  son  your  daughter  needs  you're 
 gonna  need  to  do  these  things  you  will 
 not  allow  yourself  to  be  another  sad
[03:29] pathetic  low  value  father  an  absent 
 father  an  abusive  father  this  is  why  now
[03:35] whilst  we're  young  we  focus  on  things 
 like  mental  health  so  that  when  we 
 eventually  have  children  we  won't  pass 
 on  like  family  traumas  to  them  we  won't
[03:41] abuse  them  we  won't  shower  them  we  won't 
 scream  at  them  this  is  why  we  start 
 being  productive  now  so  that  our 
 finances  can  be  set  up  your  future  son
[03:48] is  hoping  that  you  give  up  this  weakness 
 the  weakness  is  over  indulging  in  the 
 modern  technological  version  of  the
[03:53] thing  that  fulfills  our  need  porn  over 
 love  video  games  over  brotherhood  it's  a
[03:58] very  good  life  when  you  go  down  this 
 path  but  what  if  you  don't 
 what  if  you're  watching  this  video  right
[04:03] now  and  you're  uncertain  about  getting 
 into  self-improvement  and  you're  fine 
 skipping  a  few  days  from  the  gym  because
[04:08] it  doesn't  really  matter  and 
 meditation's  kind  of  too  weird  it 
 doesn't  work  for  me  and  journaling  is 
 kind  of  gay  i  don't  want  to  write  in  a
[04:14] diary 
 what  if  you  refuse  to  do  the  good  habits
[04:20] i  could  make  this  like  a  nice  soft  video 
 that  you're  used  to  where  it's  like  oh 
 you  know  everyone's  perfect  bro  [ __ ] 
 that  if  you  refuse  to  do  the  good  habits
[04:26] if  you  over  indulge  in  the  bad  if  you 
 continue  playing  video  games  taking 
 drugs  eating  junk  food  scrolling  on 
 social  media  just  looking  at  underage
[04:32] girls  shaking  ass  on  tick  tock  instagram 
 you  will  end  up  just  like  these  jeffries
[04:38] you'll  become  one  of  those  like  weak 
 empty  shallow  flabby  like  hairy  stomach 
 kind  of  men  and  you'll  pass  that  on  to
[04:44] your  children 
 maybe  your  son  will  be  the  one  who 
 changes  it  then  maybe  your  son  will  grow
[04:49] up  and  say  you  know  what  i  don't  want  to 
 end  up  like  my  father  hopefully  he  won't 
 say  that  hopefully  you  are  the  one  who
[04:55] changes  things  for  your  bloodline  what 
 you  see  before  you  is  not  a  usual 
 youtube  channel  everyone  else  is  way  too
[05:01] [ __ ]  soft  on  men  telling  them  that 
 it's  okay  to  be  weak  it's  okay  to  be 
 feminine  it's  okay  to  like  display 
 emotions  and  be  a little  [ __ ]  is  it
[05:07] [ __ ]  what  you  see  in  front  of  you  is  a 
 cult  you  know  like  those  cults  that 
 you've  heard  about  which  they're  all 
 they're  weird  and  they're  they're
[05:12] strange  they're  doing  things  which  is 
 uncommon  and  controversial
[05:17] that's  what  you  see  in  front  of  you  you 
 see  a  cult  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
 young  men  who  refuse  to  live  like  the  99
[05:23] percenters  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
 young  men  who  refuse  to  jack  off  six 
 times  a  day  castrating  ourselves
[05:31] what  you  see  is  a  cult  of  men  who  hope 
 for  better

 to  4chan  to  find  his  special  videos  he 
 doesn't  realize  how  much  better  off  he'd
[00:11] be  if  he  got  onto  nofa  but  some  men  just 
 like  Jeffrey  don't  want  to  improve  let 
 me  walk  you  through  my  unfiltered
[00:17] jackathons  I'd  wake  up  late  on  the 
 weekends  and  immediately  grab  my  phone  I 
 start  scrolling  through  Reddit  with
[00:22] morning  breath  and  I'd  go  through  the 
 memes  and  political  posts  the  funny 
 videos  and  the  interesting  articles  and 
 oh  look  I'm  not  safe  for  work  post  Don't

[00:34] going  in  I  go  on  the  subreddit  post 
 after  post  I'm  dry  humping  my  bed  sheets 
 at  this  point  someone's  linked  this  porn
[00:40] star's  own  subreddit  I'm  going  deeper 
 into  the  rabbit  hole  first  nut  of  the 
 day  conquered  within  20  minutes  a  week
[00:45] in  I  [ __ ]  around  for  a  while scrolling 
 on  Reddit  playing  summoner's  war  on  my 
 phone  looking  at  gym  girls  glute
[00:50] workouts  on  Instagram  time  for  round  two 
 straight  on  to  Pornhub  remember  that
[00:55] Latina  made  video  with  a  guy  just  keeps 
 handing  her  money  to  undress  yeah  let  me 
 spend  30  minutes  trying  to  find  that  one
[01:00] particular  video  and  it  ended  up  being 
 in  360p  still  like  the  second  nut  of  the
[01:05] day  and  of  course  the  third  nut  comes  at 
 night  time  following  Jeffrey's  nighttime 
 routine  I  can't  sleep  without  fapping
[01:10] What  a  Sad  life  Adonis 
 Adonis  looks  around  in  shame  at  the  men
[01:15] of  today  he  sees  fat  lazy  undisciplined 
 unambitious  weak  men  who  over  indulge  in
[01:21] instant  gratification  he's  let  down  but 
 there  is  hope  Adonis  notices  a  small
[01:26] group  of  men  growing  larger  and  larger 
 this  group  of  men  say  [ __ ]  you  to  the 
 researcher  when  they're  offered  the
[01:31] first  marshmallow  in  the  experiments  and 
 even  the  second  marshmallow  we  don't 
 want  that  sugary  [ __ ]  we're  fasting
[01:37] we're  on  a  dopamine  detox  we  do  nofap 
 and  we  meditate  and  we  read  and  we 
 Journal  at  honest  Smiles  he's  impressed
[01:43] I've  jacked  off  twice  in  the  last  18 
 months  I  walk  around  and  I  look  at  some 
 guys  and  I  know  for  a  fact  that  some  of
[01:49] these  men  have  jacked  off  twice  this 
 morning  so  like  the  majority  of 
 teenagers  obviously  I  was  busting  a  lot 
 of  nuts  and  I  get  to  about  age  17  or  18
[01:56] and  a  lot  of  people  are  talking  about  no 
 fat  It's  Gonna  Make  You  levitate  and  you 
 can  hold  eye  contact  with  girls  and  you 
 really  want  to  hold  eye  contact  then
[02:01] girls  will  know  woman  attraction  and 
 [ __ ]  and  obviously  I'm  not  okay  that 
 sounds  sick  bro  let's  go  and  of  course  I
[02:06] get  to  like  day  one  or  two  and  I  relapse 
 and  I  go  again  I'm  okay  come  on  day  19 
 got  to  do  a  19  day  recycle  I  got  to  day
[02:11] three  okay  90  day  reset  okay  to  like  day 
 one  just  kept  on  resetting  kept  on 
 relapsing  kept  on  relapsing  I  remember
[02:16] that  I  would  always  relapse  because  I 
 never  really  changed  the  habit  of  when  I 
 would  fat  so  I'd  wake  up  and  I'd  be  on
[02:22] no  fat  but  I'd  just  scroll  on  Reddit  as 
 always  and  it's  almost  like  I  knew  what 
 I  was  searching  for  I  knew  what  I  was
[02:27] scrolling  for  hoping  to  see  but  I  didn't 
 want  to  like  consciously  admit  it  and 
 you'd  keep  scrolling  you  know  just  her
[02:32] I'm  just  looking  at  memes  I'm  just  oh 
 ass  I  mean  you  can  click  and  oh  look  and 
 I  would  like  just  pretty  much  try 
 humping  the  bed  sheets  and  [ __ ]  and  you
[02:37] know  like  essentially  acting  like  I'm 
 not  doing  the  thing  that  I'm  doing 
 because  I  didn't  have  like  the 
 accountability  for  it  and  so  I  failed  a
[02:43] bunch  of  times  like  I  literally  failed 
 for  a  while  on  nofap  but  I  started 
 making  some  changes  I  never  quit  I  knew
[02:49] for  a  fact  that  this  was  the  way  forward 
 and  it  literally  would  take  me  years  to 
 make  good  progress  on  nofap  and  that's
[02:55] one  of  the things  that  we're  going  to 
 discuss  later  in  this  video  but  that's 
 one  of  the  things  that  these  YouTubers 
 don't  tell  you  about  they  don't  give  you 
 like  realistic  expectations  they  sell
[03:01] you  this  [ __ ]  dream  of  like  the  nofap 
 benefits  timeline  but  they  don't  tell 
 you  that  to  be  good  on  nofap  takes  years
[03:06] and  so  I'm  gonna  give  you  like  a  mindset 
 lesson  later  on  So  eventually  I  started 
 getting  into  double  digit  IQ  and  I
[03:11] delete  Reddit  all  right  like  I  blocked 
 the  not  safe  for  work  posts  on  Reddit 
 until  now  I  can't  see  and  it's  like  one
[03:16] more  barrier  but  then  obviously  I  go 
 onto  Instagram  and  start  like  going 
 through  like  the  Instagram  models  when 
 you  click  on  a  model's  profile  you  like
[03:21] jack  off  to  the  pictures  for  a  bit  and 
 scroll  back  up  and  then  click  on  the 
 suggested  models  profile  and  you  ended 
 up  looking  at  some  like  Serbian  woman
[03:27] who's  posting  slightly  pictures  of 
 herself  because  her  family's  hungry  it's 
 kind  of  a  dark  road  to  go  down  bro  I'm 
 so  glad  that  I'm  not  a  [ __ ]  wanker
[03:33] anymore  like  some  a  big  Improvement  for 
 me  came  when  I  started  going  out  to
[03:38] nightclubs  and  parties  around  age  18  to 
 19.  I'm  actively  going  out  I'm  actively 
 like  kissing  girls  in  clubs  and
[03:43] everything  and  it  was  just  a  nice 
 mindset  switch  where  I  was  like  okay  I 
 can  be  the  little  loser  who  like  touches 
 himself  at  home  and  like  you  know
[03:49] busting  that  home  or  I  can  literally 
 just  save  up  for  the  girls  that  I  go  and 
 meet  outside  and  I  was  like  that  just
[03:54] got  me  like  way  more  motivated  for  it  I 
 got  into  this  idea  of  okay  I  want  to 
 have  like  a  full-on  like  massive  load
[03:59] bro  massive  load  when  I  like  bust  with  a 
 girl  that's  why  I  just  stopped  touching 
 myself  like  at  all  obviously  every  now
[04:04] and  then  every  few  days  I'll  still  be 
 doing  it  but  at  least  it  helps  push  me 
 in  the  right  direction  through  uni  it 
 was  pretty  much  the  same  thing  that  when
[04:09] I  was  actively  sleeping  with  girls  I 
 would  purposely  like  get  onto  nofap 
 absolutely  no  problem  and  so  this  was
[04:14] the  first  time  after  about  three  years 
 of  being  on  nofap  that  I  could  literally 
 get  weeks  at  a  time  no  problem  and  I
[04:21] wouldn't  like  actually  fap  of  course  I 
 could  not  have  sex  in  the  middle  and 
 everything  and  it  was  pretty  much  the 
 same  thing  for  a  long  time  whilst  I  was
[04:26] in  university  I  was  hooking  up  with  a 
 girl  like  every  few  weeks  or  so  so  I  was 
 just  kind  of  like  saving  my  nut  for  that
[04:31] and  I  remember  eventually  it  got  to  the 
 point  when  the  amount  of  girls  that  I 
 was  attracting  decreased  quite  a  lot
[04:36] because  I  gained  like  a  lot  of  weight 
 got  like  depression  and  anxiety  and  like 
 you  know  I  was  going  through  some  like 
 bad  started  going  out  less  and
[04:41] everything  and  so  of  course  I  almost 
 automatically  started  fapping  more  it's 
 like  a  very  interesting  like  linear
[04:46] correlation  with  that  interestingly  like 
 I  was  jacking  off  a  lot  when  I  was  like 
 living  with  a  girl  who  I  was  like
[04:51] sleeping  with  and  like  dating  and 
 everything  as  well  bro  when  you've  got 
 mental  health  problems  just  know  like 
 you're  a  wanker  like  you  are  100  gonna
[04:56] fat  more  it's  just  how  it  works  it's 
 very  interesting  like  even  if  you've  got 
 a  woman  to  sleep  with  in  literally  in
[05:01] the  same  room  or  the  next  room  to  you 
 you're  just  gonna  end  up  being  way  more 
 drawn  to  the  validation  and  the  intimacy
[05:06] the  fake  virtual  pixel  intimacy  that 
 porn  gives  you  because  you  can  get  an 
 unlimited  amount  of  like  variance  and
[05:12] it's  like  each  woman  you  watch  who's  you 
 know  undressing  and  looking  at  the 
 camera  who's  getting  pounded  and
[05:17] everything  and  you  visualize  yourself 
 pounding  her  that  feels  like  it  fills 
 the  gap  of  like  the  lack  of  love  that
[05:22] you  didn't  get  from  your  parents  or 
 whatever  your  trauma  is  wrong  we  went 
 kind  of  deep  there  but  it  is  the  truth 
 100  like  you  you  jack  off  because  you've
[05:28] got  some  mental  health  problems  100  is 
 the  truth  boys  eventually  I  move  out  of 
 the  city  that  you  know  I've  been  in  for
[05:33] the  last  few  years  for  University  I 
 moved  back  home  to  my  parents  house  I'm 
 on  full-on  dopamine  detox  monkey  mode 
 style  [ __ ]  I've  literally  did  not  touch
[05:39] my  dick  for  like  six  months  straight  I 
 started  sleeping  with  a  girl  and  I  buy 
 some  condoms  and  I  wanted  to  like  fully
[05:45] like  get  into  using  condoms  I  don't  know 
 some  people  say  it's  a  cult  honestly 
 like  because  I  had  been  on  nofap  six 
 months  straight  like  I  did  not  bust  for
[05:51] six  months  I  feel  like  I  had  the 
 conscious  like  strength  not  to  but  I  it 
 was  like  a  conscious  decision  too  fap
[05:56] that  day  with  a  condom  on  to  make  sure 
 it  was  a  completely  perfect  and  people 
 can  say  it's  a  quote  but  I  personally 
 don't  think  it  is  because  then  I  lasted
[06:02] about  another  six  months  without  fapping 
 so  I  don't  think  it  was  like  out  of 
 weakness  or  discipline  or  whatever  the
[06:07] condoms  it  was  actually  [ __ ]  sick 
 doing  this  and  it's  a  practice  I 
 recommend  kind  of  side  note  but  if 
 you're  gonna  start  [ __ ]  you've  never 
 been  given  sex  education  slow  that's
[06:14] weird  isn't  it  you've  never  been  given 
 sex  education  from  a  [ __ ]  you've  been 
 given  sex  education  from  like  the  60
[06:19] year  old  woman  who  comes  into  your 
 school  she's  had  sex  like  three  times  or 
 once  in  the  last  year  when  her  husband's
[06:24] behaved  and  done  all  of  his  chores  like 
 a  [ __ ]  mule  she  gives  like  Duty  sex 
 to  her  husband  once  a  year  or  something 
 for  his  birthday  you  need  to  be  given
[06:30] sex  education  from  like  an  actual  person 
 who  and  one  of  the  things  that  I  was 
 never  taught  in  school  in  the  sex
[06:35] education  class  or  even  like  read  it  or 
 anything  is  how  to  actually  find  the 
 right  condom  size  and  once  you  do  it's
[06:40] like  all  of  the  excuses  you  have  to  use 
 one  go  away  you  should  happily  use  one 
 the  reason  why  we  as  guys  don't  is 
 because  it's  just  kind  of  like  you  know
[06:45] it's  a  boner  kill  and  it's 
 psychologically  it's  just  kind  of  you 
 know  the  packaging  stick  it  on  and  stuff
[06:50] and  two  it's  like  a  physical  thing  of 
 like  it  doesn't  feel  as  good  when  you 
 find  your  right  size  both  of  those 
 problems  get  reversed  you  become  the  guy
[06:56] who's  like  it's  completely  vast  and 
 normal  for  you  to  put  one  on  fully 
 changes  your  mental  state  when  you're 
 actually  having  casual  sex  with  girls
[07:02] because  you  don't  feel  like  you're  at 
 risk  anymore  kind  of  off  track  if  you 
 want  to  find  out  your  condom  size 
 literally  just  like  Google  it  it's  like
[07:07] this  guides  and  everything  how  to  find 
 out  my  condom  size  you'll  find  out  like 
 the  nominal  Within  by  the  right  size  my 
 size  is  60  mm  in  the  nominal  with  so  you
[07:14] can  like  go  online  and  see  what  that  is 
 it's  too  big  for  some 
 that  sounded  way  way  more  gay  than  it
[07:20] had  to  be  should  I  do  I  have to  explain 
 oh  I'm  60  mm  boys  you'll  find  it  in  the
[07:25] extra  large  Department 
 so  I  tried  it  on  that  time  and  I  was
[07:30] like  fully  think  okay  I'm  gonna  bust  to 
 like  you  know  make  sure  it  feels  okay 
 and  it  did  it's  fine  then  I  literally 
 went  about  another  sort  of  like  six
[07:35] months  not  like  plan  myth  to  be  six 
 months  it  just  kind  of  happened  in  the 
 sense  that  I  then  had  phone  sex  with  a 
 girl  that  I  was  dating  so  we  were  fully
[07:41] like  in  a  relationship  and  everything 
 and  so  it  was  like  she  was  we  had 
 distance  between  us  while  she  was  on 
 like  a  trip  or  something  so  it's  like
[07:46] that  to  me  it's  like  you  can  see  it  as 
 like  fapping  but  it's  like  I  don't  feel 
 bad  about  those  moments  at  all  so  it's
[07:51] two  times  in  the  last  18  months  but  it 
 felt  like  it  was  under  my  control  in 
 this  sense  imagine  there's  two  men  in  a
[07:56] cage  and  there's  a  nice  juicy  steak 
 which  guy's  gonna  fight  harder  for  it 
 the  one  who's  full  on  McDonald's  the  guy
[08:02] who's  been  saving  up  that  hunger  the  guy 
 who's  fasting  of  course  the  guy's 
 fasting  if  you've  ever  fasted  before  if
[08:07] you've  done  intermittent  fasting  or 
 you've  done  like  if  it's  badass  if 
 you've  done  like  a  whole  day  water  fast 
 even  though  you  know  we  know  grilling
[08:12] works  you  get  less  hungry  and  everything 
 but  it's  like  it's  weird  you  turn  into 
 like  almost  Primal  in  a  sense  and  you
[08:18] like  it's  like  your  scent  your  ability 
 to  smell  and  salivate  literally  goes  up
[08:23] I  don't  know  about  anyone  else  but  when 
 I'm  smelling  so  I'm  like  paying  food 
 when  I'm  fasting  I  almost  envisioned 
 like  very  slightly  like  fighting  that
[08:29] person  for  that  food  like  it's  a  very 
 primal  thing  when  you  fasted  what  about 
 if  you  fast  from  ejaculation  from  porn
[08:34] from  sex  it's  the  exact  same  thing  if  as 
 men  we  do  most  if  not  all  of  our  actions
[08:39] to  reproduce  to  have  sex  right  a  lot  of 
 guys  oh  no  I  weight  lift  I  lift  weights
[08:44] for  me  Shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  okay  just 
 you're  a  dumbass  you  don't  even  like 
 have  the  level  of  awareness  to  know  that 
 you  have  like  subconscious  motivations
[08:50] of  course  you  you  dumbass  we  do  things 
 to  have  sex  to  reproduce  to  spread  our 
 seed  100  we  do  maybe  not  at  all  things
[08:56] but  it's  like  in  a  weird  way  me  making 
 this  nofap  video  right  now  is  still 
 somewhat  for  the  purpose  of  reproduction
[09:02] because  this  will  get  uploaded  to  my 
 YouTube  channel  the  YouTube  channel  will 
 grow  I'll  make  more  money  I'll  get  more 
 successful  I'll  be  able  to  attract  a
[09:07] meat  to  spread  my  seed  to  everything  we 
 do  is  somehow  linked  to  that  what  if 
 you've  simply  just  cut  off  the  last
[09:13] points  the  biggest  motivation  for  man 
 what  if  you  curse  it  off  because  when 
 you  jack  off  and  you  watch  porn  you  take
[09:19] that  huge  motivation  a  huge  drive  away 
 from  yourself  There's  an  actual  sexual 
 transmutation  which  it's  like  you  know
[09:25] it's  a  very  like  big  word  and  it's  like 
 defined  really  the  simple  thing  is  that 
 when  we  have  Sexual  Energy  we  use  it  if
[09:32] we  don't  have  someone  to  have  sex  with 
 right  now  when  we  feel  horny  if  you're 
 doing  the  right  things  it's  like  you
[09:37] start  to  work  on  the  things  that  would 
 eventually  get  you  that  person  to  have 
 sex  with  the  issue  with  fapping  and 
 having  sex  especially  casual  sex  is  that
[09:44] you  cut  off  that  ability  to  work  for 
 anything  you  don't  need  to  you've 
 already  achieved  the  height  of  like  male
[09:49] life  once  we've  achieved  this  pursuit  of 
 ejaculating  and  spreading  our  seed  it's 
 like  we  get  comfy  this  is  like  why  so
[09:54] many  guys  will  jack  off  last  thing  in 
 the  night  because  it  literally  makes  you 
 feel  lazy  it's  like  you  feel
[09:59] accomplished  it's  like  this  idea  of  like 
 yeah  like  I've  already  done  my  job  I 
 don't  need  to  like  do  anymore  I'm  tired
[10:04] I'm  fatigued  I'm  lethargic  you  get 
 depleted  you  get  drained  imagine  a  bull 
 like  the  bull  [ __ ]  what  happens  after
[10:09] it  gets  castrated  it  turns  into  like  a 
 docile  weak  pushover  you're  castrating
[10:14] yourself  it's  the  exact  same  thing  like 
 when  an  animal  gets  castrated  think 
 about  any  animal  right  now  any  pets  or
[10:19] anything  when  it  gets  castrated  its 
 balls  gets  chopped  off  it  stops  his 
 production  of  testosterone  it  stops  his
[10:24] ability  to  have  sex  and  to  reproduce  it 
 turns  into  like  a  dog  style  animal  it 
 turns  into  just  a  weak  pushover  feminine
[10:31] version  of  what  it  was  that's  what 
 you're  doing  to  yourself  you  are 
 castrating  yourself  if  you  have
[10:36] potential  which  you  hopefully  do  if 
 you're  watching  my  videos  but  most  men 
 do  have  potential  that's  the  thing  even
[10:41] if  you're  like  an  average  Chef  for  the 
 thing  is  most  men  have  potential  the 
 issue  is  that  most  men  don't  put  in  the 
 work  to  achieve  that  potential  because
[10:47] you  don't  need  to  because  our  potential 
 is  supposed  to  be  used  to  eventually 
 attract  the  mates  that  we  can  sleep  with
[10:52] that  we  can  reproduce  with  but  what  if 
 you  fooled  your  mind  and  your  body  to 
 already  think  that  you've  been
[10:57] reproducing  like  every  day  three  times  a 
 day  since  you're  like  13  years  old  and 
 the  way  that  it  seems  to  mess  up  your
[11:02] mind  with  the  dopamine  receptors  I  don't 
 know  I  don't  know  the  science  [ __ ]  okay 
 I'll  tell  you  the  truth  but  the  way  that 
 I  understand  it  is  that  we  have  only  a
[11:08] limited  amount  of  energy  and  sort  of 
 like  feel  good  hormone  in  us  we  want  to
[11:14] get  that  feel-good  hormone  from 
 something  productive  from  doing  our  work 
 when  you  hyper  trigger  this  feel-good
[11:20] home  or  this  dopamine  hormone  there's 
 like  less  of  it  available  to  motivate 
 you  to  then  do  that  hard  work  it's  the
[11:26] simple  concept  of  like  doing  a  bunch  of 
 easy  stuff  makes  the  hard  stuff  harder 
 even  though  it  stayed  exactly  the  same
[11:32] the  first  workout  after  a  long  time  off 
 always  feels  harder  than  like  the  70th
[11:37] workout  when  you've  been  going 
 consistently  you're  just  in  the  flow  of 
 things  it  doesn't  feel  exactly  hard 
 anymore  and  I'm  not  gonna  lie  fapid
[11:42] watching  porn  it  fully  gives  you  like 
 the  personality  of  a  loser  like  you 
 literally  feel  like  a  loser  like  there
[11:47] was  this  Dynamic  that  I  would  always 
 experience  when  I  used  to  go  out  to 
 nightclubs  and  parties  and  obviously
[11:52] everyone's  lying  if  they  say  that  the 
 ghost  of  those  places  to  not  [ __ ]  right 
 100  Bro  [ __ ]  you  right  [ __ ]  the  people
[11:58] who  lie  about this  if  you're  going  to 
 like  clubs  as  a  guy  bro  you're  trying  to 
 you  want  to  hook  up  with  a  girl  that 
 night  I'm  just  going  for  the  shutdown
[12:03] bro  just  go  for  the  music  go  for  the  DJ 
 like  that's  what  girls  say  bro  I'm  not 
 like  the  other  girls  I  dress  up  for
[12:09] myself  in  my  phone  shut  up  Eve  so  I'd  go 
 out  to  the  club  obviously  hoping  to  hook
[12:14] up  with  a  girl  that  day  you  know  I've 
 flirt  with  some  girls  oftentimes  I  would 
 make  up  with  them  and  everything  but 
 sometimes  like  a  fair  amount  of  times
[12:19] maybe  50  maybe  even  more  you  go  to  the 
 club  and  you  wouldn't  come  back  with  a 
 girl  you're  horny  it's  3am  you  really
[12:24] really  wanted  to  like  have  sex  tonight 
 you  remember  speaking  to  a  bunch  of 
 girls  you  you  had  the  sense  of 
 uncomfortability  when  you  saw  that  a
[12:30] girl  that  you  had  spoken  to  was  like 
 leaving  the  club  with  a  guy  so  what  do 
 you  do  now  well  of  course  you  know  the 
 last  call  on  Tinder  maybe  it's  3am  4am
[12:36] you  know  see  if  any  girls  are  active  on 
 there  and  maybe  message  a  few  girls  on 
 Instagram  depending  on  how  desperate  you
[12:41] are  but  eventually  you  end  up  checking 
 off  and  the  exact  same  Dynamic  happens 
 to  a  guy  who  for  example  like  you  know 
 sees  a  pretty  girl  on  Instagram  he
[12:46] messages  her  she  doesn't  reply  and  he 
 ends  up  like  jacking  off  to  her  pictures 
 I  think  about  what  that's  sending  in
[12:51] your  mind  like  oh  if  she  doesn't  want  me 
 I'll  just  myself  to  her  pictures  it  like
[12:56] fully  just  think  like  picture  this  in 
 your  mind  of  like  you  know  all  the  guys 
 have  been  out  tonight  to  try  and  get  a
[13:01] girl  some  of  the  guys  pull  you  know  some 
 like  tall  chats  or  whatever  they  end  up 
 taking  a  girl  home  and  it's  all  these
[13:06] like  little  loser  guys  who  come  home 
 dark  in  crusty  room  and  they  like  touch 
 themselves  instead  because  they  didn't
[13:11] get  managed  to  like  get  the  success 
 tonight  do  you  want  your  personality  to 
 get  closer  to  those  type  of  guys  because
[13:17] I'm  not  gonna  lie  bro  that's  some 
 [ __ ]  that's  cringe  like  beta  male 
 type  of  [ __ ]  and  I  know  some  people
[13:23] really  hate  the  phrase  beta  male  and 
 they're  like  oh  I'm  saying  bml's  cringe 
 you're  not  allowed  to  say  that  bro  I
[13:28] don't  give  a  [ __ ]  me  like  if  there's  a 
 beta  male  action  it's  masturbation  of 
 course  it  is  if  there's  one  thing  that
[13:34] fully  defines  the  beta  and  the  alpha  is 
 that  the  alpha  sleeps  with  the  girl  and 
 the  beta  jacks  off  whilst  watching  them
[13:39] through  like  the  little  people  just 
 watching  porn  and  jacking  off  bro  it's 
 [ __ ]  cringe  you're  literally  watching 
 a  video  of  the  woman  that  you  once  get
[13:46] [ __ ]  by  someone  else  I  wish  that  was 
 me  what  the  [ __ ]  is  like  exactly  the 
 same  as  watching  sports  you're  just  at
[13:52] the  displacing  yourself  visualizing  that 
 yourself  like  imagining  and  hoping  that 
 you  wear  this  other  guy  on  screen  stop
[13:58] displacing  yourself  stop  trying  to 
 imagine  I  wish  that  was  me  stop  trying 
 to  imagine  that  you're  the  guy  who's
[14:03] winning  putting  the  work  and  start 
 winning  yourself  what  a  disgusting  way 
 that  some  guys  are  living  life  in  the
[14:08] fingers  if  you're  watching  this  video 
 I'm  kind  of  ranting  against  you  but  the 
 chances  are  you  probably  already  know 
 about  nofap  and  stuff  I  just  had  a  bit
[14:14] of  a  rant  in  my  mind  I  was  sat  in  like  a 
 coffee  shop  and  I  was  literally  just 
 like  watching  people  go  by  and  it  was 
 quite  a  weird  time  because  I'm  a
[14:20] YouTuber  I  can  work  whenever  I  want  so 
 it  was  like  11  A.M  on  a  weekday  all  the
[14:25] young  people  of  course  are  like  in 
 University  in  schools  and  whatever  so  we 
 didn't  really  see  many  young  people  and
[14:30] there  was  just  like  older  people  40  50 
 60  70  whatever  of  you  know  age  people 
 going  past  and  I  was  literally  looking
[14:35] at  every  single  guy  and  I  was  thinking 
 like  100  of  these  guys  jack  off  100 
 there  was  one  attractive  guy  who  went
[14:41] past  and  you  know  what  I  guarantee  that 
 he  jacks  off  too  that's  this  is  what's 
 very  interesting  if  you  had  to  think
[14:46] what  type  of  guy  jacks  off  you  of  course 
 we  would  say  you  know  the  losers  the 
 betas  and  stuff  what's  very  very 
 interesting  you  might  see  this  is  that
[14:52] even  the  attractive  Chad  looking  type  of 
 guys  even  they  do  as  well  it's  very 
 interesting  isn't  it  even  the  type  of
[14:58] guys  who  for  example  would  have  a 
 girlfriend  even  the  type  of  guys  who  for 
 example  go  out  and  still  like  you  know 
 they  hook  up  with  girls  it's  like  a
[15:04] plague  that's  infested  all  types  of  men 
 apart  from  those  men  who  have  found 
 nofap  and  who  have  gotten  into  this
[15:09] culture  but  there  is  a  huge  huge  issue 
 with  being  in  this  like  community  of
[15:14] nofap  and  if  you're  watching  this  video 
 you're  probably  suffering  from  that  I 
 want  to  give  you  advice  on  nofap  because
[15:19] I'm  not  gonna  lie  like  when  I  see  these 
 videos  online  I'm  like  yo  these 
 YouTubers  don't  know  what  the  [ __ ] 
 they're  talking  about  they're  giving  you
[15:24] some  trash  advice  I  don't  think  these 
 YouTubers  practice  what  they  preach 
 whatsoever  when  I  I  look  at  nofap  advice 
 and  when  people  ask  me  advice  and
[15:29] they're  like  oh  but  this  guy's  video 
 says  this  I'm  like  what  the  f  people  are 
 coming  to  me  my  boys  are  coming  to  me 
 with  worse  mental  health  because  they
[15:35] got  onto  nofa  how  does  that  make  sense 
 because  you  got  onto  nofap  you  feel 
 worse  because  of  the  way  that  these  guys
[15:41] explain  it  online  the  nofaps  benefit 
 timeline  go  [ __ ]  yourself  there's  no 
 such  thing  as  a  notified  benefit  time
[15:46] like  that  date  96  or  the  day  13  I  [ __ ] 
 you  you  do  you  think  the  body  works  like 
 that  a  day  seven  and  a  half  you'll  get  a
[15:52] three  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  you'd  [ __ ] 
 dumb  I'm  tired  like  Rob  said  this  I've 
 raged  about  these  nofap  YouTubers  many
[15:58] times  because  they're  literally  giving 
 you  a  mental  illness  that  they  are  so 
 [ __ ]  toxic  with  this  idea  that  they
[16:03] do  it's  like  ah  I'm  on  day  7  000  and  if 
 you  relapse  then  you're  like  that's  what
[16:08] they  say  if  you  relapse  here's  all  these 
 benefits  here's  your  the  day  90  benefits 
 day  90  you'll  you'll  be  able  to  levitate
[16:14] but  if  you  relapse  you'll  lose 
 everything  think  about  how  disgusting 
 that  advice  is  if  you  relapse  you'll
[16:20] have  to  start  again  from  the  Nova 
 benefit  timeline  go  [ __ ]  yourself 
 imagine  how  deep  this  gets  into  the  mind 
 of  a  young  person  who's  watching  this
[16:26] imagine  saying  and  actually  she  making 
 an  obese  guy  believe  this  and  you  say 
 this  obese  fat  guy  use  okay  so  here's
[16:31] all  the  benefits  to  working  out  you'll 
 get  to  live  and  people  will  like  you  and 
 you  know  you'll  get  confidence  and  and
[16:36] your  heart  will  start  working  right  and 
 if  you  miss  a  workout  you  lose  all  of 
 these  benefits  imagine  saying  that  if
[16:42] you  go  one  day  without  working  out  you 
 lose  all  these  benefits  how  [ __ ]  does
[16:47] that  sound  that's  what  these  little 
 cringy  YouTubers  are  telling  you  these 
 nofap  YouTubers  every  single  one  that
[16:52] I've  seen  just  they  say  this  [ __ ]  to 
 you  that  if  you  relapse  you've  lost  all 
 the  benefits  it's  like  literally  it's
[16:57] like  saying  if  you  take  a  day  from  the 
 gym  you've  lost  all  of  the  gains  how 
 [ __ ]  stupid  is  that  and  it's  like
[17:02] it's  such  a  toxic  the  amount  of  young 
 guys  who  came  to  me  and  they  get  like 
 almost  in  tears  where  they're  like  I
[17:08] can't  get  to  day  90  it's  been  like  day 
 three  day  I  got  to  day  seven  and  like 
 they  start  getting  annoyed  I  got  to  day
[17:13] seven  and  I  relapsed  all  right  day  seven 
 is  an  accomplishment  so  you're  telling 
 me  in  the  last  eight  days  you  fap  once
[17:19] they're  like  yeah  how  many  times  did  you 
 use  the  fat  per  week  like  every  day 
 twice  a  day  do  you  not  see  like  the  huge
[17:24] [ __ ]  progress  that  you've  just  made 
 that  is  huge  progress  you  used  to  jack 
 off  every  single  day  let's  say  you  got
[17:29] to  day  three  and  you  relapse  right 
 [ __ ]  these  horrible  [ __ ] 
 will  tell  you  that  you  failed  and  you
[17:35] have  to  reset  your  progress  I  will  tell 
 you  any  good-hearted  person  will  tell 
 you  that  if  you've  got  to  day  three  and
[17:40] you've  relapse  on  day  three  that  means 
 that  over  three  days  you  [ __ ]  once 
 just  six  months  ago  over  three  days  you
[17:46] were  fapping  three  times  maybe  four 
 maybe  five  progress  you  have  to 
 understand  this  is  like  pawn  and
[17:52] masturbation  is  a  habit  that  you've  been 
 building  up  for  years  it  takes  months  if
[17:57] not  years  to  destroy  that  habit  it  took 
 me  five  years  to  destroy  it  for  a  solid 
 I  think  two  years  after  I  found  nofap  I
[18:04] could  barely  get  to  like  day  seven  it 
 was  only  when  I  stopped  counting  the 
 days  in  University  and  I  wasn't  sat
[18:09] there  like 
 etching  it  into  my  wall  with  a  knife  I'm 
 on  day  seven  I'm  so  close  to  the  nofap
[18:14] benefit  it's  time  like  [ __ ]  you  that's 
 when  it  started  getting  closer  and 
 closer  to  the  golden  point  of  no  fat
[18:19] that's  something  I've  mentioned  which  no 
 one  else  has  there  is  a  golden  point  of 
 no  fat  it's  the  ultimate  goal  to  get  to 
 the  golden  point  of  nofap  is  where  you
[18:26] forget  that  nofap  exists  it's  where  you 
 forget  the  porn  and  masturbation  is  like 
 even  a  thing  it's  like  every  now  and 
 then  when  I  see  the  word  nofap  and
[18:32] pulling  a  message  I'm  like  oh  yeah  like 
 that's  that's  the  thing  like  I 
 completely  forget  that  it's  like  a  thing 
 that  you  can  do  to  like  masturbate
[18:38] that's  the  best  case  scenario  the  issue 
 is  that  when  you  watch  all  these 
 YouTubers  you're  watching  this  video
[18:43] right  now  you  are  obsessed  with  this 
 you're  so  obsessed  that  you  can't  you're 
 literally  stopping  yourself  from  getting
[18:48] to  this  golden  Point  what  was  the 
 ultimate  goal  of  all  this  it  was  you 
 know  you  wanted  to  make  progress  you 
 wanted  to  get  the  nofap  benefits  right
[18:54] but  you  didn't  want  to  be  sat  there 
 constantly  overthinking  about  this  did 
 you  you  don't  want  to  be  sat  there 
 almost  feeling  like  a  full-time  job  in
[19:01] your  mind  like  don't  fap  today  I  wonder 
 when  the  next  time  I'm  gonna  relapse 
 don't  fap  today  don't  fap  today  or  when 
 I  wonder  when  I'm  gonna  see  a  trigger
[19:06] that  was  never  the  goal  we  wanted  to 
 almost  feel  immune  to  this  way  even  if 
 we  end  up  literally  being  faced  with
[19:11] porn  we  kind  of  like  don't  associate  it 
 with  jacking  off  the  issue  is  that  when 
 you're  in  the  middle  of  this  Cult  of
[19:16] nofa  and  I  say  my  server  on  my  channel 
 and  everything  I'm  doing  here  is  a  cult 
 like  I  openly  say  to  you  we're  literally
[19:21] in  a  cult  but  they're  Cults  like  the 
 nofap  cult  is  a  very  like  dirty  one 
 compared  to  what's  just  trying  to  be
[19:27] more  like  Adonis  that's  like  a  cult  that 
 they're  pushing  you  on  which  is  like  a 
 very  negative  one  where  they  make  you 
 feel  worse  when  you've  like  regressed  on
[19:33] their  [ __ ]  no  fat  benefit  timeline 
 [ __ ]  you  the  [ __ ]  cringy  videos  bro 
 like  anyone  with  a  like  I'm  not  even
[19:39] smart  bro  I'm  literally  I'm  not  even 
 smart  but  anyone  with  like  double  digit 
 IQ  knows  that  the  body  doesn't  work  on  a
[19:45] benefits  timeline  if  you  get  to  day  16 
 you'll  be  able  to  hold  eye  contact  a 
 woman  attraction  [ __ ]  you  woman
[19:50] attraction  women  can  tell  you  know  women 
 can  tell  that  you  feel  like  a  spurg  all
[19:55] of  it  is  almost  like  a  placebo  like 
 that's  the  biggest  part  of  it  right 
 there  is  absolutely  some  part  in  your
[20:00] physiological  system  that  changes  when 
 you  master  of  course  there  is  but  it's 
 not  anywhere  near  as  much  as  people  say
[20:05] now  I'm  literally  still  preaching  nofap 
 to  you  I'm  still  telling  you  to  get  onto 
 I'm  telling  you  that  we're  never  gonna 
 watch  porn  again  every  time  I  sort  of
[20:11] criticize  nofap  YouTubers  some  Spirit 
 comes  to  me  he's  like  oh  Hamza  is  wrong 
 because  because  porn's  really  bad  for
[20:16] you  yeah  no  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  we're 
 never  watching  porn  again  we're 
 preferably  going  to  drastically  or
[20:21] eliminate  our  fapping  too  but  you  need 
 to  understand  what  the  real  benefits  are 
 because  then  when  you  don't  experience
[20:27] the  [ __ ]  levitation  on  day  16  and  the 
 woman  attraction  and  like  every  woman's 
 wet  for  you  you  feel  weird  it's  like  the
[20:33] dynamic  of  when  you  start  lifting 
 weights  and  you  see  all  these 
 [ __ ]  lying  to  you  on  YouTube 
 it's  like  one  year  buddy  transformation
[20:38] in  these  [ __ ]  full-on  bodybuilder  at 
 this  point  and  you're  like  oh  that's 
 weird  because  I'm  six  months  in  and  I
[20:43] don't  really  look  that  difference 
 because  follow  me  with  the  same  example 
 it  would  be  so  useful  for  you  when  you 
 start  weightlifting  to  find  a  very
[20:49] realistic  natural  weight  lifters  body 
 transformation  because  sometimes  you'll 
 click  on  these  body  Transformations  and
[20:55] people  have  said  this  to  me  like  Sam  our 
 own  videos  has  said  this  but  he  would 
 see  other  people's  body  Transformations 
 and  they'd  get  [ __ ]  huge  in  the  first
[21:01] year  and  two  years  and  three  years  and 
 of  course  then  you're  gonna  feel  worse 
 you're  gonna  start  questioning  things 
 your  mind's  gonna  start  like  playing  on
[21:06] you  you're  gonna  literally  give  yourself 
 like  so  much  extra  stress  the  issue  with 
 all  these  YouTubers  and  they  say  in  this
[21:12] [ __ ]  like  all  the  women  will  know 
 and  stuff  it's  like  you  absolutely  will 
 give  off  a  different  vibe  compared  to
[21:17] the  guy  who's  like  watching  porn  is  you 
 know  he's  got  a  [ __ ]  up  mental  health 
 of  course  you  will  but  the  biggest 
 benefit  of  nofap  I  promise  you  people
[21:23] are  going  to  disagree  with  this  but  I 
 promise  you  the  biggest  benefit  is  the 
 placebo  it's  that  you  think  it's  going
[21:29] to  make  women  hold  eye  contact  with  you 
 you've  been  told  so  many  times  women 
 attraction  women  gonna  hold  eye  contact
[21:34] so  when  you  get  to  day  three  you  just 
 notice  it  more  it's  almost  like  you're 
 looking  out  for  it  more  and  you  end  up
[21:39] of  course  holding  eye  contact  with  more 
 girls  because  you're  actually  trying  to 
 do  it  because  you  almost  feel  like  you
[21:44] deserve  it  at  that  point  what  if  we 
 shortcut  the  process  what  if  we  give  you 
 that  Placebo  right  now  I'm  telling  you
[21:49] right  now  like  no  woman  on  the  street  is 
 like  sensing  that  you  haven't  bust  a  nut 
 it  would  be  the  other  way  around  if  it 
 had  to  be  something  like  this  then  in  an
[21:55] evolutionary  standard  the  women  wouldn't 
 pay  more  attention  to  the  guy  who  seems 
 to  have  already  been  drained  because
[22:01] it's  almost  like  oh  like  why  is  he 
 busting  that  like  some  woman's  you  know 
 taking  his  seed  which  must  mean  that 
 he's  got  like  The  evolutionary  like
[22:07] traits  that  is  good  enough  for  one  woman 
 so  it  might  be  good  enough  for  me  like 
 having  a  built-up  amount  of  semen  would
[22:13] be  an  evolution  very  disadvantage  for 
 men  so  busting  would  make  you  more
[22:18] attractive  to  girls  I've  just  disproved 
 them  but  I'm  just  saying  real  fast  at 
 home  I'm  not  saying  no  Fabs  bad  you 
 [ __ ]  dumbass  right  I'm  saying  to
[22:23] still  get  onto  it  still  absolutely  never 
 ever  watch  porn  never  watching  that  ever
[22:28] again  bro  but  just  have  way  more 
 realistic  standards  maybe  I  have  to  do 
 my  own  [ __ ]  no  Fabs  benefit  time  on
[22:33] the  timeline  but  honestly  it's  kind  of  a 
 mood  kill  because  you  know  everyone's 
 told  you  that  it's  gonna  make  you  money
[22:38] and  everything  but  really  the  biggest 
 benefit  practically  is  the  time  saved 
 that  it's  just  the  truth  you  save  a
[22:44] solid  few  hours  a  week  which  is 
 extremely  valuable  you'll  probably  save 
 about  five  hours  every  single  week  which
[22:49] is  actually  like  a  ridiculous  amount  of 
 time  that  you'll  save  obviously  like 
 you're  combust  the  nut  within  like  a 
 minute  but  like  oftentimes  you'll
[22:55] probably  agree  with  this  when  you're 
 jacking  off  you  don't  like  just  do  it 
 fast  as  possible  you  kind  of  edge  out  a 
 bit  you  that  you  search  for  the  proper
[23:00] video  you  end  up  scrolling  way  more  if 
 it's  completely  out  of  your  life  you 
 save  a  solid  few  hours  a  week  which  is  a 
 huge  advantage  that's  probably  the  best
[23:06] advantage  that  there  is  now  there  is 
 absolutely  more  of  a  benefit  in  terms 
 like  semen  retention  and  everything  and
[23:11] you  know  sexual  transmutation  and 
 everything  I  know  for  a  fact  that  the 
 guy  who  jacks  off  is  just  going  to  be
[23:16] worse  in  a  lot  of  like  different 
 performing  things  fasting  from 
 ejaculation  fasting  from  like  poor
[23:22] masturbation  even  sex  it's  almost  like 
 it  builds  hunger  in  you  just  the  same 
 way  that  fasting  from  food  does  there's

6qwH4rnS3lM,"[00:00] jeffrey  downloads  a  youtube  blocker  he 
 can  no  longer  watch  the  videos  on 
 youtube  yes  finally  he's  going  to  make
[00:05] some  progress  he  even  has  a  pawn  blocker 
 installed  on  his  pc  this  is  it  this  is 
 the  time  that  jeffrey's  actually  going
[00:10] to  finally  improve  himself 
 wait  who's  that  a  mysterious  figure
[00:15] uninstalls  the  blocker  from  jeffrey's 
 computer  who  could  it  be  who  would 
 undermine  your  self-improvement  attempts
[00:22] there  is  only  one  man  we  can  trust  to 
 find  out  the  answer  for  us
[00:34] adonis
[00:39] how  dare  you  sacrifice  young  geoffrey's 
 attempts  to  improve  himself  the 
 mysterious  figure  tries  to  run  away  but
[00:44] he's  no  match  for  adonis  the  fastest  man 
 on  the  planet  anonymous  sweeps  him  to 
 the  floor  and  holds  him  there  in  a
[00:50] camorra  he  slowly  pulls  the  mask  off  our 
 perpetrator
[00:57] mark  zuckerberg 
 [Applause] 
 so  it  was  zuck  all  along  ruining
[01:03] jeffrey's  efforts  to  improve  himself 
 mystery  solved  well  done  adoles  the
[01:08] first  habit  that  helped  me  get  my  life 
 together  was  weightlifting  this  was  like 
 the  first  productive  thing  i  ever  did  in
[01:13] my  life  age  17.  and  if  you've  been  into 
 lifting  or  calisthenics  recently  you'll 
 know  that  this  is  the  case  when  it's
[01:18] like  the  first  good  habit  that  you  do  it 
 really  is  like  the  cornerstone  that  gets 
 you  to  do  all  the  good  things  i  started
[01:24] weightlifting  at  age  17  looking  like 
 this  115  120  pounds  i  was  so  skinny  my
[01:29] wrists  and  my  forearms  were  skinnier 
 than  my  sisters  weightlifting  was  a 
 beautiful  crucial  thing  for  me  i
[01:35] remember  that  this  is  extremely  valuable 
 to  say 
 it  gave  me  hope  it  gave  me  optimism  i
[01:41] saw  the  path  ahead  of  me  okay  i've 
 started  weightlifting  as  long  as  i  never 
 quit  i'll  build  like  my  dream  physique  i
[01:47] felt  like  that  was  a  guarantee  and  so  it 
 got  me  perhaps  for  one  of  the  first 
 times  in  my  life  to  look  forward  to  the
[01:53] future  to  think  that  i  can  do  something 
 today  that  will  make  my  future  better 
 because  i  never  really  understood  the
[01:59] concept  of  working  hard  in  school  or 
 anywhere  else  it  was  weightlifting  i 
 really  started  my  life  then  the  second
[02:05] habit  that  helped  me  get  my  life 
 together  was  learning  so  at  age  21  i 
 took  an  online  course  which  is
[02:10] completely  free  and  it's  called  the 
 science  of  well-being  it  was  going  kind 
 of  viral  at  that  time  and  i  saw  some
[02:15] people  talk  about  it  on  reddit  and  so  i 
 took  the  course  it's  online  it's  free 
 you  can  literally  just  google  the 
 science  of  well-being  it's  kind  of  like
[02:21] an  online  course  where  you  just  kind  of 
 sit  there  you  open  up  the  browser  and 
 it's  almost  like  youtube  videos  we  just 
 let  the  video  play  but  it's  extremely
[02:27] educational  and  so  for  the  first  time  in 
 my  life  i  was  actually  learning  it's 
 very  very  [ __ ]  sad  to  hear  that  isn't
[02:33] it  i  was  21  years  old  and  that  was  the 
 first  time  i  was  learning  i  had 
 literally  graduated  from  university  and
[02:38] i  don't  consider  any  of  the  things  that 
 i  learned  in  the  education  system  actual
[02:43] learning  the  pathetic  education  that  i 
 went  through  was  a  complete  waste  of 
 time  but  when  oddly  oh  you're  not
[02:49] supposed  to  say  this  because  education 
 is  like  education  is  absolutely  key  but 
 the  education  system  the  school  the
[02:54] college  the  universities  are  [ __ ] 
 [ __ ]  and  this  is  maybe  a  side 
 tangent  but  age  21  is  the  first  time
[02:59] that  i  actually  ever  learned  anything  i 
 took  this  course  it  changed  my  life  it's 
 all  about  mental  health  and  i kind  of 
 explained  the  real  research  on  how  to  be
[03:06] happy  on  how  to  have  good  mental  health 
 i  had  never  learned  these  things  before 
 so  many  of  my  problems  were  fixed
[03:12] because  i  took  this  course  and  i 
 implemented  the  steps  the  third  habit 
 that  helped  me  get  my  life  together  is
[03:17] one  that  i  learned  from  the  course  that 
 we  just  mentioned  the  instructor  in  the 
 course  tells  you  of  the  vast  benefits  of
[03:23] meditation  so  the  third  habit  was 
 meditating  and  i  struggled  hard  trying 
 to  meditate  when  i  first  started  i
[03:28] literally  couldn't  even  last  one  minute 
 and  yeah  like  every  time  i  say  this 
 everyone  says
[03:33] one  minute 
 that's  what  he  said  shut  up  it's  not 
 even  that  funny  i  remember  struggling 
 hard  when  i  first  started  to  meditate  i
[03:39] download  some  of  those  apps  and  within 
 literally  30  seconds  to  one  minute  i'd 
 be  so  bored  i  need  more  stimulation  that
[03:45] i  just  opened  my  eyes  and  just  cancelled 
 the  app  early  meditation  became  a 
 beautiful  thing  and  it  became  so
[03:50] consistent  in  my  morning  routine  just  a 
 few  minutes  every  single  morning 
 eventually  i  leveled  it  up  to  20  minutes
[03:55] in  the  morning  what  meditation  did  for 
 me  honestly  the  biggest  benefit  which  is 
 somewhat  unexpected  it  immediately
[04:01] significantly  improved  my  diet  perhaps 
 you  could  probably  connect  the  dots  but
[04:06] when  i  was  researching  meditation 
 oftentimes  people  were  just  saying  you 
 know  it's  mindfulness  and  presence  and
[04:11] you  know  there's  this  benefit  in  this 
 one  as  soon  as  i  became  more  mindful  i 
 didn't  want  to  eat  that  junk  that  i
[04:16] would  usually  be  eating  and  i  got  so 
 much  more  pleasure  and  enjoyment  from 
 eating  healthy  foods  i  remember  before  i
[04:22] started  meditating  and  along  with  mental 
 illness  like  mental  health  problems  like 
 depression  anxiety  stress  i  was  a  big
[04:29] big  binge  eater  it's  almost  weird  for  me 
 to  say  this  right  now  because  it's  been 
 so  long  since  i've  binge  eight  you  know
[04:34] a lot  of  people  say  like  oh  yeah  like  i 
 ate  lots  of  food  no  no  binge  eating  is 
 like  you  eat  till  you  feel  [ __ ]  sick
[04:40] and  then  you  keep  eating  you  have  this 
 weird  need  not  just  finish  the  food  that 
 you've  got  in  front  of  you  but  to  finish
[04:46] everything  to  eat  everything  in  sight 
 and  it's  heavily  heavily  related  to 
 anxiety  it's  heavily  related  to  like
[04:52] needing  a  sense  of  comfort  which  you  can 
 get  from  food  and  feeling  full  it's  kind 
 of  dark  actually  but  i  remember  there
[04:58] was  a  guy  i  coached  i  used  to  do  like 
 one-on-one  coaching  i  don't  do  it 
 anymore  but  there  was  a  guy  i  coached
[05:03] who  was  sexually  abused  as  a  child  and 
 he  was  overweight  like  he  was  obese  but
[05:09] you  know  that  was  the  thing  that  i  was 
 trying  to  help  him  with  and  i  remember 
 once  he  just  said  something  that  really 
 almost  it  broke  my  heart  but  he
[05:15] explained  so  much  we  were  trying  to  get 
 you  know  really  explain  logically  okay 
 like  why  do  you  eat  so  much  what  like
[05:20] you  know  he  would  eat  until  he  was  so 
 [ __ ]  sick  and  agitated  with  himself 
 and  i  had  known  about  what  had  happened
[05:25] to  him  as  a  child  and  just  once  he  just 
 connected  the  dots  and  he  said  like  well 
 when  i  eat  that  much  and  i'm  so  full  i
[05:31] feel  so  like  disgusting  that  it  kind  of 
 feels  like  a  way  to  protect  myself  from
[05:37] further  sexual  abuse  trauma  and  abuse 
 and  things  that  mess  up  your  mental
[05:42] health  can  truly  truly  make  make  you  do 
 some  like  really  crazy  self  detrimental
[05:48] things  like  binge  eating  like  drug  abuse 
 like  self-harming  meditation  i 
 personally  believe  is  the  single  best
[05:54] thing  you  can  do  to  improve  on  that  the 
 list  of  benefits  of  meditation  and  this
[05:59] video  would  be  over  an  hour  long  if  i 
 actually  told  you  the  list  of  benefits 
 it's  just  one  of  those  where  it's  almost 
 like  a  weird  vague  thing  where  you're
[06:05] not  100  sure  if  it's  working  if  i  can 
 give  you  one  piece  of  advice  right  now 
 it's  start  meditating  you  know  you
[06:11] follow  one  of  those  apps  the  app  i 
 recommend  is  called  medito  completely 
 free  app  i'm  not  even  like  associated
[06:16] with  them  i  would  download  an  app  and  i 
 would  just  follow  you  know  five  minutes 
 three  minutes  one  minute  every  single
[06:21] morning  and  just  have  this  kind  of 
 perception  that  yes  as  long  as  i'm  doing 
 this  i'm  gonna  be  making  progress  and  it
[06:26] will  become  clear  to  me  soon  in  the 
 future  really  relate  yourself  to  like 
 the  guy  who  goes  to  the  gym  does  the
[06:32] workout  and  then  looks  in  the  mirror  and 
 says  like  well  i'm  not  any  thinner  or 
 i'm  not  any  like  you  know  more  muscular
[06:37] yet  well  yeah  you've  been  eating  [ __ ] 
 food  and  you  haven't  been  exercising  for 
 years  and  years  and  years  maybe  decades
[06:42] so  to  that  guy  we  have  to  say  well  yeah 
 go  to  the  gym  for  three  months  and  then 
 you'll  probably  see  some  gains  so  for 
 you  you've  been  doing  the  equivalence
[06:48] you've  been  [ __ ]  up  your  mental 
 health  with  all  this  content  stimulation 
 with  social  media  with  porn  for  years
[06:53] and  years  and  years  and  so  it's  gonna 
 take  a  couple  of  weeks  at  least  for  you 
 to  see  something  and  it's  usually
[06:58] someone  meditates  for  two  weeks  and 
 their  life  transforms  forever  the  fourth 
 habit  is  journaling  specifically
[07:03] gratitude  journaling  this  is  so  simple 
 literally  just  write  down  a  couple  of 
 things  that  you're  grateful  for  this 
 puts  you  in  a  very  positive  mindset
[07:09] because  for  once  in  your  life  you're 
 actually  sat  there  and  not  striving  to 
 want  anything  else  you're  not  like
[07:14] thinking  about  anything  else  you're 
 literally  just  thinking  okay  what  am  i 
 happy  about  what  am  i  grateful  that  is 
 in  my  life  it's  a  very  beautiful
[07:19] practice  and  when  you  get  more 
 consistent  you'll  find  that  you'll  start 
 expressing  gratitude  just  throughout
[07:24] your  normal  day  it's  kind  of  like  a 
 skill  and  the  higher  you  level  up  this 
 skill  by  simply  writing  down  things  or 
 just  expressing  gratitude  or  thinking
[07:30] about  what  you're  grateful  for  the  more 
 that  it  will  just  naturally  come  in 
 imagine  you  just  sat  there  one  day  and
[07:35] just  randomly  you  get  a  feeling  of 
 gratitude  that  oh  yeah  i'm  really 
 grateful  to  be  alive  i'm  really  grateful
[07:40] for  my  family  it's  a  very  beautiful 
 feeling  the  fifth  habit  that's  changed 
 my  life  is  reading  i  know  that  i've 
 already  mentioned  learning  but  i'm  gonna
[07:46] put  this  as  a  separate  one  because  i 
 think  reading  and  learning  are  two  of 
 the  most  important  things  that  you  can 
 do  as  a  young  man  reading  is  literally
[07:52] like  such  a  high  value  skill  that  i'd 
 say  over  90  of  young  men  aren't  doing  if
[07:58] you're  watching  this  video  right  now  and 
 you  don't  currently  read  books  you  are 
 going  to  get  destroyed  you  are  going  to
[08:03] get  dominated  by  another  man  who's 
 reading  it's  as  simple  as  that  the  woman 
 that  you  want  will  be  his  the  money  that
[08:08] you  want  will  be  his  the  status  that  you 
 want  will  be  his  you  choose  stay  in  this 
 lowly  position  of  like  oh  well  greetings
[08:13] not  that  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  i  get 
 aggressive  about  this  because  when  you 
 realize  the  roi  of  reading  and  then  i
[08:18] see  that  people  don't  actually  read  and 
 they  choose  to  just  watch  [ __ ] 
 netflix  and  anime  and  [ __ ]  and  i  just 
 think  to  myself  like  there  is  literally
[08:24] the  pathway  to  wealth  there  is  literally 
 the  pathway  to  love  it's  literally  just 
 all  there  in  books  all  you  have  to  do  is
[08:29] just  read  and  then  just  try  to  implement 
 those  things  that  you  learned  and  your 
 life  changes  forever  and  when  people
[08:34] don't  read  it  it  honestly  pisses  me  off 
 because  i  just  think  why  are  you  missing 
 out  on  life  reading  is  quite  literally
[08:39] like  a  10  out  of  10  thing  i  wouldn't 
 speak  like  this  if  i  didn't  preach  it 
 get  into  reading  it  seems  a  little  bit
[08:44] boring  when  you  first  start  off  it's  a 
 bit  tricky  because  your  mind  is  so 
 [ __ ]  you  can  barely  read  a  few
[08:49] sentences  before  your  mind  starts 
 thinking  about  something  else  reading  is 
 a  skill  right  now  you're  level  one  in 
 this  skill  because  in  the  real  world
[08:54] when  you  don't  level  up  a  skill  you 
 actually  lose  experience  you  need  to 
 like  look  yourself  in  the  mirror  and
[08:59] have  a  little  bit  of  hatred  towards 
 yourself  and  say  like  [ __ ]  i  can't  even 
 read  bro  i  read  like  three  sentences  in
[09:04] my  mind  wonders  what  a  [ __ ]  disgrace 
 you  need  to  have  some  aggression  about
[09:09] this  and  literally  say  to  yourself  what 
 a  disgrace  that  i  can't  and  i  will  not 
 read  what  a  privilege  it  is  to  read  and
[09:16] to  get  the  wisdom  and  knowledge  from  men 
 who  are  better  than  us  and  i  choose  not 
 to  read  because  it's  not  that  fun
[09:21] because  it's  a  little  bit  hard  slap  some 
 sense  into  yourself  pick  out  a  couple  of 
 books  and  start  reading  for  an  hour  a
[09:26] day  every  single  day  for  the  rest  of 
 your  life  it's  that  simple  this  is 
 literally  how  you  become  rich  like  i  was 
 gonna  make  a  separate  video  titled  like
[09:32] obnoxiously  titled  the  reason  why  i'm 
 rich  and  you're  broke  simply  because  i 
 read  that  is  the  one  you  can  say  it's
[09:37] privilege  whatever  the  [ __ ]  you  want  to 
 say  i  read  the  right  book  at  the  right 
 time  and  that  changed  my  life  forever
[09:43] the  book  was  the  millionaire  fastlane  by 
 mj  demarco  it's  kind  of  like  a  new 
 blueprint  to  understanding  wealth  and
[09:49] money  i  read  it  at  about  age  21  when  i 
 was  first  starting  to  make  money  like 
 you  know  i  was  first  like  working 
 full-time  jobs  after  i  finished
[09:55] university  i  was  trying  businesses  and 
 just  because  i  read  that  single  book  i 
 never  fell  into  the  trap  that  the 
 majority  of  like  99  of  people  do  and
[10:01] they're  okay  making  2k  a  month  3k  a 
 month  and  like  you're  probably  thinking 
 about 
 two  games  it's  actually  pretty  good  bro
[10:07] reading  changes  like  i  sound  like  a 
 [ __ ]  and  yeah  i  am  i  am  okay  but 
 reading  will  change  your  life  and  you
[10:12] don't  have  to  take  my  word  for  it  either 
 you  read  and  your  life  improves  or  you 
 don't  and  you  stay  like  everyone  else
[10:17] when  i  think  about  i  went  20  something 
 years  without  reading  if  i  started 
 reading  when  i  was  in  high  school  holy
[10:23] [ __ ]  and  i'm  not  talking  about  reading 
 what  your  [ __ ]  dumb  teacher  gives  to 
 you 
 i'm  talking  about  reading  some  good
[10:28] books  that  you  see  recommended  in  our 
 space  what's  interesting  is  that  what's 
 popular  is  usually  wrong  so  whatever  99
[10:34] of  people  recommend  is  usually  wrong 
 what  i  found  personally  is  that  the 
 books  that  are  recommended  you  know
[10:39] widely  recommended  are  actually  really 
 really  good  it's  really  interesting  i 
 think  because  people  who  consistently
[10:44] read  are  in  like  the  top  five  percent 
 anyway  so  you  know  the  same  books  keep 
 getting  recommended  by  the  people  who
[10:49] read  consistently  then  you  know  it's  a 
 pretty  good  book  you  don't  have  to  look 
 for  like  a  very  weird  niche  book  that  no
[10:54] one's  recommended  because  you  know  we 
 want  to  be  like  the  one  percent  like  the 
 one  percent  are  the  people  who  read  i 
 hope  that  makes  sense  the  sixth  habit
[11:00] that  helped  me  get  my  life  together  is 
 very  interesting  it's  failing  i  got  into 
 the  habit  of  failing  of  trying  things
[11:05] and  failing  them  there's  a  video  of  mine 
 which  is  getting  a  lot  of  views  right 
 now  and  it's  titled  i  am  a  failure  it's
[11:10] kind  of  like  a  epic  montage  edits  like 
 you  know  with  music  and  hype  and 
 everything  and  i  describe  the  process  of
[11:16] actually  becoming  successful  is 
 constantly  just  trying  and  failing  and 
 being  okay  with  that  failure  and  then
[11:21] learning  from  it  and  then  trying  again  i 
 think  my  generation  especially  has  a 
 problem  with  this  i  see  perfectionism  is
[11:27] like  through  the  roof  it's  kind  of  a 
 weird  term  perfectionism  because  it 
 almost  seems  like  a  positive  thing 
 perfectionism  is  for  [ __ ]  like  if
[11:33] you're  a  perfectionist  you  have  to  be  a 
 coward  you  have  to  be  a  [ __ ]  i'd  say 
 most  of  my  generation  is  so  deathly
[11:38] afraid  of  failure  and  if  you're  afraid 
 of  failure  you  will  never  become  a 
 success  and  finally  the  seventh  habit
[11:43] one  that  you  can  probably  guess  is 
 uploading  content  i  realized  about  two 
 years  ago  that  social  media  is  the
[11:49] single  greatest  opportunity  of  our 
 generation  this  is  our  generation's  gold 
 rush  uploading  content  consistently  led
[11:55] me  to  where  i  am  today  at  first  i  was 
 doing  it  just  for  the  sake  of  like 
 entrepreneurship  and  making  money  online
[12:00] and  slowly  and  surely  when  an  audience 
 started  building  up  and  i  got  way  more 
 purposeful  and  more  driven  and  more
[12:05] focused  it  became  more  like  a  movement  a 
 revolution  a  revolution  of  young  men  who
[12:10] are  sick  and  tired  of  living  normal 
 lives  we've  done  years  of  playing  video
[12:15] games  of  watching  porn  of  eating  shitty 
 junk  food  and  we  hate  our  lives  for
[12:20] years  we  scrolled  on  social  media 
 because  that's  the  normal  thing  to  do 
 and  we  hated  our  lives  i  felt  these
[12:25] emotions  i  felt  this  sickness  this  pain 
 inside  of  me  this  agitation  of  living 
 like  a  normal  person  and  i  was  so  fed  up
[12:32] with  it  that  i  transformed  my  life 
 forever  and  i  started  documenting  my 
 process  and  just  coming  onto  camera  and 
 just  teaching  my  learning  lessons  of
[12:38] living  quite  a  weird  life  detached  away 
 from  like  not  fully  detached  away  from 
 modern  technology  you  know  i've  got  my
[12:43] computer  on  right  now  i've  got  a 
 document  open  with  like  today's  script 
 and  everything  but  enough  that  i  don't
[12:48] have  social  media  i  haven't  watched  porn 
 in  years  i  don't  have  dating  apps  i 
 don't  eat  shitty  junk  food  i  don't  eat
[12:54] sweets  and  crisps  uploading  content 
 starts  it's  just  a  habit  that  you  know 
 you're  just  kind  of  doing  to  try  and
[12:59] make  some  money  and  as  soon  as  you  start 
 building  up  an  audience  you  start  taking 
 it  seriously  because  you  realize  like  oh
[13:04] [ __ ]  like  hundreds  of  people  are 
 watching  me  looking  up  at  me  and  you 
 really  want  to  start  spreading  a  good
[13:09] message  after  that 
 i've  seen  some  people  taking  my  content 
 and  re-uploading  it  onto  like  their  kind
[13:15] of  like  what  andrew  tate's  done  but 
 they've  got  like  hamsa  clips  hamza 
 shorts  and  it's  just  like  videos  of  me
[13:20] we're  like  oh  you  know  hamster  explains 
 no  fat  benefits  i've  seen  people  do  that 
 and  get  like  quite  a  lot  of  views  and
[13:25] their  channels  are  monetized  i  never 
 copyright  anyone  who's  taken  my  videos  i 
 wanted  to  make  an  announcement  if  you've
[13:30] ever  wanted  to  like  download  my  videos 
 and  keep  them  safe  in  cases  like  youtube 
 ever  bans  me  or  if  you  want  to  like  make
[13:35] your  own  sort  of  youtube  account  just

ULKh2QCU3mQ,"[00:00] you're  never  gonna  get  girls  like  that 
 geoffrey  jeffrey  does  it  all  wrong  he  is 
 horny  but  he  doesn't  have  the  right
[00:05] traits  that  actually  makes  him 
 attractive  to  girls  of  course  it's 
 jeffrey  so  he's  missing  some  of  the
[00:10] fundamentals  his  breath  stinks  how  do 
 you  think  you  can  attract  any  women  like 
 that  when  your  breath  stink  geoffrey
[00:15] even  chads  can't  afford  to  have  bad 
 breath  adonis 
 adonis  doesn't  have  green  flags  green
[00:21] flags  haven't  died 
 green  flags  haven't  done  it  a  phenomenal
[00:27] communicator  respectably  honest  insanely 
 attractive  adonis  is  the  world's  best
[00:33] postman  because  he  brings  the  whole 
 package 
 all  right  i  asked  a  bunch  of  my  female
[00:38] friends  for  their  advice  on  dating  i 
 asked  them  what's  the  best  green  flags 
 that  guys  can  have  and  we're  going  to
[00:43] listen  to  their  responses  because  i  got 
 them  to  send  me  voice  notes  so  firstly 
 showing  a  genuine  and  sincere  interest
[00:49] in  your  life  so  someone  that  basically 
 asks  you  questions  about  your  day  and 
 how  works  go  in  and  just  generally  asks
[00:56] about  you  you  know  things  aren't  always 
 just  about  them  all  the  bread  pillars 
 and  the  black  fillers  are  getting 
 annoying  wait  wait  hang  on  what  about
[01:02] being  an  alpha  male  what  about  what 
 about  having  the  perfect  eyelid  shape 
 guys  someone  who  takes  care  of  themself
[01:07] because  i  always  think  if  someone's  able 
 to  take  care  of  themselves  then  they're 
 able  to  take  care  of  you  too  and  by  that
[01:13] it  can  be  anything  from  watching  them 
 trying  to  achieve  the  goals  you  know 
 taking  care  of  their  appearance  or  you
[01:19] know  trying  to  that's  actually 
 interesting  that  she  said  taking  care  of 
 your  goals  and  she  wants  to  see  a  man 
 who's  actually  achieving  things  in  his
[01:24] life  and  this  is  one  of those  things 
 that  i've  never  seen  many  guys  talk 
 about  like  online  everyone  talks  about 
 okay  attractiveness  and  actually  do
[01:29] agree  with  that  i  think  attractiveness 
 is  one  of  the  most  important  parts  but  a 
 huge  part  of  attraction  that  girls  have
[01:34] in  guys  is  that  the  guy  sets  goals  and 
 achieves  them  and  why  why  do  you  think 
 this  is  really  ask  yourself  right  now
[01:39] why  would  a  woman  be  attracted  to  a  guy 
 who  sets  goals  and  achieves  them  because 
 it  shows  ambition  and  it  shows  at  least
[01:44] a  potential  for  future  success  and 
 that's  incredibly  attractive  and  plus  we 
 can  get  a  little  bit  deeper  if  the  woman
[01:49] that  you're  trying  to  attract  is 
 feminine  the  feminine  is  attracted  to 
 the  masculine  you  must  understand  the
[01:54] feminine  and  the  masculine  energy  if  you 
 want  to  have  like  a  sexual  relationship 
 you  want  to  understand  these  the 
 masculine  is  all  about  like  the  mission
[02:00] what's  next  what  goal  are  we  going  to 
 achieve  what  are  we  going  to  conquer  the 
 moment  that  a  masculine  man  achieves  a 
 goal  he  sets  another  one  and  another  one
[02:06] and  another  one  it's  all  about  the 
 pursuit  of  something  whereas  the 
 feminine  energy  is  all  about  like  the
[02:11] flow  of  love  about  laughter  dance 
 communication  if  the  women  that  you're 
 trying  to  attract  are  feminine  they  will
[02:16] be  more  into  you  if  they  see  that  you 
 are  the  masculine  guy  who's  like  focused 
 on  his  goals  his  purpose  his  mission
[02:21] like  that  person  living  a  healthy  and 
 balanced  lifestyle  and  i  think  that  if 
 they're  able  to  do  them  things  for
[02:26] themselves  then  the  chances  are  they're 
 able  to  take  care  of  you  as  well  a  guy 
 who  makes  an  effort  with  your  parents
[02:32] and  siblings  i  think  that  there's 
 nothing  nicer  than  watching  like  a  guy 
 going  well  with  your  parents  and  like
[02:37] your  brothers  and  sisters  or  like  your 
 grandparents  whoever  it  might  be  i  think 
 that  that's  definitely  a  really  nice
[02:42] thing  and  it  shows  that  they  care  about 
 you  and  like  the  people  around  you  and 
 the  people  who  are  important  to  you  as 
 well  that's  a  big  one  for  long-term
[02:48] serious  relationships  you  want  to  get 
 along  with  their  family  but  you  also 
 want  to  make  sure  that  she  gets  along 
 with  yours  if  you're  really  pursuing
[02:54] like  a  serious  relationship  you  want  to 
 be  together  for  years  maybe  for  your 
 life  you  want  to  have  children  together 
 it's  very  important  that  you  fit  in  with
[02:59] her  family  and  she  fits  in  with  yours 
 because  you  can  still  have  a 
 relationship  where  you  don't  fit  in  but 
 the  best  case  scenario  you  don't  have
[03:04] that  level  of  friction  not  to  like  jack 
 my  own  tough  but  i'm  pretty  sick  with 
 going  to  like  a  girl's  family  and  like
[03:10] you  know  communicating  with  her  parents 
 and  like  doing  well  with  them  and  like 
 speaking  to  them  as  if  they're  almost 
 like  friends  and  the  best  advice  i  can
[03:15] give  you  for  that  is  just  social  skills 
 you've  got  to  almost  see  them  as  like 
 people  that  you'll  be  interacting  with
[03:20] in  the  gym  and  you  ask  them  questions 
 you  take  an  interest  you  make  jokes  and 
 everything  and  sometimes  you'll  come 
 across  some  family  members  who  are  like
[03:25] testing  you  and  you  know  it's  like 
 hardcore  like  and  like  i  don't 
 personally  get  along  with  that 
 personality  style  who  like  wants  to
[03:31] challenge  me  but  the  girls  who  i've 
 previously  dated  and  their  parents  who 
 were  like  you  know  nice  people  and  i  got 
 along  with  them  like  i  actually  was  more
[03:37] interested  in  the  girl  because  of  that 
 but  it  starts  with  you  and  your  social 
 skills  to  be  honest  imagine  you're  about 
 to  meet  like  this  girl's  parents  are  you
[03:43] gonna  hold  eye  contact  are  you  gonna  go 
 in  for  a  handshake  or  a  hug  are  you 
 gonna  be  awkward  and  like  not  know  what 
 to  do  and  be  honest  because  it's  really
[03:48] worth  just  kind  of  considering  what  kind 
 of  guy  you  are  when  it  comes  to  like 
 seeing  her  family  someone  who  shows  you
[03:53] that  they  like  you  through  their  actions 
 and  they  don't  just  tell  you  they  like 
 you  so  for  example  they  might  hold  the 
 door  open  for  you  or  text  you  throughout
[03:59] the  day  to  ask  you  how  your  day's  going 
 or  notice  that  you're  struggling  with 
 something  like  they  want  to  help  you
[04:04] overcome  it  or  someone  who  wants  to  help 
 support  you  with  your  goals  and  tries  to 
 put  you  sometimes  like  before  themselves
[04:10] i  think  that  that's  a  real  like  green 
 flag  because  words  are  words  at  the  end 
 of  the  day  actions  are  the  most
[04:15] important  things 
 watch  their  actions  and  not  their  words 
 and  this  is  really  good  advice  for  guys
[04:20] as  well  when  you're  kind  of  evaluating 
 the  girl  that  you're  interested  in  watch 
 her  actions  and  not  what  she  says  to  you 
 and  we  have  now  another  friend  who's
[04:26] answering  the  same  question  hey  i'm  so 
 sorry  i  just  saw  this  um  i  don't  use 
 instagram  that  watches  it  like  once
[04:32] every  week  two  weeks  or  so  so  yes  two 
 main  green  flags  would  be  responsibility
[04:38] and  if  he  shows  compassion  towards  other 
 people  but  most  especially  his  family  if 
 he  takes  care  of  himself  and  then  his
[04:44] immediate  family  that  already  says  a  lot 
 about  who  he  is  and  how  he  would  treat 
 you  in  the  future  so  yeah  hope  it  helped
[04:51] bye  that's  really  nice  so  she  mentioned 
 the  importance  of  responsibility 
 is  kind  of  like  taking  care  of  yourself
[04:57] and  the  things  that  you  should  be  taken 
 care  of  and  then  when  you  reach  a  good 
 enough  level  and  you  have  the  mental 
 capacity  to  do  so  start  taking
[05:03] responsibility  for  more  things  jordan 
 peterson  really  talks  about 
 responsibility  a  lot  so  it's  no  surprise
[05:08] that  she's  just  mentioned  that  number 
 one  they  hype  you  up  he's  he's  your 
 number  one  hype  man  anywhere  anywhere  in
[05:15] the  world  number  two  you  don't  even  have 
 to  ask  for  anything  because  they've  got 
 your  back  like  they  already  know  because
[05:21] they've  studied  you  so  they  know 
 what  you  need  and  when  you  need  it 
 sometimes  even  before  you  know  so  she
[05:27] just  said  that  the  number  one  green  flag 
 is  that  the  guy  like  hypes  her  up  and 
 encourages  her  and  that  the  second  one
[05:32] is  kind  of  like  he  knows  what  her  needs 
 are  number  three  is  like  they're  not
[05:37] looking  for 
 problems  in  you  as  a  person
[05:42] they  understand  that 
 like 
 we're  all  at  different  growth  like
[05:47] growing  levels  and  so  they're  not  trying 
 to  pick  up  what  they  don't  like  about
[05:52] you  they're  actively  trying  to  find  what 
 they  do  like  about  you  all  the  time
[05:58] because  you  can  either  destroy  someone 
 even  with  your  thoughts  and  put  yourself
[06:03] off  them  or  like 
 just  appreciate  someone  if  that  makes
[06:08] sense 
 and  not  hurt  them  i  don't  have  that 
 green  flag  i'll  be  totally  honest  i  um  i
[06:13] have  a  tendency  to  pick  out  negative 
 traits  in  the  women  that  i'm  dating  so  i
[06:19] don't  know  if  it's  like  a  defense 
 mechanism  or  something  but  it's  usually 
 like  i'll  really  like  a  girl  and  things 
 will  be  going  good  but  then  my  brain
[06:24] will  automatically  start  to  like 
 negatively  see  them  like  oh  she  does 
 this  wrong  and  she  could  do  that  you
[06:29] know  like  picking  out  things  so  that 
 maybe  it  kind  of  like  protects  myself  or 
 something  but  one  other  thing  like  she 
 was  just  saying  then  that  instead  of
[06:35] doing  that  instead  of  like  trying  to  see 
 all  the  negatives  and  weigh  them  up  just 
 focus  more  on  the  positives  and  that's 
 what  my  very  very  beautiful  healthy
[06:41] advice  and  i  think  you'll  be  able  to  do 
 that  if  you  implement  more  gratitude  if 
 you  really  think  to  yourself  okay
[06:46] instead  of  being  like  critical  of  this 
 person  think  okay  what  are  you  grateful 
 for  what  good  things  do  they  bring  to 
 the  table  focus  on  them  now  that  being
[06:52] said  it  is  very  important  to  still  take 
 account  of  like  red  flags  but  i  think 
 that  should  be  something  that  you  do
[06:57] like  every  now  and  then  every  like  at 
 the  start  of  a  relationship  you  kind  of 
 weigh  up  like  what  red  flags  do  they 
 have  like  is  there  anything  that  like
[07:03] really  could  be  like  a  problem  but  once 
 you  kind  of  acknowledge  them  and  you 
 kind  of  want  it  to  go  forward  then  don't 
 keep  constantly  bringing  them  up  focus
[07:09] more  on  the  positives  because  it  will 
 really  show  like  she  kind  of  briefly 
 mentioned  it  there  how  you  think  about 
 someone  will  show  in  the  way  that  you
[07:15] interact  with  them  and  you  want  if 
 you've  got  a  partner  if  you've  got  a 
 girl  that  you're  dating  you  want  her  to 
 feel  like  you  only  think  like  positive
[07:21] things  of  her  you  want  her  because  that 
 will  nourish  her  that  will  make  her  feel 
 good  and  that  will  encourage  her  to  be
[07:26] even  better  one  important  piece  of 
 advice  that  i've  learned  previously  is 
 that  you  shouldn't  really  try  to  change 
 your  partner  if  you  want  to  date  this
[07:32] person  you  should  assume  they're  going 
 to  stay  like  as  they  are  you  shouldn't 
 think  oh  yeah  this  person's  life's  but 
 like  if  i  can  save  her  like  a  lot  of
[07:38] young  men  have  this  tendency  like  oh 
 like  you  know  she's  kind  of  nice  and  she 
 likes  me  too  but  like  she's  got  some  bad
[07:43] habits  she's  got  some  of this  she  goes 
 to  the  club  she  takes  like 
 pictures  i  don't  like  that  but  you  know 
 i  can  change  her  but  you  know  i  can
[07:48] maybe  change  her  and  she  won't  be  like 
 that  anymore  you  have  to  kind  of  accept 
 a  person  as  they  are  right  now  otherwise
[07:53] you're  almost  forcing  them  to  be 
 inauthentic  around  you  and  that  kind  of 
 relationship  will  never  work  out  she
[07:58] sent  me  some  text  messages  as  well  she 
 said  number  three  is  the  most  important 
 one  the  last  one  that  she's  just  text  me 
 as  well  is  that  they  believe  you  when
[08:04] you're  telling  them  something  so 
 essentially  that  there's  a  good  level  of 
 trust  in  the  relationship  and  not  taking 
 life  and  themselves  too  seriously
[08:11] i  look  for  personally  is  a  guy  who  is 
 not  afraid  to  show  that  he  is  attracted
[08:18] to  women 
 so  let  me  explain  um  there's  a  lot  of 
 guys  who  think  that  like  simping  is
[08:25] cringe  and  that  you  should  never  let  a 
 woman  know  that  you  like  her  basically
[08:30] and  so  the  way  that  this  manifests  is 
 that  men  refuse  to  give  compliments  men
[08:37] refuse  to  engage  in  non-sexual  physical 
 touch  just  like  little  playful  touching
[08:43] um  and  so  a  green  flag  that  i  look  for 
 is  a  guy  who's  not  afraid  to  let  me  know 
 that  he  finds  me  attractive  that
[08:49] um 
 to  cut  out  there  but  i  do  want  to 
 comment  that  is  100  i've  done  the  wrong
[08:55] thing  here  in  previous  relationships  so 
 i've  mentioned  a  bunch  of  times  on  my 
 videos  that  there  was  a  girl  that  i  used 
 to  live  with  like  we  were  literally
[09:01] dating  we  were  together  for  like  two  or 
 three  years  and  i  was  in  like  this  kind 
 of  red  pill  anti-simp  mode  of  like  you
[09:06] know  never  tell  her  that  i  appreciate  i 
 never  tell  like  never  say  nice  things 
 about  her  and  like  you  know  like  all 
 these  alpha  males
[09:11] and  when  i  look  back  like  i  see  so  much 
 negativity  in  that  kind  of  relationship
[09:16] and  i  feel  like  i  have  so  much  change 
 from  that  when  now  i  do  what  she  says 
 and  like  you've  gotta 
 like  if  you  think  that  this  is  like
[09:22] simply  like  okay  there's  a  girl  that  you 
 like  maybe  it's  a  girl  that  you  date  in 
 to  show  her  that  you  care  about  her  to 
 show  her  that  you  appreciate  her  to  like
[09:27] do  little  things  for  her  to  hold  her 
 hand  to  hug  her  to  kiss  her  at  like  any 
 moment  if  you  think  that's  simply  bro  yo
[09:33] you've  spent  too  much  time  on  the 
 internet  you  literally  like  it  would  be 
 better  for  you  right  now  it'd  be  bad  for
[09:38] my  channel  and  my  youtube  algorithm  but 
 it'd  be  better  for  you  to  turn  this 
 video  off  and  like  just  just  go  stand
[09:43] outside  in  the  rain  and  actually  feel 
 the  real  world  because  too  often  like 
 young  men  are  consumed  by  the  internet 
 by  youtube  by  like  media  and  you  think
[09:49] that  anything  positive  towards  a  woman 
 is  like  simping  and  it's  bad  for  you  and 
 i  i  don't  want  to  be  a  better  male
[09:55] bro  it's  it's  the  more  beta  male  the 
 more  like  weak  male  skinny  neck  thing 
 low  testosterone  thing  to  do  is  to  take
[10:00] date  and  advice  from  like  guys  who  don't 
 even  show  their  face  on  youtube  saying 
 like  oh  we  need  to  stop  simping  shut  up
[10:05] bro  don't  simp  like  don't  be  like  some 
 weird  like  guy  who  donates  money  to  like 
 titty  streamers  on  twitch  but  when  you
[10:11] like  a  girl  and  she  likes  you  too  be 
 totally  like  as  affectionate  as  you  want 
 to  be  so  for  me  personally  bro  i'm  the
[10:17] most  affectionate  person  ever  i'm 
 literally  if  i'm  next  to  someone  even  a 
 male  friend  i'm  touching  them  constantly
[10:22] it's  just  what  i  do  it's  like  how  i  kind 
 of  like  show  love  and  i  always  used  to 
 kind  of  like  turn  that  down  and  so  i  was
[10:27] living  like  an  inauthentic  life  i  was  in 
 inauthentic  relationships  now  it's 
 almost  like  a  test  for  me  because  if 
 there's  someone  who's  unattracted  to
[10:33] that  part  of  me  if  there's  someone  who's 
 like  oh  why  you  touch  it  bro  i'll  never 
 see  them  again  because  we're  clearly 
 incompatible  and  doing  nice  things  for  a
[10:38] girl  again  you  shouldn't  be  doing  it  in 
 some  kind  of  simply  way  like  i'll  donate 
 money  to  her  but  doing  something  nice 
 and  romantic  like  one  of  the  things  i've
[10:44] done  is  i'm  in  the  car  with  a  girl  for 
 driving  and  you  know  there's  a  car 
 behind  us  or  something  and  i  tell  her 
 where  i  pull  over  so  she  thinks  almost
[10:49] like  it's  an  emergency  or  something  she 
 pulls  over  there's  a  car  behind  just 
 like  waiting  what  what  why  they  just
[10:54] blow  it  i  get  out  the  car  like  run 
 across  the  road  pick  out  a  flower  go 
 back  in  the  car  give  it  to  her  and  she's 
 like 
 no  one's  ever  done  oh  god  like  you  know
[11:00] she's  crazy  for  it  that  isn't  me  like 
 being  a  sim  that  isn't  me  like  oh  my  god 
 like  i  hope  she  has  sex  with  me  after
[11:05] this  it's  just  kind  of  like  i  felt  like 
 doing  that  it  stayed  inside  my  memories 
 i  guess  it's  like  a  romantic  thing  that
[11:10] i've  done  that  i'm  actually  like  glad 
 that  i  did  and  then  she  sent  another  one 
 as  well  women  want  to  be  around  men  that
[11:16] make  them  feel  desirable  women  don't 
 want  to  be  around  a  guy  where  they  have
[11:21] to  guess  if  he  finds  them  attractive  if 
 he  wants  to  be  around  them  at  this
[11:26] current  point  in  time 
 because  if  it's  like  if  you're  not 
 expressing  interest  why  am  i  here  i  just
[11:32] want  to  leave  you  know  women  want  to  be 
 around  men  that  make  them  feel  like 
 they're  attractive  and  those  men  are
[11:38] attracted  to  them  really  ask  yourself 
 this  question  is  it  not  the  same  for  you 
 would  you  want  to  be  around  a  woman 
 would  you  want  to  date  a  woman  who  kind
[11:43] of  doesn't  really  show  that  she  even 
 likes  you  like  no  of  course  not  like 
 some  guys  are  kind  of  into  that  where
[11:48] they  said  oh  don't  make  it  too  easy  for 
 me  or  something  but  you  want  like  some 
 kind  of  positive  feedback  loop  from  that
[11:53] you  wouldn't  want  to  date  a  woman  who 
 like  doesn't  show  that  she  actually 
 cares  about  you  and  that  she  actually 
 likes  you  hey  hamza  i  really  appreciate
[11:59] you  reaching  out  to  me  but  yeah  um  for 
 me  my  green  flags  would  probably  be  a
[12:04] guy  who  has  a  morning  and  night  routine 
 someone  who  meditates  who's  into  fitness
[12:11] and  self-improvement  because  that  just 
 shows  that  they  care  about  themselves 
 and  they're  working  towards  becoming
[12:17] better  versions  of  themselves  and 
 they're  prioritizing  themselves  you  know 
 and  yeah  that's  just  really  attractive
[12:23] and  whenever  i  see  and  meet  guys  like 
 that  they  honestly  have  my  respect
[12:28] because  i'm  into  that  stuff  so  yeah 
 that's  nice  so  she's  talking  about  the 
 guy  being  like-minded  to  her  and  he's  on
[12:35] self-improvements  he's  doing  the  good 
 habits  of  course  my  audience  pool  for 
 this  study  is  skewed  it's  biased  towards
[12:40] women  who  are  onto  self-improvement 
 because  i'm  friends  with  them  but 
 probably  like  thoughtfulness  are  like 
 just  the  little  things  so  going  wrong
[12:46] it's  nice  to  receive  flowers  but  i  mean 
 like  say  if  i'm  in  a  rush  like  i've  been 
 at  uni  all  day  for  them  to  be  like  oh
[12:52] just  come  straight  to  the  gym  like  i've 
 got  your  pre-workout  ready  made  you 
 don't  need  to  go  home  and  like  i  don't 
 know  that's  a  very  specific  example  but
[12:57] just  little  things  like  that  she's  such 
 a  gym  girl  but
[13:02] the  best  green  flag  in  a  guy  is  that  he 
 gets  me  pre-workout 
 oh  my  god  i  know  if  they  like  marvel  and
[13:09] they  don't  just  mean  like  oh  yeah  no  i 
 like  iron  man  i  mean  like  if  they  truly 
 understand  the  multiverse  and  like  they
[13:14] understand  how  it  all  interlinks  and 
 they're  always  like  oh  my  god  that's 
 coming  out  and  he's  going  to see  that 
 straight  away  that  is  a  big  dream  flag
[13:20] for  me  because  i  think  i'm  just  such  a 
 little  marvel  nerd  oh  my  god  i've 
 probably  just  exposed  myself
[13:26] so  the  first  one  she  said  is  that  he 
 does  little  things  for  her  like  he's 
 kind  of  thinking  about  her  and  he's  just
[13:31] made  her  life  easier  in  some  sense  and 
 the  second  one  she's  specifically 
 talking  about  like  marvel  like  the  movie
[13:36] company  or  something  but  it's  more  kind 
 of  like  sharing  the  same  enthusiasm  and 
 interest  in  the  things  that  she  likes  as
[13:41] well  the  two  biggest  green  flags  that  i 
 see  in  guys  and  you  also  notice  this
[13:48] when  your  friends  find  a  good  guy  and 
 you  start  seeing  green  flags  the  one
[13:53] thing  is  being  responsive  and  receptive 
 to  emotions  so  understanding  signals
[14:00] understanding  when  the  girl  is  not  okay 
 or  when  she  didn't  like  something  and
[14:05] picking  up  on  it  and  asking  about  it  and 
 the  second  thing 
 is  being  able  to  apologize  like  putting
[14:12] that  part  away  for  like  five  minutes  to 
 have  the  conversation  and  apologize  for
[14:17] something  they  know  has  upset  the  girl 
 so  i  think  that's  the  two  biggest 
 screenshots  for  me  interesting  so  the
[14:23] first  thing  she  said  is  kind  of  like 
 social  intelligence  being  able  to  pick 
 up  cues  so  so  if  you're  dating  a  girl
[14:28] it's  kind  of  like  having  that  sense  that 
 gut  instinct  that  like  something  isn't 
 right  with  her  that  she's  upset  about
[14:33] something  and  it's  kind  of  like  a  true 
 stereotype  that  women  generally  are  more 
 emotional  and  they'll  have  like  the  full
[14:38] spectrum  of  emotions  and  for  a  man  it's 
 like  we're  more  certain  on  something 
 like  today  i  feel  happy  tomorrow  i  feel
[14:44] okay  you  know  i  mean  it's  like  okay 
 we're  consistent  with  that  whereas  a 
 woman  especially  a  feminine  woman  can 
 have  quite  chaotic  mood  so  she  can  be
[14:50] like  anxious  and  insecure  for  one  second 
 and  literally  five  minutes  later  feel 
 like  totally  love  and  secure  so  you  have
[14:55] to  be  able  to  pick  up  on  that  and  the 
 second  thing  she  said  is  a  green  flag  is 
 the  ability  to  apologize  now  this  is
[15:01] where  it  gets  interesting  because  you 
 might  think  oh  no  this  is  all  wrong  and 
 hamster's  getting  blooper  advice  from 
 girls  why  would  you  ask  girls  for  advice
[15:06] and  stuff  but  the  thing  is  i  have  been 
 through  the  spectrum  of  dating  advice 
 and  i  have  been  like  okay  total  virgin
[15:12] then  i've  been  total  red  pill  alpha  male 
 pills  and  you  know  dry  like  dark 
 behaviors  and
[15:17] apologizing  to  a  girl  for  me  is 
 extremely  unnatural  because  i've  for
[15:23] years  i've  like  implemented  more  of  like 
 the  dark  triad  alpha  male  traits  and 
 everything  and  so  there  was  a  girl  that
[15:28] i  apologized  to  a  little  while  ago  even 
 multiple  girls  like  i'm  getting  more 
 into  the  ability  of  being  able  to
[15:33] apologize  and  like  she's  just  said  she 
 used  the  perfect  word  there  it's  being 
 able  to  put  your  pride  away  pride  is  the
[15:38] fuel  for  your  ego  the  opposite  of  that 
 is  humility  and  humility  as  you  may 
 remember  is  adonis's  second  virtue
[15:44] humility  is  being  able  to  see  some  of 
 your  weaknesses 
 like  for  me  probably  the  main  one  is
[15:49] personal  cnn  a  big  one  for  me  is  like 
 interest  like  matching  interest  that's
[15:54] fine  personality  and  matching  interest 
 so  interest  we've  heard  that  a  couple  of
[15:59] times  now  having  the  same  interest  as 
 her  so  that's  all  my  friends  who  replied 
 there  was  a  few  who  like  didn't  really 
 get  the  message  and  they  they  messaged
[16:05] me  back  like  is  the  video  for  men  or  for 
 women  so  those  are  the  best  green  flags 
 that  women  say  that  they're  attracted  to
[16:10] and  it's  up  to  you  to  decide  if  you  do 
 want  to  be  introspective  and  see  if  you 
 bring  these  things  to  the  table  share
[16:15] the  video  with  a  friend  who  it  might 
 help  and  do  the  hard  work  especially 
 when  you  don't  feel  like  it
"
ZLde30A5xCE,"[00:00] bro  i  think  you're  all  a  little  gay  for 
 liking  this  hamza  hamza  hamza  y'all  need
[00:05] some  friends  bro  this  is  crazy  don't 
 manage  to  do  this  all  this  videos  are 
 like  every  day  you  have  to  improve  he's
[00:10] a  gym  bro  he  can  speak  eloquently  what 
 the  [ __ ]  you  watch  get  grow  the  [ __ ]  up
[00:15] bro  do  you  not  have  friends  you  don't 
 have  friends  do  you  all  of  you  are  just 
 18  year  old  and  lonely  bro
[00:23] i  thought  me  and  sneaker  were  cool  i 
 have  him  on  whatsapp  and  i've  connected 
 really  really  well  with  his  brother  who 
 we'll  speak  about  soon  and  before  we
[00:29] continue  on  with  this  video  i  really 
 just  want  to  say  like  i  love  sneako's 
 old  videos  i  love  his  old  vibe  i  just
[00:34] think  that  he  might  have  went  down  the 
 wrong  path  nico  made  a  reaction  video  to 
 our  movement  where  he  was  insulting
[00:40] towards  the  young  men  who  were  on 
 self-improvement  saying  that  they're  on 
 like  lesser  stages  than  life  than  he  is
[00:45] and  that  he  doesn't  need  it  anymore  all 
 of  you  are  just  18  year  old  and  lonely 
 bro  and  you're  in  college  and  [ __ ]  you
[00:50] want  to  get  a  job  you're  like  i  need  to 
 do  something  with  my  life  and  this  guy's 
 like  just  he's  feeding  that  mentality
[00:55] which  is  good  it's  good  to  push  people 
 but  bro  i  don't  need  this  i'm  not  at
[01:00] that  point  the  first  thing  that  i  really 
 picked  up  on  was  how  like  fragile  i've 
 never  wanted  to  say  this  you know
[01:05] fragile  masculinity  but  how  how  fragile 
 his  masculinity  seemed  when  he  saw  a 
 video  of  me  stretching  on  his  live
[01:10] stream  he  watched  like  a  day  in  the  life 
 video  that  i  made  on  my  second  channel 
 where  i'm  showing  like  my  life  in
[01:15] thailand  i'm  training  really  hard  and  i 
 started  the  day  with  some  like  light 
 stretching  it's  something  that  i  wanted 
 to  get  more  consistent  in  and  he  just
[01:20] fully  fully  like  called  me  gay  for  it 
 called  me  weird  for  posting  that  video 
 and  saying  like  oh  you  like  he  brought 
 his  friends  look  look  how  gay  it  is  like
[01:25] look  wearing  shorts  and  it  looks  kind  of 
 gay  bro  get  the  go  bro  bro  bro  that's
[01:30] crazy  imagine  if  i  made  these  videos 
 would  you  still  respect  me  in  short
[01:35] shorts  and  i  think  we're  all  kind  of 
 surprised  that  he  has  this  viewpoint 
 because  sneaker  himself  was  even  a  bit
[01:40] of  an  athlete  he  used  to  box  and  lift 
 heavy  weights  so  he  knows  the  importance 
 of  stretching  and  keeping  your  body 
 mobile  stretching  is  really  important  i
[01:47] neglected  it  for  years  but  now  i'm 
 training  harder  than  ever  i'm  lifting 
 heavy  weights  six  times  a  week  i'm 
 training  muay  thai  six  times  a  week  i'm
[01:53] signing  up  for  an  amateur  muay  thai 
 fight  so  that's  gonna  be  a  very  very 
 interesting  chapter  of  my  life  and  so  of
[01:58] course  with  everything  that  we're  doing 
 we  go  to  the  gym  so  often  stretching  and 
 mobility  work  being  flexible  is  so  so
[02:03] important  so  i  was  really  surprised  by 
 sneaker  thought  it  was  like  gay  to 
 stretch  and  then  i  realized  he  doesn't 
 go  to  the  gym  anymore  in  the  react  video
[02:09] that  he  posted  on  his  second  channel  he 
 criticized  us  and  our  movements  that 
 self-improvement  is  cringe  it's  for
[02:14] people  who  are  in  this  is  his  words 
 lesser  stages  of  life  than  he  is  nico 
 your  ego  is  blinding  you  you  are  at  that
[02:20] lesser  stage  you  are  not  a  man  of 
 character  you  cheated  on  your  last 
 girlfriend  you  have  no  integrity  you
[02:26] drink  alcohol  just  sat  there  by  yourself 
 that's  a  horrible  habit  you  watched 
 another  guy  have  sex  with  your
[02:31] girlfriend  that's  weird  and  you  can  call 
 us  all  insecure  for  that  if  you  want 
 i've  seen  her  [ __ ]  other  men  and  it's
[02:36] just  like  that  was 
 imagine  seeing  the  girl  you  love  like 
 get  [ __ ]  get  [ __ ]  love  her  it  was
[02:42] literally  like  this  far  away  from  me 
 we're  on  the  same  bed  i  was  with  his 
 girl  he  was  with  my  girlfriend
[02:47] yeah  yeah  what's  wrong  with  you  you're 
 odd  you  sat  on  the  bed  while  she  got 
 [ __ ]  i  i  was  there  too  i  mean
[02:54] i  got  up 
 were  you  [ __ ]  his  girl  i  i  was  not 
 [ __ ]  with  her  so  you  just  sat  there  i
[02:59] wonder  what  goes  on  in  your  brain  you 
 don't  meditate  you  don't  journal  you 
 don't  even  go  to  the  gym  anymore  tanika
[03:04] you  say  that  you're  past  that  point  in 
 life  where  you  need  self-improvement  i 
 say  this  not  as  an  insult  but  i  think
[03:09] you're  being  delusional  and  you  know 
 what's  weird  literally  just  like  a  day 
 before  nico  made  this  video  about  me  he
[03:14] posted  this  celebratory  post  on 
 instagram  with  him  like  he  had  three 
 youtube  plaques  he  had  like  two  silver
[03:19] ones  for  100k  and  one  gold  one  and  i 
 literally  bro  i  saw  that  post  i 
 literally  showed  it  to  my  friends  i  was
[03:24] like  bro  he's  like  he's  such  a  sick 
 creator  and  like  i  want  to  take  a 
 picture  just  like  this  because  i've  got 
 like  two  silver  plaques  from  youtube
[03:29] from  my  main  channel  for  my  second 
 channel  and  i'm  getting  closer  and 
 closer  to  getting  that  gold  one  for  one 
 million  and  so  i  saw  that  picture  and  i
[03:34] visualized  it  for  myself  and  i  was  so 
 hyped  for  him  but  then  after  all  this  i 
 did  some  investigating  sneaker  your
[03:39] channel's  dying  your  daily  views  have 
 dropped  significantly  you  did  just  cross 
 over  the  one  million  mark  and  i  didn't
[03:45] really  feel  so  proud  of  you  for  that  but 
 i  had  to  look  through  some  of  your 
 videos  and  anyone  else  can  do  this  most
[03:50] of  the  comments  from  your  subscribers 
 were  negative  the  old  sneaker  used  to 
 post  thought-provoking  videos  he  was
[03:56] literally  like  a  modern  day  philosopher 
 now  it  just  seems  like  you  watch  too 
 much  red  pill  and  routine  content  and  it
[04:01] seems  like  you're  trying  to  be 
 controversial  to  get  those  views  to 
 spike  up  again  the  old  sneaker  would 
 post  beautifully  edited  like  very
[04:07] creative  videos  like  the  editing  that 
 you  would  do  in  those  videos  was  so 
 artistically  impressive  your  videos  used
[04:13] to  feel  like  a  cinematic  masterpiece  and 
 now  you're  just  sitting  there  reacting 
 to  other  youtubers  dishing  out  insults
[04:19] whilst  you're  literally  drunk  brother 
 you  need  self-improvement  now  more  than 
 ever  now  i  speak  directly  to  my  boys  and
[04:25] to  eco  subscribers  if  they  do  find  this 
 video  boys  make  sure  you  do  not  get 
 complacent  self-improvement  setting
[04:31] goals  setting  challenges  for  yourself 
 experiencing  discomfort  is  what  grows 
 you  as  a  man  if  you  stop
[04:37] self-improvement  if  you  stop  the  good 
 habits  if  you  stop  meditating  if  you 
 stop  going  to  the  gym  what  happens  you
[04:42] lose  those  gains  this  is  for  life  it 
 seems  to  us  that  sneaker  got  complacent 
 he  achieved  a  fantastic  level  of  success
[04:48] that  i  respect  so  much  but  then  at  some 
 point  in  the  last  one  or  two  years  i'm 
 not  sure  exactly  when  he  just  took  his
[04:54] foot  off  the  gas  pedal  he  stopped 
 improving  himself  and  he  started 
 indulging  in  pleasures  instead  of
[04:59] staying  purposeful  what  i  see  from  this 
 sad  image  is  a  young  man  who  has  no 
 purpose  and  we  all  know  how  sad  of  a
[05:05] life  that  is  and  now  my  message  directly 
 to  sneakers  nico  i  know  that  you're 
 watching  this  video  i  know  that  you  love
[05:10] youtube  you've  probably  been  reacting 
 live  to  this  video  acting  like  a  proper 
 jeffrey  getting  like  insulting  getting 
 loud  and  swearing  and  saying  oh  this  is
[05:16] gay  like  oh  i'm  making  fun  of  me  like  oh 
 my  god  he's  wearing  gold  or  some  [ __ ]  i 
 know  that  you're  probably  doing  that 
 right  now  i  just  want  to  remind  you  that
[05:22] you  are  an  influencer  you  know  that 
 quote  that  we  are  the  average  of  the 
 five  people  we  spend  time  with  i  think
[05:27] the  updated  version  of  that  quote  is 
 that  we  are  the  average  of  the  content 
 that  we  consume  people  are  becoming  more
[05:33] like  you  when  they  watch  your  content  i 
 think  you  should  take  the  responsibility 
 to  just  keep  in  mind  to  always
[05:38] try  to  be  a  positive  influence  on  the 
 lives  of  your  viewers  i  urge  you  to  have
[05:43] humility  to  be  able  to  see  your 
 weaknesses  and  improve  on  them  instead 
 of  staying  complacent  to  improve  your
[05:48] life's  nico  it  starts  with  humility 
 humility  is  the  skill  of  defying  your
[05:53] ego  the  awareness  of  knowing  that  you 
 have  things  to  improve  on  i  highly 
 suggest  that  you  read  the  book  ego  is
[05:58] the  enemy  by  ryan  holiday  i  really  hope 
 that  you  reconsider  the  importance  of 
 self-improvement  i  deeply  deeply  care
[06:04] about  young  men  getting  onto  this 
 pathway  getting  onto  this  journey 
 joining  our  community  and  improving 
 themselves  especially  their  mental
[06:10] health  i  don't  want  to  keep  seeing  you 
 or  anyone  else  go  down  that  dark  path  of 
 purposelessness  you  and  your  boys  are
[06:16] always  welcome  in  my  movements  and  boys 
 do  you  know  who's  part  of  our  movement 
 this  is  where  it gets  interesting
[06:21] forgive  me  for  sounding  insulting  but 
 the  upgraded  version  of  synecos  nico  2.0
[06:26] his  brother  vince  nico's  brother  is  like 
 the  og  he  lifts  heavy  weights  he's  got  a 
 very  impressive  physique  he's  a
[06:31] successful  entrepreneur  he  stars  in 
 plays  and  he's  steered  clear  from  drugs 
 and  he  really  seems  to  live  a  life  of
[06:37] like  integrity  and  values  and  virtue 
 that's  a  young  man  that  we  respect  me 
 and  sneaker's  brother  vince  really  get
[06:42] on  and  vince  actually  wrote  a  class 
 project  about  me  and  my  journey  on  the 
 video  where  sneaker  was  criticizing
[06:48] self-improvement  in  our  movements  he 
 even  mentioned  that  his  brother  was  like 
 on  all  of  the  self-improvement  habits
[06:53] this  is  vincent  vincent  be  [ __ ] 
 stretching  the  [ __ ]  off  in  the  [ __ ] 
 store  bro  what  an  interesting  sight  is
[06:59] to  see  the  younger  brother  who  is  the 
 adonis  and  the  older  brother  who's  the 
 jeffrey  sniko  you  used  to  be  one  of  my
[07:05] all-time  favorite  youtubers  i  remember 
 this  one  period  where  i  literally  went 
 through  your  channel  and  watched  all  of
[07:11] your  old  videos  but  recently  i  found 
 myself  just  not  clicking  on  your  content 
 again  just  thinking  oh  more  drama  more
[07:16] obnoxiousness  and  so  i  think  it's  time 
 for  me  to  unsubscribe  and  use  the  time 
 that  i  was  spending  watching  your  videos
[07:22] on  my  own  self-improvement  journey  i 
 wish  you  the  best  sneaker  if  you're 
 watching  this  video  and  you  don't  know 
 who  i  am  or  the  movement  that  i'm
[07:28] leading  here  my  name  is  hamza  i  help 
 young  men  go  through  the  geoffrey  to 
 adonis  transformation  through
[07:33] self-improvements  we  are  literally  a 
 cult  of  young  men  who  refuse  to  continue
[07:38] living  like  the  weak  comfortable  lives 
 that  we've  had  we  don't  want  to  be 
 feminine  anymore  we  want  to  be  more 
 masculine  we're  done  watching  porn  and
[07:43] playing  video  games  and  taking  drugs  we 
 want  to  go  out  there  and  achieve 
 something  that  gives  us  confidence  if
[07:48] that  interests  you  you  can  subscribe  to 
 our  channel  if  you  want  to  you'll 
 probably  like  this  video  right  here  do
[07:53] the  hard  work  especially  when  you  don't 
 feel  like  it
"
XUgqt_Aeg9Q,"[00:00] there  she  is  Jeffrey  it's  Jessica  how 
 can  I  start  a  conversation  with  her 
 she's  walking  here  quick  well  what
[00:05] should  I  say  what  should  I  say  oh  man 
 she's  walked  past  already  she  didn't 
 even  look  at  me  next  time  definitely
[00:10] I'll  speak  to  her  Adonis 
 the  most  beautiful  feminine  woman  walks
[00:15] past  Adonis  what  do  you  think  he  does  he 
 walks  right  up  to  her  and  starts  a
[00:20] conversation  Jeffrey's  watching  from  the 
 bushes  how  that  looks  so  easy  how  did  he 
 do  that  he  just  went  up  and  he  just  said
[00:26] something  what  did  he  last  night  I  was 
 just  at  Mike  thurston's  place  recording 
 a  podcast  with  him  he's  like  really
[00:31] attractive  really  successful  like  Chad 
 looking  type  of  guy  and  he  even  said 
 that  for  him  growing  up  the  hardest  part
[00:37] was  to  break  the  ice  with  a  girl 
 breaking  the  ice  kind  of  means  like 
 starting  the  conversation  and  when  he 
 said  that  I  realized  that  a  lot  of  guys
[00:43] actually  struggle  with  the  first  like 
 I'm  not  talking  about  you're  the  deep 
 relationship  or  even  the  date  I'm 
 talking  about  literally  okay  you've  seen
[00:49] her  how  do  you  open  your  mouth  to  say 
 anything  to  her  that's  honestly  the 
 hardest  part  for  most  guys  a  lot  of  guys
[00:55] actually  once  they've  had  an  okay  little 
 conversation  they  can  go  from  there  but 
 so  many  guys  will  see  the  girl  that
[01:00] actually  they're  attracted  to  they'll 
 hold  eye  contact  with  a  girl  they'll 
 smile  at  the  girl  the  girl  will  smile 
 back  and  they'll  say  nothing  because
[01:06] they're  just  not  used  to  like  opening  up 
 their  mouth  and  I've  had  this  before 
 I've  been  in  Starbucks  with  my  sister 
 see  a  cute  girl  from  like  the  side  she
[01:12] looks  at  me  I  look  at  her  she  looks  away 
 I  know  what's  gonna  happen  when  a  girl 
 looks  away  when  you've  made  icons  like 
 Don't  Look  Away  she'll  look  back  again
[01:17] this  time  smile  give  her  like  a  little 
 cheeky  smile  I  gave  her  a  smile  she 
 smiled  at  me  and  I  had  this  thought  okay 
 I  could  stand  up  right  now  probably  like
[01:23] Chad  move  and  walk  across  Starbucks  and 
 go  interrupt  her  conversation  with  her 
 mother  and  you  know  just  says
[01:30] I  could  have  done  that  I  did  nothing  I 
 sat  there  just  coping  like  once  I 
 finished  my  drink  then  I'll  go  over
[01:35] there  she  stands  up  with  her  mom  they're 
 about  to  leave  she's  walking  out  and  I'm 
 literally  thinking  wait  I  could  run  up 
 right  now  and  just  Chase  it  down  come
[01:40] here  nothing  happens  I  don't  end  of 
 story  I  don't  regret  it  that  much  I'm 
 past  that  stage  of  like  really  feeling
[01:45] like  if  I  don't  go  speak  to  a  girl  but  I 
 have  been  there  and  so  many  guys  have 
 every  guy  has  this  story  when  you've
[01:51] looked  into  like  cold  approaching  and 
 speaking  to  girls  where  there's  a  girl 
 that  you  could  have  approached  you  could 
 have  spoke  to  and  you  didn't  and  then
[01:56] you  realize  that  regretting  that 
 decision  of  not  speaking  to  her 
 literally  would  have  felt  worse  than  her
[02:01] just  rejecting  you  every  guy  gets  this 
 life  lesson  that  regret  is  worse  than 
 rejection  and  so  today  we're  gonna  solve
[02:07] a  way  that  you  no  longer  regret  seeing  a 
 girl  and  not  speaking  to  her  I  want  you 
 at  the  end  of  this  video  to  be  equipped
[02:12] that  next  time  you  see  a  girl  you're 
 actually  gonna  not  only  be  able  to  do  it 
 but  you'll  actually  feel  good  going  up
[02:18] to  her  to  speak  to  her  now  I  started  my 
 cold  approach  like  starting 
 conversations  with  girls  around  my  time
[02:23] in  University  although  it  was  still 
 difficult  it  was  a  lot  easier  because  it 
 was  night  time  it  was  in  university  it
[02:28] was  in  parties  or  in  nightclubs  and 
 everyone's  drinking  so  it  was  kind  of 
 like  way  easier  to  walk  up  to  a  girl  in
[02:33] the  middle  of  a  nightclub  and  go  speak 
 to  her  like  you  know  outside  of  like  the 
 um Dance  Floor  she's  next  to  the  bar  or
[02:38] she's  outside  in  the  smoking  area 
 smoking  area  was  always  my  favorite  to 
 go  speak  to  girls  and  obviously  this  is 
 like  the  generate  stuff  but  it  really
[02:44] came  in  handy  because  this  is  an 
 important  skill  you  might  be  thinking  oh 
 I  don't  care  about  getting  pillows  I'm 
 like  oh  this  is  well  how  are  you  gonna
[02:50] meet  the  woman  who's  supposed  to  be  your 
 wife  how  are  you  going  to  meet  the  woman 
 who's  gonna  have  your  kids  you're 
 obviously  not  gonna  meet  her  on  only
[02:55] fans  or  something  you're  going  to  meet 
 her  in  person  and  you're  gonna  need  to 
 walk  up  to  her  and  speak  to  her  out  yeah 
 so  no  matter  if  I've  practiced  this  in
[03:01] clubs  or  whatever  this  can  be  useful 
 even  if  you  literally  want  like  a  good 
 girl  like  a  wife  so  I  lived  that  life
[03:06] for  a  couple  of  years  where  I  was  going 
 to  clubs  and  I  was  practicing  this  you 
 know  starting  conversations  with  girls 
 and  then  when  I  left  that  City  and  I
[03:11] went  home  you  know  I  started  all  this 
 stuff  often  became  productive  dopamine 
 detox  and  stuff  I  still  wanted  to  level
[03:16] up  my  cold  approach  skill  so  I'm  not 
 even  lying  bro  I'd  literally  just  go  on 
 like  a  half  an  hour  walk  every  day  and
[03:21] literally  just  go  approach  I  know  it's 
 like  silly  like  I  don't  I  wouldn't 
 suggest  doing  this  because  it  was  such  a 
 time  consuming  it's  not  worth  it  but  I'm
[03:27] kind  of  glad  that  I  did  not  that  it  was 
 really  high  Roi  but  I  learned  quite  a 
 lot  that  I  can  teach  you  right  now  so
[03:32] what  I  realized  is  that  there's  a 
 three-step  process  like  to  start  this 
 conversation  with  a  girl  and  it's  gonna
[03:37] seem  so  detailed  but  just  trust  me  on 
 this  if  you  can  understand  this  three 
 puts  that  process  it's  so  easy  the  first
[03:42] step  is  like  when  you  actually  see  the 
 girl  that  you  now  are  thinking  okay  and 
 I'm  probably  gonna  approach  her  the 
 reason  why  this  is  an  important  step  is
[03:48] because  you  literally  need  to  go  and  see 
 the  girl  in  your  [ __ ]  Vision  to  go 
 and  approach  her  most  guys  live  a  life
[03:54] where  they  don't  even  see  girls  like 
 maybe  you  do  in  school  for  example  or  in 
 the  workplace  but  so  many  guys  spend
[03:59] most  of  their  days  just  inside  looking 
 on  the  computer  screen  and  so  you  don't 
 see  women  with  their  own  eyes  maybe  you
[04:04] see  them  on  Instagram  but  that  doesn't 
 count  we're  talking  about  Regal  not  like 
 digital  [ __ ]  you  need  to  be  outside  more
[04:09] now  I  did  this  by  literally  just  going 
 on  a  daily  walk  and  just  finding  women 
 to  go  speak  to  there's  cringe  I  wouldn't 
 recommend  this  but  what  I  would  do  and  I
[04:15] would  suggest  to  you  which  all  high 
 value  guys  do  is  be  open  to  speaking  to 
 girls  as  you  go  about  your  normal
[04:21] day-to-day  life  so  don't  leave  your 
 house  to  go  and  try  and  find  some  women 
 to  go  speak  to  you  that's  just  sad
[04:26] honestly  like  I  look  back  and  almost 
 cringe  when  I  did  this  but  I'm  glad  that 
 I  can  you  know  give  you  the  experience 
 don't  go  out  looking  for  women  but  go
[04:32] out  of  your  house  to  go  to  the  gym  to  go 
 shopping  to  do  this  to  do  this  to  do 
 this  and  there  in  those  environments
[04:37] where  you  were  gonna  go  to  anyway  speak 
 to  those  girls  so  get  out  into  the 
 environment  which  is  the  gym  or  the  cafe
[04:42] you  know  things  that  you  do  outside  of 
 your  house  you  need  to  specifically  just 
 be  outside  of  your  house  I  know  this  is
[04:48] silly  but  I  guarantee  you're  not  better 
 than  this  I  guarantee  you're  watching 
 this  thinking  oh  I'm  just  going  to  skip 
 over  I  guarantee  you're  not  better  than
[04:54] this  I  guarantee  that  you  would  see  a 
 boost  to  your  dating  life  and  the  amount 
 of  women  that  you're  speaking  to  if  you
[04:59] actually  set  the  intention  to  get 
 outside  of  your  house  more  you  spend 
 most  of  your  days  in  your  house  on  your
[05:04] phone  on  the  laptop  wondering  why  you 
 can't  get  girls  or  wondering  why  all 
 girls  have  thoughts  because  you're 
 meeting  them  all  on  Instagram  or  on
[05:09] Tinder  or  something  you  need  to  simply 
 be  outside  your  house  more  the  easiest 
 way  way  to  do  go  for  a  walk  every  day
[05:14] the  best  way  go  into  the  city  where 
 there's  a  lot  of  people  and  be  around 
 those  areas  so  you  get  outside  and  now
[05:20] you  actually  have  women  in  Your  Vision 
 like  you're  gonna  actually  see  women 
 that's  that  one  most  guys  won't  follow 
 this  step  they'll  be  interested  in  the
[05:26] other  two  steps  maybe  they've  already 
 skipped  over  and  they're  gonna  keep 
 wondering  like  oh  this  is  it's  not 
 working  for  me  it's  because  of  my 
 genetics  and  stuff  if  the  guy  skipped
[05:32] this  step  I  guarantee  the  next  two  steps 
 won't  work  once  you  have  seen  the  woman 
 that  you  want  to  approach  and  honestly
[05:37] you  only  get  like  a  split  second  first 
 you  see  look  at  this  is  the  girl  you 
 want  to  go  speak  to  the  way  to  start 
 this  conversation  and  I'm  talking  with  a
[05:42] stranger  right  if  there's  a  girl  who's 
 in  your  class  and  you  you've  got  some 
 similarities  it's  a  lot  easier  to  speak 
 to  her  because  you  can  just  say  oh  have
[05:48] you  done  the  homework  today  and  start 
 the  conversation  but  I'm  saying  let's 
 teach  you  how  to  speak  to  a  complete 
 stranger  so  that  it's  actually  easier  to
[05:53] speak  to  like  female  friends  or  anyone 
 else  that  you  know  right  so  there's  a 
 girl  there  which  was  step  one  that  you 
 see  her  step  two  which  is  so  like  again
[06:00] specific  but  trust  me  this  is  so 
 important  step  two  as  soon  as  you  see 
 that  girl  is  literally  command  your  legs
[06:05] to  walk  towards  her  this  is  the  most 
 important  like  step  and  trust  me  if  you 
 don't  do  this  step  it  won't  happen  you
[06:11] must  command  your  legs  to  walk  towards 
 her  without  thinking  anything  as  soon  as 
 you  walk  to  water  you  start  to  feel  a
[06:17] lot  more  bold  when  you  see  that  girl  and 
 you  spend  some  time  thinking  okay  should 
 I  approach  what  should  I  say  what  should 
 I  say  trust  me  when  I  say  that  you  won't
[06:23] end  up  approaching  what  you  need  to  do 
 is  walk  over  there  without  a  pre-built 
 sentence  in  your  mind  you  see  that  girl
[06:29] maybe  10  meters  away  and  you  literally 
 command  your  legs  walk  towards  a  walk 
 towards  or  walk  towards  her  and  then 
 part  of  step  two  is  to  also  get  her
[06:35] attention  physically  by  doing  something 
 like  yo  excuse  me  like  this  stick  your 
 hand  up  and  shoot  so  she  sees  you  it's
[06:40] absolutely  normal  in  this  step  and  she 
 might  be  a  bit  you  know  weird  a  bit 
 scared  straight  away  this  happens  he
[06:45] literally  I've  even  seen  videos  of 
 Chad's  like  approach  girls  and  she  gets 
 a  bit  scared  because  it's  quite  abnormal 
 right  usually  when  someone  stops  you  on
[06:51] the  street  they're  quite  Shady  people 
 they're  scammers  they're  asking  for 
 money  or  something  so  it's  normal  so 
 when  you  do  see  her  instant  reaction
[06:57] don't  be  like  scared  by  I  don't  like  you 
 know  looking  at  her  body  or  anything 
 just  just  assume  oh  yeah  you  know  a
[07:02] little  scared  girl  whatever  yeah  ask  it 
 don't  ask  you  oh  I'm  sorry  but  that's 
 fine  that's  step  two  step  two  is  so
[07:07] important  most  guys  again  won't  even  do 
 this  because  they'll  see  the  girl  and 
 they  think  no  no  but  I  can't  go  over 
 yeah  I've  got  to  think  of  something  no
[07:12] specifically  you  need  to  walk  to  water 
 before  you  have  thought  of  something 
 because  when  you  think  of  something  it's
[07:17] too  late  you  can't  sit  there  and  think 
 oh  what  should  I  say  should  I  approach 
 her  because  at  that  point  it's  gone  you 
 literally  see  her  from  step  one  step  two
[07:23] as  soon  as  you  see  her  literally  just 
 command  your  legs  just  walk  towards  and 
 I  know  you're  scared  because  you're 
 gonna  think  wait  what  do  I  say  though
[07:28] what  do  I  say  I'm  saying  trust  me  when  I 
 say  just  walk  towards  her  get  her 
 attention  yo  excuse  me  hello  excuse  me 
 something  like  this  now  at  step  three
[07:34] she  is  in  front  of  you  you  have  got  her 
 full  attention  she's  looking  directly  at 
 you  you're  looking  at  her  step  through
[07:39] say  something  now  the  thing  is  if  you're 
 waiting  for  me  to  say  okay  say  this 
 exactly  I  know  that  you're  never  gonna 
 do  good  with  women  you  know  why  because
[07:45] you  can't  treat  women  like  this  base 
 like  online  you  can  right  online  all 
 women  are  Bots  until  proven  otherwise
[07:50] online  like  all  women  are  literally  just 
 all  they  deserve  is  like  copy  and  paste 
 messages  up  until  she's  met  you  in 
 person  and  then  you  put  more  effort  in
[07:56] but  in  person  when  you  see  this  woman 
 you  can't  just  have  a  copy  and  paste 
 sentence  to  say  to  it  you  can  do  that  on 
 Tinder  you  can  do  that  on  Instagram  DMS
[08:02] but  in  person  you  can't  just  know  okay 
 the  first  thing  I'm  gonna  say  to  say 
 every  girl  that  I  approach  is  this 
 sentence  because  it  seems  fake  you  walk
[08:07] straight  up  and  whatever  naturally  comes 
 into  your  mind  I  found  that  when  you  let 
 your  brain  think  on  the  spot  you  you
[08:13] actually  do  a  lot  better  than  if  you've 
 preemptively  thought  of  this  and  your 
 brains  kind  of  disagree  right  now  and
[08:18] that  no  no  I'm  way  better  with 
 preparation  if  that  was  true  you  would 
 be  great  at  approaching  girls  anyway 
 wouldn't  you  you  wouldn't  need  this
[08:23] video  I  know  my  way  is  very  scary 
 because  I'm  literally  saying  okay  you 
 walk  towards  her  before  you  even  know
[08:28] what  you're  gonna  say  then  it  has  been 
 time  I'll  be  honest  with  you  there's 
 been  times  where  I  walked  over  to  a  girl 
 and  I  don't  even  know  what  I'm  about  to 
 say  I  stutter  or  something  and  I'm  like
[08:33] oh  sorry  I  thought  you  were  someone  else 
 and  then  she  goes  it's  embarrassing  it 
 happens  right  but  there's  been  a  lot  of 
 times  where  I'll  just  walk  towards  her
[08:38] and  instantly  my  brain  will  just  come 
 off  of  something  where  I  just  like  you 
 know  see  something  on  her  that  she's 
 wearing  or  I  say  something  or  there  was
[08:44] a  girl  who's  holding  like  a  bag  of  KFC  I 
 was  like  what  did  you  buy  what's  in 
 there  another  girl  recently  she's  like 
 taking  some  supplement  or  something  so  I
[08:49] walk  over  there  I'm  like  what  is  that 
 and  she  shows  me  it's  like  black  seed 
 oil  and  she's  telling  me  about  like  the 
 prophet  Muhammad  was  taking  this  and  it
[08:55] cured  all  diseases  or  something 
 literally  just  go  over  and  just  allow 
 your  brain  to  say  something  naturally 
 the  reason  why  this  seems  scary  is
[09:01] because  you  have  D  trained  your  brain's 
 natural  ability  to  be  good  in  a  social 
 conversation  and  now  you're  watching
[09:07] videos  on  like  social  anxiety  and  videos 
 like  titling 
 you  need  to  train  that  again  so  that  you
[09:12] can  actually  be  good  with  girls  and  so 
 follow  this  three-step  process  step  one 
 actually  see  her  get  outside  see  more
[09:18] women  in  person  step  two  command  your 
 legs  to  walk  towards  it  get  her 
 attention  yo  excuse  me  step  three  you're 
 already  there  now  just  allow  your  brain
[09:24] to  say  some  kind  of  observational 
 question  to  her  you  might  be  pissed  off 
 because  you're  thinking  oh  man  I  wish 
 she  just  told  me  like  something  to  say
[09:29] the  issue  with  that  that  this 
 pre-prepared  question  is  that  this  will 
 actually  make  you  less  likely  to  go  on
[09:36] approach  because  then  you  start  to 
 practice  the  senses  in  your  mind  and  it 
 adds  to  the  mental  turmoil  if  right  now
[09:41] you  I  just  tell  you  okay  just  go  up  even 
 if  you're  not  gonna  say  anything  just  go 
 up  and  you'll  get  some  experience  of  you
[09:46] know  walking  towards  a  girl  and  getting 
 her  attention  that's  still  positive  but 
 if  you  won't  even  go  up  because  you're 
 overthinking  about  wait  should  I  say
[09:52] this  that  that  special  copying  space 
 sentence  should  I  say  it  what  if  I 
 started  when  I  say  it  and  you  don't  end 
 up  doing  it  the  three-step  process  you
[09:58] can  literally  go  out  and  try  this  today 
 and  I  guarantee  you  will  have  better 
 results  starting  conversations  with 
 girls  than  you've  ever  had  before  click
[10:03] and  watch  this  video  about  dating  right 
 now  do  the  hard  way  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah

8zUGEcgBDUA,"[00:00] how  about  we  start  2024  by  building  a 
 $373  a  day  business  together  live  in  the
[00:08] space  of  a  week  so  look  my  name  is  Iman 
 gaji  and  I've  been  running  multiple 
 online  businesses  over  the  last  7  years
[00:15] and  I  guess  you  could  say  that  I've 
 learned  a  thing  or  two  during  this  time
[00:20] mainly  the  fact  that  building  a 
 successful  online  business  these  days 
 really  isn't  as  hard  as  most  people  make
[00:27] it  out  to  be  quite  frankly  most  people 
 just  over  complicate  things  because  at
[00:32] the  end  of  the  day  it  really  just  comes 
 down  to  three  simple  components  now
[00:38] separately  they  don't  do  much  but  when 
 you  put  them  together  that's  when  the
[00:43] real  magic  happens  and  that's  what  I'm 
 going  to  show  you  how  to  do  live  over
[00:49] the  space  of  one  week  and  I  know  for 
 some  these  may  sound  like  big  promises
[00:54] and  there's  no  shortage  of  people  out 
 there  willing  to  make  these  big  promises 
 now  I  actually  did  something  similar  to
[01:00] this  last  year  but  it  was  a  private 
 in-person  event  and  people  went  crazy
[01:05] for  it  and  this  year  I'm  doing  it  again 
 except  online  entirely  free  and  much
[01:11] better  so  from  January  15th  to  January 
 22nd  I  hosting  my  times  up  event  again
[01:17] this  is  totally  free  and  I  decided  to 
 make  it  online  this  time  and  over  the 
 course  of  a  week  I'm  going  to  show  you
[01:23] how  to  put  together  these  three 
 components  so  that  we  can  build  a 
 six-figure  business  together  in  the
[01:30] quickest  time  possible  and  it  doesn't 
 require  any  startup  capital  or  any
[01:35] previous  work  experience  and  I'm  going 
 to  walk  you  through  the  exact 
 step-by-step  process  of  how  to  do  all  of
[01:40] this  from  scratch  now  all  you  have  to  do 
 to  save  a  spot  is  click  the  link  around
[01:46] this  video  and  register  the  idea  is  by 
 the  end  of  the  week  you  will  have  a 
 fully  functioning  business  up  and
[01:52] running  ready  to  pay  you  anywhere  from 
 $1,000  to  $10,000  a  month  reoccurring
[01:57] nobody  else  out  there  has  helped  as  many 
 many  people  as  I  have  I've  documented
[02:02] the  entire  Journey  since  I  was  15  years 
 old  on  my  YouTube  building  my  businesses
[02:07] and  if  you've  been  following  me  for  any 
 period  of  time  you've  likely  heard  of  my
[02:12] many  success  stories  in  the  past  like 
 how  I  helped  vaclav  who  went  from 
 delivering  Uber  Eats  back  in  March  to
[02:18] making  $10,000  a  month  in  may  only  two 
 short  months  after  he  understood  and
[02:23] implemented  the  three  components  I'm 
 going  to  tell  you  about  so  if  that 
 sounds  like  something  you'd  be
[02:28] interested  in  make  sure  to  save  your 
 spot  as  soon  as  possible  before  they
[02:33] fill  up  and  when  you  register  you're 
 also  going  to  get  instant  access  to  this 
 goal  setting  work  sheeet  so  that  you  can
[02:38] set  your  goals  the  right  way  for  2024 
 then  during  our  one  week  event  I'm  going
[02:45] to  show  you  how  to  put  together  the 
 ultimate  action  plan  to  turn  those  goals
[02:50] into  reality  and  make  2024  your  year  so 
 save  your  spot  now  get  your  goal  setting

iZhp1PKn4PE,"[00:00] Jeffrey's  just  about  to  post  his 
 comments  he's  road  to  your  beautiful  to
[00:05] a  girl  on  Instagram  and  he's  gonna 
 comment  it  publicly
[00:10] Jeffrey  I'm  not  sure  that's  a  good  idea 
 and  he  sweated  and  he's  shaking  and  his
[00:16] heart's  beating  fast  and  his  finger  goes 
 down  to  post 
 and  then  suddenly
[00:21] someone  stops  him  someone  saves  him  from 
 embarrassing  himself  who  could  it  be
[00:27] Adonis 
 it  only  sees  young  Jeffrey  making  the
[00:32] mistake  there's  so  many  young  guys  make 
 publicly  commented  on  a  girl's  picture
[00:38] and  saying  you're  beautiful  or  even 
 worse  pretending  to
[00:43] like  something  about  that  girl  which 
 isn't  her  appearance  and  so  they  comment 
 oh  wow  nice  nice  plant  pot  in  the
[00:50] background  oh  whoa  is  that  is  that  a 
 poster  behind  you  this  band  because  I
[00:57] like  this  but  they  don't 
 Dennis  is  Gonna  Save  Jeffrey
[01:03] and  so  day  by  day  Adonis  teaches  Jeffrey 
 exactly  how  to  master  the  art  of
[01:10] compliments  in  a  woman 
 and  it  works
[01:16] Jeffrey  actually  gets  his  first  ever 
 girlfriend 
 and  he  gets  to  live  this  terrific  life
[01:23] of  beautiful  memories 
 their  first  date  their  10th  date  the
[01:29] hundredth  dates 
 is  genuinely 
 actually  really  happy  with  himself
[01:38] and  so  one  day  Jeffrey  is  in  a  beautiful 
 restaurant  with  a  waterfall  View
[01:44] sat  with  his  woman 
 with  this  new  self-image  as  this  guy
[01:49] who's  actually 
 intelligent  and  wise  and  mature  and
[01:56] sophisticated  he's  got  a  beautiful  woman 
 on  his  arms  who  actually  really  likes 
 him
[02:04] and  in  this  restaurant  on  this  day 
 the  corner  of  his  eye  Jeffrey  spots
[02:10] Adonis  just  reading  a  newspaper  to  the 
 side
[02:15] and  Donna  sees  Jeffrey  and  this  woman 
 and  they  both  just  give  each  other  a
[02:20] little  nod 
 I'm  going  to  tell  you  about  my  first
[02:25] ever  cold  approach  so  if  you  visualize 
 me
[02:30] awkward 
 skinny  fat  little  brown  kid 
 who's  traumatized  is  watching  because
[02:36] like  cold  approach  videos  on  YouTube 
 I'll  go  up  and  compliment  her  that's  a
[02:41] really  really  good  idea 
 right  okay  so  I'm  gonna  try  this 
 me  and  one  of  my  friends  go  to  the  town
[02:48] center  we  take  the  bus  there  and 
 everything 
 and  I'm  already  nervous  by  the  way
[02:55] we're  walking  around  you  know  Alhambra 
 there's  a  girl  there  no  no  no  she's 
 she's  busy  no  no  she's  she's  ugly  like
[03:01] she  wasn't  ugly  oh  no  she's  uh  she's 
 working  no  she  wasn't  working  there  just 
 excuse  after  excuse  after  excuse  finally
[03:07] it's  almost  time  for  us  to  leave  we've 
 been  walking  around  for  like  two  hours 
 like  Predators  looking  for  like  women  to
[03:13] practice  on  it  I  mean  it  sounds  kind  of 
 crazy  I'm  only  16  okay  so  it's  not  that
[03:18] bad  but  eventually  I'm  just  thinking 
 like 
 I  think  I'm  just  gonna  do  it  my  friend 
 has  walked  up  a  little  bit  and  he  hasn't
[03:24] even  realized  that  I've  slowed  down 
 inside  of  this  shop  to  my  right  there's
[03:29] like  a  clothes  shop  there's  like  a 
 female  uh  assistant  you  know  who's
[03:34] working  there  she's  just  kind  of  like 
 stood  at  the  front  just  waiting  for 
 someone  to  come  in  to  greet  them  or 
 whatever  and  I  think  that  this  is  it  so
[03:41] I  literally  just  walk  in  again 
 skinny  fat  awkward  traumatized  16  year
[03:46] old  me  walking  already  nervous  and  stuff 
 oh 
 I  just  wanted  to  you're  you're  beautiful
[03:53] sorry
[03:58] I  literally  apologized 
 I  walked  out  you  know  in  a  second  of
[04:05] awkwardness  I  didn't  even  look  behind  me 
 I  didn't  even  wait  you  know  to  to  hear
[04:11] her 
 response  or  anything 
 a  few  seconds  of  awkwardness  and  and  you
[04:16] know  some  weird  kind  of  Shame  for  you 
 know  not  being  super  confident  with  what 
 I  did  but  then  after  that  I  actually
[04:21] started  to  feel  pretty  good  and  when  I 
 told  my  friend 
 um  he  had  stopped  and  he  looked  at me  he
[04:26] was  like  why  did  you  go  in  there  did  you 
 did  you  speak  to  her  I  said  yeah  I  did  I 
 said  she  was  beautiful  I  said  no  no  you
[04:31] didn't  like  we're  actually  kind  of  Happy
[04:39] and  you  know  it  was  on  the  same  day 
 when  I  was  still  16  years  old  literally
[04:44] the  same  day  that  we  ended  up  getting 
 the  bus  back  towards  his  house  and  on
[04:49] the  bus  there  was  two  girls  there 
 and  we  literally  thought  we  should  like 
 you  know  carry  on  the  momentum  we  end  up
[04:56] our  stop  was  the  next  one  but  then  the 
 bus  stopped  and  they  were  getting  off  so 
 we  pretty  much  followed  them  off  the  bus
[05:02] for  like  it  was  only  like  an  extra  it 
 was  only  like  broke  cold  approaching
[05:07] makes  you  [ __ ]  weird  but  it  makes  you 
 do  some  crazy  [ __ ]  like  yeah  so  we're 
 following  these  girls  off  the  bus  and
[05:17] um 
 it's  literally  only  like  an  extra  two 
 minute  walk  away  for  us  so  it's  kind  of 
 worth  it  I  guess  but  yeah  we  we  end  up
[05:23] going  off  and  the  momentum's  just  inside 
 of  me  and  so  it  was  so  much  easier  for
[05:29] me  to  kind  of  like  you  know  we  walked  in 
 front  of  the  girls  for  a  second  then  I 
 just  you  know  got  a  little  bit  more 
 confident  I  stopped  and  just  said  oh
[05:34] excuse  me  like  do  you  go  to  our  school  I 
 thought  I  recognized  it's  I  wasn't 
 smooth
[05:39] but  I  did  say  something  like  oh  you  know 
 do  you  go  to  law  school  I  didn't 
 recognize  you  or  does  your  sister  go  to
[05:44] oh  okay  but  you  you  so  where  are  you 
 from  what  are  you doing  today  and  I'm 
 pretty  sure  I  ended  up  getting  her
[05:50] number  which  was  the  first  cold  approach 
 number  that  I  had  ever  gotten  on  my
[05:56] first  ever  day  second  approach 
 the  momentum  carried  me  there  and  I  had
[06:02] a  really  good  mindset  about  this  where  I 
 didn't  feel  like  this
[06:09] huge  amount  of  like  shame  and  regret  and 
 you  know  a  lot  of  guys  will  go  out  there 
 to  cold  approach  and  they  feel  horrible
[06:15] after  they've  been 
 um  rejected  I  had  one  friend  who  I  was 
 kind  of  like  coaching
[06:21] and  when  he  went  and  he  was  honestly 
 quite  frankly  a  Chad  I'm  not  even  taking 
 the  piss  this  is  what  like  a  lot  of
[06:27] people  online  don't  realize  even  Chads 
 are  struggling  these  days  so  this  guy's 
 six  foot  two  attractive  guy  he  was
[06:33] getting  into  the  gym  and  everything  nice 
 style  and  he  ends  up  going  out  to  cold 
 approach  and  I  speak  to  him  the  next  day
[06:39] and  he's  like  I  got  [ __ ]  black  pilled 
 he's  like  no  I  will  never  go  out  and
[06:44] approach  again  I  will  net  no  I  will 
 never  do  I  might  wait  what  happened  it's 
 like  bro  like  he  spoke  like  four  women
[06:50] and  he  got  rejected  he  said  even  the  fat 
 [ __ ]  rejected  me  that  was  his  words 
 right  and  obviously  it  can  be  quite  like
[06:56] a  black  pill  moment  to  go  in  cold 
 approach  and  try  and  compliment  a  woman 
 and  she  doesn't  take  it  well  and  maybe
[07:01] you've  complimented  a  woman  online  or  in 
 school  these  days  it  seems  to  be  all
[07:06] online  and  she  leaves  it  on  red  or  she 
 ignores  it  or  worst  of  all  she  can  kind
[07:12] of  tell  that  she's  probably 
 screenshotted  it  and  she  sent  it  to 
 group  chat  of  people  that  you  know  and
[07:18] it  feels  really  awkward 
 that's  what  we're  going  to  cover  today
[07:23] I'm  going  to  try  and  help  you  to  master 
 the  art  of  complimenting  a  woman  now
[07:29] there  is  an  actionable  step  for  you 
 because  this  is  an  actionable  video 
 the  actionable  step  is  that  when  you  are
[07:35] ready  whilst  watching  this  video 
 you  must  go  and  actually  use  what  you're
[07:40] learning  here  that  means  that  there's 
 gonna  be  a  point  in  listen  up  okay 
 there's  gonna  be  a  point  in  this  video
[07:46] that  Something's  Gonna  click  for  you  and 
 your  brain  will  literally  start  to
[07:51] process  exactly  what  you  could  say  to 
 someone  and  it  seems  like  it  would  be
[07:56] effective  at  that  point 
 it  is  your  duty  to  stop  watching  the 
 video  and  go  and  do  that  thing  if  it's
[08:03] possible  if  obviously  it's  like  9  p.m 
 right  now  and  you  don't  want  to  you  know 
 you're  not  gonna  go  in  like 
 find  Our  House  in  the  night  obviously
[08:09] but  if  it's  online  for  example  if  that's 
 what  your  brain  is  processed  oh  yeah  I 
 could  send  her  this  message  this  girl
[08:14] that  I'm  speaking  to  do  it  immediately 
 it  serves  you  more  if  you  go  and  take
[08:20] action  even  though  it  might  be  bad  for 
 like  my  YouTube  metrics  if  you  like 
 pause  the  video  or  something  I'm  hoping
[08:25] that  you  come  back  and  finish  the  video 
 because  there'll  be  lots  of  extra  tips 
 and  the  last  chapter  that  we're  going  to
[08:30] cover  is  kind  of  Juicy  as  well  don't 
 jump  over  there  just  yet  let's  go  in 
 order  and  let's  start  first  of  all  with
[08:36] the  power  of  genuine  genuine  compliments 
 what's  the  actual  reason  why  we're  going
[08:42] to  be  complimenting  women  most  guys  get 
 this  wrong  because  most  guys  chances  are 
 you're  looking  at  this  quite  in  this
[08:48] binary  masculine  way  of  like  okay 
 complimenting  is  something  good  that  I
[08:54] can  do  why 
 think  about  it  why  do  you  actually  think 
 that  complimenting  a  woman  is  a  good
[08:59] thing  and  don't  don't  [ __ ]  by  the 
 way  because  this  is  when  every  guy  will 
 start  to  [ __ ]  answers  you'll  you'll
[09:05] know  if  you're  a  guy  who's  generally 
 like  a  little  [ __ ]  low  testosterone 
 because  you'll  start  to  cope  right  now 
 and  say  oh  yeah  because  you  know  I'm
[09:10] just  spreading  love  enjoy  like  bro  be 
 authentic  do  you  genuinely  care  about 
 spreading  love  and  joy  or  are  you  just
[09:16] trying  to  [ __ ]  are  you  just  trying  to 
 like  you  know  get  a  girl's  number  but  be 
 honest  which  one  is  it  don't  don't  lie
[09:22] for  most  guys  it's  gonna  be  here  right 
 we're  not  this  spiritually  enlightened 
 guy  who's  given  his  gift  to  everyone
[09:27] would  love  to  be  there  but  you  need  to 
 be  authentic  right  now  the  reason  why 
 you're  considering  complimenting  a  woman
[09:32] is  because  you  want  something  out  of  her 
 that's  gross  this  is  why  you've
[09:37] struggled  with  complimenting  girls  so 
 far  because  you're  gross 
 I  bet  you  didn't  expect  like  a  [ __ ]
[09:43] YouTuber  to  just  look  at  you  and  say 
 you're  gross  you  know  why  you're  gross 
 is  because  you're  trying  you're  needy
[09:48] you're  trying  to  get  something  out  of 
 the  act  of  complimenting  and  praising  a 
 woman  you're  trying  to  get  by  giving
[09:58] that's  not  fair  the  point  of  the  the 
 compliment  is  truly  to  give  to  her  but
[10:04] most  guys  have  it  in  their  mind  of  what 
 they  want  by  giving  this  compliment  and
[10:09] when  you  are  like  that  your  compliments 
 come  off  as  extremely  needy  so  if  you
[10:14] struggled  in  the  past  with  this  if 
 you've  gave  cringe  compliments  if  you 
 complimented  a  girl  and  she's  not
[10:19] replied  online  I  guarantee  it's  because 
 you  didn't  actually  just  want  to  give 
 the  compliments  you  wanted  her  reply  of
[10:27] course  you  did  that's  not  a  terrible 
 thing  right  it's  just  that  you  use 
 compliments  as  a  tool  in  your  your  like
[10:32] dating  toolbox  but  that's  not  the  way  to 
 really  go  about  it  the  compliment  is
[10:37] kind  of  like  a  gift  to  a  feminine  woman 
 and  so  this  is  what  I've  learned  from 
 the  book
[10:43] the  way  of  the  superior  man  by  David 
 data  so  in  this  book  in  chapter  17  I
[10:49] believe  it  is 
 it  chapter  17  let's  see 
 chapter  17  yes  I've  read  this  book  so
[10:56] many  times  I  know  the  chapters  By 
 Numbers  chapter  17  is  titled  praise  her
[11:01] and  I'm  going  to  read  you  a  little  part 
 of  this
[11:06] praise  magnifies  the  quality  of  your 
 woman  that  you  praise
[11:11] what  this  means  is  it's  like  positive 
 reinforcements
[11:16] you're  so  beautiful  when  you  smile  it's 
 much  more  effective  than  you're  so  ugly
[11:22] when  you  frown 
 praise  is  literal  food  for  feminine
[11:27] qualities  if  you  want  your  woman  to  grow 
 in  her  Radiance  health  happiness  love
[11:33] beauty  power  and  depth  then  praise  these 
 qualities  praise  them  daily  a  number  of
[11:39] times 
 praise  is  kind  of  like 
 your  tool  not  even  at  all  praise  is
[11:47] almost  like  a  watering  can 
 visualize  a  watering  can  you  can  use  for
[11:52] plants  and  when  you  water  the  plant  it 
 grows  but  when  you  praise  a  woman  you're
[11:58] watering  the  parts  of  her  that  you've 
 just  praised  so  that  they  grow  so  I'm
[12:03] just  going  to  give  you  a  very  quick  tip 
 here  by  the  way  an  actionable  step  this 
 is  why  you  should  never  ever  compliment
[12:09] a  woman  on  Instagram  ever  again  you  know 
 why 
 praise  is  positive  reinforcements
[12:15] what  you're  actually  doing  is  positively 
 reinforcing  her  to  keep
[12:20] posting  onto  Instagram 
 because  you  reinforce  the  behavior  when
[12:25] you  praise  when  you  compliment  a  woman 
 you  simply  just  reinforce  the  behavior 
 that  she's  doing  and  so  when  you  see  her
[12:31] post  on  Instagram  and  you  comment  or  you 
 DM  or  you  mention  it  to  her  the  next  day 
 you  see  her
[12:36] your  like  you're  positively  reinforcing 
 her  to  keep  posting  onto  Instagram 
 that's  probably  not  what  you  want  right
[12:42] it's  probably  the  opposite  you  probably 
 wanted  to  post  Less  on  Instagram  don't 
 you 
 the  way  you  you  compliment  a  woman  is
[12:48] you  really  think  to  yourself  What  is  the 
 characteristic  the  trait  the  behavior
[12:54] that  not  just  for  me  but  for  her  would 
 be  better  if  it  grew
[13:00] it  could  be  her 
 acting  feminine
[13:05] and  this  is  exactly  what  I  did 
 and  so  with  my  girl  she  had  like  you
[13:10] know  these  moments  of  being  very  very 
 feminine  and  she  was  like  cute  and  she'd 
 draw  me  stuff  and  when  I  saw  that  I
[13:16] thought  okay  that's  a  really  cool 
 Behavior  she  just  drew  like  there  was  a 
 time  when  I  was  like  um  on  my  laptop  or
[13:22] something  watching  like  some  kind  of 
 educational  business  thing  she's  just 
 off  to  my  side  she  wants  my  attention
[13:27] but  I'm  kind  of  focused  on  this  and 
 she's  just  kind  of  drawing  she's  like 
 look  I  drew  you  this  and  it's  just  like 
 a  nice  flower  and  I  praised  her  like  a
[13:33] crazy  amount  for  this  and  I'm  genuinely 
 seeing  her  smile  go  bigger  and  bigger 
 and  she's  almost  like  a  little  girl
[13:39] and  I'm  telling  you  right  here  right  now 
 one  by  one  every  single  time  she  showed
[13:44] me  this  like  feminine  arts  and  crafts 
 like  making  stuff  for  me  I've  praised
[13:49] her  like  crazy 
 to  the  point  that  she's  made  me  like 
 some  really  cool  stuff  like  this  she's
[13:54] literally  made  this  entire  thing 
 this  is  like  a  pla  plant  pot  made  from
[14:00] clay  and  it's  got  a  lion  at  the  front  of 
 it  my  name  means  lion  if  you  go  and  like
[14:05] check  on  Google  Hamza  translates  to  like 
 lion  or  Brave  line  it's  a  cool  last  name
[14:10] isn't  it  and  so  she's  literally  done 
 that  and  then  also  since  I'm  lying  I 
 call  her  Kitty  and  then  she  Drew  this
[14:16] she  um  painted  this  for  me  little  Cactus 
 pot  with  little  kitties  on  it
[14:22] and  she  also  like  got  me  in  the  cactus 
 as  well  and  I  told  her  this  is  probably 
 one  of  the best  gifts  I've  ever  gotten 
 just  because  like  I  just  it  just  keeps
[14:28] it  just  stays  on  my  desk  and  I'm  on  my 
 desk  like  10  hours  a  day  so  I  really 
 like  it  I  was  broke  imagine  that  imagine
[14:33] if  your  girl's  making  you  like  this  type 
 of  stuff  where  she's  literally  spent 
 like  hours  drawing  these  cute  little
[14:39] cats  and  everything  look  at  that
[14:44] praise  got  us  here 
 and  so  she  gave  me  those  you  know  the
[14:49] plan  part  she  gave  me  the  the  pencil 
 part  and  I'm  literally  thinking  to 
 myself  well  like  chapter  17  in  this  book
[14:55] praising  a  woman  is  you  is  so  effective
[15:00] and  then  I  go  downstairs 
 into  the  kitchen
[15:06] and  there's  my  mom  just 
 cooking  in  the  kitchen  like  I  always  see
[15:12] her 
 almost  like  a  sad  look  on  her  face  and 
 I'm  realizing  like
[15:17] she  doesn't  get  praised  anywhere  near  as 
 much  as  she  should  do
[15:22] you  know  it's  so  easy  when  someone  is  so 
 consistent  in  the  things  they  do  for  you
[15:28] to  just  get  adjusted  to  it  and  to  not 
 remember  to  be  grateful  for  it
[15:35] but  there's  something  that  a  woman  is 
 doing  for  you  maybe  it's  a  mother  maybe 
 it's  your  mother
[15:41] now  you  could  go  in  Praise 
 so  I  don't  know  how  applicable  this  is 
 for  you  right  now  but  an  actionable  step
[15:47] which  will  actually  help  you  still  get 
 girls 
 it's  the  go  and  think  of  a  praise  for
[15:54] your  mother 
 now  you  know  there  could  be  a  guy  oh  no 
 but  my  my  mother's  a  crack  addict  or
[16:01] something  okay  okay  but  for  the  majority 
 of  us 
 there  could  be  some  kind  of  praise  for
[16:07] your  mother  and  even  if  your  mother's 
 passed  away  you  could  still  kind  of 
 visualize  one  if  you  just  close  your
[16:13] eyes  right  now  and  think  about  the 
 things  that  your  mother  has  done 
 consistently  for  you  to  the  point  that 
 you've  adjusted  so  much  to  it  that  it
[16:19] just  kind  of  feels  like  normal  life  that 
 she  does  that  thing  so  for  me  it's  it's 
 cooking  like  she's  literally  in  the
[16:24] kitchen  right  now  as  we  speak 
 it's  also  washing  the  clothes  and 
 putting  them  into  my  room
[16:29] taking  care  of  the  house 
 these  things  you  only  really  notice  when 
 the  person  kind  of  stops  doing  them
[16:36] but  they're  doing  it  every  day  and  if 
 it's  a  woman  a  feminine  woman  you 
 praising  her  for  it  in  the  right  way
[16:43] will  make  her  like  so  bubbly  and  you 
 know  why  this  will  help  you  get  girls
[16:48] even  though  it's  with  your  woman  with 
 your  mother 
 because  the  way  that  you  praise  your
[16:53] mother  will  also  work  for  the  way  that 
 you  should  praise  like  the  girl  that  you
[16:58] want  to  or  are  already  dating  it's  the 
 same  way  praise  doesn't  have  to  be 
 sexual  although  we  will  talk  through
[17:04] like  sexual  compliments  later  in  this 
 video  don't  skip  that  just  yet  you  horny 
 [ __ ]  but  like  there's  one  that
[17:10] you  could  probably  generate  for  your 
 mother  in  your  mind  right  now  and  I'd 
 say  this  is  an  actionable  stuff  that  if 
 you  really  want  this  video  to  help  you
[17:16] and  genuinely  change  your  life  in  your 
 family  life  which  is  [ __ ]  awesome  for 
 a  video  to  do  when  you  really  think
[17:21] about  how  nice  that  would  like  of  an 
 impact  that  would  be  on  your  life  to 
 have  like  a  one  percent  happier  family
[17:28] really  just  think  of  one  praise  that  you 
 could  give  your  mother
[17:35] and  go  and  give  it 
 right  now
[17:41] right  here  right  now
[17:49] you  don't  even  need  to  pause  the  video 
 because  I'll  go  and  do  it  right  now
[18:04] foreign
[18:57] that's  what  we  call  an  actionable  step 
 if  you  didn't  go  and  do  that  you're  a
[19:02] [ __ ]  and  this  is  your  last  chance 
 before  we  move  on  if  you  haven't  went 
 down  and  spoke  to  your  mother  go  and  do 
 that  right  now  I  went  down  with  a
[19:08] massive  smile  on  my  face  and  and  hugged 
 her  and  she  was  like oh  what  is  it 
 Mother's  Day
[19:16] and  then  I  just  um I  just  told  this 
 truth  I'm  recording  this  video  I'm 
 telling  everyone  that  they  should  praise
[19:21] their  mothers  because  of  how  hard  like 
 their  mothers  probably  work 
 and  I  said  like  you  know  you're  always
[19:26] cooking  and  you  um I'm  out  of  breath 
 we're  running  up  the  stairs  for  you  uh
[19:31] you  take  care  of  the  house  and 
 everything  and 
 um 
 yeah  she's  just  she  sat  there  like  in
[19:36] the  sun  just  smiling  right  now  so  that's 
 all  it  takes  that's  literally  all  it
[19:41] takes  and  if  you've  got  the 
 the  experience  of  giving  your  mother  a
[19:46] compliment  like  that 
 you're  going  to  be  better  at 
 complimenting  a  woman  100  obviously  your
[19:52] mother's  a  woman  but  like  complimenting 
 the  woman  that  you  want  to  date  of 
 course  you  will  because  the  compliment
[19:57] like  the  nature  of  the  praise 
 is  the  same  and  the  reason  why  I  suggest
[20:04] for  you  to  almost  like  give  one  to  your 
 mother  first  is  because  you  don't  really 
 want  anything  out  of  it  you're  lit  you
[20:10] just  want  to  make  her  feel  kind  of  nice 
 right 
 that's  exactly  why  you  should  compliment
[20:15] a  woman  even  the  woman  that  you  want  to 
 date  and  the  woman  that  you  want  to 
 sleep  with  it  should  be  in  the  same
[20:20] energy  that  you'll  give  to  your  mother 
 in  the  sense  that  like  you  just  want  to 
 make  her  smile  and  and  know  that  you
[20:26] appreciate  something  about  her 
 that's  how  you  give  like  a  genuine
[20:31] compliments 
 now  you  might  ask
[20:36] but  wouldn't  I  be  a  Sim  if  I 
 complimented  a  woman  on  something  like 
 this  wouldn't  be  wouldn't  I  be  seen  as  a
[20:43] simp  and  so  we're  gonna  have  an  entire 
 section  in  this  video  of  how  to  avoid 
 complimenting  like  a  simp
[20:49] now  here  is  a  rule  that  I  think  you 
 should  follow  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 if  you  aren't  with  her
[20:56] in  a  relationship  dating  whatever  if 
 you're  not  with  her 
 do  not  compliment  her  appearance  do  not
[21:03] compliment  anything  about  her  looks 
 use  that  rule  so  let's  say  there's  a
[21:09] girl  in  your  workplace  or  your  class 
 it's  so  easy  for  like  the  beta  male
[21:14] version  of  you  it's  a  compliment  and 
 probably  you'll  never  have  the 
 confidence  to  actually  say  that  she's
[21:19] you  know  beautiful  or  anything  but 
 you'll  say  some  stuff  like  oh  yeah  that 
 that  dress  looks  nice  or  you  know  that 
 the  stickers  you  have  on  your  bag  are
[21:25] really  no  no  nothing  about  looks  the 
 reason  why  you  can  set  this  rule  is  one 
 you'll  seem  a  lot  less  like  a  simp  who's
[21:32] commenting  underneath  her  pictures  wow 
 you  know  you  look  incredible  oh  yeah 
 it's  a  nice  nice  smile  babe  and  also  too
[21:38] it  makes  you  work  harder  to  actually  see 
 for  yourself  okay  apart  from  her  beauty
[21:43] what  do  you  actually  like  about  her 
 because  if  you  look  like  if  you  use  this 
 rule  you'll  realize  that  you  don't
[21:49] sometimes  there's  nothing  of  a  girl  that 
 you  actually  appreciate  it's  just  that 
 she's  kind  of  nice  looking  that's  it  but
[21:55] if  you  like  if  you  made  this  rule  that 
 you  can't  compliment  a  woman  unless 
 you're  with  her  on  her  looks  you'll
[22:00] realize  you'll  turn  into  a  lot  less  of  a 
 simp  this  is  the  problem  with  simping  is
[22:05] just  that  all  guys  are  basing  it  on  her 
 looks  or  they're  almost  giving  like  a
[22:10] fake 
 um  fake  compliment  which  is  not  on  her 
 look  so  for  example  we've  got  the  rule
[22:15] that  you  can't  compliment  a  woman  on  her 
 looks  unless  you're  actually  like  with 
 her  maybe  you're  on  a  date  okay  that's
[22:20] fine  but  if  she's  like  some  random  girl 
 that  you've  barely  ever  spoke  to  or  some 
 girl  in  your  class  who's  not  really
[22:25] interested  in  you  complimenting  on  other 
 looks  is  going  to  seem  a  bit  like  cringe
[22:31] at  the  same  time  don't  just  then  think 
 okay  well  you  know  I'll  just  send  her  a 
 message  on  her  only  fans  oh  you've  got  a
[22:38] lovely  smile  I  can  imagine  some  like 
 some  simply  guide  like  doing  that  of
[22:43] like  you  know  to  some  girls  literally 
 there  bent  over  with  some  massive 
 [ __ ] 
 like  you  know  doing  something  sexual  and
[22:50] this  guy  is  compensated  like  oh  yeah 
 you've  got  a  really  lovely  smile  like 
 that's  still  being  a  weirdo  okay  so  the
[22:56] idea  is  if  you  compliment  the  way  that 
 she  looks  it's  usually  not  gonna  be  a
[23:02] good  thing  if  you  are  just  like  very 
 soon  getting  to  know  her  or  slash  like
[23:08] don't  even  know  her  at  all  if  you're  in 
 a  relationship  with  her  100  compliments 
 her  beauty  in  my  opinion  like  if  you
[23:14] want  a  fast  tip  the  fastest  and  like  one 
 of  the  best  kind  of  compliments  you  can
[23:19] have  which  is  such  a  boyish  one  with  a 
 girl  that  you're  you're  actually  with 
 it's  the  just  wolf  whistle  utter
[23:25] literally  just  fully  like  check  her  out 
 she's  walking  away  from  you  I  think  I 
 said  this  once  recently  she's  walking
[23:30] away  from  you 
 stare  at  her  ass  and  wolf  whistle  with 
 like  a  like  a  boyish  smile  on  your  face
[23:36] and  I  guarantee  she  will  have  like 
 literally  the  the  most  giddy  girl  kind
[23:42] of  response  to  that  if  you're  with  the 
 girl  if  you're  not  with  the  girl  then
[23:47] probably  don't  do  that  because  you  know 
 some  girls  can  be  offended  at  it  you 
 might  not  pull  it  off  in  the  right  way
[23:52] if  you're  not  with  her  then  just  go  with 
 compliments  which  would  make  her  feel
[23:59] good  for  the  sake  of  just  making  her 
 feel  good  and  I'll  tell  you  about  this
[24:04] so  I  go  to  the  gym  at  the  same  time 
 every  single  day  and  often  I'll  see  the
[24:09] same  kind  of  people  around  me  and 
 there's  a  girl  I  see  who's  always  there 
 at  the  same  time  as  me  consistently
[24:14] every  day  and  she  stays  for  a  quite  a 
 long  time  like  a  solid  hour  and  a  half 
 or  something  and  she's  usually  there
[24:20] before  I  even  get  in  so  she's  probably 
 there  for  even  longer  and  she's  grinding 
 it  out  but  she's  she's  got  a  very  like
[24:25] lovely  personality  she's  kind  of  like 
 dancing  and  stuff  and  whatever  right 
 so  I  see  her  she's  doing  a  normal
[24:31] workout  I'm  doing  my  normal  workout  and 
 as  she's  walking  like  somewhat  near  me
[24:37] one  day  to  go  it's  like  a  different 
 machine  I'm  not  so  social  in  the  gym 
 these  days  so  this  isn't  about  me 
 flirting  with  or  anything  but  a  personal
[24:43] trainer  sees  her  maybe  they  somewhat  you 
 know  have  seen  each  other  enough  and  the 
 personal  trainer  kind  of  shouts  out  in
[24:48] in  a  playful  sense  of  like  oh  you're  a 
 beast  you're  in  here  you  know  you're 
 still  here  like  he  said  he  says
[24:54] something  like  that  like  you're  still 
 here  you're  a  beast  insinuating  okay 
 she's  been  here  for  a  while  she's 
 working  really  hard
[25:00] she  has  the  biggest  smile  on  her  face 
 and  I  promise  you  after  that  she  stayed
[25:07] for  extra  long  she  started  to  like 
 experiment  with  new  equipment  that  I 
 could  tell  that  she  wasn't  really  used
[25:12] to  she  starts  like  sprinting  on  this 
 treadmills  later  on  I'm  stretching  near 
 like  the  place  where  we  have  a  a  boxing
[25:18] bag  and  she  literally  just  puts  the 
 gloves  on  and  starts  training  on  that 
 and  like  her  form  was  whack  and  I  didn't
[25:23] want  to  be  like  I  didn't  want  to  go  up 
 there  oh  you  know  it's  like  like  a 
 [ __ ]  sometimes  like  guys  will  do  this
[25:28] like  oh  let  me  give  you  some  tips  you 
 can  do  if  you  want  whatever  but  um  her 
 form  wasn't  very  good  but  you  know  she
[25:33] was  trying  anyway  and  so  she's  literally 
 on  the  boxing  bag  she's  smiling  she's 
 got  like  this  extra  playful  part  inside
[25:40] of  her 
 and  she's  literally  in  the  corner  like 
 like  fully  like  bursting  into  like
[25:45] dancing  and  stuff  after  that  and  like 
 just  smiling  so  much  that's  what  a 
 simple  compliment  did  do  you  see  how  the
[25:52] PT  did  not  compliment  oh  hey  nice  ass 
 babe  oh  hey  you've  got  a  lovely  smile 
 because  those  things  can  be  seen  as
[25:58] cringe  if  you're  not  like  close  enough 
 intimately  with  the  girl  the  PT 
 complimented  something  fantastic  which
[26:04] is  literally  just  oh  hey  you're  still  in 
 here  wow  you're  in  here  a  lot  and  she 
 took  pride  in  that  because  a  gym  girl
[26:10] will  take  pride  in  that  right  so  you 
 could  literally  steal  the  exact  same
[26:15] compliments  that  he  did  next  time  if 
 you're  going  to  the  gym  and  you  see  the 
 exact  same  girl  in  there  all  the  time
[26:21] you  can  like  look  at  her  in  a  sign  of 
 respect  do  something  like  this  be  like 
 you're  in  here  at  like  every  single  day
[26:26] nice  one  that's  it  you  literally  could 
 just  say  that  and  you  know  she  smiles
[26:31] when  I've  been  walking  away  and  I 
 guarantee  she's  gonna  have  not  only  a 
 way  better  day  way  better  training
[26:36] session  and  she's  also  gonna  remember 
 you 
 you  didn't  want  anything  from  her
[26:42] now  you  see  how  that  isn't  simping  at 
 all  you  see  that  you're  that's  like  what
[26:47] a  genuine  compliment  is  when  you 
 genuinely  respect  that  this  person  has
[26:52] been  there  doing  this  thing  when  you 
 genuinely  like  this  thing  about  a  person 
 when  it's  just  based  on  superficial
[26:58] looks  that's  when  you  can  come  across  as 
 a  bit  of  a  simp  and  you  probably  don't 
 want  that
[27:04] now  hearing  all  this  especially  with  you 
 know  the  example  I've  given  you  of 
 complimenting  the  girl  on  inside  of  the
[27:10] gym  you  might  still  have  another 
 limiting  belief  which  is  but  I  still 
 don't  feel  very  confident  and  this  is
[27:16] where  most  guys  get  stuck  you're 
 learning  more  and  more  okay  praise  is 
 important  how  to  praise  without  being  a
[27:22] simp  but  you  still  don't  feel  like 
 confident  enough  to  like  give  more 
 compliments  out  and  this  is  where  I  can
[27:29] give  you  one  fast  tip  which  will 
 literally  not  only  help  you  give  out
[27:35] compliments 
 I'm  not  exaggerating  when  I  say  that 
 this  tip  will  help  you  with  100  of  your
[27:41] life 
 can  you  think  what  it  might  be
[27:46] this  is  an  actionable  step  that  you 
 should  do  before  you're  about  to  go  and
[27:51] approach  a  girl  or  compliments  her 
 whether  it's  online  whether  it's  in 
 person  and  it's  also  an  actionable  step
[27:57] that  you  could  do 
 before  you  literally  go  and  do
[28:02] anything  in  life 
 and  it's  the  breathe  fully  there  is  a
[28:10] chapter  before  you  get  like  weirded  out 
 by  that  and  you  you  just  wanted  me  to 
 give  you  like  okay  just  say  this  bro
[28:15] trust  me  when  I  say  I'm  using  like  think 
 about  it  I'm  I'm  this  YouTuber  I'm  using 
 a  part  of  my  video  valuable  time  in  the
[28:21] video  to  give  you  this  advice  I  would 
 only  like  say  the  things  that  I  thought 
 was  going  to  be  valuable  to  you
[28:27] I  promise  you  that  this  is  one  of  the 
 most  valuable  tips  I  could  genuinely
[28:32] ever  give  you  no  matter  what  I  learn  in 
 the  future  of  my  entire  life  this  is
[28:37] probably  one  of  the  most  valuable  tips  I 
 could  ever  give  you  and  it's  to  breathe 
 fully  to  unlock  your  diaphragm  your
[28:44] stomach  when  you  breathe  you  will  get  so 
 much  more  present  happy  in  a  social  flow
[28:53] strong 
 you'll  overcome  a  lot  of  that  neurotic
[28:59] self-concern  you're  the  thinking  that  we 
 have  when  we're  just  stuck  in  our  brains 
 because  that's  what  happens  to  me  quite
[29:05] often  and  so  when  I  first  joined  this 
 gym  again  like  I  had  been  in  this  gym 
 I've  spoke  about  it  a  lot  in  previous
[29:11] videos  but  then  I  I  left  I  traveled 
 around  I  moved  into  different  countries 
 I  came  back  and  I  joined  and  I  kind  of
[29:17] like  you  know  fell  off  my  breath  work 
 meditation  practice  and  I  went  in  and 
 for  a  bunch  of  my  first  workouts
[29:23] I  was  kind  of  that  guy  with  his  hood  up 
 just  kind  of  you  know  just  focused  on  my 
 own  thing  and  just  being  silent  and  you
[29:28] know  just  doing  my  own  thing  and 
 honestly  I  had  quite  like  negative 
 thoughts  in  my  mind
[29:34] and  then  I  remembered  the  tip  that  I  had 
 learned  from  here  which  we'll  discuss 
 and  I  started  to  breathe  fully  just
[29:40] literally  for  a  few  seconds  before  I'd 
 walk  into  the  gym  you  know  so  I'm 
 walking  like  I'm  walking  towards  the  gym 
 or  I  usually  I  run  to  the  gym  and  I'm
[29:46] starting  to  implement  this  practice 
 which  I'll  literally  walk  you  through 
 the  exact  way  to  breathe  and  by  the  time
[29:51] I'd  walk  into  the  gym  it  was  as  if 
 suddenly  I  was  visible  to  everyone  where
[29:58] before  this  and  I  was  wearing  the  same 
 clothes  by  the  way I  still  had  the  hood 
 up  and  everything  like  so  before  this  I
[30:03] was  kind  of  like  I  felt  kind  of 
 invisible  to  people  I  was  just  like  an 
 NPC  who's  in  the  gym  who's  also  doing 
 his  workout  I  promise  every  single  time
[30:10] I  do  a  few  deep  breaths  suddenly  it 
 feels  like  there's  almost  a  spotlight  on
[30:15] me  in  the  gym  and  I'm  not  saying  this 
 out  of  ego  this  is  just  simply  a  fact 
 suddenly  I'm  so  much  more  visible
[30:21] because  it's  like  the  smallest  part  of 
 your  body  language  maybe  your  shoulders 
 literally  just  do  this
[30:27] and  just  see  my  shoulder  there  just  this 
 little  difference  here  so  you  can  go  in
[30:32] you've  not  been  breathing  right  you've 
 been  breathing  shallowly  you've  been 
 sitting  down  with  chip  posture  you're 
 going  to  the  gym  like  this  you  breathe
[30:38] right  for  a  few  seconds  you  kind  of  open 
 up  your  body  and  you  look  like  this  like 
 that  little  bit  of  a  difference  it's
[30:43] like  that  makes  such  a  difference  in 
 people's  brains  Primal  brains  and 
 nervous  system  that  suddenly  they  see  oh
[30:49] happy  friendly  healthy  strong  guy  over 
 there  and  they  actually  look  towards  you
[30:54] girls  smile  guys  come  over  and  talk  and 
 literally  the  first  and  and  every  time
[30:59] that  I've  just  done  a  couple  of 
 breathing  practices  but  also  like 
 specifically  kind  of  like  open  up  the
[31:04] front  of  my  body  literally  just  by  doing 
 this  so  like  this  is  how  we  normally 
 stand  literally  just  just  do  this  just
[31:09] push  your  your  gyno  commercial  out  so 
 push  your  chest  out  breathe  fully  which
[31:14] I'll  explain  how  to  do  that  every  single 
 time  I  do  it  I  promise  at  least  three  or
[31:20] four  people  come  and  speak  to  me  in  the 
 gym  suddenly  it's  like  okay  is  it  just  a 
 coincidence  it  probably  is  a  coincidence
[31:26] but  that  more  and  more  people  who 
 recognize  me  will  come  in  on  those  days 
 that  someone  for  who  I  used  to  speak  to
[31:32] in  the  gym  a  year  ago  suddenly  just  this 
 is  their  first  workout  back  and  they 
 come  straight  towards  me  we  have  another
[31:37] work  we  have  like  a  conversation  then 
 another  guy  comes  walks  over  Hamza  how 
 many  subscribers  are  you  on  now  then  his
[31:42] friend  comes  over  then  like  the  girl  in 
 the  corners  like  smiling  towards  me  then 
 a  girl  walks  into  like  the  part  where
[31:47] I'm  training  and  she's  actually  like  an 
 old  friend's  sister  so  I'm  speaking  to 
 her  like  suddenly  it's  like  I'm  in  this
[31:52] social  flow  speaking  to  like  multiple 
 people  for  the  workout 
 it  can  be  a  bit  of  a  distraction  I  will
[31:57] admit  but  it's  kind  of  nice  to  feel  like 
 you're  socially  included  in  the  places
[32:02] that  you  go  to  it  really  is  and  it 
 really  does  destroy  the  anxiety  you  know
[32:07] that  anxious  negative  thinking  that  you 
 get  about  yourself  or  about  other  people 
 when  you're  speaking  when  you're  in  the
[32:12] social  flow  you  don't  get  that  and  you 
 just  have  way  more  of  a  pleasant  time 
 and  sometimes  honestly  I  have  a  better
[32:17] workout  when  that  happens  because  you 
 just  kind  of  feel  like  a  stronger  you 
 know  like  if  you  put  yourself  in  that
[32:22] situation  where  literally  three  people 
 come  up  they  recognize  you  they  speak  to 
 you  they  you  know  they  say  oh  you  know
[32:27] they're  asking  you  questions  you  ask 
 them  some  questions  suddenly  you  notice 
 that  like  a  girl  in  the  same  part  of  the 
 room  is  looked  over  towards  you  like
[32:33] three  times  you're  probably  gonna  train 
 maybe  a  little  bit  harder  after  that 
 aren't  you  it's  kind  of  nice  isn't  it
[32:38] this  all  comes  down  to  just  breathing 
 right  and  so  breathing  right  will  not
[32:44] just  help  you  with  compliments  but  with 
 literally  the  rest  of  the  world  and  what 
 you  need  to  do  is  breathe  fully  you  can
[32:50] have  a  look  at  chapter  47  let's  see  if 
 I've  got  it  right  is  it  47  or  is  it  45
[32:57] it  is
[33:02] 44  45  yeah  45  that's  kind  of  close 
 chapter  45  of  our  book
[33:09] the  way  the  superior  man  breathed  down 
 the  front  all  men  tend  to  have  blocks  in
[33:14] the  front  of  their  body  and  my  along  an 
 imaginary  line  that  runs  from  the  top  of 
 the  head  through  the  tongue  throat  heart
[33:21] solar  plexus  Naval  genitals  down  to  the 
 perineum  the  principal  bodily  key  to
[33:26] mastering  the  world  and  women  is 
 maintaining  a  full  and  open  front  of  the 
 body  at  all  times  the  best  method  is
[33:33] through  full  and  relaxed  breathing 
 drawing  energy  down  the  front  and 
 freeing  attention  from  neurotic
[33:39] self-concern  this  is  the  most  important 
 book  that  I  read  every  single  day 
 this  is  the  book  that  has  changed  my
[33:45] life  the  most 
 in  this  book  he's  saying  the  principle
[33:50] bodily  key  to  mastering  the  world  and 
 women  is  to  is  to  maintain  a  full  and
[33:57] open  front  of  the  body  most  men  will 
 close  up  the  front  of  their  body  because 
 of  poor  habits  neurotic  self-conception
[34:03] because  when  you  think  about  it  when 
 you're  thinking  overthinking  about 
 yourself  anxious  you  know  you're 
 thinking  kind  of  negative  thoughts
[34:09] naturally  your  body  language  will  kind 
 of  respond  to  that  and  suddenly  you  will 
 be  that  guy  who's  kind  of  using  this
[34:14] phone  like  this  and  the  front  of  your 
 body  is  kind  of  caved  inwards  if  you 
 think  to  remind  yourself  of  what  we've
[34:20] just  learned  open  up  the  front  of  your 
 body  like  this  and  now  you  walk  around 
 it's  like  I  don't  look  weird  right  maybe
[34:25] with  the  bathroom  but  like  I  don't  look 
 like  I'm  like  forcing  my  like  weird 
 posture  or  anything  I  just  look  like  a
[34:31] guy  with  decent  posture 
 this  is  a  quick  tip  that  just  before 
 you're  about  to  go  and  compliment  a
[34:37] woman  you  should  do  every  single  time  so 
 imagine  in  this  realistic  scenario  even
[34:43] if  it's  online  or  it's  in  person  and 
 there's  a  woman  you  want  to  go  and  speak 
 to  literally  just  think  to  yourself  okay
[34:51] the  deep  breathing  thing  take  a  full 
 deep  breath  to  the  point  that  it's  loud
[34:56] like  this  and  really  what  you  want  to  do 
 is  use  the  air  and  kind  of  force  it  into
[35:02] the  lower  part  of  your  stomach  and  let 
 your  stomach  kind  of  bloat  out  it's  okay
[35:07] remember  like  how  a  king  would  Breathe 
 he  wouldn't  care  that  his  stomach  bulges 
 a  little  bit  you  need  to  have  that  same
[35:12] thing  you  shouldn't  be  walking  around 
 tightening  up  your  abs  thinking  that 
 anyone  can  see  that  and  someone  will
[35:17] respect  you  more  because  you've  got  a 
 six-pack  or  anything  let  your  stomach 
 [ __ ]  bulge  out  when  you  breathe 
 breathe  forcefully
[35:29] just  one  of  those  before  you  go  and  do 
 anything  important  will  significantly
[35:36] help  you  now  this  is  a  book  on 
 spirituality  masculinity  and  everything 
 but  if  you  want  a  bit  less  of  like  a
[35:42] woo-woo  type  of  practice  Dr  Andrew 
 huberman  has  been  talking  about  this 
 practice  with  a  slight  change  that  you
[35:48] can  use  which  is  called  the  cyclic  sigh 
 and  it's  very  similar  to  this  but
[35:53] there's  just  one  difference  which  is 
 that  when  you're  at  the  end  of  the 
 inhale  you  stop  there  for  a  second  and
[35:59] you  inhale  a  bit  more  so  this  is  exactly 
 what  it  looks  like
[36:05] foreign
[36:10] you  do  a  full  deep  breath  and  when  you 
 get  to  the  point  where  you're  pretty 
 much  full  you  kind  of  stop  for  a  split
[36:16] second  and  do  another  that  the  double 
 inhale  after  that  so  it's  double  inhale 
 and  then  exhale  that's  been  seen
[36:23] literally  just  one  of  those  has  been 
 seen  says  significantly  reduce  stress 
 and  help  people  get  into  the  present
[36:29] moment  actually  even  more  than 
 meditation 
 when  there's  something  that  has  been
[36:34] proven  to  be  more  effective  than 
 meditation  you  should  probably  take  it 
 seriously  so  I  know  that  this  is  kind  of
[36:40] a  weird  part  of  this  video  when  you  just 
 wanted  to  learn  how  to  compliment  a 
 woman  this  is  the  weird  stuff  that  will
[36:46] actually  help  you  more  I  could  have 
 spent  20  minutes  in  this  video  giving 
 you  like  you  know  like  a  chat  gbt  20
[36:52] examples  of  compliments  you  could  have 
 given  a  woman  and  go  yeah  go  on  go  go 
 ahead  you  didn't  need  that  the  way  for
[36:59] you  to  like  compliment  a  woman  is  for 
 you  to  genuinely  think  to  yourself  the 
 thing  you  want  to  say  to  her  that  like
[37:04] actually  means  you  appreciate  her  you 
 know  it's  you  like  being  authentic  with 
 what  you  appreciate  with  her  me  being
[37:12] sat  here  and  telling  you  examples  of 
 things  you  can  say  is  gonna  actually 
 harm  you  more  because  you're  not  being
[37:17] authentic  with  the  thing  that  you 
 actually  appreciate  about  her  the  thing 
 that  you  respect  or  like  about  her
[37:23] but  I  can  give  you  more  like  the 
 strategy  that  will  simply  just  make  you
[37:28] better  at  complementing  women  as  a  whole 
 instead  of  giving  you  the  specific  words 
 to  say  and  you  know  I'm  equipping  you
[37:34] more  as  like  a  man  instead  of  like  a 
 [ __ ]  dumbass  right  so  this  is  the
[37:40] principal  key  for  you  to  take  away  from 
 this  video  is  to  breathe  fully  before 
 you're  about  to  compliment  a  woman
[37:46] before  you're  about  to  approach  a  woman 
 breathe  fully  whilst  you're  having  sex 
 breathe  fully  24  7.
[37:54] you  will  be  honestly  twice  as  strong  I
[37:59] guarantee  it  not  even  like  in  a  woo-woo 
 sense  I  guarantee  if  you  start  to 
 breathe  more  fully  through  the  day
[38:04] promise  I  promise  you  this  and  you  can 
 report  back  I  promise  you  if  you  started 
 I  really  really  remind  yourself  write
[38:10] pieces  of  paper  remind  yourself  have 
 like  your  phone  wall  screen  literally 
 just  saying  breath  fully  I  guarantee
[38:15] you'll  hit  more  PR's  in  the  next  week 
 than  you  have  over  the  last  few  months 
 guarantee  it  Garrett  you  think  this  is
[38:20] some  woo-woo  practice  go  and  try  it  you 
 think  you  know  if  you're  a  guy  who's
[38:25] having  sex  right  now  I  guarantee  if  you 
 start  to  breathe  fully  right  here  right 
 now  even  outside  of  sex  guarantee  you
[38:31] will  last  for  as  long  as  you  want  this 
 sounds  like  it's  a  magical  practice  it's
[38:36] just  breathing  properly  bro  it's  like 
 the  standards  aren't  that  high  literally 
 just  breathe  and  you'll  you'll  actually
[38:42] be  better  in  the  world  you're  here 
 shallow  breath  crooked  neck  from  like 
 the  poor  posture  wondering  like  why  you
[38:48] feel  so  weak  and  so  timid  in  the  world 
 and  your  body  language  is  like  this 
 [ __ ]  open  it  up  breathe  fully  I'm
[38:54] making  you  this  promise  that  you  can 
 come  back  in  the  next  week  you  will  hit 
 more  PR's  than  you've  ever  done  before
[38:59] now  obviously  if  you're  on  a  [ __ ] 
 huge  calorie  deficit  okay  fair  enough 
 but  like  I'm  expecting  things  to  stay
[39:04] consistent  if  you're  a  guy  who's 
 actively  [ __ ]  right  now  if  you 
 breathe  deeply  through  the  day  I
[39:09] guarantee  you  will  last  for  as  long  as 
 you  want  it's  nice  stuff  bro  and  so  when
[39:14] there's  a  girl  that  you  want  to  go  and 
 compliment  just  one  deep  breath  before 
 you  let's  say  okay  I'm  in  the  gym
[39:20] there's  a  girl  there  that  I  want  to 
 speak  to 
 [Music] 
 foreign
[39:25] that's  it  and  even  whilst  you  speak  to 
 her  even  whilst  you  do  everything  in 
 life  you  can  still  breathe  deeply
[39:31] obviously  like  when  you're  next  to 
 someone  you  don't  have  to  like  you  know 
 be  loud  or  anything  but  you  can  still  be
[39:36] breathing  Deeply  One  extra  tip  I'll  give 
 you  is  that  when  you  really  are 
 conscious  of  your  stomach  when  you
[39:41] breathe  deeply 
 you'll  just  get  into  the  the  habit  of 
 feeling  that  you're  always  kind  of
[39:47] tightening  your  stomach  manually  you 
 don't  even  realize  when  you  breathe 
 deeply  it's  almost  like  you  have  to  cue
[39:52] yourself  to  let  go  of  your  stomach  and 
 then  you'll  feel  like  oh  wow  now  my 
 stomach  is  actually  kind  of  relaxed  like
[39:58] my  stomach  is  actually  tense  right  now 
 I'm  becoming  more  and  more  aware  of  it 
 you  probably  don't  know  like  you're
[40:04] probably  not  that  aware  of  how  tense 
 your  body  is  these  things  make  a  bigger 
 difference  than  you'll  honestly  then
[40:11] you'll  ever  realize  a  bit  of  tense  like 
 a  muscular  tenseness  in  your  body  a  bit
[40:17] of  a  shallow  breath  will  genuinely  you 
 know  the  trajectory  of  your  life  will 
 genuinely  be  significantly  different
[40:24] than  if  you  literally  just  breathe  fully 
 I  know  that  this  seems  like  a  weird 
 thing  for  me  to  mention  in  this  video  I
[40:30] wouldn't  have  spent  so  long  on  this  if 
 this  wasn't  so  important  if  this  is  one 
 of  the  first  times  you're  hearing  this
[40:35] and  you're  quite  inspired  by  this  it 
 would  serve  you  well  to  absolutely 
 obsess  over  this  to  get  pieces  of  paper
[40:42] and  write  breathe  fully  breathe  into 
 your  stomach  breathe  into  your  balls  and 
 stick  it  up  on  your  wall  to  change  your
[40:47] phone  wallpaper  to  read  chapter  45  of 
 this  book  you  can  probably  go  find  it 
 online  for  free  like  the  PDFs  and  stuff
[40:52] and  to  literally  just  breathe  fully  for 
 as  many  breaths  as  possible  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  I  promise  that  this  is  one
[40:59] of  the  best  tips  I  could  genuinely  ever 
 give  you  and  you  know  that  this  is 
 authentic  because  I'm  not  charging  you
[41:04] for  this  this  I'm  not  selling  you  a 
 program  on  like  how  to  breath  fully  you 
 can  just  do  it  right  now
[41:10] laughs 
 now  let's  talk  about  the  bit  that 
 there's  quite  a  few  people  probably
[41:15] interested  in  let's  talk  about  sexual 
 compliments  I  won't  exactly  give  you
[41:20] like  a  detailed  story  just  because  I 
 don't  want  it  to  be  too  vulgar  or 
 personal  or  anything  but  what  I  will
[41:25] tell  you 
 is  that  when  you're  literally  having  sex 
 with  a  woman  is  the  best  time  to  shower
[41:33] her  in  compliments  I'm  talking  every  few 
 seconds  you're  literally  having  sex  with
[41:38] a  girl  you  can  be  giving  her  another 
 compliment  I'm  gonna  say  a  few  just  so 
 you  can  kind  of  understand  like  you  know
[41:43] some  examples  I'm  not  gonna  say  it  in 
 like  the  sexy  way  that  I  would  when  I'm
[41:48] like  literally  [ __ ]  so  I'm  just  gonna 
 say  it  in  a  mundane  way  otherwise  you'll 
 sound  really  cringe  I'm  not  even  gonna
[41:53] look  at  you  as  well  you're  so  sexy 
 that's  so  hot  you  look  so  good  look  how
[41:58] good  we  look  things  like  that  you  can 
 and  you  can  by  the  way  you  can  just  say 
 the  same  one  like  10  times  20  times  this
[42:05] is  the  time  when  you're  literally  having 
 sex  with  a  girl  to  compliment  her  like 
 crazy  can  you  tell  why  it's  manipulative
[42:10] as  [ __ ]  but  both  people  benefit  from  it 
 but  it's  like  super  manipulative  because 
 you're  gonna  get  laid  a  lot  more  if  you
[42:16] do  this  you  know  why 
 remember  that  we  said  that  a  compliment 
 is  kind  of  like  positive  reinforcements
[42:21] when  you  praise  her  you  positively 
 reinforce  the  behavior  that  she's  doing
[42:27] so  when  you  praise  her  a  lot  during  sex 
 you're  positively  reinforcing  her  to
[42:33] have  more  sex  with  you 
 remember  that  concept  that  if  you
[42:38] comment  underneath  her  Instagram  picture 
 that  you're  beautiful  what  you're  not 
 doing  is  complimenting  or  like  sort  of
[42:44] uh  positively  reinforcing  her  um  you 
 know  putting  on  makeup  or  anything
[42:49] you're  positively  reinforcing  like  the 
 latest  Behavior  which  is  her  posting  to 
 Instagram  you  don't  want  to  do  that  but
[42:55] when  you  say  You're  beautiful  when  you 
 say  you're  sexy  when  you  say  that  feels 
 so  good  when  you  say  all  these  things  to
[43:00] her  when  you're  literally  having  sex 
 you're  positively  reinforcing  the 
 behavior  which  is  her  having  sex  with
[43:05] you 
 which  is  kind  of  nice  and  so  I  promise 
 if  there's  a  girl  that  you're  currently
[43:10] like  sleeping  with  and  you  want  to  sleep 
 with  her  even  more  often  and  you  want 
 her  to  like  literally  feel  better  and
[43:16] even  like  kind  of  melt  more  and  enjoy 
 herself  and  also  make  you  even  feel 
 better 
 shower  her  in  compliments  like  crazy  I'm
[43:25] literally  not  exaggerating  when  I  say 
 every  few  seconds  give  a  compliment  and
[43:30] when  you're  like  having  sex 
 now  you  can  also  have  another  limited 
 belief  but  won't  this  be  cringe  if  I'm
[43:36] just  you  know  saying  all  these  things 
 Midway  through  Facebook  at  this  point  if 
 you're  literally  [ __ ]  her  at  that 
 point  your  past  being  seen  as  cringe  she
[43:42] likes  you  bro  she  likes  you  stop  this 
 [ __ ]  insecure  mindset  take  a  deep 
 breath  literally  the  two  things  you
[43:47] should  be  doing  whilst  having  sex  is 
 just  deep  breathing  and  just  giving 
 compliments
[43:52] you're  so  sexy  no  do  this  cyclic  sigh  my
[43:57] whilst  you're  [ __ ]
[44:04] so  let's  give  you  a  full  plan  of  action 
 that  you  can  go  forward  with  and  start 
 actually  complimenting  women  in  the
[44:09] right  way  First  Step  that  I  would  give 
 you  which  I  really  think  you  should  do  I
[44:14] genuinely  can  vouch  for  this  book  and  I 
 can  tell  you  that  I've  spent  over  a 
 hundred  hours  studying  this  book  and  it
[44:20] it  has  paid  off  completely  I  read  this 
 book  almost  most  days  I've  read  it  okay
[44:26] I've  read  this  book  like  multiple  times 
 but  I  continuously  studied  this  book 
 because  it's  kind  of  like  a  guidebook  to
[44:32] Life  as  a  man  and  it  is  super  valuable 
 chapter  17  is  praise  her  that's  the  one
[44:38] which  talks  about  this  concept  it'd  be 
 worth  you  to  recap  that  chapter  45  talks 
 about  breathing  fully  it'd  be  worth  you
[44:44] to  recap  that  so  this  is  an  actionable 
 step  if  you  want  to  further  your 
 learning  on  this  you  can  go  and  read
[44:49] those  two  chapters  17  and  45  the  book  is 
 the  way  of  the  superior  man  by  David
[44:54] data  I  literally  even  have  a  necklace 
 with  the  same  logo  you  can  just  about 
 see  it  like  this  is  the  the  man  on  it
[45:00] see  the  one  with  this  little  pbl  see 
 that  this  is  like  by  Leonardo  da  she  and
[45:05] it's  called  like  the  vitrullian  man  or 
 some  [ __ ]  and  I've  got  like  the  necklace 
 of  that  as  well
[45:10] that's  number  one  so  recap  those 
 chapters  number  two  a  part  of  our  full
[45:15] plan  of  action  like  a  new  rule  for  you 
 never  ever  compliment  a  girl  on  her
[45:20] looks  unless  you're  actually  like  with 
 her  or  at  least  on  a  first  date  never  do
[45:25] it  like  publicly  through  Instagram 
 remember  like  a  second  part  of  this 
 always  remember  that  when  you  praise  a
[45:31] woman  when  you  compliment  a  woman  you 
 are  positively  reinforcing  I  should  have 
 probably  explained  what  that  means
[45:36] hopefully  you  know  positively 
 reinforcing  kind  of  means  that  you  like 
 you  you  kind  of  encourage  them  to  do
[45:41] that  thing  more  so  when  you  compliment  a 
 woman  you're  positively  reinforcing  the
[45:46] behavior  that  she's  just  done  this  means 
 that  you  should  never  ever  ever 
 compliment  a  woman  for  her  Tick  Tock  her
[45:53] Instagram  you  know  how  good  she  looks  on 
 Instagram  because  you're  literally 
 reinforcing  her  posting  to  Instagram  if
[45:59] you  see  her  in  person  and  for  example 
 she's  dressed  up  for  you  compliments 
 compliments  compliments  amazing  if
[46:04] you're  having  sex  with  a  compliment 
 compliment  compliments  if  she's  done 
 something  nice  for  you  she's  made  you 
 like  a  cute  little  thing  like  my  girl
[46:10] has  made  made  me  compliment  sweet 
 awesome  but  if  she's  like  posted 
 something  on  Instagram  where  she  looks
[46:16] good  you  probably  don't  want  to 
 reinforce  her  to  be  on  Instagram  more 
 not  only  because  you  might  feel  a  bit
[46:22] insecure  that  she's  posting  good  looking 
 pictures  or  anything  but  the  fact  that 
 it's  like  ins  like  posting  on  Instagram 
 is  not  really  a  healthy  thing  right  so
[46:29] just  always  remember  it's  like  rule 
 slash  like  actionable  step  number  three 
 only  ever  positively  reinforce  the
[46:36] behavior  that  would  actually  be  good  for 
 her  to  do  more  never  ever  comment 
 underneath  a  Instagram  picture  again  oh
[46:42] hey  you  look  really  good  or  you  know 
 some  like  fake  comments  underneath  her 
 her  picture  where  it's  like  you're  not
[46:47] gonna  compliment  what  she  looks  like  but 
 you're  gonna  say  oh  hey  you  know  did  you 
 have  a  fun  time  there
[46:52] nice  plant  pots  in  the  background  is 
 that  wallpaper  from  Ikea  it's  just 
 cringe  right  you  don't  want  to  say
[46:58] anything  like  nice  in  her  like  Instagram 
 because  you  don't  want  to  reinforce  it 
 at  all  if  anything  you  should  be 
 insulting  her  on  Instagram  so  she  gets
[47:04] off  the  app 
 now 
 the  main  part  of  the  actionable  step  or
[47:11] the  full  plan  of  action  is  go  and 
 compliment  a  woman  within  24  hours  once 
 you've  done  it  no  matter  how  it  goes
[47:17] report  back  here  on  this  video  and  write 
 a  comment  to  encourage  another  young  man 
 who's  on  the  same  Journey  as  you  because
[47:22] there's  going  to  be  guys  who  are 
 literally  one  step  behind  you  and  your 
 comment  might  have  actually  helped  them
[47:27] better  than  my  entire  video  would  have 
 because  they're  able  to  relate  to  you
[47:32] more  the  way  that  you  type  and 
 everything  so  this  is  an  actionable  step 
 a  challenge  to  like  the  absolute  top 
 guys  who  are  watching  this  who  will
[47:38] literally  you  know  you  don't  have  to  be 
 super  advanced  in  self-improvements  but 
 more  so  the  guys  who  have  actually  got 
 the  right  kind  of  mindset  who  know
[47:43] they're  going  to  become  successful  go 
 and  use  this  within  24  hours  but
[47:48] take  a  deep  breath  before  you  go  and  do 
 it  that  is  the  one  principle  bodily  key 
 of  the  world  take  a  deep  breath  before
[47:54] you're  going  to  go  and  compliment  this 
 woman  as  soon  as  you've  done  it  you  can 
 use  your  phone  find  this  video  again  and
[47:59] write  your  experience  and  just  write 
 like  a  little  bit  of  encouragement 
 because  it'd  be  so  wholesome  to  see  this 
 entire  common  space  just  be  so  wholesome
[48:06] of  other  guys  saying  like  oh  this  is  a 
 really  Wholesome  Way  for  you  to 
 compliment  a  woman  I  did  it  like  this
[48:12] here's  my  Learning  lesson  I  probably 
 could  have  done  it  like  this  or  it 
 worked  really  well  and  I've  got  a  date 
 with  this  girl  imagine  how  inspiring
[48:17] that  would  be  to  another  guy  who's 
 reading  this  if  and  when  you're  actually
[48:22] having  sex  with  this  girl  shower  her  in 
 compliments
[48:28] if  you've  watched  this  far  you're 
 probably  like  a  real  fan  of  mine  you're
[48:33] probably  like  an  absolute  true  fan  you 
 probably  appreciate  this  video  you 
 probably  like  me  you  probably  know  my 
 story  and  everything  if  you'd  like  to
[48:39] help  me  the  one  of  the  best  things  you 
 can  do  right  now  you've  probably 
 subscribed  already  but  you  can  turn  the
[48:44] post  notifications  on  but  one  of  the 
 best  things  you  can  do  literally  just 
 share  this  video  to  as  many  group  chats
[48:51] and  DMS  as  you  can  you  can  click  on  the 
 shell  button  get  the  link  go  blast  it  to 
 your  friends  who  need  to  hear  it  go
[48:57] blast  it's  like  the  group  chats  you're 
 in  which  has  got  some  guys  whatever  it 
 is  if  you  get  like  another  10  people  to
[49:02] watch  if  every  guy  who's  got  to  this 
 point  gets  like  five  people  ten  people 
 50  people  to  watch  I  wish  there  was  like 
 a  leaderboard  so  we  could  see  who's
[49:08] gotten  the  most  people  to  like  watch  the 
 video  because  that'd  be  awesome  but  yeah 
 that  would  really  help  me  and  it  would
[49:13] also  just  help  you  know  like  another 
 young  man  who  you  can  probably  relate  to 
 who's  probably  going  through  something
[49:18] similar  he's  had  the  same  kind  of 
 thoughts  and  fears  and  pains  and  he  gets 
 to  have  this  advice  and  we  can  just  grow
[49:23] alongside  each  other 
 do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah
"
jmRfHNeOoM8,"[00:00] the  first  time  that  I  ever  saw  porn  I 
 was  13  years  old  and  I  was  actually  in
[00:06] class  next  to  one  of  my  friends  and  we 
 were  on  the  computers  in  this  class  and
[00:11] he  told  me  to  go  onto  Google  and  to 
 search  up  Kayla  Collins  clean  Kayla
[00:17] Collins  like  some  um  you  know  some  girl 
 who  takes  like  nudie  pictures 
 and  this  was  back
[00:23] 12  years  ago 
 and  I  searched  it  up  and  it  was  just 
 like  this  woman  posing  provocatively
[00:28] she's  in  like  some  Cafe  she's  got  like 
 cream  all  over  there  to  eat  and 
 everything  and  I'm  literally  13  you  know
[00:34] years  old  like  whoa  my  heart  beats  fast 
 and  everything  I'm  in  class  right  now  so 
 I  closed  it  off  and  it's  just  kind  of
[00:39] like  you  know  smoking  to  himself 
 and  then  I  get  the  idea  what  if  I  write
[00:44] her  name  but  instead  of  writing  clean  at 
 the  end  of  it  I  write  dirty  and  so  I  go
[00:49] home  I  do  that  exact  same  thing  I  go 
 onto  Google  and  I  type  in  her  name  but  I 
 type  in  dirty  and  it's  essentially  the
[00:55] same  kind  of  pictures  but  this  time 
 they're  like  fully  fully  nude  and  so 
 that  was  like  the  first  experience  that
[01:01] I  ever  had  seeing  this  I'm  13  years  old 
 which  is  still  a  little  bit  late  for 
 some  guys  and  it  was  it  was  a  picture  it
[01:08] was  quite  tame 
 and  naturally  I  did  what  every  young  guy
[01:13] would  do  at  that  age  I  did  that  thing 
 that  those  guys  in  you  know  in  class  in
[01:18] sports  class  were  saying  that  you  could 
 do  with  your  penis  and  that  was  really 
 fun  and  um  I  probably  had  like  the
[01:23] strongest  orgasm  of  my  entire  like  a 
 [ __ ]  like
[01:28] so  I  started  jacking  off  right  every 
 single  day  after  this  and
[01:34] at  first  it  was  very  like  tame  tame  porn 
 so  I  used  to  have  a  PSP  and  I  used  to  go
[01:40] on  to  Google  on  the  and  I'd  search  for 
 some  like  interesting  sofa  search  like
[01:46] girls  in  sexy  Santa  costumes  and  I'd 
 just  be  jacking  off  to  that  and  then
[01:51] eventually  it  was  a  big  jump  right  I 
 went  from  that  and  I  swear  to  God  I  went 
 from  that  and  I  ended  up  finding  the
[01:57] glory  whole  niche  of  like  which  is 
 like  a  really  dirty  niche  of  like  people
[02:03] will  be  in  a  bathroom  and  then  they'll 
 just  cut  a  hole  there  so  like  someone 
 some  big  dick  can  like  come  through  the
[02:08] side  and  some  girl  will  be  like  doing 
 [ __ ]  to  that  so  I  went  through  like  a 
 big  jump  but  then  I  kind  of  like 
 gravitated  back  from  that  and  then  went
[02:14] through  a  lot  of  the  normal  progression 
 of  like  you  know  then  I'm  watching 
 um  lesbian  porn  and  stuff  I'm  watching
[02:20] like  mostly  it  was  like  pictures  at 
 first  for  a  long  time  then  it  was  like 
 10  videos  then  it  was  like  kind  of
[02:25] normal  videos  then  you  know  it  levels 
 off  and 
 before  you  know  it  it's
[02:31] three  times  before  I  even  I've  even 
 gotten  out  of  bed
[02:36] I'm  a  young  man  I'm  17  now  I'm  18. 
 I'm  waking  up
[02:42] I'm  not  getting  out  of  bed  I'm  not  doing 
 anything  productive  I'm  not  like  in  a 
 rushing  to  go  fulfill  my  mission  or  my
[02:47] purpose  or  or  to  achieve  some  goals  or 
 to  help  my  family  or  to  to  build  myself
[02:52] I  met  waking  up  and  I'm  the  the  first 
 thing  that  I'm  doing  is  grabbing  my 
 phone  and  going  on  to  Pornhub  and
[02:57] jacking  off  finishing  lying  around 
 scrolling  through  reddits  and  stuff
[03:02] and  then  doing  it  again 
 and  then  again
[03:09] I  remember  I  still  remember  the  first 
 time  that  I  I've  jacked  off  three  times 
 like  in  one  go
[03:16] must  have  taken  me  like  hours  to  you 
 know  like  you  finish  and  then  you  wait  a 
 little  bit  and  everything
[03:21] I  remember  how  like  [ __ ]  dirty  and 
 sweaty  that  I  felt  afterwards
[03:26] it's  like  this  it's  this  shame  that  you 
 know  when  I  went  downstairs  to  make 
 breakfast  or  something  my  family's  there
[03:31] you  just  feel  like  a  goblin  like  you 
 feel  like  this  [ __ ]  like  gremlin
[03:37] it  would  shame  that  they  they  control 
 you  and  make  you  weak
[03:43] and  so  it  was  around  this  time  that 
 nofap  started  to  come  about  online  like 
 you  know  people  openly  started  to  speak
[03:49] like  this  as  I  am  to  you  today 
 it  was  around  this  time  when  I  was  17  18
[03:54] years  old  that  for  the  first  time  in  my 
 life  I  actually  started  to  see  a  lot  of 
 people  start  opening  up  about  their  porn
[04:00] addiction  about  getting  onto  nofap  and 
 everything 
 and  so  I  got  onto  nofap  in
[04:07] 25 
 something  like  that
[04:13] and  it  really  did  change  my  life  forever 
 I  struggled  heavily  right  so  exactly
[04:18] what  happened  was  you  know  I'm  watching 
 all  these  videos  online  and  they're 
 saying  about  nofap  and  all  these 
 benefits  and  girls  will  smell  the
[04:23] retention  on  you  and  all  this  right  and 
 it  sounds  awesome  and  and  the  truth  is 
 like  I  knew  that  I  needed  it  and  I  think
[04:30] most  guys  actually  know  this  most  guys 
 know  that  they  need  this  [ __ ]
[04:37] I'm  gonna  get  to  90  days  and  then  I'm 
 probably  just  not  gonna  fap  again 
 because  it's  for  losers
[04:42] 24  hours  later  I'm  fapping
[04:54] and  again  I'm  gonna  make  some  progress 
 I'm  gonna  make  progress  I'm  gonna  make 
 progress
[05:01] the  next  day  I'm  fapping
[05:10] being  stuck  in  this  cycle  where  you  have 
 no  control  over  your  sexual  impulses
[05:18] what  it  does  to  a  man  is  is 
 horrible
[05:26] it  was  it  felt  like  this 
 it  felt  like  a  full-time  job  being  on
[05:31] nofap  and  constantly  just  snapping  back 
 back  to  to  relapsing  back  to
[05:40] ah
[05:46] back  to  failure  back  to  struggle
[05:55] 24  hours  later  relapse 
 get  up  to  three  days  this  time  so
[06:00] [ __ ]  horny 
 relapse  relapse  relapse  relapse  relapse
[06:06] constantly  get  into  three  days  then  then 
 messing  up  again  three  days  then  messing 
 up  again  three  days  then  messing  up
[06:12] again
[06:23] and  that's  when  I
[06:28] that's  when  I  started  to  realize  the 
 truth  of  this  and  that's  when  I  started 
 to  realize  how  to  actually  do  nofap
[06:33] properly  and  how  to  go  about  your  porn 
 addiction
[06:45] it  was  a  change  in 
 identity
[06:50] I  stopped  seeing  myself  as  the  guy  who's 
 trying  to  quit  porn  I  stopped  seeing
[06:55] myself  as 
 the  guy  on  nofap 
 and  I  started  instead  to  just  see  myself
[07:01] sounds  courageous  [ __ ]  when  I  was  18  to 
 see  myself  as  the  alpha  male  who  [ __ ]
[07:07] the  girls  instead  of  the  beta  male  who 
 just  jacks  off  his  dick  it  sounds  cringe 
 I  was  18  years  old  and  I  said  this  so
[07:13] obviously  it's  fine 
 I  started  to  just  see  myself  in  that  way
[07:18] like  I  used  to  almost  like  daydream 
 about  okay  I  am  this  guy  now  I'm  this 
 guy  I'm  the  alpha  male  now  I'm  the  alpha
[07:24] male  I'm  not  from  beta  male  who  like  you 
 know  some  little  monkey  who  has  to  Jack 
 his  dick  off  instead  of  getting  the  girl
[07:29] I  get  the  girl  I  get  the  girl 
 and  almost  instantly  I'm  now  getting  up 
 to  day  seven  day  eight  day  nine  day  ten
[07:36] and  suddenly  it  starts  getting  weeks  and 
 weeks  and  weeks  and  pretty  much  I'm  just
[07:41] not  watching  porn  or  fapping  anymore  and 
 the  only  time  that  I  was  actually  like
[07:46] ejaculating  was  when  I  was  actually 
 having  sex  so  suddenly  it's  like  okay 
 that's  probably  the  best  case  scenario
[07:53] that's  how  I  personally  fixed  my  my 
 nofap  and  porn  addiction  which  I  think
[07:58] haunts  so  many  men  and  so  today  I  wanna 
 I  wanna  synthesize  10  books  that  are  on
[08:03] Pawn  addiction  and  take  you  know  a 
 lesson  from  each  book  and  then  give  you 
 some  of  my  input  on  it  the  first  book  is
[08:11] the  porn  Circuit  by  Sam  Al  a  lebrando
[08:16] and  one  tip  that  he  says  is  important  is 
 to  seek  professional  help  to  get  therapy
[08:22] and  counseling  this  is  a  quite  a  like  a 
 well-known  book  on  this  space  I  don't
[08:27] like  this  advice  honestly  I  don't 
 personally  like  this  advice  this  this 
 per  like
[08:32] seek  professional  help  go  see  a  doctor 
 like  these  are  the  things  that  sound 
 really  smart  and  you're  almost  crazy  to
[08:38] criticize  this  advice  and  and  your 
 normies  and  like  [ __ ]  Jeffries  and 
 the  the  weak  people  of  the  world  who
[08:44] could  never  question  anything  but  if  you 
 ever  like  the  way  I'm  talking  right  now 
 scares  a  lot  of  people  when  I'm  saying
[08:49] like  yeah  seeking  professional  help 
 isn't  as  as  positive  as  you  think  it  is 
 because  as  someone  who's  been  through 
 therapy  it's  not  as  effective  as  you
[08:55] think  it  is  go  and  actually  look  at  the 
 therapy  statistics  it's  not  one  it's  not 
 as  effective  as  you  think  it  is  two  it's
[09:00] expensive  as  [ __ ]  three  it's  for  a 
 lot  of  people  it  makes  their  condition 
 worse  because  every  day  like  a  [ __ ]
[09:06] you're  there  saying  like  oh  yeah  and 
 this  is  my  problem  I'm  a  fap  around  you 
 know  my  name's  Hamza  and  I'm  an
[09:12] alcoholic  that's  not  good  for  you  to 
 talk  about  your  problem  talking  about 
 your  problems  then  you  know  like
[09:17] feminine  women  who  talk  about  their 
 problems  and  like  to  complain  and  stuff 
 that  all  their  problems  would  be  solved
[09:22] if  talking  about  them  was  helpful 
 right  if  talking  about  your  problems  was 
 helpful  a  lot  of  people's  problems  would
[09:28] be  solved  but  it's  not  that  simple  and 
 you  can  follow  some  psychological 
 framework  that  was  made  in  some
[09:33] University  but  still 
 there's  way  more  effective  ways  to  go 
 through  it  in  my  opinion  and
[09:39] I  am  I'm  a  big  advocate  of 
 self-improvement  and  not  of  like
[09:44] professional  help  when  it  comes  to 
 therapy  and  counseling
[09:50] foreign 
 I  know  this  is  going  to  seem  a  bit
[09:56] backwards  and  a  lot  of  people  won't 
 understand  this  but  chances  are  if 
 you're  watching  my  video  you  will 
 I  think  sometimes  you  need  to  enjoy  the
[10:02] pain  sometimes  you  can't  just  hope  for 
 this  easy  way  out  thinking  yeah  I'll 
 just  go  take  some  medication  yeah  I'll
[10:07] just  go  to  therapy  yeah  I'll  just  go  to 
 see  a  doctor  sometimes  you  need  to 
 Winston  Churchill  says  this  if  you  find
[10:13] yourself  Going  Through  Hell  keep  going
[10:18] the  second  book  is  the  pawn  Trap  by 
 Wendy  and  Larry  maltz  and  they've  said
[10:24] to  set  clear  boundaries  about  how  you'd 
 use  the  internet  and  Technology
[10:31] and  this  is  actually  relevant  to  me  so 
 when  I  was  trying  to  first  get  onto 
 nofap  and  stop  watching  porn  and  you
[10:36] know  I  kept  on  relapsing  every  day  22 
 days  or  something  you  know  the  big 
 mistake  that  I  made  which  you  you  might
[10:41] be  making  right  I  changed  nothing  apart 
 from  like  the  goal  of  wanting  to  not  to
[10:48] fap  right  I  changed  nothing  else  I  just 
 thought  to  myself  yeah  I'm  on  nofap  now 
 yeah  yeah okay  so  I'm  not  gonna  fap
[10:53] anymore  yeah  I'm  not  gonna  watch  porn 
 anymore  right  but  I  didn't  change 
 anything  else 
 so  guess  at  what  time  I  kept  on
[11:01] relapsing 
 first  thing  in  the  morning  because  I 
 didn't  change  my  habits  I'd  grab  my
[11:08] um my  phone  straight  and  you  know  I'm 
 not  gonna  watch  porn  I'm  just  gonna 
 scroll  down  Reddit
[11:13] and  usually  there's  Pawn  in  there  but 
 you  know  I'm  not  gonna  watch  it  I'm  not 
 gonna  watch  you  I'm  literally  in  the
[11:19] environment  where  I  fap  I'm  using  like 
 the  device  that  I  use  the  internet 
 um  social  media  platform  and  everything
[11:24] I'm  just  scrolling  and  oh  there's  the 
 first  post  like  I  just  click  on  it 
 randomly  you  know  like  without  even 
 thinking  about  it  you  click  on  okay
[11:29] there's  a  pair  of  titties  now  now  I'm 
 horny 
 I  didn't  actually  set  boundaries  for  a
[11:34] while  I  struggled  like  this  I  just  kept 
 on  relapsing  and  it  took  me  a  while  to 
 realize  this  that  you  need  to  actually
[11:39] think  of  some  kind  of  restrictions  you 
 can  place  on  yourself  or  like  just
[11:45] restriction  sounds  too  too  negative  but 
 like  more  of  a  boundary  that  you  can 
 place  on  your  habits  so  that  you  don't
[11:50] actually  end  up  in  the  exact  scenario 
 where  you  keep  fat  think  so  for  me  it 
 was  when  I  was  lying  down  all  underneath
[11:55] my  covers  nice  and  warm  and  comfort 
 scrolling  on  Reddit  which  would
[12:00] eventually  lead  to  like  porn  that's  like 
 come  on  that's  a  recipe  for  disaster  it 
 didn't  occur  to  me  that  I  needed  to  set
[12:05] some  kind  of  boundaries  I  think  yeah 
 that's  [ __ ]  stupid  to  keep  doing  this 
 habit  if  I'm  Gonna  Keep  on  um  if  I'm
[12:11] gonna  stay  on  nofa  you  need  to  figure 
 out  right  now  what  is  some  kind  of 
 boundary  that  you  can  place  on  your
[12:17] devices  on  the  internet  because  thing 
 about  it  you  only  have  a  porn  addiction 
 because  of  the  internet  right  you  only 
 have  one  because  it's  very  unlikely  that
[12:23] you're  going  through  like  your  dad's  old 
 magazines  right  now  it's  very  unlikely 
 that  you're  actually  going  to  the  store 
 to  buy  some  VHS  tapes  right  so  it's
[12:30] literally  your  porn  addiction  it's 
 literally  coming  from  like  one  or  two 
 devices  your  computer  or  your  phone 
 right  so  we  need  to  set  some  kind  of
[12:36] boundaries  for  that  now  a  lot  of  people 
 recommend 
 to  get  Pawn  blockers  and  to  get  the
[12:41] website  blockers  and  for  some  people 
 that  seems  to  work  to  a  nice  level  I'd 
 never  liked  that  idea  because  I  had
[12:47] downloaded  I'd  you  know  followed  the 
 craze  I  download  the  um  the  poem  blocker 
 oh  you  can't  go  to  pornhub.com  oh  wow
[12:54] it's  blocked  me  from  going  to 
 pornhub.com 
 oh  man  if  there  was  only  a  hundred
[13:00] million  other  porn  sites  that  I  could  go 
 to  oh  it's  blocked  all  of  the  porn  sites 
 oh  man  if  there's  only  20  different
[13:07] social  media  sites  that  I  could  go  to 
 that  has  Pawn 
 I  don't  think  blocking  it  and  stopping
[13:13] yourself  from  being  able  to  go  there  is 
 like  in  this  kind  of  weight  it's  kind  of
[13:19] like  just  putting  a  blindfold  over  your 
 eye 
 I  think  the  more
[13:25] I  think  the  better  ways  for  you  to  like 
 set  a  psychological  boundary
[13:31] not  some  kind  of  technological  one 
 because  sweet  like  we  should  use
[13:36] technology  to  make  our  life  easier  okay 
 sweet 
 but  I  think  a  lot  more  power  comes  in
[13:42] the  psychological 
 boundary  that  you  can  place  on  yourself 
 and  you  say  these  words  to  yourself  like
[13:48] I'm  not  going  to  go  on  this  app  anymore 
 I  don't  need  this  app  which  you  know
[13:53] Tick  Tock  which  is  where  I  end  up 
 fapping 
 I'm  not  going  to  put  myself  physically
[13:58] in  that  environment  where  I  usually  do 
 fap  so  I'm  not  going  to  just  go  sit  in 
 the  toilet  just  scrolling  pretending  to
[14:04] have  a  [ __ ]  just  scrolling  and  scrolling 
 because  that's  when  I  usually  fat  but 
 I'm  not  just  gonna  go  lie  down  in  the 
 middle  of  the  day  like  some  depressed
[14:10] little  [ __ ]  Goblin 
 anymore  because  I'm  not  like  that  I'm 
 just  gonna  have  a  boundary  I'm  not  gonna
[14:15] do  that  anymore 
 you're  brain  on  porn  by  Gary  Wilson  is  a
[14:20] really  famous  book  and  this  is  one  that 
 a  lot  of  people  speak  about  and  he  talks 
 about  finding  healthier  ways  to  cope  so
[14:27] there's  a  chapter  in  this  where  he  he 
 pretty  much  just  says  like  get  on  to 
 self-improvement  instead  of
[14:33] watching  porn  and  and  fapping  find 
 healthier  ways  to  cope 
 I  don't  really  like  the  word  cope
[14:39] because  it  it  means  that  you  know  where 
 it's  something  to  cope  with  it's
[14:44] something  that  we're  struggling  with 
 it's  something  that  we  need  there's  a 
 lack  when  we're  not  watching  porn 
 there's  a  lack  women  not  fapping  or
[14:50] something  which  I  I  don't  like  that  that 
 thinking  and  so  I  think 
 find  like  a  healthier  outlets  for  your
[14:57] energy  and  also  find  healthier  habits  so 
 your  day  should  be  100  productive  this
[15:04] is  like  you  want  to  know  honestly  the 
 brutal  fact  honestly  which  pisses  a  lot 
 of  people  off  you  want  to  quit  porn  you
[15:10] want  to  quit  fapping  you  want  to  get  all 
 the  success  that  you  want  you  want  to 
 build  yourself  up  to  be  attractive  make
[15:15] money  get  girls  you  want  to  know  all 
 like  really  the  [ __ ]  real  secret  to 
 this  bro  have  a  day  that's  100 
 productive  all  the  like  the  weak
[15:22] seemingly  like  left-wing  people  who  have 
 got  skinny  necks  and  low  testosterone 
 that  they  don't  like  this  advice  and
[15:27] they  always  criticize  me  and  they  always 
 say  like  oh  your  day  shouldn't  just  be 
 productive  and  stuff  you  should  you  know
[15:32] you  should  rest  and  I'm  like  rest  is 
 productive  you  dumbass  oh  no  but  you  you 
 should  also  play  video  games  video  games
[15:38] no  they're  not 
 your  day  should  be  100  productive  your 
 calendar  like  you  should  have  a  blocked
[15:44] military  routine  like  you  know  what 
 you're  doing  at  every  hour  of  the  day 
 right  here  right  now  I  know  what  I'm
[15:50] doing  at  every  hour  of  the  day  because 
 my  calendar  is  already  set  I  have  a 
 video  that's  on  my  channel  you  can  go
[15:55] look  I'm  not  gonna  link  it  but  you  can 
 just  go  look 
 and  it's  about  monk  mode  productivity
[16:00] 2023  like  the  thumbnails  like  a  picture 
 of  my  face  and  it  says  like  oh  he  left 
 and  he  came  back  successful  or  something
[16:05] right  go  and  have  a  look  at  how  I  speak 
 about  the  calendar  and  the  military 
 routine  in  there  you  need  to  be
[16:11] productive  100  of  the  day  this  is  this 
 is  what  men  are  supposed  to  be  like 
 honestly  this  is  what  like  a  man  is
[16:16] supposed  to  get  to  a  certain  age  at  like 
 literally  age  13  you're  supposed  to  be  a 
 man  in  my  opinion  you're  supposed  to  go
[16:21] work  and  literally  just  [ __ ]  work  all 
 day  and  be  productive  all  day  now  you 
 don't  that  doesn't  mean  that  you  need  to
[16:26] like  you  know  grind  hardcore  16  hour 
 days  and  be  sleep  deprived  because  being 
 productive  also  means  sleeping  well  it
[16:32] also  means  going  out  into  nature  but  it 
 just  means  that  you're  not  wasting  any 
 time  because  that  is  a  sin
[16:37] wasting  time  watching  [ __ ]  Rick  and 
 Morty  is  a  sin  watching  pointless  videos
[16:42] that  you're  not  going  to  use  just  to 
 fill  up  the  time  is  a  sin  100  of  your 
 day  should  be  productive  that  does  not
[16:47] mean  that  you  need  to  like  you  know  like 
 grind  at  the  same  task  or  study  for  15
[16:52] hours  a  day  you  should  have  some  kind  of 
 balance  you  should  still  goes  to  the  gym 
 because  that's  productive  you  should 
 still  eat  because  that's  productive  you
[16:58] should  still  meditate  because  that's 
 productive 
 but  when  you  set  up  this  productive  like 
 military  style  routine  this  time  table
[17:05] this  like  okay  day  by  day  exactly  this 
 is  what  we're  gonna  do
[17:10] it's  it's  hard  to  even  consider  to  be  a 
 a  wanker  honestly  it's  hard  to  be  one  at
[17:17] that  point  because  you  you're  you  know 
 like  you  have  this  extra  level  of 
 accountability  you  know  exactly  what  you
[17:22] should  do  at  all  given  times  I  know  that 
 I'm  gonna  record  till  8  30  a.m  today  and
[17:27] so  not  only  am  I  you  know  I'm  I'm  away 
 from  porn  and  fapping  and  stuff  but  when 
 you  know  exactly  what  you're  gonna  do  at
[17:33] all  hours  of  the  day 
 you  automatically  just  start  to  go  and 
 do  it
[17:39] you  have  this  extra  resistance  to  doing 
 anything  that  isn't  in  your  calendar 
 which  means  it's  even  harder  for  you  to
[17:45] go  and  fap  and  watch  porn  because  you 
 know  what  you  could  be  doing  right  now
[17:50] find  like  I  would  say  not  a  healthy  way 
 to  cope  but  I  would  say  [ __ ]  like  set  up
[17:55] a  healthy  masculine  discipline  military 
 style
[18:00] timetable  routine  calendar 
 once  your  Energy's  going  in  there  and
[18:06] you've  got  other  things  to  do  that  are 
 actually  healthy  for  you  that  are 
 productive  for  you  and  your  goals  and 
 your  mission  and  your  purpose
[18:12] I  think  you're  going  to  be  less  likely 
 to  find  yourself  like  falling  back  into 
 Pawn
[18:21] rewired  is  another  book  it's  by  Erica 
 spiel
[18:26] Spielman  and  she  talks  about  uh 
 mindfulness  in  this  so  mindfulness  is
[18:32] something  that's  really  helped  me  and  I 
 think  it  would  really  really  help  any 
 guy  who's  struggling  from  the  situation
[18:38] you've  probably  heard  of  it  before  but 
 let  me  explain  it's  even  a  completely 
 different  way  mindfulness  is  the  reward
[18:45] of  meditation 
 so  we  need  to  just  focus  on  meditation 
 meditation  there's  there's  hundreds  of
[18:52] different  thousands  of  different  ways  to 
 meditate  but  I'm  just  going  to teach  you 
 the  one  that  you  probably  care  about  the 
 most  which  is  going  to  help  you  with 
 addictions  with  porn  it's  going  to  make
[18:58] you  more  successful  more  focused  and 
 have  like  negative  thoughts  right  and 
 the  kind  of  meditation  that  we're  gonna
[19:03] do  this  a  simple  step-by-step  framework 
 which  no  one  else  has  ever  spoke  about 
 but  as  soon  as  you  hear  this  it's  just
[19:09] gonna  click  right  so  step  one  is  that 
 okay  stop  meditating  so  we  just  focus  on 
 something  like  our  breath  do  this  with
[19:14] me  right  just  focus  on  your  breath  this 
 is  step  one  step  one  is  when  we're 
 focusing  on  the  breath  and  we  literally
[19:19] just  feel  like  just  feel  it  right  so 
 just  pick  one  spot  in  your  physical  body 
 where  you  literally  just  want  to  focus
[19:24] imagine  one  millimeter  so  you  could  pick 
 like  right  here  on  your  nose  or  you
[19:29] could  pick  like  on  your  stomach  or 
 whatever  you  want  to  do  so  just  focus  on 
 one  spot 
 and  just  breathe
[19:35] back  step  on  step  two  is  invisible  step 
 two  actually  happens  without  you
[19:41] realizing  it  and  it's  when  your  mind 
 goes  away  from  the  thought  so  literally 
 usually  within  some  milliseconds  like
[19:48] usually  within  a  second  or  two  when 
 we're  focusing  on  the  breath  we're 
 focusing  on  that  exact  millimeter  of
[19:53] somewhere  on  our  skin  for  example  our 
 mind  will  go  somewhere  else  and  we'll
[19:58] start  to  think  of  other  things  and  we 
 don't  actually  realize  it  yet  because 
 when  your  mind  goes  somewhere  else  it's
[20:03] almost  like  you  are  that  you  feel  like 
 you  are  the  thought  at  that  point  and  so 
 you  are  indulging  in  the  thought  and  you
[20:08] don't  really 
 you're  not  very  aware  that  you  are 
 thinking
[20:13] and  so  for  step  two 
 that's  when  your  mind  wanders  now  step 
 three  is  when  you  actually  become
[20:19] consciously  aware  that  your  mind  has 
 wandered  it's  that  that  aha  moment  of 
 like  oh  I  have  drifted  away  into
[20:25] thoughts  man  I  suck  at  meditation  but 
 instead  of  feeling  bad  about  it  and 
 thinking  oh  I'm  not  able  to  focus  you
[20:31] realize  that  actually  step  four  is  when 
 we  just  return  back  to  the  original
[20:37] Point  step  four  straight  after  when  we 
 get  the  thought  oh  yeah  like  I'm  deep  in
[20:42] thought  right  now  step  four  is  simply 
 okay  come  back  to  the  breath  return  back
[20:47] to  the  breath 
 this  bit  here  returning  back  to  the 
 breath  that's  like  one  rep  that's  one
[20:53] push-up  that's  one  bicep  curl  for  the 
 brain  this  is  the  process  you  need  to  go 
 through  this  a  lot  of  guys  try  and
[20:59] meditate  and  then  get  upset  when  they 
 can't  be  focused  but  you  need  to  go 
 through  this  and  the  better  you  get  a 
 meditation  the  faster  that  you'll  get
[21:05] one  rep  you  start  by  focusing  on  that 
 exact  spot  somewhere  in  your  body  and 
 just  feel  your  breath
[21:10] within  literally  a  few  seconds  you  don't 
 even  realize  it  just  yet  obviously  we're 
 very  aware  that  we're  doing  this  but 
 within  a  few  seconds  your  mind  will  just
[21:17] wonder  then  you'll  realize  your  mind  is 
 wandering  you'll  get  that  moment  of  like 
 oh  I  was  deep  in  thought  and  then  all
[21:22] you  have  to  do  is  just  return  back  to 
 that  exact  place  that  you  were 
 previously  focusing  on  and  just 
 completing  this  is  one  rep  do  that  a
[21:29] thousand  times  I  complete  this  four  step 
 cycle  a  thousand  times  and  you  will 
 literally  see  like  a  significant
[21:34] difference  of  a  significant  Improvement 
 of  how  mindful  you  are  and  the  more
[21:39] mindful  you  are  the  more  all  of  your 
 life  gets  better  but  really  how 
 mindfulness  is  used  to  overcome
[21:45] addictions  because  it's  one  of  the  most 
 effective  addiction  treatments  is  that 
 it  kind  of  feels  like  it  gives  you  more
[21:52] control  over  your  Cravings  so  oft  like 
 sometimes  we  get  these  hard  Cravings
[21:57] that  eventually  just  wear  us  down  until 
 eventually  we  just  go  and  do  the  bad 
 habit  right  mindfulness  like  the  more
[22:03] mindful  you  become  it's  like  the 
 stronger  you  get  to  be  able  to  just 
 ignore  those  Cravings  to  be  able  to  just
[22:08] like  understand  that  you  don't  have  to 
 actually  submit  to  the  craving  and  it 
 just  does  less  to  you  so  imagine  this
[22:14] right  you  have  impulses  which  are 
 usually  bad  right  usually  like  most  of
[22:19] our  impulses  are  quite  negative  in  the 
 modern  day  they're  very  like  you  know 
 short  term  instant  gratification  right
[22:24] mindfulness  gives  you  impulse  control 
 so  when  you  want  to  go  and  do  that  thing
[22:29] that's  not  good  for  the  long  term  which 
 is  an  Impulse  because  you  can  get  it 
 right  now
[22:34] mindfulness  helps  you  with  impulse 
 control  by  pushing  what  you  want  further 
 and  further  away  because  you  understand
[22:40] that  delaying  gratification  being 
 patient  going  for  your  long-term  goal  is 
 better  so  literally  we  could  set  up  a
[22:46] study  this  has  been  done  so  many  times 
 but  we  could  set  up  a  study  where  we 
 just  get  two  participants  and  we  just
[22:51] ask  them  do  you  want  this  chocolate  bar 
 the  people  who  meditate  are  more  likely 
 to  say  no  because  it's  not  healthy  for
[22:57] them  it's  simple  as  that  if  you  meditate 
 the  reason  why  it's  genuinely  a 
 superpower  is  because  you're  literally
[23:03] like  it  helps  your  impulse  control  if 
 you've  ever  heard  of  the  term  impulse 
 control  that  is  incredible
[23:09] Amazing  Alex  hamosi  well  an  entrepreneur 
 and  author  I  really  like  he  ended  up
[23:15] looking  into 
 a  bunch  of  uh  six  really  really
[23:20] successful  people  he's  talking  about 
 billionaires  right  and  he  said  they've 
 got  three  traits  in  common  they  have  a
[23:25] superiority  complex  they're  very 
 insecure  and  they  also  have  impulse
[23:30] control 
 so  they  think  they're  better  than 
 everyone  else  but  they've  got  deep 
 rooted  insecurity  that  they  feel  like
[23:35] they  need  to  prove  it  and  they've  got 
 impulse  control  so  that  they're  able  to 
 delay  gratification  that  makes  a
[23:41] billionaire 
 these  two  things  are  psychological 
 things  that's  a  different  video  but 
 impulse  control  is  33  of  being  a
[23:49] billionaire  of  being  a  millionaire 
 whatever  success  that  you  want  a  lot  of 
 it's  going  to  come  from  you  literally
[23:54] just  choosing  to  wait  for  the  long-term 
 goal  isn't  it  right  it's  going  to  be 
 delayed  gratification 
 mindfulness  is  delayed  gratification
[24:01] mindfulness  lets  you  delay  gratification 
 if  there's  one  major  thing  that  allows
[24:06] you  to  choose  that  that  second 
 marshmallow  it's  mindfulness
[24:11] and  so  practice  Mindful  and  stop 
 meditating  so  there's  a  free  app  that 
 you  can  use  and  it's  called  medito  and
[24:17] you  can  also  just  follow  my  meditation 
 it's  a  video  on  YouTube  just  search 
 Hamza  10  minute  meditation  onto  YouTube
[24:23] where  I  literally  just  tell  you  to 
 breathe  alongside  me  so  it's  literally 
 just  me  every  three  seconds  just  saying
[24:28] like  breathe 
 exhale  inhale  exhale  and  just  follow 
 along  and  you  like  deep  breathe  with  me
[24:33] and  you  can  follow  that  or  you  can  use 
 the  app  that  I  use  which  is  medito 
 m-e-d-i-t-o  and  that's  a  really  really
[24:39] good  app 
 my  lights  just  like  stopped  working  this 
 this  is  [ __ ]  low  budget  Productions
[24:45] honestly  I'm  here  I've  got  allergies  I 
 keep  like  using  [ __ ]  toilet  paper  to
[24:50] wipe  my  allergies  on  there 
 so 
 there  is  then  a  book  breaking  the  cycle
[24:57] by  George  Collins  and  he  spoke  about  a 
 support  system  so  having  people  like
[25:02] other  people  who  can  help  you  overcome 
 this  addiction  this  feels  cringe 
 honestly  I  don't  have  the  confidence  to
[25:08] ask  someone  in  my  real  life  hi  I've  got 
 a  porn  addiction  can  you  help  me  but
[25:13] this  is  why  I  think  internet  communities 
 are  really  good  because  if  you  go  on  to 
 for  example  there's  subreddits  for  this
[25:19] this  online  blogs  for  this  this  Discord 
 like  my  I've  got  a  big  Discord  server 
 you  can  just  find  the  link  somewhere
[25:25] that's  got  200  000  guys  in  and  some  you 
 know  there's  a  page  for  on  there  for
[25:30] like  nofap  and  everything  I've  got  a 
 private  Community  which  is  like  super 
 [ __ ]  expensive  so  you  probably  can't 
 afford  it  but  in  there  we'll  speak  about
[25:36] these  things  as  well  and  people  get  to 
 like  actually  hop  on  a  video  call  with 
 me  and  ask  me  questions  when  you  have  a
[25:41] support  network  when  you  have  like  other 
 people  who  can  help  you  with  this  and 
 mostly  honestly  when  you  can  just  speak
[25:46] to  someone  and  kind  of  have  someone 
 who's  more  experienced  than  you  guide 
 you  through  the  like  the  thing  that  you
[25:53] need  to  do  that  becomes  really  valuable 
 but  I  actually  genuinely  think  that  but
[25:58] this  is  going  to  be  controversial  as 
 [ __ ]  but  honestly  I  I  genuinely  think 
 that  getting  coaching  from  someone  is 
 more  valuable  than  therapy  therapy  is
[26:04] very  rishy  washy  we're  not  going  to  do 
 any  practical  [ __ ]  it's  very  feminine 
 right  coaching  is  like  okay  you  will
[26:09] tell  me  what  the  problem  is  and  I  would 
 sit  here  and  listen  to  you 
 and  you'd  ask  me  like  and  you  know  so
[26:14] this  is  why  I'm  struggling  I  just  keep 
 you  know  fapping  every  three  days  every 
 time  you  know  like  I  go  on  to  Reddit  do
[26:19] you  think  I  should  stop  using  Reddit 
 and  a  good  coach  would  say
[26:24] what  do  you  think 
 and  you'll  say  yeah  I  should  probably 
 stop  using  Reddit  because  you  know 
 that's  that's  when  I  stop  you  know  I
[26:29] should  probably  stop  using  Tick  Tock 
 because  that's  when  I  that's  when  I  fap 
 but  like  you  know  I've  got  to  use  tick
[26:34] tock  for  my  business  that  a  good  coach 
 would  say 
 is  there  a  way  that  you  can  still  use 
 tick  tock  for  your  business  but  you
[26:40] wouldn't  be  in  the  vulnerable  situation 
 of  ending  up  watching  porn  oh  yeah  well 
 you  know  there's  this  other  app  where
[26:46] you  can't  even  see  any  of  the  content  on 
 Tick  Tock  or  I  can  use  the  tick  tock 
 website  actually  and  you  can't  even  see 
 anything  there  I  can  just  upload  it
[26:52] there  actually  I  can  try  that  from  now 
 on  like  that  when  you've  got  like  people 
 especially  someone  who's  who's  multiple
[26:58] steps  ahead  of  you  and  you  get  to  ask 
 him  for  advice  it's  like  he's  already 
 paved  the  way  he's  cleared  the  jungle
[27:04] already  so  all  you  have  to  do  is  just  do 
 what  he  says  and  if  he's  like  a  good 
 enough  coach  or  Mentor  that's  fantastic
[27:09] this  is  Again  by  the  same  guy  I  [ __ ] 
 love  Alexi  bro  but  by  the  same  guy  he  is
[27:14] right  now  the  biggest  advocator  for 
 investing  into  mentorships  and  coaching
[27:19] to  spend  money  his  words  is  spend 
 aggressively  on  mental  ships  coaching
[27:24] Community 
 um  education  all  this  stuff  right  and 
 I'm  not  even  just  bringing  this  up  just 
 because  I  sell  my  old  stuff  here  with  my
[27:30] stuff  really  [ __ ]  expensive  so  you 
 probably  can't  afford  it  most  people 
 can't  afford  it  but  that's  fine  because 
 my  private  Community  only  has  like  200
[27:36] guys  in  which  means  that  okay  we're 
 actually  very  close  to  each  other  for 
 reference  so  my  private  Community  Adonis
[27:41] Academy  has  200  guys  we're  close  it's 
 our  support  system  where  people  can  come 
 in  and  speak  about  things  like  porn 
 addiction  my  Discord  Community  has  200
[27:49] 000  guys  we're  not  close  in  there  it's 
 just  like  a  big  [ __ ]  Global  platform 
 so  that's  why  I  genuinely  think  if
[27:55] you've  got  the  money  for  it  right  now 
 you  should  look  for  like  some  kind  of 
 porn  community  and  I'm  not  even  just
[28:00] saying  mine  mine  isn't  really 
 specifically  about  porn  mines  just  like 
 self-improvement  for  men  come  meet  me  in
[28:05] person  hop  on  video  calls  with  me  and 
 stuff  but  I'm  sure  that  there's  going  to 
 be  I've  not  joined  any  but  I'm  sure 
 there's  going  to  be  like  some  actual
[28:10] like  anti  like  you  know  quitting  porn 
 um  communities  mentorships  coaching  if  I
[28:16] if  you  had  like  a  hundred  dollars  or  if 
 I  had  100  100  bro  I'd  be  literally 
 looking  online  right  now  finding  someone
[28:21] who's  giving  good  porn  advice  and 
 literally  going  on  to  calls  with  them 
 asking  them  to  Mentor  me  seeing  if
[28:26] they've  got  some  programs  and  culture 
 courses  and  stuff  and  just  you'd  want  to 
 be  around  other  people  who  are  going
[28:31] through  the  same  problem  especially  to 
 be  leaded  by  someone  who  has  already
[28:36] solved  the  problem  that  you're  going 
 through  so  I  think  a  support  system  is 
 is  10  out  of  10  and  if  you've  got  the
[28:42] money  for  it  Go  and  invest  in  one  if  not 
 there's  so  many  free  Discord  servers  out 
 there  and  you  can  literally  just  you
[28:47] know  message  people  and  hop  on  calls 
 with  them  and  make  your  own  support 
 system  for  free
[28:52] foreign 
 thing  which  it  it  reminds  me  here  is
[28:57] Jordan  Peterson  said  that  you  have  to 
 take  responsibility  for  your  life  and 
 you  cannot  blame  addictions  and  problems
[29:03] and  adversities  onto  other  people 
 because 
 it's  it's  very  easy  at  this  point  when
[29:09] we're  talking  about  support  system  to  to 
 get  upset  here  a  lot  of  guys  will  do 
 this  like  you  know  they'll  be  like  oh
[29:14] woe  is  me  I  don't  have  anyone  and 
 you  can't  you  have  to  take 
 responsibility  for  that  honestly  I  don't
[29:20] think  there's  a  reason  right  now  for  you 
 to  not  have  some  kind  of  support  system 
 or  online  community  like  there's  so  many
[29:26] online  for  free  but  literally  not  mine 
 but  I'm  just  saying  this  free 
 communities  you  should  be  like  a  social
[29:32] active  part  of  at  least  one  of  those 
 because  social  connection  having  a
[29:37] support  system  having  people  you  can 
 speak  to  about  your  problems  having 
 other  people  that  you  can  help  it's  one
[29:42] of  the  most  important  parts  of  life  if 
 you  ever  looked  at  research  for  like 
 life  happiness  literally  always  at  the
[29:47] top  is  social  connection  it's  literally 
 just  having  people  in  your  life  and  so 
 many  guys  just  live  these  These  Quiet
[29:53] lives  of  desperation  so  many  guys  just 
 live  lonely  alone 
 like  you're  an  island
[29:58] men  are  not  meant  to  be  Islands
[30:03] the  porn  myth  by  Matt  farad
[30:08] foreign 
 so  one  of  the  things  in  this  book  was 
 that  he  mentioned  that  we  should  just
[30:14] learn  more  about  addiction  like 
 addiction  science  and
[30:19] when  I  was  reading  like  I  read  a  summary 
 of  This  Book  and  I  read  somewhere  okay 
 Matt  frad  the  porn  myth
[30:25] to  learn  more  about  addictions  I  think 
 there's  one  guy  that  we  should  go  to  and 
 it  is  Andrew  huberman  you've  probably
[30:31] seen  him  before  the  YouTube  channel  is 
 huberman  lab 
 h-u-b-e-r-m-a-n  huberman  Lab  and  he  has
[30:38] a  bunch  of  full-length  podcasts  this  is 
 literally  one  of  the  best  podcasters  in 
 the  entire  world  but  in  my  opinion  and
[30:43] he's  got  multiple  full-length  podcasts 
 one  on  an  addiction  in  general  where  he
[30:48] explains  like  what  happens  to  your 
 neurons  and  everything  and  it  sounds 
 complex  but  when  he's  explaining  it  to 
 you  and  you  get  this  like  knowledge  this
[30:54] aha  moment  it's  like  oh  that's  why  that 
 thing  is  happening  to  me  so  oh  okay  so  I
[31:00] could  probably  do  this  thing  instead  and 
 that  thing  wouldn't  happen  to  me  you 
 know  you  it's  education  think  about  how
[31:05] like  you've  always  heard  of  how 
 important  education  is  and  not  like  the 
 school  system  but  just  how  important 
 knowledge  and  wisdom  is  Right  you've
[31:10] always  heard  this  and  so  we  can  go  get 
 this  [ __ ]  for  free  online  so  huberman 
 has  one  on  on  addiction  he's  got
[31:17] multiply  I  think  on  specific  porn  if 
 you're  watching  this  video  right  now  and 
 you're  still  struggling  with  Porn  Bro
[31:22] and  you've  not  watched  this  podcast 
 you're  literally  it's  all  for  free  it's 
 genuinely  for  free  it's  worth  thousands
[31:27] of  dollars  to  watch  a  few  of  his 
 episodes  go  search  up  huberman  lad  lab 
 porn  addiction  and  just  go  see  like
[31:34] literally  the  full  left  ones  just  put 
 them  on  whilst  you  eat  put  them  on 
 whilst  you're  just  kind  of  like  you  know 
 just  wait  waiting  around  for  something
[31:39] put  them  on  whilst  you  commute  in  whilst 
 you're  running  and  stuff  like  well  I 
 don't  know  why  people  wouldn't  go  and
[31:44] get  like  a  really  good  knowledge  on  the 
 problem  that  they're  they're  trying  to 
 solve  these  days  so  learn  about
[31:49] addiction 
 the  next  book  is  pornography  at 
 pornography  am  I  saying  that  weird
[31:55] pornography  addiction  breaking  the 
 chains  by  David  J
[32:00] and  he  mentioned  like  this  psychological 
 like  he  he  said  to  practice
[32:05] self-compassion 
 to  essentially  understand  like  we're
[32:11] actually  going  through  something 
 difficult  here 
 and  that  we  should  feel
[32:17] positive  and  caring  about  ourselves 
 self-compassion  is  something  that
[32:22] honestly  sounds  like  it's  for  [ __ ] 
 doesn't  it  it  sounds  like  it's  like  some 
 wheat  [ __ ]  but  honestly  it's  actually
[32:27] something  that  I  think  I'm  very  high  in 
 so  I  think  in  in  a  lot  of  ways  I  have  a
[32:32] lot  of  masculine  like  hard  discipline 
 traits  like  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  [ __ ]  go 
 and  do  the  work  but  I  also  have  a  very
[32:37] high  level  of  self-compassion  that  when 
 I'm  going  through  something  difficult  I 
 put  it  into  perspective  and  realize  like
[32:43] oh  this  is  actually  quite  an  uphill 
 battle  this  is  actually  like  you  know
[32:48] like  I'm  just  being  fair  it  is  actually 
 hard  so  when  I  was  trying  to  quit  porn 
 and  when  I  was  also  trying  to  quit 
 social  media  and  I  kept  on  failing  I
[32:54] kept  on  relapsing  and  you  know  there  was 
 points  when  I  would  like  belittle  myself 
 there  was  points  when  I  would  actually
[32:59] say  negative  things  about  myself 
 you  probably  are  doing  the  exact  same 
 right  so  that  that  [ __ ]  exact
[33:05] situation  where  I'd  wake  up  I'd  stay 
 lying  down  in  bed  sideways  just
[33:10] scrolling  and  scrolling  and  scrolling 
 and  hoping  to  find  porn  and  oh  look 
 there's  porn  I'll  click  on  this  name 
 here  I'll  click  on  this  profile  I'll  do
[33:16] this  you  know  you  go  down  the  [ __ ] 
 Rabbit  Hole  we've  all  been  there  by  the 
 end  of  it  you're  looking  at  some  like 
 big  titty  Asian  woman  or  something  like
[33:23] that  you  know  you're  just  down  the 
 rabbit  hole  and  after  you've  messed  up 
 on  this  goal  I  often  did  like  a  straight
[33:29] like  honestly  it  got  to  the  point  when  I 
 wasn't  even  getting  post  nut  Clarity  I
[33:35] was  getting 
 intranut  Clarity  with  with  the  the 
 negative  thoughts  would  happen  as  I  was
[33:42] literally  nothing  like  I  literally  like 
 I'm  not  trying  to  get  detailed  but  in 
 the  moments  of  climax  that's  when  the
[33:49] negative  thought  I  didn't  even  get  like 
 the  10  seconds  of  bliss  anymore  bro  so  I
[33:54] started  to  feel  [ __ ]  what  the  [ __ ]  am  I 
 doing  shame  and  like  oh  this  is  gross  oh 
 like  you're  a  [ __ ]  loser  and  you're
[33:59] like  oh  I'm  so  power  left  towards  this 
 you  know  these  things  that  we  say  to 
 ourselves  is  that  gonna  help  you  think
[34:04] about  it  if  you're  convincing  yourself 
 that  you're  a  loser  that  you're 
 powerless  that  this  is  of  such  a  huge
[34:09] problem  is  that  gonna  help  you  to  feel 
 like  the  kind  of  guy  who  doesn't  need 
 porn
[34:14] because  the  kind  of  guy  who  needs  porn 
 usually  feels  like  a  bit  of  a  loser 
 and  so  telling  our  like  belittling
[34:20] ourselves  I  realized  wasn't  gonna  work 
 and  around  the  time  when  I  was  like  19 
 or  something  that's  when  I  started  to
[34:26] really  practice  a  lot  more 
 self-compassion  and  I  had  like  this  this 
 childlike  energy  come  back  to  me  where  I
[34:32] started  to  understand  the  problems  I  was 
 going  through  and  realized  like  I  have 
 to  be  my  own  best  friend  and  like  I'm
[34:37] gonna  push  myself  hard  and  I'm  gonna  get 
 annoyed  when  like  I'm  being  a  [ __ ]  but 
 at  the  same  time  I  I  do  want  to  be  nice
[34:44] to  myself  I  want  to  have  like  a  nice 
 positive  like  healthy  happy  Pleasant
[34:49] joyful  cheerful  mind  as  many  times  as 
 possible  because  I  don't  want  to  live  in
[34:54] a  state  of  like  constant  like  negativity 
 it's  just  not  how  I  wanted  to  live  and 
 so  I  started  to  actually  like  I  started
[35:00] to  speak  to  myself  in  a  way  that 
 honestly  most  people  watching  maybe  not
[35:05] this  but  like  most  people  in  general 
 would  find  it  so  cringe  and 
 uncomfortable  honestly  I  started  to 
 speak  to  myself  as  if  I  was  a  [ __ ]
[35:12] Legend  I  know  it's  gonna  sound  cringe 
 but  literally  the  term  like  alpha  male 
 meant  a  lot  to  me  this  was  when  I  was  18
[35:17] or  19.  I  I  had  lived  my  entire  life  like 
 a  [ __ ]  loser  okay  I  had  literally 
 been  the  the  guy  who'd  been  playing
[35:23] video  games  who  never  was  able  to  like 
 even  speak  to  girls  never  mind  actually 
 attract  them  the  few  times  I  had
[35:28] confidence  and  enough  to  go  and  speak  to 
 a  girl  I'd  [ __ ]  it  up  so  badly  you  know 
 I  I  really  had  a  lot  of  negativity  I
[35:33] didn't  do  well  in  school  so  my  parents 
 used  to  [ __ ]  beat  my  ass  so  I  you 
 know  I  had  a  lot  of  reasons  to  be
[35:38] negative  and  so  I  could  listen  to 
 everyone  else  and  be  like  this  [ __ ] 
 mundane  guy  who  doesn't  even  think
[35:44] positive  about  himself  because  that's  a 
 bit  cringe  and  it  makes  people 
 uncomfortable  or  I  could  start  to  delude 
 myself  and  think  yeah  I'm  a  [ __ ]
[35:50] Legend  I  would  look  at  myself  in  the 
 mirror  and  say  I'm  a  legend  I  would  Flex 
 my  muscles  when  I  didn't  I  wasn't  even
[35:55] that  big  and  I  would  literally  say  to 
 myself  yeah  I'm  such  an  animal  for  male 
 and  stuff  and  this  sounds  so  [ __ ]
[36:00] cringe  to  like  the  heartless 
 [ __ ]  out  there  who  don't  expect 
 like  they  don't  know  what  we're  actually 
 going  through  because  I'm  telling  you
[36:05] right  now  that  if  you're  anything  like 
 me  doing  this  in  private  and  you  don't 
 have  to  tell  anyone  you  don't  have  to 
 show  anyone  but  the  next  time  you  walk
[36:10] in  front  of  a  mirror  literally  think  to 
 yourself  like  yeah  I  am  a  [ __ ]  Legend 
 look  at  the  type  of  content  that  I'm
[36:15] consuming  compared  to  my  friends  who  are 
 still  Jeffries  I'm  actually  trying  to 
 quit  watching  porn  when  over  2  billion
[36:21] men  in  the  world  are  completely 
 complacent  with  it  I'm  gonna  be 
 successful  as  [ __ ]  I  am  a  legend  I  am  a
[36:27] beast  I  am  an  alpha  male  and  and  this 
 sounds  so  cringe  but  it  helped  me  it  I 
 wouldn't  be  here  today  if  I  didn't  do
[36:32] these  cringe  affirmations  if  I  didn't 
 like  in  a  cringe  way  consider  myself  to 
 be  like  an  alpha  male  before  I  was  one  I
[36:38] was  still  a  [ __ ]  I  was  still  an 
 alcoholic  I  was  addicted  to  drugs  at  the 
 time  when  I  was  saying  this  I  didn't
[36:43] even  have  that  much  muscle  that  I  was 
 flexing  but  it  helped  because  suddenly 
 when  I  would  say  these  things  to  myself
[36:48] it's  like  I  wanted  to  then  ingrain  this 
 new  identity  this  new  personality  these 
 habits  to  make  this  real
[36:54] and  so  then  I'd  go  to  the  gym  straight 
 afterwards  and  so  then  I'd  throw  my 
 phone  away  you  know  when  I  was  thinking
[36:59] about  watching  porn  and  I'm  just  doing 
 the  death  scroll  start  like  suddenly 
 like  the  cringe  thought  the  cringe
[37:04] thought  would  pop  into  my  mind  as  I'm 
 scrolling  I  throw  the  phone  away  but 
 like  yeah  I'm  not  some  beta  male  who's 
 gonna  start  watching  porn  again  I'm  not
[37:10] a  beta  male  I'm  not  a  beta  male 
 and  it  helped  I  never  told  anyone  I  was 
 thinking  about  these  things  up  until  I
[37:16] started  this  YouTube  channel  and  I'm 
 like  I'm  past  doing  that  now  because 
 I've  just  you  know  it's  a  part  of  my
[37:21] personality  I  am  who  I  am  now  and  I've 
 already  made  in  like  fantastic  progress 
 but  I'm  telling  you  right  now  if  I
[37:27] listened  to  all  these  [ __ ]  who  are 
 telling  you  that  this  is  cringe  that  you 
 shouldn't  like  talk  highly  of  yourself
[37:32] that  you  should  just  like  belittle 
 yourself  that  if  you  talk  about  your 
 successes  that's  a  bad  thing  you're 
 egotistical  the  amount  of  people  who've
[37:38] called  me  egotistical  arrogant 
 narcissist  and  they're  all  still  [ __ ] 
 losers
[37:43] but  I'm  actually  loving  my  life  now  so 
 you  can  choose  you  can  be  the  guy  who's 
 in  safety  who's  so  reserved  because
[37:49] there's  a  few  people  who  are  judging  you 
 every  time  you've  tried  to  show  a  bit 
 more  confidence  there's  a  few  people  who 
 judge  you  so  you  can  be  in  their  cage
[37:54] for  the  rest  of  your  life  if  you  want  or 
 you  can  destroy  their  perceptions  of  you
[37:59] and  go  live  the  life  that  you  actually 
 want  you  need  to  destroy  someone's 
 perceptions  either  you  destroy  yourself
[38:04] and  live  a  [ __ ]  shell  of  a  life  or 
 you  destroy  the  perceptions  of  the  of 
 the  people  that  you  don't  even  like
[38:09] anyway  who  are  saying  that  you  know 
 trying  to  be  ultra  confident  is  a  bad 
 thing  especially  for  young  men
[38:15] especially  when  you're  just  trying  to 
 find  yourself  and  you  need  like  an  extra 
 wind  in  your  life  you  need  like  an  extra
[38:20] like  gust  like  some  fire  in  your  belly 
 you  need  to  think  of  yourself  highly  in
[38:26] the  modern  day  this  has  scene  is  so  bad 
 but  I'm  telling  you  right  now  every  King 
 every  great  leader  saw  themselves  as  as
[38:33] almost  like  a  living  God  every  single 
 one  you  don't  get  to  a  place  of  of
[38:38] superiority  without  that  this  bell  curve 
 of  of  we  can  say  ego  you  need  to  get  to
[38:45] the  top  of  this  bell  curve  of  like 
 literally  you  know  saying  I'm  the  best 
 I'm  the  greatest  bro  go  watch  any  go
[38:50] watch  any  [ __ ]  athlete  that  you  look 
 up  to  there's  gonna  be  a  period  you  can 
 watch  in  their  interviews  where  they're 
 literally  saying  I'm  the  best  ever  I'm
[38:56] the  greatest  God  put  me  on  this  Earth  to 
 be  to  win  this  sport  every  single  one  of 
 them  every  great  little  leader  every
[39:02] conqueror  has  been  at  the  top  of  this 
 bell  curve  of  like  of 
 self-compassion  to  a  level  that's
[39:08] narcissistic  and  then  once  you  start  to 
 get  because  that's  what  causes  the 
 success  right  that's  our  feeling  of
[39:14] superiority  that  Alexa  Mosey  talks  about 
 that's  what  causes  the  success  it's  this 
 this  arrogant  self-belief  that  you  you
[39:20] deserve  more  so  I  will  get  there  because 
 that  causes  this  weird  feeling  where 
 you're  right  wait  I  don't  I'm  not  there 
 just  yet  and  there's  extra  attention  so
[39:26] you  get  there  eventually  and  so  every 
 guy  goes  to  the  top  of  this  bell  curve 
 and  then  you  start  to  get  the  success
[39:32] that  you  wanted  all  this  time  and  then 
 you  kind  of  level  off  and  you  don't 
 really  need  to  use  this  like  alpha  male
[39:37] personality  anymore  and  you  just  are  who 
 you  are  because  now  you've  already 
 achieved  this  success  and  maybe  we  when
[39:42] you  go  down  a  little  bit  and  you're 
 achieving  the  success  naturally  maybe 
 you  should  consider  getting  [ __ ]  10
[39:47] times  more  arrogant  again  because  that's 
 what  caused  the  success  in  the  first  but 
 who  knows  but  I'm  telling  you  right  now
[39:52] most  guys  that  I  every  guy  that  I  know 
 has  been  at  the  top  of  this  belt  covert 
 at  some  point  and  a  lot  of  them  won't
[39:57] ever  admit  it  because  it  sounds  cringe 
 to  say  like  you  have  to  be  arrogant  to 
 be  narcissistic  because  we  know  that
[40:02] weak  people  in  the  modern  day  don't 
 don't  really  respect  that 
 but  it's  for  your  own  benefit
[40:08] you  should  you  should  be  so 
 self-compassionate 
 that  people  think  you're  weird  for  how
[40:14] much  you  love  you  that  the  average 
 mediocre  person  thinks  you're  weird
[40:20] the  power  of  meaning  by 
 Emily  s  fonte  so  this  was  this  was  just
[40:27] about  addiction  and  like  recovery  from 
 like  drugs  and  stuff  in  general 
 but  I  like  this  one  because  this  was
[40:33] actually  one  of  the  few  porn  addiction 
 books  that  I  could  find  that  actually 
 mentioned  meaning  and  purpose
[40:40] so  we  should  find  meaning  and  purpose  in 
 our  lives
[40:47] and  I  don't  really  just  want  to 
 I  don't  want  to  actually  summarize  what
[40:52] purpose  is  I  recorded  a  one  and  a  half 
 hour  video  where  I  explained  purpose
[40:58] it's  on  my  channel  I'm  not  gonna  I  can't 
 be  bothered  to  link  it  or  anything  but 
 it's  on  my  channel  and  it's  just  called
[41:03] um  how  purpose  works  full  guide  to 
 purpose  something  like  that  you  can 
 literally  just  go  search  onto  YouTube 
 hamster  purpose  and  they'll  pop  up  and  I
[41:08] highly  recommend  you  watch  that  I  spent 
 quite  a  while  I  spent  about  a  week 
 preparing  my  thoughts  for  that  video  and
[41:14] if  you've  ever  heard  of  the  term  before 
 like  purpose  and  you've  heard  it  with 
 guys  in  my  niche  in  my  area  you  probably
[41:19] are  interested  and  it  probably  would 
 help  you  when  you  find  your  purpose 
 things  start  to  align  in  a  very  very
[41:25] nice  way 
 the  porn  addiction  Cure  by  Joshua  shear
[41:30] he  said  create  healthy  habits  and  so 
 this  is  similar  to  what  we  were  talking 
 about  before  with  the  um  the  healthier
[41:37] ways  to  cope  I  think  we  can  just  merge 
 these  two  but  create  healthy  habits 
 literally  just  you  know  set  up  the  day
[41:43] like  I  said  with  the  the  military 
 timetable  and  if  you're  interested  in 
 that  when  I  was  talking  before  about  the
[41:48] military  timetable  the  the  calendar  and 
 everything  that's  the  monk  mode  video 
 that  I  recently  posted  on  my  channel  so
[41:54] you  can  go  have  a  look  at  that  so  we'll 
 skip  this  one  but  what  I  will  say  is  one 
 thing  that  I  learned  from  Atomic  Habits
[42:00] by  James  Clear  was  that  perhaps  one  of 
 the  best  ways  to  actually  get  rid  of  a
[42:05] bad  habit  so  you  know  porn  and  fapping 
 is  a  bad  habit  one  of  the  best  ways  to 
 get  rid  of  it  is  to  simply  just  replace
[42:12] it  not  like  just  get  rid  of  it  you  know 
 I  try  to  I  try  to  sorry  to  get  rid  of  my
[42:18] Pawn  addiction  right  my  fapping 
 addiction  I  tried  to  get  rid  of  it 
 without  replacing  it  with  anything  and 
 so  I  found  myself  in  the  exact  literally
[42:25] imagine  that  right  imagine  the  guy  who's 
 trying  to  equip  Pawn  but  he's  lying  down 
 underneath  his  covers  and  scrolling  on
[42:30] the  exact  social  media  that  he  usually 
 jacks  off  to 
 it's  not  gonna  work  is  it  so  I  try  to
[42:36] get  rid  of  the  bad  habit  without 
 implementing  a  new  one  and  it  was 
 interesting  that  actually  when  I  started
[42:41] to  go  to  the  gym  in  the  mornings  so 
 first  thing  in  the  morning  I'd  wake  up 
 I'd  poop  I'd  brush  my  teeth  and  I'd  go
[42:46] train  fasted  right  when  I  started  to  do 
 that  and  so  obviously  I  wasn't  going  to 
 spend  time  like  you  know  lying  down  in
[42:51] bed  because  I  just  wanted  to  wake  up  and 
 go  work  out 
 I  stopped  fapping  anywhere  near  as  much
[42:57] replace  the  bad  habits  for  the  good  one 
 so  think  about  right  now  what  it  what  is 
 like  the  Habit  that  the  often  time  that
[43:04] you  fap  maybe  it's  a  specific  time  it's 
 a  specific  area  it's  the  apps  that  you 
 use  it's  a  specific  feeling  that's  a
[43:09] habit  right  replace  that  habit  with 
 something  for  me  it  was  easy  because  I 
 usually  would  wake  up  and  fap  and  so  all
[43:14] I  had  to  do  was  just  wake  up  and  go  to 
 the  gym  instead  for  you  let's  say  if  you 
 end  up  fapping  at  like  6  p.m  you  or
[43:20] every  differently  there's  going  to  be 
 something  that's  consistent  something 
 that's  habitual  maybe  it's  the  feeling
[43:25] that  you  get  maybe  it's  the  thought 
 maybe  it's  some  kind  of  trigger  that 
 you're  on  YouTube  and  you  see  this  this 
 thumbnail  or  you  know  you  go  onto  social
[43:30] media  you're  just  scrolling  and 
 scrolling  and  scrolling  oh  there's  a 
 girl  doing  a  little  [ __ ]  Tick  Tock 
 dance  or  something  and  that's  what  ends
[43:36] up  triggering  you  see  what  the  Habit  is 
 and  see  if  you  can  replace  it  with 
 something  that's  healthier  especially  if
[43:41] you  can  do  it  at  the  same  time  so  a  lot 
 of  people  for  example 
 they'll  fap  before  they  go  to  bed  and
[43:46] this  this  is  really  bad  for  you  you  end 
 up  staying  up  late  you  end  up  like 
 fapping  with  the  like  the  connection
[43:52] built  to  sleeping  and  So  eventually  a 
 lot  of  these  guys  who  always  fat  before 
 going  to  bed  always  end  up  saying  the
[43:57] same  thing  like  oh  but  I  can't  fap  if  I 
 go  to  bed  if  I  can't  go  to  bed  if  I 
 don't  fap  and  to  them  if  this  is  you
[44:02] just  quickly  I've  made  a  video  about 
 this  actually  ages  ago  so  you  can  just 
 go  search  up  on  YouTube  like  Hamza  I
[44:08] can't  sleep  if  I  don't  fap  something 
 like  that  and  I  I  end  up  explaining  this 
 specific  concept  here  of  like  no  no  if
[44:13] you've  built  up  the  link  of  like  fapping 
 and  going  to  sleep  now  you  can't  go  to 
 sleep  without  fapping  right  but  all  you
[44:18] really  need  to  do  like  I  wouldn't  even 
 think  about  quitting  porn  anymore
[44:23] honestly  because  it  was  only  when  I 
 stopped  thinking  about  it  and  I  started
[44:28] to  just  think  about  the  positive  habits 
 and  then  like  the  good  things  I  wanted 
 to  add  to  my  life  that's  when  I  made
[44:33] real  progress  honestly  so  I  think 
 focusing  on  the  negative  focusing  on 
 like  the  fact  that  you  know  we  need  to
[44:38] get  to  day  12  or  something  I  don't  think 
 that's  good  for  you  I  really  don't  and 
 I've  got  so  many  videos  on  my  channel
[44:43] where  I've  explained  in  this  and  I  still 
 want  every  man  in  the  world  to  know  this 
 I  don't  think  it's  good  to  see  yourself
[44:48] as  someone  who's  trying  to  quit  porn  I 
 don't  think  it's  good  being  a  guy  who's 
 on  nofap  I  really  don't  think  it's  good
[44:54] for  you  because  by  by  the  nature  think 
 about  it  by  how  you're  identifying  with 
 yourself  you're  literally  seeing
[45:01] yourself  as  a  guy  who's  got  a  problem 
 that's  hard  what  we  need  to  do  is  see 
 ourselves  as  guys  who  don't  even  think
[45:07] about  porn  or  fapping  like  it's  not  even 
 a  thing  in  our  lives  genuinely  I'm 
 telling  you  right  now  I  don't  get  like
[45:13] the  thought  that  I  should  fap  it's  not 
 something  that  even  happens  to  my  brain
[45:18] because  I'm  not  trying  to  quit  fapping  I 
 just  don't  do  it  it's  like  I  don't  go
[45:23] through  the  the  day  craving  a  cigarette 
 right  you  probably  don't  right  you  don't 
 go  through  the  day  craving  a  cigarette
[45:28] you  don't  go  through  a  day  craving  the 
 next  hit  of  [ __ ]  heroin  or  some  [ __ ] 
 right
[45:33] that's  how  you  like  you  want  it  to  be 
 the  same  thing  where  it's  like  you  don't 
 even  get  the  craving  for  it  and  the  way
[45:38] that  you  do  that  is  by  stopping 
 obsessing  over  the  negative  habit  of 
 like  oh  man  I  really  hope  I  don't  fap
[45:43] again  I'm  like  you  know  get  grabbing  a 
 knife  and  etching  what  day  of  nofap  you 
 are  on  your  on  your  wall  or  something
[45:48] stop  the  identification  with  these  these 
 bad  habits  and  just  start  focusing
[45:53] entirely  on  the  self-improvement  that 
 you  wanted  to  do  anyway  so  whatever  time
[45:58] you  usually  fap  whatever  mood  you're  in 
 whatever  like  you  know  the  environment's 
 like  change  it  so  that  it's  something
[46:03] healthy  it  can  be  as  simple  as  like 
 whenever  you  feel  like  fapping  go  do  100 
 push-ups  go  challenge  yourself  to  to  do
[46:09] 100  push-ups  that's  harder  than  it  seems 
 it's  way  harder  than  it  seems  you  do 
 this  you're  gonna  build  up  a  chest  and
[46:14] also  quit  flapping  at  the  same  time  but 
 in  my  opinion  something  better  is  to  do 
 something  very  consistent  throughout  the
[46:20] day  like  I  mentioned  with  that  military 
 routine  so  like  everything  is  just  set 
 when  your  whole  day  like  the  [ __ ]
[46:25] don't  like  this  advice  but  when  your 
 whole  day  is  productive  you  just  have  so 
 much  less  space  to  actually  care  about
[46:30] watching  porn  anyway 
 and  the  myth  of  sex  addiction  by  David
[46:39] J  lay  talks  about  how  again  it's  like
[46:44] it's  the  support  system  but  this  one 
 actually  went  into  a  lot  more  about  how 
 like  specifically  other  people  can  kind
[46:51] of  make  us  feel  involved  in  our 
 community 
 to  then  we'll  once  a  few  like  like  fap
[46:58] less  so  what  I  mean  by  this  is  this  book 
 taught  me  that
[47:04] I  want  you  to  imagine  right  now  if  you 
 had  a  vibrant  Social  Circle  if  you
[47:09] really  did  have  good  friends  who  are 
 messaging  you  right  now  like  good 
 friends  right  if  you  had  a  good  family 
 family  who  eat  dinner  together  every
[47:16] single  day  and  they  say  grace  and  you 
 know  like  if  you  had  a  this  type  of 
 Social  Circle  and  you  had  an  awesome
[47:21] let's  say  wife  right 
 you'd  probably  be  a  lot  less  likely  to 
 fap  and  watch  porn
[47:27] often  we're  watching  porn  because  of 
 some  kind  of  lack  aren't  we  because  we 
 don't  have  these  things  because  we've
[47:32] got  kind  of  like  a  broken  family  we've 
 got  friends  that  aren't  really  that 
 amazing  and  you  know  like  we're  not  even
[47:38] that  close  to  our  friends  we're  not  even 
 like  100  honest  with  them  these  days  and 
 we've  got  maybe  we  don't  even  have  a
[47:43] girlfriend  or  a  wife  or  we're  not  even 
 close  to  that  and  so  we're  lacking  a  lot 
 of  like  the  tribal  feeling  that  we  were
[47:49] supposed  to  have  you  know  humans  would 
 have  meant  to  be  on  being  tribes  of  150
[47:54] for  all  of  like  our  existence  we've 
 always  been  in  tribes  and  in  the  last 
 like  100  years  200  years  we  now  live  in
[48:01] cities  and  towns  and  Villages  that  are 
 packed  which  have  got  millions  of  people 
 and  actually  we've  got  less  people  in
[48:07] our  tribe  because  of  that 
 and  that's  not  good  for  us  there's  a  lot
[48:13] of  support  that  comes  from  having  a 
 tribe  and  so  you  should  do  what  it  takes 
 I've  got  some  some  videos  again  on  my  on
[48:19] my  channel  where  I've  talked  about 
 building  up  a  try  but  so  you  should  try 
 and  do  what  it  takes  the  way  I  would
[48:24] explain  this  in  a  step-by-step  process 
 is  start  by  learning  some  good  social 
 skills  because  a  lot  of  people's  social
[48:29] skills  aren't  actually  that  good  so 
 keep  this  book  next  to  you  at  all  times
[48:35] How  to  Win  Friends  and  Influence  People 
 keep  it  next  to  you  go  through  this  book
[48:40] and  literally  read  this  book  like  50 
 times  during  your  life  especially  when 
 you're  next  to  other  people  you've  got  a
[48:45] meeting  you've  got  an  interview  you've 
 got  you  know  like  this  social  occasion 
 where  you're  gonna  meet  some  friends  go 
 through  this  book  How  to  Win  Friends  and
[48:50] Influence  People  by  Dale  Carnegie 
 start  to  level  up  your  social  skills  so
[48:55] that  you've  actually  got  the  skills  to 
 you  know  navigate  like  human 
 relationships  in  a  way  that  makes  people
[49:01] feel  heard  and  you  know  people  like  to 
 speak  to  you  when  you've  got  good  social 
 skills  so  that's  like  the  foundation  and
[49:06] then  after  that  honestly  this  is 
 something  I'm  very  interested  in  try  and 
 find  very  weird  practical  ways  to  build
[49:13] a  tribe  around  you  so  this  can  be  as 
 simple  as  like  okay  learn  how  to 
 cultivate  like  a  really  good  long-term
[49:19] relationship  with  a  woman  that's  awesome 
 another  one  can  be  to  improve  your 
 relationship  with  your  family  another
[49:24] one  can  be  to  develop  some  friends  which 
 are  really  really  close  together
[49:31] really  be  honest  with  them  develop 
 secure  attachments  to  people 
 and  then  like  that's  that  slight  level
[49:37] too  right  but  my  brain  likes  to  go 
 extreme  and  so  what  I'm  thinking  about 
 this  on  this  focus  of  of  connection  and
[49:44] this  tribal  feeling  is  to  go  to  the  next 
 level  and  start  to  think  of  some  like 
 quite  crazy  ideas  like  how  do  we  get
[49:49] that  old  school  like  Primal  tribe 
 feeling  back  we  need  to  live  together  we
[49:55] need  to  meet  each  other  so  I  literally  I 
 get  these  crazy  ideas  like  what  if  we 
 all  got  like  a  big  ass  compound  like  we
[50:00] we  bought  out  like  500  acres  of  land  and 
 we've  got  you  know  like  a  little  shop  in
[50:06] there  we've  got  a  town  and  everything 
 like  like  what  if  we  make  our  own  town 
 or  Villages  is  my  idea  and  it  sounds
[50:11] silly  but  like  my  my idea  was  like  hey 
 we  buy  our  big  plot  of  land  we've 
 everyone's  got  like  houses  we  all  vet
[50:16] each  other  so  we  make  sure  that  you  know 
 like  we've  got  a  secure  attachment  we 
 like  each  other  we  see  each  other's 
 values  we  vet  each  other's  wives  and
[50:22] everything  and  we  build  up  like  our  own 
 little  village  and  make  it  really 
 successful  and  so  that's  like  a  crazy 
 level  idea  but  the  simple  idea  to  that
[50:29] which  you  might  not  have  actually 
 thought  of  just  yet  but  I  actually  like 
 I've  gotten  to  the  age  where  this  is
[50:34] kind  of  important  it's  the  sort  of  thing 
 where  do  you  want  to  live  to  build  your 
 family  not  not  just  you  know  to  be  a
[50:40] young  guy  but  to  really  start  to  think 
 okay  when  do  I  want  to  have  children  and 
 where  do  I  want  to  live
[50:45] um  raise  them  in  what  country  and  what 
 area  what  city  what  town 
 and  then  start  to  really  think  okay  the
[50:51] step-by-step  process  would  be  for  me  to 
 move  there  make  sure  it's  all  good  have 
 my  child  there  and  everything  and  then
[50:56] really  encourage  people  who  are  in  my 
 tribe  who  I  like  like  my  family  or  close 
 friends  for  them  to  get  a  house  in  the
[51:01] same  town  as  me  because  previously  this 
 wasn't  really  like  this  wasn't
[51:07] reasonable  because  everyone  had  jobs 
 that  they  had  to  specifically  go  to  but 
 these  days  it's  like  a  lot  of  people  are
[51:13] working  online  right  so  if  you've  got 
 like  I've  got  a  community  of  guys  who 
 all  work  online  and  so  really  like  it's
[51:19] almost  like  everyone's  waiting  for  me 
 I'm  probably  gonna  be  the  like  the 
 soonest  guy  to  have  children  I'm
[51:24] literally  looking  around  right  now  to 
 think  where's  the  best  place  to  raise 
 children  and  I'm  gonna  get  like  a  house 
 there  I'm  gonna  have  like  a  lovely  a
[51:30] huge  [ __ ]  family  I'm  gonna  get  loads 
 of  dogs  and  everything  I'm  gonna  have 
 like  10  children  bro  and  then  once  I 
 found  the  places  like  when  I  really  vet
[51:37] a  guy  and  I  really  like  his  values  and  I 
 think  he'd  be  good  for  me  my  family  my 
 wife  then  I  will  invite  him  into  the
[51:43] town  and  I  will  like  help  guide  him  to 
 buy  a  house  nearby  me  and  obviously 
 we'll  like  spend  all  day  together  we'll 
 go  training  in  the  gym  today  that  and
[51:49] imagine  then  that  okay  you  do  that  with 
 five  guys  or  five  families  with  your
[51:54] with  your  your  own  family  your  own  um 
 your  friends  and  everything  right  and
[51:59] suddenly  it's  like  you've  actually  got 
 that  old  school  tribe  feeling  where  you 
 can  literally  okay  you've  got  your  own
[52:04] Hut  you  walk  out  of  your  Hut  and  then 
 there's  a  guy  that  you  actually  like  and 
 you  can  like  be  around  I  think  that's
[52:09] deeply  important  I  can  imagine  that  kind 
 of  situation

ZDKAo50yjyQ,"[00:00] Jeffrey  gets  nervous  around  girls  every 
 day  he  obsesses  over  Jessica  watching
[00:05] her  in  class  dreaming  about  asking  her 
 out  and  thinking  of  her  when  he  listens 
 to  the  music  but  he's  never  even  spoke
[00:11] to  her  every  time  she  walks  near  him 
 Jeffrey  feels  a  spike  of  anxiety  his
[00:16] palms  begin  to  sweat  and  he  tries  to 
 avoid  her  or  he  overthinks  about  what  to 
 say  to  her  but  then  he  never  even  speaks
[00:22] to  her  Adonis 
 Adonis  sees  Jeffrey  struggling  and
[00:27] understands  exactly  what  he's  going 
 through  young  Adonis  also  used  to  obsess 
 over  women  and  he  was  so  nervous  and  he
[00:33] never  spoke  to  any  of  them  but  then 
 Adonis  did  something  to  destroy  his
[00:38] nervousness  and  now  he  could  not  be  more 
 confident  around  women  Adonis  puts  his 
 hands  on  Jeffrey's  shoulders  There's  A
[00:44] Better  Way  young  Jeffrey  I'll  teach  you 
 how  to  start  there's  a  quote  from  Andrew 
 Tate  that  I  really  like  so  I'm  gonna
[00:50] read  it  to  you  if  you  approach  a  girl 
 and  try  to  talk  to  her  and  you  fail 
 completely  within  30  seconds  she's  gone
[00:56] she's  forgotten  whatever  you've  been 
 through  in  your  life  has  yet  to  kill  you 
 going  over  to  that  girl  and  her
[01:01] rejecting  you  you  won't  die  come  on  now 
 little  bro  let's  go  over  10  ways  to  be
[01:06] less  nervous  around  women  number  one  and 
 probably  most  important  why  bro  every 
 time  I  do  one  of  these  clickbait  videos
[01:12] you  know  there's  seven  ways  to  get  girls 
 the  three  things  you  know  I  do  these 
 like  somewhat  clickbait  titles  and  try 
 to  still  make  them  like  really
[01:17] educational  inside  the  video  but  every 
 single  time  I  do  a  video  like  this
[01:22] number  one  the  first  point  that  I  always 
 tell  you  when  comes  to  getting  girls  is 
 to  stop  watching  more  and  even  the  soft
[01:28] core  stuff  that  you  see  on  Tick  Tock  and 
 Instagram's  literally  just  off  or  tick 
 tock's  mostly  softcore  you  can  cope  all
[01:34] you  want  and  say  like  oh  no  my  tick 
 tock's  full  of  Andrew  T  shorts  and  yeah 
 it  probably  is  and  you  know  my  Instagram
[01:39] is  full  of  just  UFC  and  you  know 
 football  stuff  yeah  it  probably  is  but 
 he's  still  probably  seeing  more  ass  on
[01:45] your  Instagram  than  your  entire 
 bloodline  has  seen  before  you  so  it's 
 still  gonna  mess  you  up  isn't  it  why  is 
 it  that  one  makes  you  nervous  around
[01:51] women  well  just  think  about  it  it's 
 messing  up  your  brain  and  it's  doing  it 
 in  such  a  malicious  way  because  when  you
[01:56] watch  porn  especially  you  know  like 
 video  content  that  you  see  on  whenever 
 something  usually  what  you're  watching
[02:01] is  another  man  piping  the  girl  that  you 
 want  and  so  you're  sat  there  like  some
[02:06] weird  man  who's  gonna  be  in  the  corner 
 watching  this  couple  have  sex  and  your 
 conditioning  and  programming  and
[02:12] training  your  brain  to  be  aroused  at  the 
 fantasy  of  other  people  having  sex  in
[02:17] front  of  you  you  train  your  brain  to 
 like  that  and  then  eventually  when  it 
 comes  to  speaking  to  girls  you  can't
[02:23] help  but  to  have  images  and  feelings  of 
 feeling  like  a  you  can't  help  but 
 think  about  the  other  guys  that  she's
[02:28] maybe  spoke  to  or  been  with  or  on  the 
 other  hand  there  are  a  lot  of  guys  it 
 makes  you  quite  weird  at  speaking  to
[02:34] girls  because  you  have  the  flashes  of 
 thousands  of  images  and  videos  of  you
[02:39] know  girls  getting  nailed  in  this  way 
 and  like  some  big  gang  bang  with  bbcs 
 and  everything  it  messes  up  your
[02:45] expectations  you're  so  conditioned  to 
 watching  these  women  who  have  had 
 surgery  and  even  this  video  editing
[02:50] going  on  and  everything  so  eventually 
 when  you  see  just  like  a  normal  woman  in 
 front  of  you  it's  disappointing  her
[02:56] titties  aren't  perfect  they're  like 
 they're  not  like  Double  D's  standard  yet 
 she's  not  making  moans  like  Madison  Ivy
[03:03] does 
 we  were  watching  a  lot  of  porn  and 
 especially  the  softcore  stuff  that  you
[03:08] see  on  social  media  it  makes  you  nervous 
 around  girls  because  I  want  you  to 
 imagine  that's  our  school  boy  he's  in 
 high  school  right  he's  like  15  years  old
[03:14] and  he  maybe  has  like  a  crush  on  the 
 girl  that  is  in  his  class  you  know  he's 
 15  it's  normal  to  be  like  you  know  a
[03:19] little  bit  of  a  Jeffrey  so  he  goes  home 
 he's  on  his  phone  and  he's  on  Tick  Tock 
 and  Snapchat  and  Instagram  and  that  girl
[03:24] that  he's  kind  of  got  a  crush  on  has 
 just  Folks  at  a  tick  tock  today  where 
 she's  doing  one  of  those  challenges  that
[03:29] are  like  child  baits  which  is  literally 
 like  you  know  it's  the  culture  of  tick 
 tock  to  promote  child  it's
[03:34] disgusting  Tick  Tock  is  weird  bro  but 
 yeah  so  he  sees  her  doing  one  of  these 
 sexual  dances  on  Tick  Tock  right  and  he
[03:39] watches  it  maybe  four  times  five  times 
 and  he  sends  the  link  to  his  friends  and 
 she's  not  even  nude  or  anything  you  know
[03:45] that'd  be  way  too  far  she's  fully 
 clothed  but  it's  like  yeah  she's  still 
 young  and  he's  seeing  this  and  seeing 
 her  in  this  sexually  provocative  way
[03:51] when  he  sees  her  next  is  he  gonna  speak 
 to  her  just  completely  normally  with
[03:56] that  image  in  his  mind  or  is  he  gonna 
 stumble  over  his  words  a  bit  more  is  he 
 going  to  be  nervous  and  a  little  bit
[04:01] weird  around  her  you  know  we're  very 
 deep  into  this  like  modern 
 hypersexualized  narrative  but  it's
[04:06] extremely  hard  to  have  normal  healthy 
 conversations  and  developments  and
[04:11] relationships  with  women  who  have  shown 
 off  their  bodies  in  a  sexual  way  online 
 it's  extremely  hard  and  it's  never  worth
[04:16] it  anyway  a  man  who  respects  himself  I 
 don't  think  would  really  go  there  so 
 she's  been  making  all  these  like  sexual
[04:21] tick  tocks  and  ass  pics  on  Instagram  and 
 everything  it  makes  you  weirdly  nervous 
 around  her  because  it  just  does
[04:27] something  to  your  brain  which  is  you 
 know  it  just  feels  weird  it's  probably 
 some  caveman  stuff  of  like  seeing  her 
 hypersexualized  online  you  know  you
[04:33] create  my  brain  thinks  yep  she's  easy 
 but  then  she  acts  like  she's  not  easy  in 
 person  so  it's  this  weird  mix  that  you
[04:38] know  it's  just  that  our  Primal  brains 
 aren't  used  to  this  it's  not  used  to 
 this  hyposexualized  nature  it's  not
[04:43] usually  you  being  able  to  log  onto  a 
 website  and  see  the  unreal  infinite 
 amount  of  variety  in  women  and  for  you
[04:49] to  trick  your  body  and  your  soul  and 
 your  brain  to  thinking  that  you're 
 ejaculating  with  one  of  these  women
[04:54] right  now  when  you're  literally  just 
 tugging  it  by  yourself  so  of  course 
 you're  gonna  feel  weird  and  nervous 
 around  girls  and  I  don't  say  this  that
[05:00] humiliate  you  or  to  make  you  feel  bad  if 
 you  do  watch  you  know  porn  still  but  you 
 can  see  from  there  are  so  many  videos
[05:05] online  so  many  guys  are  taking  a  big 
 step  back  from  porn  because  we  just  are 
 realizing  like  it's  actually  so  bad  for
[05:11] us  and  so  here's  yet  another  thing  that 
 it's  bad  for  us  with  the  second  way  to 
 be  less  nervous  around  girls  is  to  be
[05:17] around  them  more  now  I  don't  mean  you 
 have  to  go  out  there  and  you  know  date 
 more  women  or  anything  but  simply  being
[05:22] around  girls  more  whether  it's  in  class 
 or  it's  in  sports  or  events  or  cafes 
 anywhere  literally  just  having  more
[05:28] women  around  you  that  you're  casually 
 speaking  to  maybe  it's  a  female  Breezer 
 that  you're  ordering  from  maybe  there's
[05:33] a  girl  in  your  little  study  group  in 
 high  school  or  college  that  you've 
 developed  these  small  things  of  just
[05:38] having  like  a  woman  who's  somewhat 
 friends  with  you  you  know  you're  not 
 even  like  close  close  but  you  know  you 
 just  yeah  you  sit  and  you  do  work
[05:43] together  you  her  and  like  five  other 
 people  this  will  actually  let  you  subtly 
 practice  some  small  things  because  you
[05:48] know  it  just  seems  so  weird  sometimes  to 
 speak  to  girls  and  so  this  can  normalize 
 it  because  for  me  personally  when  I  was
[05:53] younger  and  I  was  in  high  school  my  mom 
 had  this  level  of  control  over  me  where 
 she  didn't  want  me  to  like  you  know  be
[05:59] around  girls  or  to  speak  to  them  in  any 
 way  because  she  thought  they  were  a 
 distraction  and  she  was  100  right  but 
 obviously  I'm  still  distracted
[06:05] and  I  was  desperate  and  my  brother  had 
 the  same  kind  of  influence  on  me  as  well 
 of  you  know  this  kind  of  thing  no  no  we
[06:10] don't  speak  to  girls  you  know  they're 
 just  weird  whatever  the  distraction  and 
 so  what  happened  was  that  I  was  quite
[06:15] awkward  and  nervous  around  girls  for  a 
 very  long  time  I  can  tell  you  that  you 
 know  I  went  to  some  like  parties  when  I
[06:20] was  15  or  16  and  there's  girls  there  and 
 I  was  just  weird  around  them  not  you 
 know  I  wasn't  saying  anything  weird  I
[06:25] wasn't  being  like  creepy  or  anything  but 
 I  just  you  know  I  didn't  know  what  to  do 
 because  it  imagined  that  one  of  the 
 first  times  that  like  a  girl's  next  to
[06:31] you  outside  of  school  and  you  just  kind 
 of  freeze  up  when  she's  talking  to  you 
 and  you  know  you're  like  you  can't  even 
 hold  eye  contact  we  sat  on  the  couch  in
[06:37] a  party  or  something  you  know  like  some 
 young  party  you  go  to  at  16  years  old 
 it's  your  friend's  birthday  party  or 
 something  and  I'm  like  barely  even
[06:42] holding  her  eye  contact  looking  straight 
 forward  and  like  you  know  laughing  at 
 jokes  that  aren't  even  funny  or  anything
[06:47] when  I  compare  that  one  random  party  it 
 was  like  one  of  my  friend's  16th 
 birthday  party  so  how  I  am  around  women
[06:52] now  and  I'm  not  no  Pro  or  anything  like 
 that  but  there's  been  a  big  amount  of 
 progress  to  like  how  comfortable  and
[06:58] confident  I  am  around  the  opposite  sex 
 because  I  have  now  actually  had  a  good 
 level  of  like  practice  of  not  even  just
[07:04] dating  but  you  know  just  literally  just 
 having  women  around  me  and  I  think 
 University  really  did  that  for  me
[07:09] because  I  lived  in  like  a  student 
 accommodation  building  so  there  was  a 
 bunch  of  guys  a  bunch  of  girls  that  I 
 knew  you  go  to  the  gym  there's  girls
[07:14] there  that  have  spoke  to  people  come  to 
 my  place  for  like  a  party  or  you  know  to 
 drink  or  whatever  so  I  was  starting  to
[07:19] surround  myself  around  women  and 
 suddenly  being  one-on-one  even  getting 
 more  intimate  it  didn't  feel  anywhere
[07:25] near  as  nerve-wracking  as  it  used  to 
 just  like  a  year  or  two  before  I  went  to 
 UNI  the  third  tip  I  can  give  you  means  a
[07:31] lot  to  me  but  most  people  will  think 
 that  this  is  a  terrible  tip  and  maybe 
 they're  right  maybe  I'm  wrong  but  this
[07:36] genuinely  helped  me  to  destroy 
 nervousness  and  this  was  the  start  to 
 find  guys  whether  in  real  life  or  online
[07:42] who  are  good  with  girls  who  you  can 
 literally  see  how  they  are  with  girls 
 there's  a  video  of  like  a  guy  who's
[07:47] flirting  with  a  girl  or  you're  like  a 
 male  friend  who  you  see  who  speaks  the 
 girls  find  the  guy  who's  actually  good
[07:53] around  girls  who  doesn't  seem  nervous 
 who  actually  seems  to  attract  them  and 
 then  this  is  what  gets  me  hated  all  the
[07:58] time  when  I  say  this  copy  them  I  promise 
 you  right  now  that  this  is  the  truth  I 
 would  not  be  the  man  that  I  am  today  I
[08:03] would  not  act  in  the  way  that  I  do 
 especially  around  women  if  it  wasn't  for 
 this  one  YouTuber  named  Joe  Delaney  he's
[08:09] a  fitness  YouTuber  and  he  seems  to  have 
 a  very  good  mature  relationship  right 
 now  but  rewind  a  bunch  of  years  and  he
[08:14] was  more  like  in  this  sort  of  party 
 aesthetic  lifestyle  and  you  know  when  I 
 was  like  18  years  old  that's  what  I  was
[08:19] looking  up  to  was  like  guys  who  were 
 like  quite  fit  and  muscular  and  who  were 
 going  out  and  being  like  confident
[08:24] around  girls  and  partying  and  so 
 watching  this  guy's  older  videos  I  think 
 they're  like  five  years  old  now  where
[08:29] he's  like  vlogging  and  showing 
 highlights  of  like  parties  and 
 everything  and  he  just  seems  so 
 confident  and  comfortable  around  women
[08:34] watching  that  and  I  promise  that  this  is 
 the  truth  because  it  sounds  kind  of  lame 
 I'd  literally  just  watch  this  guy  you
[08:39] know  his  videos  where  he's  with  some 
 girl  or  something  and  I'd  copy  the  way 
 that  he  spoke  and  his  mannerisms  and  you
[08:44] know  imitate  it  in  my  own  kind  of 
 personality  so  I  was  copying  his  style 
 with  my  interpretation  of  it  which  at
[08:51] that  point  you  know  becomes  like  almost 
 like  a  unique  version  you  know  I  mean 
 it's  technically  copying  but  then  the 
 way  that  you  copy  isn't  always  100  exact
[08:57] because  you've  got  your  own  bite  you 
 know  I  mean  so  essentially  I  copied  but 
 it's  not  100  copy  because  I'm  still  a
[09:02] hero  person  and  stuff  right  I  think  a 
 lot  of  people  find  this  like  incredibly 
 lame  or  something  so  you  don't  have  to 
 follow  this  advice  but  personally  for  me
[09:07] this  changed  my  life  forever  honestly  I 
 just  found  this  one  random  YouTuber 
 who's  really  really  good  YouTuber  it's
[09:12] just  the  way  that  he  talks  and  he's  so 
 casual  and  confident  and  he's  still  got 
 like  this  boyish  personality  which
[09:17] resonates  with  me  because  I've  kind  of 
 got  that  as  well  maybe  I've  got  it  just 
 because  I  was  watching  his  videos  but 
 either  way  I  just  saw  how  he  navigated
[09:23] the  state  that  he  went  on  on  like  a 
 picnic  date  with  some  girl  from  Tinder 
 and  I  kind  of  like  integrated  that
[09:28] myself  and  this  was  one  of  the  fastest 
 improvements  that  I've  had  with  women  or 
 even  just  life  in  general  just  because
[09:33] it  was  just  so  easy  for  me  to  just 
 pretend  to  be  a  little  bit  more  like  him 
 and  it  sounds  so  weird  to  say  this
[09:38] because  in  this  modern  day  like  we 
 extremely  value  individuality  and  we 
 think  copying  is  a  really  really  bad
[09:44] thing  and  again  you  know  if  you  copy 
 someone  of  course  you're  not  going  to 
 copy  them  100  it's  pretty  much
[09:49] impossible  to  do  that  so  it  has  your  own 
 twist  to  it  anyway  so  at  that  point  it's 
 like  you  become  a  hybrid  not  a  copy  of
[09:54] the  you  don't  mean  so  I  can  cope  and 
 tell  you  yeah  it's  not  copying  whatever 
 you  want  to  say  it  is  just  what  I  would 
 say  if  you  are  open  to  this  go  and  find
[10:00] someone  either  in  person  or  online  some 
 guy  who  is  like  a  role  model  to  you  that
[10:05] you  know  is  pretty  good  with  girls  and 
 search  specifically  for  if  it's  online 
 like  you  know  video  where  your  role
[10:10] model  is  with  a  woman  and  to  see  how 
 they  navigate  their  relationship  and  the
[10:15] small  mannerisms  and  the  way  they  talk 
 and  how  they  present  themselves  and  how 
 they  flirt  with  the  girl  YouTube  is
[10:20] amazing  for  this  because  if  you've  got 
 like  a  role  model  who's  some  kind  of 
 YouTuber  or  you  know  he's  got  a  YouTube
[10:25] channel  Jordan  Peterson  Jocko  willink 
 David  Goggins  you  know  all  these  guys  it 
 could  even  be  me  you  can  probably  go  and
[10:30] find  a  video  of  these  guys  who  are  your 
 role  models  online  where  they're  with
[10:35] their  girlfriends  or  wives  and  you  can 
 just  see  how  the  dynamic  is  with  them 
 and  if  you  really  like  that  then  you  can
[10:40] copy  that  the  fourth  way  to  stop  being 
 nervous  around  women  is  to  actually 
 devalue  women  and  especially  sex  and  to
[10:47] lower  them  off  the  pedestal  that  you've 
 put  them  on  and  honestly  it  might  not 
 even  be  you  who's  put  them  on  a  pedestal
[10:53] we  live  in  a  very 
 hyper-sexualized  era  right  now  where 
 women  are  promoted  to  take  off  as  many
[10:58] clothes  as  possible  for  the  cope  that 
 this  is  empowerments  but  they  are  more
[11:03] valuable  when  they're  naked  which  is 
 kind  of  like  what  the  patriarchy  was 
 saying  you  know  feminism  stupid  as
[11:08] feminists  aren't  very  clever  are 
 they  because  they  think  that  women 
 taking  their  clothes  off  his  empowerment 
 when  it's  actually  more  empowering  if
[11:14] it's  the  opposite  way  of  feminists  on 
 Smart  we  know  that  right  but  we  live  in 
 a  very  weird  place  where  sex  is  seen  as
[11:21] like  so  so  important  the  thing  is  yeah 
 for  a  good  relationship  it  is  incredibly 
 important  but  with  the  amount  of  Social
[11:27] and  cultural  and  even  government 
 pressure  that  you're  going  through  it's 
 gonna  be  so  much  higher  in  your  like
[11:32] list  of  things  to  care  about  for  most 
 guys  which  means  that  it's  on  a  pedestal 
 right  now  especially  if  you've  grown  up
[11:38] watching  porn  and  you  know  looking  at 
 girls  on  Instagram  and  everything 
 especially  Tech  talk  as  well  it  makes 
 you  worship  not  just  women  but  just  sex
[11:45] and  pleasure  and  Hedonism  because  is  it 
 not  worship  if  every  day  you  give  it 
 your  complete  devotion  your  complete
[11:51] attention  every  day  staring  into  the 
 phone  of  this  girl  that  you  follow  on 
 Tick  Tock  or  Instagram  of  this  porn  star
[11:57] that  you  really  really  like  is  that  not 
 worship  are  you  not  worshiping  an 
 underage  girl  if  you  check  her  Tick  Tock
[12:03] five  times  a  day  that  that's  what  we  do 
 instead  of  praying  these  days  and  so  we 
 have  women  and  especially  casual  sex  and
[12:09] Hedonism  on  a  pedestal  we're  told  that 
 that's  the  most  important  thing  ever  I 
 think  love  is  extremely  important  I
[12:14] think  good  solid  secure  healthy 
 relationships  extremely  important  maybe 
 the  most  important  thing  in  your  life  is
[12:20] your  relationships  honestly  the  people 
 you  have  in  your  life  your  friends 
 family  and  also  romantic  Partners 
 probably  the  most  important  and  valuable
[12:25] thing  that  you  have  in  your  life  but  we 
 don't  think  about  our  family  24  7  do  we 
 especially  if  you're  a  young  man  you
[12:31] wake  up  thinking  about  ass  don't  you  and 
 so  how  do  you  get  this  off  the  pedestal 
 how  do  you  stop  overvaluing  things  like
[12:36] casual  sex  so  that  you're  less  nervous 
 around  women  well  the  fifth  thing  that 
 we  can  talk  about  is  to  have  a  mission
[12:41] and  purpose  that  take  the  priority  to 
 set  up  your  life  as  a  man  is  very  very
[12:46] simple  but  you've  never  been  really  told 
 this  before  select  one  or  two  extremely
[12:51] ambitious  goals  and  then  sacrifice  most 
 of  your  life  for  them  it's  as  simple  as 
 that  it's  not  easy  if  it  was  easy  you
[12:56] know  every  guy  would  be  extremely 
 wealthy  or  the  best  father  possible  or 
 have  such  a  successful  business  or
[13:02] career  or  whatever  it's  not  easy  but  it 
 is  very  simple  have  a  very  very 
 important  mission  that  you  wake  up  and
[13:08] you  think  about  that  you  go  through  the 
 day  and  you're  thinking  about  it  that 
 you're  literally  sat  on  the  toilet  and
[13:13] you're  thinking  about  it  that  you're  in 
 the  shower  thinking  about  it  that  you're 
 getting  ready  to  go  to  bed  and  you're 
 still  preparing  for  tomorrow  because  of
[13:19] this  mission  that  you  want  to  conquer 
 most  guys  don't  have  this  and  it's  such 
 a  shame  because  most  guys  won't  just 
 spend  the  hours  that  it  takes  to  sit
[13:25] there  in  total  solitude  no  distractions 
 with  no  phone  no  computer  nothing  and  to 
 try  and  think  okay  what  could  be  a
[13:32] worthwhile  mission  for  me  for  the  next 
 few  years  of  my  life  for  the  next  10 
 maybe  for  the  rest  of  my  life  what  could
[13:37] be  a  worthwhile  Mission  an  incredible 
 goal  to  accomplish  to  sacrifice  for  most
[13:42] guys  don't  ask  themselves  these 
 questions  because  of  maybe  because  of 
 Point  number  one  they're  just  watching
[13:47] porn  all  the  time  but  if  you  can  do  this 
 maybe  right  now  maybe  you've  already 
 done  it  before  maybe  you  will  do  this 
 and  to  try  and  figure  out  okay  what  is
[13:53] this  huge  important  mission  that  will 
 reward  you  incredibly  and  yet  you're  not
[13:58] even  doing  it  for  the  reward  you're 
 doing  it  for  the  act  of  doing  it  you 
 need  a  mission  an  ambitious  goal  which
[14:04] is  like  that  and  when  you  found  that 
 when  you  found  this  goal  that's  so 
 important  to  you  it  becomes  so  easy  to
[14:09] feel  less  nervous  around  women  because 
 you  have  something  more  important  to 
 care  about  and  again  I  just  want  to 
 clarify  something  there's  a  lot  of
[14:14] YouTubers  and  social  media  guys  out 
 there  who  seem  so  cool  and  they  tell  you 
 like  yeah  I  don't  care  about  getting
[14:19] girls  and  everything  yeah  this  is  not 
 what  I'm  saying  it  would  be  such  a  shame 
 for  you  to  close  your  heart  and  to  think
[14:24] yeah  you  know  women  aren't  important  sex 
 is  an  important  I  don't  care  about  any 
 of  this  stuff  trust  me  when  I  say  that 
 women  are  incredibly  important  trust  me
[14:31] when  I  say  that  you  should  care  deeply 
 about  your  relationships  of  course  you 
 should  the  love  should  be  an  incredibly
[14:37] important  and  value  thing  in  your  life 
 it's  one  of  the  greatest  experiences 
 that  you  can  have  as  a  man  of  you  know
[14:43] conquering  a  goal  and  stuff  is  amazing 
 it's  probably  way  better  than  love  but 
 don't  be  like  one  of  these  Sigma  male
[14:48] guys  who  say  yeah  like  you  know  they 
 value  women  too  little  in  my  opinion  but 
 then  obviously  that's  my  bias  and  they
[14:53] can  do  what  they  want  fine  but  I  don't 
 think  that's  the  right  way  to  navigate 
 the  world  just  quickly  if  I  was  gonna 
 give  you  my  current  understanding  and
[14:59] sort  of  Life  plan  for  women  as  of  Monday 
 the  23rd  of  January  2023  is  to  live  with
[15:06] an  open  and  full  heart  I  don't  want  it 
 to  sound  wishy-washy  what  I'm  saying  but
[15:11] I  did  have  a  realization  recently 
 because  it  can  be  valuable  to  close  your 
 heart  to  not  think  about  women  at  all
[15:16] and  to  go  monk  mode  and  that's  what  you 
 know  a  lot  of  people  are  really  like 
 crazy  about  these  days  on  YouTube  it's 
 like  yeah  monk  mode  yeah  let's  do  it
[15:22] guys  and  that  can  be  awesome  sometimes 
 you  need  to  do  that  sometimes  you  can't 
 have  the  destruction  of  women  around  you 
 sometimes  you're  not  the  level  that  you
[15:28] want  to  be  to  attract  the  women  that  you 
 want  and  maybe  you're  getting  some  women 
 right  now  but  they're  not  of  the  quality 
 that  you  want  because  you  need  to  up
[15:33] yourself  first  so  at  that  point  you 
 could  take  a  big  step  back  from  women 
 but  in  my  opinion  you  should  always  have
[15:38] it  in  your  mind  that  the  best  case 
 scenario  is  that  you  get  to  develop 
 yourself  and  to  keep  conquering  this
[15:43] Mission  this  goal  that  you  set  for 
 yourself  whilst  having  the  love  and  the 
 flow  of  feminine  energy  in  your  life
[15:48] because  that's  the  best  case  scenario  in 
 my  opinion  it's  not  to  close  away  from 
 women  with  the  hassle  that  they  cause  or
[15:53] anything  like  this  it's  to  be  such  a 
 superior  man  so  that  you  can  take  her
[15:58] chaotic  moods  so  that  you  don't  get 
 distracted  by  her  because  there's  men 
 out  there  who  have  women  in  their  lives
[16:03] and  they're  not  even  distracted  by  those 
 women  these  kinds  of  men  these  Superior 
 men  have  learned  how  to  I  won't  even  say
[16:10] handle  or  manage  they've  learned  how  to 
 conquer  women  they've  learned  how  to 
 dominate  in  the  correct  way  and  that's
[16:16] an  absolutely  beautiful  experience  and 
 so  that's  my  current  view  of 
 relationships  and  love  is  I  want  that  in
[16:22] my  life  it  might  be  rare  for  you  to  see 
 like  a  man  who's  actually  broadcasting 
 this  to  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people
[16:27] telling  yeah  like  Love's  important  yeah 
 women  are  important  the  sigma  male  stuff 
 has  got  to  end  soon  of  so  many  guys
[16:32] saying  like  oh  yeah  I  don't  care  about 
 getting  I  don't  care  about  girls  bro 
 yeah  they're  just  girls  bro  like  yeah  I
[16:37] don't  think  you  should  obsessle 
 especially  over  things  like  casual  sex 
 and  porn  and  everything  fine  but  to  get
[16:42] into  an  amazing  relationship  should  be 
 one  of  your  life  goals  in  my  opinion  to 
 find  an  incredible  woman  that  you  want
[16:47] to  have  children  with  I  think  that's  an 
 amazing  goal  to  set  the  sixth  way  we  can 
 make  sure  that  you  don't  get  nervous
[16:52] around  girls  is  actually  to  think  about 
 the  other  things  that  you're  nervous 
 around  this  is  interesting  right  because
[16:57] for  a  lot  of  guys  they're  nervous  around 
 girls  but  also  they're  quite  nervous  not
[17:02] just  around  the  women  but  around  the 
 Social  Circle  as  well  you  see  a  lot  of 
 guys  aren't  just  nervous  about  you  know
[17:08] going  to  speak  to  that  girl  over  there 
 in  the  coffee  shop  they're  also  nervous 
 around  everyone  else  in  the  coffee  shop
[17:14] looking  at  him  and  seeing  him  get 
 rejected  for  example  a  lot  of  guys  have 
 social  anxiety  or  social  nervousness  and
[17:19] then  of  course  that's  like  compounded 
 when  they're  around  a  woman  as  well  so  I 
 have  a  video  on  my  channel  which  is
[17:24] about  social  anxiety  and  that  might  help 
 you  number  seven  is  one  that  I  really 
 like  and  it's  so  quick  mentally  reframe
[17:30] the  nervousness  for  excitements  when  you 
 feel  a  little  bit  nervous  it  doesn't
[17:35] really  help  you  to  think  oh  yeah  I'm 
 nervous  because  it  just  makes  you  you 
 know  feel  more  nervous  more  nervous 
 right  what  I  found  which  is  so  nice  and
[17:41] I  got  this  from  like  some  Instagram  post 
 or  something  right  it  was  like  you  know 
 like  one  of  those  cringe  like  Instagram 
 mottos  kind  of  things  and  actually  like
[17:47] those  models  honestly  hit  because  this 
 one's  so  true  it  said  when  you  feel 
 nervous  just  mentally  reframe  it  to
[17:53] excitement  because  nervousness  and 
 excitement  actually  just  feel  the  same 
 in  your  body  they're  the  same  thing  your
[17:58] heartbeat  goes  faster  your  pupils  dilate 
 you  know  the  physiological  stuff  is  the
[18:03] same  for  nervousness  and  excitement  the 
 only  thing  that's  different  between 
 these  two  is  how  you  perceive  them  so
[18:09] the  next  time  you  feel  nervous  around 
 women  just  tell  yourself  I  feel  excited 
 because  it  is  probably  true  if  you're
[18:14] nervous  around  this  girl  you're  probably 
 also  quite  excited  to  be  around  her  and 
 just  you  know  go  on  this  date  with  her
[18:19] for  example  bro  this  this  I  have  to  give 
 this  disclaimer  all  the  time  and  there's 
 like  this  culture  online  yeah  like  oh  I
[18:25] don't  care  about  girls  and  stuff  but 
 it's  like  it's  cute  to  be  excited  for  a 
 date  that  doesn't  make  you  a  simp  you
[18:30] could  broke  you  should  be  excited  for 
 every  time  you  every  date  that  you  go  on 
 every  time  you  see  your  woman  you  should
[18:35] feel  excited  you  know  all  these  guys  who 
 pretend  like  they're  too  cool  Sigma  mail 
 and  stuff  there's  gonna  be  guys  watching
[18:40] this  right  now  thinking  oh  yeah  I'm  just 
 gonna  create  object  cares  too  much  about 
 girls  it's  like  it's  so  weird  bro  these
[18:45] days  it's  lame  to  say  that  you're 
 excited  to  go  see  a  girl  think  about 
 that  it's  lame  to  say  that  you're  going
[18:51] on  an  audition  for  you  know  a  double 
 interview  for  love  love  is  lame  in  2023
[18:57] and  I  don't  know  about  you  but  I  don't 
 want  to  live  like  that  I  want  to  live  in 
 a  way  that  I  can  have  a  relationship  and
[19:02] feel  genuinely  excited  every  time  I'm  to 
 spend  time  with  her  no  matter  what  the 
 little  Jeffries  of  the  world  want  to
[19:08] call  me  they  want  to  call  me  a  simp  or 
 something  because  he  oh  yeah  he's 
 excited  for  a  date  that  means  he's  a 
 simp  it's  like  okay  then  if  that's  your
[19:14] definition  of  a  symptom  but  I'm  clearly 
 not  simp  anyone's  saying  this  is  like 
 just  a  total  Jeffrey  who's  like  doesn't
[19:20] understand  oh  whatever  I'm  not  gonna 
  write  about  these  guys  but  yeah 
 reframe  it  to  excitement  just  before  you
[19:25] get  ready  for  a  date  and  you  start  to 
 feel  your  heart  go  a  little  bit  faster 
 just  say  I'm  excited  not  nervous  I'm 
 excited  sometimes  the  girl  will  know  us
[19:31] let's  say  you  actually  go  on  the  days 
 and  you're  actually  really  really 
 nervous  she  might  even  see  in  you  and 
 she  might  even  say  like  oh  you  nervous
[19:36] and  you  may  as  well  just  say  no  no  not 
 nervous  I  was  pretty  excited  for  this 
 date  you  seemed  kind  of  cool  and  see  how
[19:42] you've  just  reframed  it  because  if  she 
 asks  you  are  you  nervous  and  you  said 
 yes  the  thing  is  you  could  tell  her  the
[19:47] truth  but  it's  a  bit  uncool  to  be 
 nervous  but  it's  way  more  of  a 
 connecting  moment  when  you  tell  her  you
[19:52] were  excited  for  the  dates  because  you 
 were  impressed  by  the  way  that  you  guys 
 spoke  online  or  something  just  keep  that
[19:57] one  in  mind  that's  such  a  quick  tip  you 
 can  use  anytime  you  feel  nervous  just 
 tell  yourself  yep  it's  excitement  sorry
[20:02] bro  I  had  to  run  off  to  Jitsu  we  still 
 have  three  more  points  to  go  so  the 
 eighth  points  I  want  to  walk  you  through
[20:08] in  terms  of  feeling  nervous  around  girls 
 is  to  actually  feel  grateful  and  happy
[20:13] that  you  have  this  feeling  because  it 
 might  go  away  and  you  might  think  wait 
 yeah  I  want  my  nerves  to  go  away  but
[20:18] trust  me  when  I  say  like  having  this 
 huge  level  of  excitement  and  nerves  and 
 butterflies  especially  when  you're  quite
[20:24] young  or  quite  inexperienced  it's  a  very 
 beautiful  experience  once  you're  looking 
 back  but  there  probably  will  be  a  point
[20:30] where  you  feel  totally  comfortable  and 
 confident  around  your  woman  and  that's 
 awesome  you  know  that  means  you're  a
[20:35] masculine  stoic  man  nice  but  sometimes 
 you  will  reminisce  of  the  days  where  she 
 made  your  heart  jump  and  extra  beats  you
[20:42] will  think  back  to  those  moments  when 
 you  had  that  intense  High  School  Crush 
 but  you  were  too  nervous  to  say  hi  to
[20:48] her  in  the  end  you'll  realize  that  those 
 moments  of  you  being  so  nervous  around 
 girls  were  actually  such  a  beautiful
[20:53] developmental  period  And  I  know  right 
 now  you're  trying  to  escape  it  I  know 
 right  now  you're  trying  to  run  away  from
[20:58] it  but  what  I'm  just  saying  is  you're 
 experiencing  it  anyway  why  not  reframe 
 it  again  just  like  we  reframed  it  in  the
[21:03] previous  points  where  we  reframed 
 nervousness  to  excitement  also  if  you 
 know  your  surgery  it's  not  excitement
[21:08] bro  it's  not  excitement  I'm  really 
 nervous  right  even  if  you  are  nervous 
 why  not  just  try  and  feel  grateful  for
[21:13] it  and  I  know  this  sounds  silly  and 
 you'll  want  to  skip  on  to  the  next  point 
 but  I  just  try  this  one  thing  for  10 
 seconds  just  ask  yourself  how  could  I  be
[21:19] grateful  for  these  nerves  how  could  I  be 
 grateful  that  I'm  nervous  around  girls 
 because  it's  not  a  good  thing  I'll  tell
[21:24] you  right  now  it's  not  really  a  good 
 thing  but  if  you  ask  this  question 
 honestly  about  any  part  of  life  how  can
[21:30] I  be  grateful  for  this  it's  one  of  the 
 most  powerful  questions  that  you  know
[21:35] I've  made  hundreds  of  videos  I've 
 broadcasted  to  the  internet  to  the  world 
 to  you  as  many  life  lessons  of  mine  and
[21:41] you  know  I'm  a  young  guy  I  don't  have 
 that  many  but  like  you  know  I've  tried 
 to  help  you  in  all  the  random  ideas  I 
 get  and  this  could  be  one  of  the  most
[21:47] powerful  life-changing  things  I  could 
 ever  recommend  to  you  ask  yourself  that 
 question  as  many  times  as  possible
[21:53] especially  during  bad  things  not  just 
 you  know  what  we're  talking  about  here 
 because  this  can  go  so  much  deeper  how
[21:58] could  I  be  grateful  for  this  what  is 
 there  to  be  grateful  about  in  this 
 situation  I  know  it's  a  little  bit  topic
[22:04] but  when  I  asked  myself  this  question 
 when  I  had  just  spent  a  year  living  like
[22:09] a  total  degenerate  I  just  spent  a  year 
 with  absolutely  zero  communication  to  my
[22:15] family  I  literally  bro  I  had  my  family 
 my  entire  family  blocked  all  their 
 numbers  Facebook  Instagram  WhatsApp
[22:20] everything  blocked  I  lived  like  I  didn't 
 have  a  family  for  an  entire  year  when  I 
 was  around  22  years  old  I  hope  you  can
[22:26] take  this  seriously  I  genuinely  lived  as 
 if  I  didn't  have  a  family  for  about  a 
 year  I  do  have  a  family  of  mother  father
[22:32] brother  sister  everything  but  like  you 
 know  we  had  a  massive  fight  and 
 everything  and  it  was  all  trauma  and 
 abuse  and  everything  so  I  essentially
[22:38] like  ran  away  from  home  even  though  I 
 was  22  or  something  so  I  was  old  enough 
 I  hated  my  father  I  hated  my  brother  I
[22:43] hated  the  house  that  we  lived  in  I  hated 
 the  relationship  the  family  that  we  have 
 you  know  I  started  living  like  a  man  who
[22:49] doesn't  have  a  family  would  live  porn 
 video  games  weed  every  single  day  on
[22:54] average  I  was  flapping  like  three  times 
 a  day  at  least  that's  already  bad  enough 
 isn't  it  three  times  a  day  fapping  bro  I
[22:59] had  a  girlfriend  and  I  lived  with  her 
 the  levels  to  which  I  have  been  down  bad 
 of  very  very  high  bro  I've  been  very
[23:06] down  bad  before  the  reason  why  I'm 
 telling  you  all  this  you  know  it's  so 
 weird  this  video  is  about  nervousness 
 with  girls  and  this  isn't  about  the  girl
[23:11] that  you  know  my  girlfriend  who  I  lived 
 with  we're  not  together  now  but  the 
 reason  why  I'm  telling  you  this  right 
 now  because  after  the  worst  year  of  my
[23:17] entire  life  I  discovered  gratitude 
 training  and  I  asked  myself  the  question
[23:22] how  could  I  be  grateful  for  my  family 
 specifically  I  asked  how  could  I  be 
 grateful  for  my  father  no  he's  ruined  my
[23:28] life  there's  nothing  to  be  grateful  for 
 no  I  I  hate  him  he's  abused  me  he 
 traumatized  me  still  to  this  day  I  can't
[23:33] sleep  right  still  to  this  day  I  have 
 nightmares  three  times  a  week  there's 
 nothing  to  be  grateful  about  him  you
[23:38] know  I'm  getting  angry  asking  myself 
 this  question  maybe  you  are  remember  I 
 just  asked  you  how  could  you  be  grateful
[23:43] for  being  nervous  around  girls  the  first 
 answer  is  like  no  no  I  can't  be  grateful 
 for  this  it's  a  bad  thing  it's  a 
 horrible  thing  and  you  know  I  was
[23:48] indulging  in  this  feeling  for  a  while 
 when  I  was  thinking  about  my  father  how 
 could  it  be  grateful  friend  and  the 
 first  little  thing  comes  up  he  brought
[23:54] us  to  the  UK  I  was  born  in  Pakistan  and 
 I  would  have  had  like  the  life  of  a 
 Pakistani  essentially  in  Pakistan  right
[23:59] which  you  take  that  as  it  is  but  it 
 generally  means  like  somewhat  of  a  worse 
 upbringing  in  terms  of  of  education  and
[24:05] wealth  and  finances  opportunity  compared 
 to  the  UK  okay  he  brought  me  to  the  UK 
 but  I  oh  whatever  I  don't  even  like  the
[24:11] UK  that  much  the  weather's  not  even  that 
 nice  anything  he  provided  for  a  family 
 of  five  as  a  sole  earner  because  my  mom
[24:17] is  a  housewife  it's  a  traditional 
 relationship  she's  the  housewife  he  goes 
 out  and  works  solo  wanna  work  in  two
[24:22] jobs  for  10  20  years  and  not  very 
 desirable  jobs  jobs  that  he's  admitted 
 he  doesn't  even  like  he  literally  does
[24:27] not  like  them  you  know  one  by  one  I'm 
 starting  to  fill  up  a  page  so  I'm 
 journaling  right  now  fill  up  a  page  of
[24:33] the  things  that  I  could  be  grateful  for 
 and  eventually  I'm  bursting  into  tears 
 as  I  write  more  and  more  and  more  and  I
[24:38] realized  for  the  first  time  in  my  entire 
 life  maybe  I'm  23  years  old  at  this 
 point  for  the  first  time  I've  reframed
[24:43] something  positively  what  once  felt  like 
 quite  an  insulting  question  how  could  I
[24:48] be  grateful  for  this  changed  my  life 
 forever  because  with  that  question  and 
 the  answer  say  you're  not  grateful  for
[24:53] my  father  for  so  many  different  things  I 
 patched  things  up  with  my  family  I  moved 
 out  of  the  apartment  I  was  staying  in
[24:59] with  that  girlfriend  broke  up  with  her 
 went  back  home  got  onto  a  dopamine  detox 
 fully  put  my  head  down  to  try  and  spread
[25:05] any  level  of  knowledge  that  I  have  to 
 you  this  what  you  see  here  right  now  if 
 you  see  the  YouTube  channel  and  the
[25:11] movements  and  the  comments  and  the 
 channel  profile  picture  the  amount  of 
 guys  who  come  up  and  say  like  you  know
[25:16] the  stuff  that  they've  learned  recently 
 is  changing  their  lives  forever  this 
 stemmed  from  one  question  how  can  I  be
[25:21] grateful  for  this  so  I'll  ask  you  one 
 last  time  in  terms  of  the  nervousness 
 that  you  have  around  girls  how  can  you
[25:27] be  grateful  for  that  I  totally 
 understand  if  you  think  it's  like  an 
 insulting  question  you  don't  want  to 
 answer  it  but  it'd  be  actually  really
[25:32] interesting  for  you  to  just  take  a 
 minute  and  just  you  know  almost  have 
 like  a  little  kind  of  smile  on  your  face 
 and  just  think  you  know  what  I'll
[25:37] probably  look  back  to  where  I  am  right 
 now  and  think  that  that  was  kind  of  cute 
 it's  like  a  nice  memory  like  you  know
[25:42] like  I  personally  look  back  to  my  high 
 school  years  and  I  was  so  nervous  around 
 girls  but  it's  like  I  wouldn't  change  it
[25:47] it's  only  when  you  look  back  and  you 
 connect  the  dots  and  you're  like  oh  okay 
 fair  enough  it  was  kind  of  cute  when  I
[25:52] was  like  that  again  you  don't  want  to  be 
 nervous  around  girls  for  the  rest  of 
 your  life  or  anything  of  course  but  you 
 know  you're  already  on  the  right  path  so
[25:57] you're  already  making  progress  so  why 
 not  just  think  to  yourself  like  yeah 
 I'll  probably  be  looking  back  to  this 
 moment  as  a  symbol  of  Innocence  Essence
[26:04] and  experience  developments  the  ninth 
 way  to  stop  getting  nervous  around  girls
[26:09] is  to  know  exactly  what  to  do  there  and 
 then  when  you  get  nervous  so  let's  say
[26:14] that  I'm  sat  next  to  a  girl  right  now 
 there  she  is
[26:23] so  let's  say  we're  sat  back  home  next  to 
 a  girl  and  you  know  it's  a  first  date  or 
 something  I'm  feeling  nervous  right  it's
[26:28] really  valuable  to  try  and  physically 
 feel  the  nerves  that  you  have  right  now 
 because  most  of  the  time  you  know  what
[26:33] you'll  realize  it's  actually  getting 
 worse  through  your  control  you  see  you
[26:38] have  a  lot  of  control  over  your  body  and 
 how  comfortable  you  are  and  how  relaxed 
 you  are  or  how  hyper  sensitive  and
[26:44] anxious  and  nervous  you  are  you 
 literally  get  to  choose  you  literally 
 get  to  control  this  so  what  if  we  do
[26:49] this  the  next  time  we're  nervous  and 
 there's  a  girl  next  to  us  and  we  become 
 aware  that  we're  nervous  right  so  you 
 know  you're  on  this  first  date  and  you
[26:55] have  the  thought  maybe  while  she's 
 speaking  because  you're  not  very  present 
 said  enough  I'm  really  nervous  like  as 
 soon  as  you're  consciously  aware  of  that
[27:01] why  not  just  open  up  the  front  of  your 
 body  a  little  bit  more  this  may  seem 
 like  silly  so  some  guys  out  there  but  I
[27:06] promise  you  if  you  can  just  try  this  and 
 trust  me  if  you  physically  I'm  talking 
 literally  like  in  the  real  world  open  up
[27:12] your  heart  your  rib  cage  the  front  of 
 your  body  you  will  feel  so  much  more
[27:17] powerful  when  I'm  nervous  or  when  I'm 
 scared  or  when  I'm  anxious  I'm  sat  like 
 this  this  is  why  I'm  like  looking  around
[27:23] like  this  I'm  closing  my  body  I'm  a 
 little  bit  scared  I'm  you  know 
 presenting  to  be  on  my  phone  pretending
[27:28] to  do  something  I'm  like  this  I'm  closed 
 up  even  though  it  seems  too  simple  to  be 
 true  I've  found  that  you  can  make  such  a
[27:33] big  difference  in  your  mood  by  literally 
 just  changing  the  way  that  you  sit  or 
 you  stand  I  see  this  all  the  time  with
[27:38] people  who  don't  feel  good  they're 
 always  like  this  and  people  who  mostly 
 feel  good  they're  always  open  up
[27:43] especially  men  open  up  the  front  of  your 
 body  look  there's  different  ways  to  sit 
 you  can  sit  like  this  and  you  know  my
[27:48] stomach  right  now  is  like  all  curled  up 
 a  little  bit  how  do  you  think  I'm  gonna 
 be  breathing  if  my  body's  like  this  am  I
[27:53] going  to  be  breathing  deep  breaths  like 
 a  king  like  a  superior  man  or  am  I  going 
 to  be  hardly  breathing  at  all  probably
[27:58] hardly  but  if  I  open  up  right  now 
 imagine  how  I'm  gonna  breathe  when  like 
 I'm  taking  up  space  literally  it's  as
[28:03] simple  as  that  just  physically  take  more 
 space  open  your  stomach  open  your  heart 
 your  rib  cage  open  all  this  even  like
[28:09] right  now  I've  got  my  legs  kind  of 
 crossed  even  just  open  them  up  as  well 
 there's  real  science  behind  this  I  won't
[28:14] try  and  explain  the  science  to  you 
 because  I  kind  of  like  you  know 
 understand  it  but  I  don't  to  a  good 
 level  that  I  could  teach  you  anything
[28:19] but  from  my  perspective  when  we  open  up 
 and  we  change  our  breathing  and  we  take
[28:24] more  of  like  a  control  Superior  strong 
 posture  it  changes  the  state  that  our
[28:29] body  is  in  because  when  you're  proper 
 clothes  and  you're  breathing  too  fast  or 
 shallow  your  body's  in  that
[28:34] parasympathetic  or  which  one  I  don't 
 know  which  one  it  is  but  like  another 
 fight  or  flight  one  where  it  thinks  like 
 okay  you're  scared  you're  prepared  for
[28:39] an  attack  but  if  you  just  relax  a  little 
 bit  you  know  feel  good  take  some  good 
 breath  don't  close  your  legs  Don't  Close
[28:44] Your  Eyes  I  mean  you  can  do  sometimes  to 
 be  honest  this  is  just  weird  to  say  like 
 yeah  Alexa  I  like  this  bro  this  is  like
[28:50] how  my  character  would  stand  in  a  game
[28:55] foreign 
 open  everything  up  and  especially 
 breathe  slowly  so  the  next  time  you're 
 feeling  nervous  you  know  the  easiest
[29:01] thing  you  can  do  cold  deep  breath  it 
 should  be  so  full  that  you  actually 
 think  that  it's  like  it's  too  much  this
[29:06] feels  almost  a  bit  weird  she's  gonna 
 notice  that  I'm  taking  a  deep  breath 
 that's  like  the  level  of  breath  that  you
[29:11] should  be  taking  I'm  gonna  take  one  full 
 breath  with  you  right  now  I  know  that  my 
 YouTube  retention  rate's  gonna  drop  just 
 because  there's  no  dope  for  me  I'll  get
[29:17] my  Editor  to  like  make  some  explosions 
 or  some  it's  just  so  we  can 
 maintain  the  Jeffrey's  attention  but 
 take  one  full  breath  with  me  and  I'll
[29:23] symbolize  with  my  arms  right 
 foreign
[29:37] should  last  about  10  seconds  10  seconds 
 most  people  on  average  breathe  like  two
[29:43] to  four  seconds  per  breath  but  a  full 
 deep  breath  the  kind  of  one  that  relaxes 
 you  always  remember  this  a  full  breath
[29:48] that  relaxes  you  lasts  more  than  six 
 seconds  the  next  time  you  feel  a  bit
[29:53] nervous  why  don't  you  just  try  and 
 roughly  count  how  long  each  breath  is 
 and  I  guarantee  you'll  be  literally  like
[29:58] two  seconds  it's  almost  as  simple  as 
 this  bro  make  your  breath  at  least  six 
 seconds  long  three  seconds  in  three 
 seconds  out  or  even  better  make  it
[30:04] closer  to  ten  seconds  five  in  five  hours 
 and  finally  the  last  way  to  stop  getting 
 nervous  around  girls  is  to  drastically
[30:10] improve  yourself  when  I  was  a  lot 
 younger  before  I  went  through  my  own 
 self-improvement  Journey  before  I
[30:15] started  going  to  the  gym  or  building  a 
 business  or  trying  to  actually  be 
 productive  and  trying  to  improve  my
[30:20] mental  health  and  understanding  the 
 world  more  when  I  was  just  a  kid  who 
 just  you  know  played  video  games  and 
 everything  I  was  very  very  nervous
[30:26] around  the  girls  like  so  nervous  that  I 
 wasn't  even  next  to  girls  you  know  like 
 I  wasn't  going  on  dates  or  anything  I
[30:31] was  so  nervous  that  because  of  like  you 
 know  mixture  of  things  but  you  know 
 what's  helped  me  long  term  over  years
[30:36] it's  just  becoming  like  a  higher  tier 
 man  becoming  more  of  a  successful  man 
 more  of  a  Driven  Man  and  I've  got  like  a
[30:41] list  of  accomplishments  which  I  noticed 
 some  other  people  it's  like  not  that 
 impressive  but  to  me  especially  because
[30:46] I  was  a  total  Jeffrey  just  a  few  years 
 ago  I'm  still  like  a  part-time  Jeffrey 
 sometimes  anyway  but  like  for  me  the
[30:52] progress  that  I  made  and  the 
 accomplishments  that  I  have  racked  up  it 
 means  a  lot  to  me  and  what  I've  found  is 
 it's  created  some  level  not  all  but  like
[30:59] some  level  of  like  self-love  and 
 self-respect  that  now  I  don't  seem  to 
 get  nervous  around  that  many  girls  it's
[31:04] usually  like  the  woman  that  I'm  really 
 impressed  by  I  feel  a  little  bit  nervous 
 sometimes  like  for  my  first  date  with  my
[31:10] girl  we  met  in  a  coffee  shop  in  Thailand 
 so  we're  in  the  same  island  that  we  met 
 this  is  where  I  am  by  the  way I  didn't
[31:15] really  announce  this  but  I'm  in  Thailand 
 we  met  on  this  island  around  six  months 
 ago  and  for  our  first  date  we  met  in  a
[31:20] coffee  shop  and  it  was  very  proper  cute 
 and  everything  and  before  I  went  there  I 
 was  actually  like  nervously  excited  so  I
[31:25] already  followed  you  know  that  tip  I 
 told  you  like  tip  number  seven  mentally 
 reframe  to  excitement  so  certainly  bro  I
[31:31] was  certainly  feeling  some  nerves  I  was 
 like  very  attracted  to  her  and  the 
 conversations  we  were  having  were 
 rejuvenating  and  so  I  felt  like  you  know
[31:38] some  nerves  but  the  thing  is  like  you 
 know  I've  done  well  she's  by  my  side 
 she's  totally  into  me  and  that's 
 interesting  I  was  quite  nervous  and
[31:43] quite  excited  for  our  first  date  but  it 
 went  fine  because  being  nervous  around 
 girls  isn't  that  terrible  you  know  still
[31:49] to  this  day  I  get  it  sometimes  now  she's 
 by  my  side  waiting  for  me  to  finish 
 recording  so  she  can  just  hang  out  with
[31:54] me  if  you  stay  on  this  path  this  path  of 
 self-improvement  the  Journey  of  becoming
[31:59] more  like  a  Donuts  great  things  will 
 come  your  way  there  will  be  a  time  that 
 you  will  look  back  to  your  younger  self
[32:04] and  you'll  just  have  so  much  gratitude 
 and  love  for  the  progress  that  you've
[32:09] made  that's  what  I  wish  for  you  usually 
 at  the  end  of  like  these  YouTube  videos 
 I  know  a  bunch  of  YouTubers  will  try  and
[32:14] sell  you  their  products  I  don't  really 
 have  anything  to  sell  like  that  like  we 
 do  have  some  products  but  I  don't  really 
 like  to  like  push  them  in  your  face  so
[32:20] if  you  wanted  to  try  and  find  them  you 
 probably  could  but  it  takes  a  little 
 while  to  even  find  anything  that  I  sell 
 but  what  we  do  have  which  we've  just
[32:26] recently  started  is  the  YouTube  channel 
 memberships  so  there's  no  pressure  but 
 if  you'd  like  you  can  support  the
[32:31] movement  moments  and  support  my  editors 
 and  everything  because  we  have  a  whole 
 team  behind  this  I  know  like  on  the
[32:36] channels  my  picture  it's  my  name  it's  me

s4r-cyXrYb4,"[00:00] jeffrey  is  a  black  pillar  there's 
 nothing  you  can  do  to  improve  your  looks 
 it's  all  over  you're  coping  it's  over
[00:05] for  you  curry  cells  you  should  just  kill 
 yourself  that's  how  black  pillars 
 actually  talk  they  tell  young  men  who
[00:10] are  feeling  insecure  to  kill  themselves 
 if  they  don't  have  a  certain  height  or 
 characteristics  of  their  face  black 
 pillars  like  jeffrey  hate  to  see  you  on
[00:16] self-improvement  they  don't  want  to  be 
 proved  wrong  jeffrey  will  try  to  pull 
 you  back  down  into  the  bucket  of  the
[00:21] crabs  he  doesn't  want  you  to  invalidate 
 his  excuses  for  a  long  time  i  thought  i 
 was  ugly  and  i  genuinely  thought  there
[00:26] was  nothing  i  could  do  about  it  i 
 thought  i  was  ugly  simply  because  i  was 
 brown  skinned  and  i  had  this  belief  that
[00:31] brown  people  were  just  unattractive 
 especially  to  the  white  women  that  i 
 wanted  it  was  only  until  i  adopted  a
[00:36] positive  thinking  mindset  when  i  started 
 going  to  the  gym  and  i  realized  that 
 progress  was  possible  i  started  to
[00:41] convince  myself  that  i  could  also 
 progress  my  face  i  did  research  and  i 
 found  a  bunch  of  things  and  i  found  that 
 there's  only  around  five  things  that
[00:47] truly  can  change  how  attractive  your 
 face  is  and  it's  worth  implementing  all 
 of  these  here  is  a  picture  of  what  i
[00:52] used  to  look  like  when  i  was  18  and  here 
 is  the  pictures  that  i  take  now  adonis 
 adonis  has  a  warrior  skull  what  a  fine
[00:58] specimen  indeed  she  looks  phenomenal 
 with  a  jawline  as  sharp  as  the  spear  of
[01:03] zeus  and  the  hunter  eyes  that  would  make 
 black  pillars  proud  there's  only  six 
 things  that  matter  in  terms  of  your
[01:08] facial  attractiveness  low  body  fat 
 tongue  posture  head  posture  neck  size
[01:13] face  exercises  and  beard  and  we're  going 
 to  discuss  exactly  how  to  improve  these
[01:19] what  about  navel  canvas  tint  and  and 
 hunter  oh  shut  up  bro  black  pillars  man 
 we're  not  going  to  discuss  things  that
[01:24] you  can't  change  because  at  least  to  me 
 that's  a  complete  waste  of  time  there's 
 of  course  a  hundred  different  tiny  bits
[01:29] of  your  face  that  make  up  the 
 attractiveness  but  thinking  about 
 something  that  you  can't  change  is  for
[01:34] losers  so  let's  go  through  an  order  of 
 importance  firstly  low  body  fat  this  is 
 obvious  and  common  sense  but  some  guys
[01:40] still  have  too  high  of  a  body  fat 
 percentage  the  ideal  body  fat  that  you 
 should  set  the  goal  off  is  around  10  to
[01:45] 12  percent  this  is  when  your  abs  are 
 completely  visible  you  may  even  have 
 some  veins  around  your  abs  in  your
[01:50] v-line  and  you'll  have  a  sharp  jawline 
 with  no  baggy  skin  underneath  one  huge 
 point  that  no  one  mentions  in  terms  of
[01:55] low  body  fat  is  that  to  look  even  better 
 at  a  low  body  fat  percentage  you  want  to 
 weigh  more  you  simply  want  your  body
[02:01] weight  to  be  as  high  as  possible  whilst 
 also  remaining  lean  and  the  way  to  do 
 that  is  to  bulk  up  first  and  then  cut  to
[02:08] get  leaner  this  is  what  i  looked  like  at 
 120  pounds  and  i  was  fairly  lean  but  you 
 can  see  that  my  face  didn't  exactly  look
[02:13] chiseled  whereas  when  i  put  on  a  fair 
 amount  of  muscle  two  to  three  years 
 later  this  is  what  i  look  like  at  150
[02:18] pounds  you  can  see  a  big  difference  in 
 my  jawline  the  more  that  you  weigh 
 whilst  being  lean  the  better  that  you'll
[02:24] look  focus  on  increasing  your  body 
 weight  and  then  cutting  tongue  posture 
 is  very  very  important  and  something  to
[02:30] be  mindful  of  24  7.  here  is  what  people 
 look  like  when  they  are  mouth  breathers
[02:35] and  here's  what  people  look  like  when 
 they  breathe  from  their  nose  i  was  a 
 mouth  breather  for  most  of  my  adult  life 
 my  nose  would  always  be  stuffy  and  i
[02:41] realized  how  to  fix  this  you  simply  need 
 to  breathe  from  your  nose  more  and 
 you're  probably  thinking  wait  it  comes
[02:46] off  you  you  literally  just  said  your 
 nose  is  stuffy  like  i  can't  breathe  from 
 my  nose  so  how  do  i  breathe  however  much 
 you  can  breathe  from  your  nose  it's
[02:52] generally  how  much  you  need  to  so  let's 
 say  if  your  nose  is  literally  85  blocked 
 and  you  can  just  about  barely  breathe
[02:58] it's  almost  like  a  meditation  practice 
 to  breathe  as  much  as  you  can  without 
 doing  that 
 most  people  do  which  is  to  like  fall
[03:05] don't  do  that  stupid  [ __ ]  just 
 calmly  breathe  silently  through  your 
 nose  and  that's  how  much  air  you  should
[03:10] be  taken  in  the  reason  why  your  nose  is 
 generally  blocked  even  though  you'll 
 believe  that  you've  got  allergies  or  any
[03:15] [ __ ]  you've  been  convinced  by 
 doctors  generally  the  reason  why  so  many 
 people's  noses  blocks  is  because  they
[03:20] simply  don't  breathe  from  their  nose 
 because  they  breathe  from  their  mouths 
 the  more  that  you  breathe  from  your  nose 
 the  more  it'll  open  up  but  you  need  to
[03:25] go  through  the  trials  and  tribulations 
 of  breathing  through  your  nose  when  you 
 can  hardly  do  so  and  it's  completely
[03:30] safe  and  it's  even  healthier  to  do  this 
 simply  breathe  through  your  nose  in  a 
 very  silent  calm  way  and  do  a  full
[03:36] exhale  breathing  from  your  nose  will 
 allow  you  to  assume  the  correct  tongue 
 posture  which  is  when  your  mouth  is
[03:41] closed  your  tongue  presses  up  against 
 the  top  of  your  mouth  and  you  want  to 
 really  focus  on  getting  most  of  your
[03:47] tongue  against  the  top  of  your  mouth  not 
 just  the  tip  but  most  of  it  it  takes 
 some  practice  i  don't  care  what  anyone
[03:52] says  this  literally  changes  the  shape  of 
 your  skull  once  again  these  are  pictures 
 of  me  when  i  ended  puberty  at  around  age
[03:58] 18  and  two  years  later  i  still  remember 
 this  blue  picture  in  the  gym  when  you 
 can  literally  see  that  my  face  started
[04:03] to  grow  outwards  in  more  of  like  a 
 warrior  skull  shape  head  posture  is  very 
 very  important  and  is  so  overlooked  in
[04:09] terms  of  facial  attractiveness  everyone 
 especially  you  has  some  terrible  head 
 posture  because  of  all  the  technology
[04:14] everyone's  got  like  their  neck  up 
 because  we're  always  doing  this  you  know 
 to  see  our  foot  sometimes  i'm  in  the  gym
[04:19] and  i  literally  see  someone  using  their 
 phone  like  this 
 freak  bro  and  you  just  see  everyone  like 
 this  the  simple  way  to  improve  your  head
[04:25] posture  which  improves  your 
 attractiveness  is  simply  just  give 
 yourself  a  double  chin  as  a  stretch  hold 
 it  for  two  seconds  the  more  you  do  this
[04:31] the  more  your  neck  will  start  going  back 
 and  you'll  assume  that  good  confidence 
 strong  posture  with  your  shoulders  back
[04:36] and  neck  is  back  that  jordan  peterson 
 promotes  the  size  of  your  neck  actually 
 makes  a  big  difference  in  your  face  okay
[04:41] we  wanted  to  talk  about  face  while 
 you're  talking  about  neck  your  neck  is 
 always  visible  and  in  terms  of  muscle
[04:46] and  size  and  testosterone  and 
 masculinity  oftentimes  people 
 subconsciously  will  see  your  neck  size
[04:52] as  the  size  of  the  man  that  you  are  when 
 you  see  someone  with  a  thick  neck  even 
 if  the  rest  of  their  body  is  cropped  out
[04:57] you  automatically  have  some  kind  of 
 respect  for  this  guy  and  you  wouldn't 
 want  to  mess  with  them  but  when  you  see 
 a  guy  with  a  skinny  neck  and  his  body's
[05:03] cropped  out  you  think  yeah  i  could  you 
 know  this  is  a  skinny  guy  there's  no 
 problem  we  could  show  you  the  rest  of 
 his  body  he  could  be  massive  but  you
[05:08] wouldn't  have  thought  that  if  you  only 
 saw  his  neck  it's  very  important  to 
 train  your  neck  with  the  rest  of  your
[05:13] body  in  the  gym  as  we've  been  doing  and 
 the  simplest  way  to  increase  your  neck 
 size  is  simply  to  do  neck  curls  where 
 you  just  place  a  small  weight  on  your
[05:19] forehead  and  just  curl  your  neck  like 
 this  when  you're  laying  off  a  bench  the 
 fifth  thing  you  can  do  to  improve  your 
 facial  attractiveness  is  the  face
[05:25] exercises  and  these  are  generally  kind 
 of  weird  i'll  be  completely  honest  i 
 don't  really  do  these  that  much  but
[05:30] there  is  one  thing  that  i  do  heavily 
 recommend  which  is  to  chew  harder  foods 
 the  shape  of  our  skull  and  jaws  are
[05:35] getting  smaller  because  we're  chewing 
 very  soft  processed  foods  any  food 
 that's  rough  and  hard  like  nuts  is  very
[05:41] helpful  for  training  the  muscles  around 
 the  jawline  and  you  can  also  do  a  bunch 
 of  different  facial  exercises  which  look
[05:47] kind  of  weird  my  friend  chris  at  first 
 man  made  a  full  video  on  the  facial 
 exercises  which  i'll  link  below  and
[05:52] finally  the  last  thing  that  you  can  do 
 is  grow  and  also  shape  your  beard  to 
 improve  your  facial  attractiveness  if
[05:58] you  can't  grow  a  beard  just  yet  and  you 
 feel  like  you  should  have  the  genetics 
 to  do  so  so  everyone  in  your  family  can
[06:03] grow  a  beard  even  your  mother  then  it's 
 just  because  you  haven't  actualized  your 
 masculinity  yet  this  is  like
[06:08] neuroscience  and  everyone  disagrees  with 
 me  but  i'm  100  sure  of  this  if  you  are 
 genetically  capable  of  getting  a  beard
[06:13] you  will  get  it  when  you  become  more 
 masculine  when  you  become  more  of  a  man 
 and  you  take  responsibility  take  more
[06:18] responsibility  look  after  more  people 
 become  a  leader  and  you'll  see  that  your 
 braid  will  grow  faster  than  ever  if
[06:23] you've  already  got  a  beard  it's  very 
 important  that  you  shape  it  in  a  certain 
 way  which  is  to  have  the  mustache  and 
 the  chin  longer  than  the  cheek  and  the
[06:29] sidelines  a  very  important  part  of 
 making  your  beard  look  good  is  shaping 
 the  underside  of  it  you  want  to  trim  up
[06:34] the  beard  to  your  jawline  around  the 
 cheek  here  and  have  the  beard  come  down 
 about  an  inch  near  the  chin  like  this  do
[06:40] the  hard  work  especially  when  you  know 
 if  you  like  it

Mqtfev7oLPw,"[00:00] 271  how  can  it  be  so  low  how  can  your 
 testosterone  levels  be  so  low  is  that
[00:06] really  what  you're  going  to  ask  yourself 
 whilst  you  dip  your  greasy  hands  in  that 
 packet  of  Doritos  they  must  have  made  a
[00:11] mistake  I'm  really  healthy  I  only  play 
 video  games  for  one  hour  a  day  and  uh
[00:16] Jeffrey  it's  more  like  six  and  I 
 exercise  all  the  time  you  have  two 
 workouts  tracked  on  the  strong  app  come
[00:21] on  Jeffrey  I'm  an  alpha  male  you  are 
 nothing 
 Adonis
[00:26] Adonis  is  also  receiving  his 
 testosterone  results  he  opens  the 
 message  and  his  number  flies  off  the
[00:32] screen  oh  yes  seven  billion  nanograms 
 per  deciliter  men  are  supposed  to  have
[00:37] high  levels  of  testosterone  coursing 
 through  their  veins  just  like  Adonis
[00:43] I  thought  this  video  with  some  words 
 from  Adonis  about  the  consequences  of 
 having  low  testosterone  low  testosterone
[00:49] will  destroy  you  as  a  man  for  it  makes  a 
 man  weak  docile  and  emotional  I  might  be
[00:54] releasing  some  merch  soon  I  was  going  to 
 release  like  a  bathrobe  and  stuff  don't 
 skip  this  section  because  this  is 
 relevant  to  the  video  and  so  you  know  I
[00:59] was  gonna  okay  yes  we  will  release  the 
 bathrobe  right  and  I  think  okay  let's 
 maybe  do  like  a  shirt  or  a  vest  and  my
[01:04] friend  Sam  makes  this  joke  that's 
 relevant  for  this  video  which  you're 
 probably  gonna  be  able  to  relate  to  even
[01:09] though  it's  going  to  piss  you  off  and  he 
 said  we  should  make  a  line  of  the 
 clothing  for  men  who  have  got  [ __ ]  tits
[01:14] and  actually  like  for  a  marketing  idea  I 
 think  that's  actually  a  good  idea  you 
 know  just  because  they'll  go  viral  like
[01:19] people  will  talk  about  it  oh  this  guy's 
 like  made  you  know  like  a  guy  no  T-shirt 
 or  something  but  it's  actually  such  a
[01:24] common  problem  that  did  you  know  about 
 50  or  57  of  young  men  have  got
[01:29] gynecomastia  I've  got  [ __ ]  titties  50 
 of  men  so  one  in  two  has  breasts  think
[01:35] about  how  [ __ ]  that  actually  is  that's 
 something  that  has  went  so  wrong  inside 
 of  us  that  men  have  started  to  develop
[01:42] like  women  wood  something  is  so  entirely 
 wrong  and  I  think  testosterone  is  just 
 one  of  those  things  I  think  the
[01:47] psychological  subversion  the 
 conditioning  that  we've  been  through  as 
 young  men  not  not  so  much  you  know  the
[01:52] Plastics  and  the  testosterone  but  the 
 message  that's  been  implanted  into  us  to 
 be  weak  and  docile  and  emotional  to  open
[01:57] up  about  our  feelings  because  that  seems 
 like  good  advice  doesn't  it  and  then 
 every  man  who  opens  up  to  his  girlfriend 
 eventually  says  yeah  like  she  won't  have
[02:03] sex  with  me  anymore  like  low 
 testosterone  is  just  one  of  the  issues 
 that  men  are  facing  there's  seven  things 
 that  we're  going  to  speak  about  today
[02:08] and  the  first  thing  that's  destroying 
 your  testosterone  levels  and  your 
 ability  to  feel  like  a  man  is  actually
[02:14] poor  mental  health  you  might  not  have 
 considered  that  you  might  have  thought 
 that  the  first  thing  I  was  going  to  say 
 is  that  you  need  to  [ __ ]  more  [ __ ]
[02:19] you  need  to  lift  more  weights  but 
 actually  most  guys  I  promise  you  this  is 
 the  truth  most  guys  would  get  the
[02:24] greatest  Roi  the  increase  of 
 testosterone  if  they  first  improve  their 
 mental  health  because  if  you  have 
 anxiety  or  paranoid  thoughts  if  you  feel
[02:31] unsafe  you  know  you've  went  through  some 
 [ __ ]  before  maybe  you  got  attacked  maybe 
 you  got  traumatized  and  now  you  don't 
 really  feel  safe  even  in  like  what
[02:37] should  be  a  safe  environment  you  know 
 what's  actually  going  on  like 
 scientifically  inside  of  your  body  your 
 fight  or  flight  system  is  activated
[02:43] cortisol  is  through  the  roof  and 
 cortisol  and  testosterone  work  in 
 opposites  when  cortisol  goes  up
[02:48] testosterone  goes  down  when  testosterone 
 goes  up  cortisone  goes  down  when  your 
 cortisol  is  going  up  because  you  keep 
 getting  thoughts  of  like  feelings  of
[02:54] unsafety  and  paranoid  and  stress  from 
 exams  and  maybe  you're  still  thinking 
 about  the  time  that  your  dad  beat  your 
 ass  or  that  kid  in  school  your  friend
[03:00] beat  your  ass  and  you're  thinking  about 
 this  more  and  more  and  more  every  time 
 that  you  get  like  a  negative  hostile
[03:05] thought  in  your  mind  causes  our  spiking 
 up  testosterone  going  down  and  what  if 
 you  got  depression  a  lack  of  enjoyment  a
[03:11] lack  of  pleasure  a  lack  of  color  to  your 
 life  you  feel  unable  to  go  to  it  and  do 
 even  the  basic  things  they  feel
[03:16] pointless  for  many  young  men  symptoms  of 
 depression  are  they  don't  even  brush 
 their  teeth  every  day  again  my  best
[03:21] friend  Sam  when  I  first  met  him  he  was 
 at  the  level  of  like  brushing  his  teeth 
 every  few  days  he's  obviously  changed
[03:26] now  he  lives  with  me  here  within  Dubai  a 
 lot  of  men  have  depression  and  if  you  do 
 have  it  you  can't  go  and  do  the  other
[03:31] things  that  we  need  to  recommend  if  I 
 tell  you  okay  you've  got  depression  I 
 tell  you  to  stop  drinking  alcohol  or
[03:36] stop  smoking  weed  or  you  know  whatever 
 your  vices  video  games  or  something  you 
 wouldn't  be  able  to  because  you're 
 depressed  we  need  to  fix  the  depression
[03:41] first  and  then  those  like  poor  habits  go 
 away  there  is  an  easy  way  for  you  to
[03:46] improve  your  mental  health  without  going 
 to  therapy  and  spending  thousands  of 
 dollars  in  therapy  not  without  going  to
[03:51] the  hospital  and  getting  ostrich  eyes 
 and  labeled  as  like  you  know  someone's 
 something's  wrong  with  you  without 
 needing  to  go  on  medications  without
[03:56] needing  to  spend  months  or  years  trying 
 to  change  things  and  it's  literally  just 
 follow  my  mental  health  guide  I  have
[04:01] made  a  full  mental  health  guide 
 completely  for  free  there's  nothing  to 
 sell  you  at  all  it  will  walk  you  step  by
[04:06] step  through  everything  that  you  need  to 
 do  if  you  put  your  100  trust  in  me 
 within  two  weeks  you  will  see  the
[04:11] greatest  improvements  to  your  mental 
 health  since  you  were  a  child  that 
 mental  health  guys  a  YouTube  video  is 
 linked  right  now  and  as  a  card  in  in  the
[04:17] description  I  promise  you  that  that 
 video  will  save  your  life  go  to  it  right 
 now  the  second  thing  [ __ ]  up  the 
 testosterone  levels  is  poor  sleep  and  I
[04:23] always  ask  this  question  maybe  you'll 
 know  by  now  how  many  hours  of  sleep  does 
 an  average  person  need  on  average  eight 
 hours  right  that's  what  we  always  hear
[04:29] right  if  you  want  eight  hours  of  sleep 
 and  you  need  to  wake  up  at  six  a.m  what 
 time  do  you  go  to  bed  most  people  will 
 do  the  math  and  say  okay  if  I  need  to
[04:35] wake  up  at  six  then  eight  hours  before 
 that  would  be  10  pm  so  10  pm  would  be  my 
 bedtime  most  people  would  say  that  right
[04:40] but  that's  not  how  it  works  most  people 
 don't  realize  this  maybe  you  didn't  but 
 there's  such  a  thing  called  Sleep 
 efficiency  and  that  is  how  efficient  you
[04:46] are  at  sleeping  at  the  time  that  you 
 were  in  bed  because  you  see  the  time 
 that  you  spend  in  bed  is  not  actually
[04:51] the  time  that  you  have  asleep  most 
 people  on  average  have  around  an  80  to 
 85  sleep  efficiency  that's  like  if
[04:57] that's  a  pretty  good  level  right  if 
 there's  like  nothing  psychologically 
 wrong  with  you  about  80  that  means  that 
 if  you  want  eight  hours  of  sleep  with  80
[05:04] efficiency  in  bed  that  means  you  need  to 
 be  in  bed  for  10  hours  so  if  you  want  to 
 wake  up  at  6am  and  get  eight  hours  of
[05:10] sleep  and  you  have  an  80  sleep 
 efficiency  you  need  to  go  to  bed  at  8  pm 
 and  that  is  if  you  have  an  80  sleep
[05:15] efficiency  if  you've  got  something  wrong 
 with  you  like  I  do  mine  is  down  to  like 
 71  so  if  I  leave  10  hours  for  bed  I'll
[05:22] on  average  sleep  seven  hours  most  people 
 will  never  even  consider  this  and 
 they'll  think  oh  yeah  well  you  know  if  I
[05:27] go  to  sleep  at  12  and  I  wake  up  at  six 
 that's  six  hours  no  it's  not  if  you  want 
 to  sleep  at  12  and  you  wake  up  at  six 
 you're  gonna  sleep  for  maybe  about  four
[05:32] and  a  half hours  you  need  to  start  to 
 prioritize  your  sleep  and  the  only  thing 
 you  can  do  bro  stop  being  a  Jeffrey  at
[05:37] night  time  when  it  gets  the  7  PM  8  PM 
 you  should  be  unwinded  now  fair  enough 
 if  it's  7  PM  or  8  pm  and  you've  got  like
[05:42] a  late  sport  colossal  League  class  or 
 something  okay  fair  enough  maybe  you're 
 going  to  be on  technology  maybe  you're 
 going  to  be  exhilarated  fine  but  when
[05:48] you're  in  the  home  at  8pm  9  pm  10  p.m 
 there  should  not  be  anything  in  front  of 
 you  you  shouldn't  be  watching  Andrew
[05:53] take  motivational  podcasts  you  shouldn't 
 be  watching  country  Tate  shorts  you 
 shouldn't  be  on  Tick  Tock  you  should  be 
 watching  porn  or  playing  video  games
[05:58] that  is  not  the  time  to  stimulate 
 yourself  so  many  guys  say  this  and  you 
 might  have  said  this  to  be  honest  and
[06:03] just  openly  admit  have  you  coped  like 
 this  because  a  lot  of  guys  say  at  the 
 end  of  a  hard  day  they  want  to  unwind  by
[06:08] watching  their  favorite  show  or  playing 
 some  video  games  they  just  want  to  rest 
 and  do  that  so  many  guys  have  said  that
[06:13] to  me  and  every  time  when  I  say  this 
 upcoming  sentence  they  realize  how  wrong 
 they  were  and  I  literally  just  say  to 
 them  do  you  really  think  that  your  brain
[06:19] is  resting  when  you  play  video  games  do 
 you  really  think  if  we  were  able  to  like 
 you  know  do  some  kind  of  scan  on  your
[06:24] brain  it  would  just  be  perfectly  still 
 when  you  play  games  honestly  and  then 
 straight  away  they're  like  oh  yeah  fair
[06:29] enough  again  video  games  TV  shows  all  of 
 that  [ __ ]  is  hyper  stimulating  it 
 doesn't  help  you  rest  it  does  the  exact
[06:35] opposite  this  is  why  like  for  most  guys 
 when  they  say  oh  I  just  can't  sleep 
 early  I  can't  go  to  sleep  at  10  pm  I  am
[06:41] 100  certain  up  until  proven  otherwise 
 that  the  reason  why  they  say  this  is 
 because  they're  literally  just
[06:46] stimulating  themselves  at  9pm  or  10  pm 
 and  saying  oh  well  I'm  not  I'm  not  oh 
 but  I'm  not  tired  I'm  not  sleepy  you've
[06:51] got  like  [ __ ] 
 blue  on  your  phone  right  now  like  oh  but 
 I'm  not  sleepy  I'll  go  to  bed  when  I'm 
 sleepy  no  you'll  be  sleepy  when  you  go
[06:57] off  your  computer  you'll  be  sleepy  when 
 you  literally  turn  off  this  [ __ ]  Bro  our 
 parents  were  right  all  this  time 
 honestly  my  mom  knew  this  [ __ ]  back  like
[07:03] before  there  was  ever  any  research  on 
 this  and  I  thought  that  she  was  being 
 silly  and  over  dramatic  and  now  I've
[07:08] become  like  my  mom  saying  like  to  young 
 guys  like  you're  better  than  playing 
 video  games  for  this  many  hours  because 
 the  thing  is  there's  some  guys  watching
[07:13] this  right  now  who  may  have  skipped  it 
 because  they're  Jeffries  and  they  don't 
 have  humility  but  there's  some  guys 
 maybe  if  you're  just  that  kind  of  guy
[07:18] who  you  don't  play  video  games  you're 
 not  a  Jeffrey  anymore  and  you're 
 thinking  like  oh  this  advice  is  for 
 someone  else  I'm  not  like  this  anymore 
 but  there's  probably  still  something
[07:23] that  you  can  improve  on  isn't  there  you 
 should  never  be  easy  on  yourself  you 
 should  literally  think  to  yourself  okay 
 there's  still  some  [ __ ]  that  I'm
[07:29] doing  at  like  8pm  they're  still  making 
 me  stimulated  because  bro  if  you  see  a 
 comment  or  a  message  from  someone  at  APM
[07:34] I  guarantee  your  brain  is  more 
 stimulated  for  the  next  half  an  hour  so 
 if  you're  seeing  it  at  9pm  just  before
[07:39] you're  about  to  get  ready  for  bed  and 
 some  prick  sends  you  a  message  which 
 like  you  know  triggers  you  emotionally 
 your  friend  says  like  oh  they  can't  come
[07:45] to  the  workout  tomorrow  or  someone 
 messages  you  have  you  done  the  thing 
 then  you  can't  sleep  and  you  want  to 
 know  the  beautiful  thing  about  sleeping
[07:50] when  you're  sleeping  that's  when  you 
 make  taking  testosterone  the  third 
 reason  why  your  testosterone  levels  are
[07:55] all  messed  up  you're  coming  too  much  bro 
 I  know  this  is  weird  and  I've  recently
[08:00] just  gotten  more  into  the  the  niche  of 
 like  speaking  about  ejaculation  and 
 semen  retention  and  nofap  I've  been  on
[08:05] this  ship  for  a  while  right  I  discovered 
 nofap  age  17  right  and  I  think  I  did  it
[08:10] better  than  everyone  else  any  other 
 YouTuber  you've  seen  there  no  fap  advice 
 is  worse  than  mine  I  know  for  a  fact  it 
 is  because  when  people  follow  my  advice
[08:16] they  don't  ever  go  back  to  porn  and 
 masturbation  when  people  follow  some 
 [ __ ]  YouTubers  advice  they
[08:21] constantly  commenting  oh  guys  I  only  got 
 a  day  through  when  you  follow  my  advice 
 your  life  changes  forever  in  terms  of  no 
 Fab  like  I  was  the  one  who  just  luckily
[08:27] honestly  I  was  just  lucky  I  just  cracked 
 the  code  of  nofap  when  I  was  like  18 
 years  old  and  I  just  realized  you  have 
 to  progressively  unload  instead  of  just
[08:34] cutting  it  out  completely  and  trying  to 
 get  to  day  90.  anyone  who  tells  you 
 they're  on  day  x  of  nofap  I  know  for  100
[08:39] certainty  they're  they're  actually  going 
 to  fail  if  you  know  what  day  you're  on 
 right  now  I  know  for  100  for  certainty
[08:44] that  you're  gonna  fail  you're  gonna 
 relapse  again  if  I  ask  some  guy  what  day 
 of  no  fap  are  you  on  and  he  just 
 Shrugged  in  my  like  I  don't  know  I  don't
[08:49] count  it  I  know  for  a  fact  he's  gonna  be 
 absolutely  fine  you  wanna  know  why 
 because  when  you're  counting  these  days 
 and  like  dropping  a  knife  and  like
[08:55] etching  it  into  your  wallet  I'm  almost 
 on  day  90  I  can  start  to  levitate  some 
 [ __ ]  you're  so  obsessed  with it  that 
 it's  still  part  of  your  identity  you're
[09:01] a  guy  who's  trying  to  quit  porn  and 
 masturbation  I  don't  want  to  insult  guys 
 but  bro  I  see  this  in  my  Discord  server
[09:06] we  have  a  massive  Discord  server  maybe 
 we've  joined  you  can  find  the  link  in 
 the  description  but  I  see  a  fair  amount
[09:11] of  guys  who  have  literally  got  their 
 nofap  day  in  their  Discord  name  oh  my  my 
 name's  Steve  and  I'm  on  day  73  and  I
[09:17] just  think  bro  you're  gonna  relapse  and 
 it's  actually  gonna  [ __ ]  you  up  because 
 of  how  much  you've  added  this  to  your
[09:22] identity  this  was  never  the  plan  was  it 
 when  we  discovered  the  [ __ ]  and  we 
 discovered  you  know  like  we  went  through
[09:27] Jeffrey  propaganda  when  we  grew  up 
 didn't  we  how  how  accessible  porn  was 
 remember  some  [ __ ]  teachers  and  like
[09:32] government  propaganda  told  us  that 
 masturbation  and  porn  was  healthy  do  you 
 ever  remember  that  propaganda  because  I 
 do  I  get  pissed  like  bro  it'll  be  it'll
[09:38] be  9pm  on  a  Tuesday  [ __ ]  December  or 
 something  and  I  literally  just  wake  up 
 and  think  hang  on  a  minute  I  literally
[09:44] vividly  remember  propaganda  where 
 sophisticated  clean  shirt  [ __ ] 
 teachers  on  posters  and  [ __ ]  who  told  us
[09:51] that  masturbation  would  have  been  good 
 for  who  told  us  how  to  masturbate  that 
 was  my  sex  ed  class  they  told  like  that
[09:56] pisses  me  off  right  but  having  said  that 
 if  you  are  currently  so  obsessed  with  no 
 Fabs  even  retention  that  is  literally
[10:01] your  Discord  name  is  like  how  many  days 
 you're  on  bro  it's  a  part  of  your 
 identity  or  a  guy  who's  trying  to  quit
[10:06] right  now  which  means  that  you  are  also 
 the  guy  who's  going  to  fail  don't  be  the 
 guy  who's  trying  to  quit  be  the  guy  who
[10:11] just  simply  doesn't  do  it  because 
 imagine  there's  two  people  right  and 
 let's  use  a  different  example  let's  say 
 that  they  both  smoke  so  there's  Jeffrey
[10:17] and  we  won't  say  Adonis  because  Adonis 
 obviously  doesn't  smoke  cigarettes  but 
 we'll  say  Jeffrey  and  then  there's 
 Jessica  and  Jessica's  on  her  way  to  be
[10:22] Anastasia  right  Jeffrey  and  Jessica  both 
 smoke  and  then  they  realize  that  they 
 want  to  stop  smoking  cigarettes  and  they
[10:27] just  want  to  go  clean  from  that  right 
 Jeffrey  goes  to  the  nofap  route  which 
 all  these  [ __ ]  YouTubers  will  tell 
 him  okay  if  you  want  to  get  to  day  90
[10:32] then  your  lungs  will  be  cured  until 
 Jeffrey's  okay  I  really  want  to  go  today 
 Jessica  does  more  of  like  a
[10:37] psychological  analysis  on  herself  and 
 realizes  you  know  what  I  don't  want  to 
 be  this  kind  of  person  anymore  I'm  not  a
[10:42] smoker  anymore  okay  they're  both  on 
 three  days  four  days  five  days  Jeffrey's 
 etching  it  into  his  wall  yes  come  on
[10:47] getting  closer  getting  closer  Jessica's 
 just  living  her  life  and  she's  becoming 
 more  and  more  like  Anastasia  suddenly
[10:52] let's  say  they  both  go  out  to  a  social 
 event  maybe  a  party  Jeffries  offered  a 
 cigarette  and  Jessica's  offered  a
[10:57] cigarette  what  do  you  think  Jeffrey  and 
 Jessica  say  Jeffrey  says  oh  no  no  thanks 
 I'm  trying  to  quit  but  his  friends  keep 
 on  offering  him  the  cigarette  and  they
[11:03] smoke  next  to  him  and  he  likes  the  smell 
 then  his  Cravings  go  through  the  roof 
 till  eventually
[11:09] Jeffrey's  back  to  smoking  again  he's 
 relapsed  but  what  about  Jessica  she 
 meets  some  new  people  there  and  they 
 tell  her  oh  you  want  to  smoke  and  she
[11:15] says  no  thanks  I  don't  smoke  they  don't 
 ask  her  again  and  she  doesn't  even  get 
 the  craving  because  she  doesn't  smoke 
 because  she  changed  who  she  was  not  just
[11:22] got  obsessed  with  the  act  of  quitting 
 because  if  you  get  obsessed  with  the  act 
 of  quitting  it's  still  a  part  of  your 
 identity  you're  not  over  it's  the  exact
[11:28] same  with  nofap  all  of  these  YouTubers 
 bro  I  promise  you  I've  watched  a  lot  of 
 YouTube  there  isn't  a  single  good  nofap
[11:33] YouTuber  out  there  right  now  I've  made 
 like  maybe  five  videos  on  nofap  which 
 are  better  than  their  entire  Channel 
 their  channels  when  I  just  see  the
[11:38] titles  and  I  just  think  like  you're 
 ruining  young  men's  mental  health  what 
 the  [ __ ]  are  you  doing  telling  people 
 about  like  oh  but  the  nofaps  benefit
[11:44] timeline  go  [ __ ]  yourself  it  pisses  me 
 off  every  time  I  have  to  speak  about 
 these  little  cretins  bro  they're  just
[11:49] weird  guys  who  sit  at  home  and  like 
 count  [ __ ]  etching  in  their  wall  and 
 stuff  man  yeah  they  might  be  trying  to
[11:54] help  guys  but  I  don't  think  they're 
 doing  it  in  a  good  way  I  think  they're 
 not  really  trying  to  help  they're  just 
 trying  to  make  videos  which  perform  well
[11:59] the  issue  with  ejaculating  too  much  is 
 that  you're  prolactin  spikes  the  [ __ ]  up 
 which  means  that  then  your  testosterone
[12:04] levels  go  down  so  just  like  cortisol  and 
 testosterone  the  same  thing  actually 
 happens  with  prolacting  and  test
[12:09] testosterone  because  you  know  the  post 
 not  Clarity  you  know  after  you  bust  them 
 out  whether  you've  masturbated  or  you've 
 had  sex  you  get  this  like  dip  this  like
[12:15] dip  in  your  energy  you  feel  lethargic 
 you  don't  you  know  you've  lost  all  of 
 your  horniness  for  like  at  least  20
[12:20] minutes  right  that  is  a  huge  spike  in 
 prolactin  and  prolactin  is  like  a 
 counter  to  testosterone  which  then  goes
[12:25] down  now  for  most  guys  this  issue  is 
 coming  from  porn  and  masturbation  but 
 actually  for  some  guys  who  think  that
[12:30] they're  Above  This  which  could  be  you 
 soon  they  actually  are  going  through 
 this  issue  even  in  sex  even  when  you 
 have  sex  and  you  ejaculate  them  that
[12:36] still  decreases  your  testosterone  that 
 still  makes  you  feel  lethargic  and  tired 
 honestly  you  might  think  like  sex  is 
 amazing  and  stuff  but  there  are  some
[12:41] consequences  to  this  and  any  guy  who 
 who's  [ __ ]  a  lot  knows  that  if  you 
 meet  a  girl  you  have  sex  like  four  times
[12:46] in  a  day  after  that  you're  like  you're 
 just  not  interested  in  women  for  like  at 
 least  hours  there's  a  lot  of  like
[12:51] bedroom  mistakes  that  young  men  are 
 making  and  there  isn't  a  lot  of  good 
 advice  for  this  there's  a  lot  of  Jeffrey
[12:56] propaganda  out  there  I've  made  a  private 
 video  for  that  which  is  in  the 
 description  three  bedroom  mistakes  to 
 watch  out  for  go  and  click  on  that  right
[13:02] now  the  fourth  thing  that's  destroying 
 your  testosterone  levels  is  a 
 sedimentary  lifestyle  it's  9  45  a.m  in
[13:08] about  15  minutes  I'm  gonna  go  get  ready 
 to  go  hit  an  upper  body  session  and  then 
 go  hit  an  MMA  one-to-one  class  with  the
[13:14] coach  they're  the  UFC  coach  so  I'm  gonna 
 go  exercise  for  about  two  and  a  half 
 hours  after  this  then  we'll  be  out  and
[13:19] about  going  to  buy  food  everything  going 
 to  like  The  Barbers  and  stuff  that's 
 pretty  good  but  that's  not  even  at  the
[13:24] level  that  we  should  be  exercising  it 
 depends  where  you're  at  because  a  lot  of 
 guys  are  in  that  total  Jeffrey  Zone 
 where  they  don't  even  go  and  do  anything
[13:30] but  you've  been  watching  my  videos  for  a 
 little  while  you've  already  considered 
 you  know  getting  into  the  gym  more 
 seriously  getting  more  fits  so  you're
[13:36] probably  someone  who's  a  big  step 
 further  than  the  hordes  of  Jeffries  in 
 the  world  aren't  you  but  having  said
[13:41] that  I  still  don't  actually  think  that's 
 enough  because  when  you  get  into  the  gym 
 and  you  do  resistance  training 
 weightlifting  calisthenics  you  start
[13:47] hearing  this  term  called  over  training 
 and  you  start  getting  scared  of  like 
 doing  too  much  and  you  want  to  minimize 
 it  and  everything  and  I  think  that's
[13:53] [ __ ]  Jeffrey  propaganda  honestly  I 
 don't  think  there  is  maybe  0.1  percent 
 maybe  less  of  the  population  actually
[13:58] over  train  I  think  it's  overblown  and  I 
 think  to  live  like  natural  Primal  humans
[14:03] with  maxed  out  levels  of  testosterone 
 they  were  over  training  by  like  the  fat 
 scientists  standards  of  today  this  fat
[14:10] scientists  fat  doctors  these  days 
 telling  you  that  you're  over  training  if 
 you  lift  weights  for  like  45  minutes  I 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  because  if  you  don't
[14:16] consider  the  scientific  [ __ ]  and  if  you 
 don't  track  with  like  Fitness  track  you 
 know  I've  got  the  aura  ring  right  but 
 I'm  even  starting  not  to  use  it  anymore
[14:21] because  I've  just  realized  like  it  just 
 invokes  weakness  in  you  if  you  want  to 
 be  like  David  Goggins  you  think  David 
 Goggins  are  sat  there  like  oh  what  if
[14:27] what  if  I'm  over  trading  how  many  sets 
 have  I  done  today  you  know  because  after 
 25  sets  the  recovery  is  shut  the  [ __ ]  no
[14:32] one  he's  not  thinking  that  you  think 
 that  any  of  these  like  [ __ ]  hard 
 disciplined  guys  attracting  their  sleep 
 thinking  like  oh  well  you  know  I've  only
[14:38] got  for  53  minutes  of  REM  sleep  I  should 
 probably  take  the  day  off  work  today  are 
 they  [ __ ]  is  Andrew  Tate  waking  up
[14:43] looking  at  his  [ __ ]  sleep  stats  and 
 saying  like  oh  well  I'll  just  have  an 
 easy  day  today  like  [ __ ]  that  bro  what
[14:48] I've  noticed  the  reason  why  I'm  not 
 wearing  my  uh  ring  today  my  auto  ring  I 
 only  wear  it  at  night  time  now  I  don't 
 wear  it  through  the  day  and  I  don't  even
[14:53] look  at  the  stats  anymore  because  it 
 invokes  weakness  in  you  so  the  sedentary 
 lifestyle  affects  two  different  kinds  of
[14:58] people  it  affects  the  total  Jeffries  who 
 just  don't  do  anything  but  it  also 
 affects  the  sort  of  guys  who  are  on
[15:03] self-improvement  but  we've  been  told 
 that  we  should  do  less  and  we  should 
 spend  more  day  just  you  know  just 
 sitting  around  and  relaxing  and  like  oh
[15:08] but  you  know  if  you're  your  rest  score 
 is  less  than  73  in  this  health  tracker 
 then  you  should  just  take  the  day  off  it 
 affects  People  Like  Us  who  are  on  our
[15:14] way  to  becoming  more  like  Adonis  more 
 like  these  alpha  males  but  those  guys 
 who  are  already  at  the  top  they  don't 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  this  like  oh  you  know
[15:20] maximum  17  sets  per  workout  otherwise 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  bro  honestly  yeah  sure
[15:25] you  don't  want  to  injure  yourself  fine 
 absolutely  make  sure  you've  got  good 
 form  with  everything  you  do  you  don't 
 want  to  be  a  [ __ ]  and  go  lift  with
[15:30] some  [ __ ]  form  and  then  get  hurt 
 obviously  but  that's  not  what  we're 
 talking  about  I  think  a  human  can  work
[15:35] out  for  hours  every  single  day  no 
 problem  I  think  it's  a  modern  invention 
 to  say  that  you  should  exercise  for  less
[15:40] than  like  45  minutes  a  day  because  at 
 least  for  me  personally  you  want  to  know 
 my  own  like  particular  experience  when  I
[15:45] do  like  a  minimalistic  kind  of  workout 
 routine  bro  I'm  not  even  happy  I  become 
 like  a  the  shell  of  a  person  that  I'm
[15:50] supposed  to  be  I  am  supposed  to  be  like 
 a  man  like  David  Goggins  I'm  supposed  to 
 be  ultra  disciplined  I'm  supposed  to
[15:55] have  like  aching  [ __ ]  joints  and 
 going  to  work  out  anyway  because  when  I 
 do  that  I  am  on  top  of  the  world
[16:01] yesterday  bro  I  woke  up  the  day  that  the 
 morning  after  our  Meetup  so  we  just  did 
 a  meet  up  in  Dubai  I  spot  about  20  guys
[16:07] I  want  you  to  think  about  that  I  spared 
 about  about  20  guys  spot  about  20  guys 
 that's  deeply  [ __ ]  like  like
[16:13] intenseful  right  that's  that's  intense 
 you're  literally  fighting  guys  I'm 
 punching  kicking  grappling  and 
 everything  when  I  came  home  from  that
[16:19] meal  after  being  there  for  hours  on  my 
 feet  for  fighting  people  I  literally  was 
 so  sore  that  it  was  hurting  me  to  walk
[16:25] and  I  was  limping  I  woke  up  text  Sam 
 like  an  excuse  telling  him  like  oh  you 
 know  I'm  not  gonna  come  today  you  know
[16:31] I'm  over  training  and  [ __ ]  I'm  watching 
 the  David  Goggins  podcast  I'm 
 re-watching  the  one  with  uh  Joe  Rogan 
 the  first  one  and  just  hearing  this  guy
[16:36] talk  is  so  inspiring  that  I'm  like  man 
 [ __ ]  this  I'll  mess  it  up  bro  let's  go 
 do  David  gogan's  workout  man  so  it's
[16:41] like  the  previous  message  was  like  oh 
 bro  you  know  I'm  really  tired  let's  miss 
 it  the  next  message  oh  bro  let's  go  do 
 it  David  Goggins  work  come  on  let's  go
[16:46] do  500  pull-ups  bro  I  think  that's  the 
 better  way  to  live  if  you  want  to  know 
 more  about  my  personal  life  for  the  last
[16:52] years  I've  like  meticulously  tracked  my 
 sleep  and  all  this  [ __ ]  and  really  cared 
 about  like  you  know  health  and  stay
[16:57] underneath  like  you  know  I  don't  want  to 
 over  train  I  don't  want  to  stretch  my 
 body  and  I  just  think  back  to  the  times 
 where  I  was  living  like  this  Ultra
[17:03] disciplined  lifestyle  where  I  was  waking 
 up  not  even  thinking  a  bit  like  oh  you 
 know  like  if  I  woke  up  too  early  for 
 example  for  the  sake  of  discipline  you
[17:09] know  to  wake  up  at  five  or  half  four  to 
 go  outside  for  a  run  at  that  time  when  I 
 was  shredded  in  2020  and  I  was  like
[17:14] literally  exercising  for  like  four  hours 
 a  day  bro  that  was  the  happiest  time  of 
 my  life  honestly  and  I  wasn't  waking  up 
 thinking  like  oh  man  like  I  don't  know
[17:20] if  I  slept  enough  or  anything  I  still 
 had  fantastic  habits  so  we  need  to 
 follow  you  know  the  second  thing  we 
 spoke  about  we  don't  want  to  have  poor
[17:25] sleep  I  still  had  fantastic  habits  I  was 
 in  bed  at  like  half  eight  but  I  wasn't 
 ever  thinking  like  oh  man  let  me  track
[17:30] my  sleep  and  just  make  sure  because  if 
 I've  not  slept  enough  then  I'll  just 
 take  the  day  off  like  oh  I  was  getting 
 it  done  bro  and  when  you  see  pictures  of
[17:35] me  when  I  was  bald  in  2020  early  2021 
 bro  like  I  was  shredded  as  [ __ ]  I  was
[17:40] like  I'm  happy  with  that  man  honestly 
 maybe  I  was  over  training  in  some  [ __ ] 
 but  bro  [ __ ]  that  man  I  was  so  [ __ ]
[17:45] happy  with  my  life  I  felt  like  a  [ __ ] 
 man  back  then  so  you  need  to  figure  out 
 what  kind  of  said  it  said  in  Terry
[17:50] lifestyle  that  you  have  you  need  to 
 figure  out  if  you're  a  total  Geoffrey 
 who  doesn't  do  anything  you  need  to 
 increase  it  but  if  you  are  a  bit  more
[17:55] advanced  you  need  to  figure  out  what's 
 holding  you  back  because  our  [ __ ] 
 natural  Primal  caveman  ancestors  were
[18:01] not  thinking  about  over  training  or  any 
 [ __ ]  bro  they  were  getting  it  done 
 they  were  men  who  had  to  go  out  for  the 
 hunt  the  fifth  thing  that's  destroying
[18:07] many  men's  testosterone  levels  now 
 yourself  is  alcohol  and  a  party 
 environment  the  late  night  environment
[18:12] alcohol  itself  is  a  poison  substance 
 that  should  be  absolutely  limited  to
[18:17] maybe  just  maybe  the  smallest  amount  per 
 year  if  not  just  completely  cut  out  I 
 think  it's  better  if  you  completely  cut
[18:22] it  out  but  I  also  understand  some  people 
 want  to  drink  like  every  now  and  then 
 which  is  like  it's  acceptable  a  little 
 bit  if  you're  drinking  every  month  if
[18:28] you're  drinking  every  week  if  you're 
 drinking  multiple  times  a  week  hold  your 
 hand  up  right  now  and  say  that  you're  a 
 Jeffrey  there's  no  excuse  there's  no
[18:33] like  you  have  to  say  this  you  have  to 
 say  that  you're  a  chef  if  you're 
 drinking  more  than  once  a  week  even  if 
 you're  drinking  like  two  three  times  a
[18:39] month  you  have  to  hold  your  hand  up  and 
 say  Jeffrey  like  and  the  thing  is  some 
 [ __ ]  are going  to watch  ah  no 
 having  a  glass  of  wine  every  day  at
[18:44] dinner  is  not  being  me  just  shut  the 
 [ __ ]  up  bro  wine  is  the  biggest  [ __ ] 
 cope  that  I  see  of  these  people  all  the
[18:49] time  man  all  biggest  [ __ ]  cope  like 
 as  I  see  intellectual  people  always 
 saying  I  want  one  glass  of  wine  I  know
[18:54] sometimes  I  have  two  like  shut  up  just 
 shut  up  and  go  for  a  run  bro  what  the
[18:59] [ __ ]  what's  gonna  need  a  drinking 
 alcohol  when  it  does  nothing  bro  it's 
 like  it  tastes  like  [ __ ]  and  if  you  want 
 to  get  drunk  for  the  sake  of  being  drunk
[19:04] fair  enough  you  probably  got  some 
 problems  but  fair  enough  but  if  you  just 
 want  to  drink  for  all  your  a  lot  let's 
 go  let's  not  get  drunk  let's  just  go  for
[19:11] a  drink  Club  why  it  tastes  horrible  if 
 you're  not  gonna  get  the  sort  of  drunk 
 effects  from  it  then  what's  the  point  of
[19:16] it  it  tastes  like  [ __ ]  usually  it's 
 consumed  in  an  environment  where  you're 
 surrounded  by  total  [ __ ]  Jeffries
[19:21] like  the  great  old  British  pub  [ __ ] 
 weather  spoons  from  alcohol  has  been 
 proven  time  and  time  again  to  destroy
[19:28] not  only  your  testosterone  but  your 
 health  in  general  if  you  want  the 
 fastest  way  to  destroy  your  testosterone
[19:33] to  develop  man  boobs  to  gain  up  to  25 
 body  fat  to  look  like  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  to
[19:38] feel  like  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  go  start 
 drinking  consistently  simple  as  that 
 this  is  then  coupled  with  the
[19:43] environment  which  the  alcohol  is 
 consumed  in  the  party  environment  the 
 nighttime  environment  those  things  can 
 be  very  fun  honestly  those  things  can  be
[19:49] very  fun  and  I  think  maybe  it's  somewhat 
 valuable  for  a  lot  of  young  men  to  go 
 and  experience  that  stuff  if  you  have
[19:54] the  total  desire  to  you  know  like  really 
 want  to  go  and  see  what  like  a  party  is 
 like  and  stuff  yeah  go  ahead  if  you  like 
 really  enjoy  it  fair  enough  go  ahead
[20:00] maybe  go  maybe  just  don't  get  drunk  as 
 simple  as  that  but  like  maybe  it's  like 
 it's  hard  to  say  this  because  obviously 
 I've  experienced  all  this  myself  I  was
[20:06] like  a  total  [ __ ]  dumbass  student  on 
 drugs  drinking  all  the  time  for  years 
 and  years  so  for  me  to  tell  you  to  not
[20:12] try  those  things  it's  a  bit 
 contradictory  but  obviously  like  I  can 
 only  tell  you  not  to  try  those  things 
 because  I've  experienced  them  myself  so
[20:18] even  though  I'm  telling  you  to  do 
 something  that  I've  not  done  this  is  how 
 teaching  someone  to  avoid  your  mistakes
[20:23] Works  does  that  make  sense  because  when 
 I  speak  about  partying  that's  when  I  get 
 a  bunch  of  comments  from  Jeffries  who 
 said  oh  my  Hamza  like  I  party  all  the
[20:29] time  and  how  can  you  tell  us  not  to 
 party  because  you  used  about  it  do  you 
 realize  like  the  common  sense  of  the 
 concept  of  teaching  a  mistake  to  someone
[20:34] is  that  you  had  to  do  the  thing  that's 
 my  cool  response  to  comments  like  that 
 and  I  don't  know  if  I'm  wrong  but
[20:39] they're  wrong  but  this  is  common  sense 
 isn't  it  like  I  can  only  tell  you  to 
 avoid  a  mistake  that  I've  done  myself 
 and  it  shouldn't  be  like  oh  Hamza  you
[20:44] did  that  thing  well  well  yeah  that's  why 
 I'm  telling  you  not  to  do  it  bro  because 
 I  did  it  what  the  [ __ ]  you  want  about 
 like  oh  but  you  did  it  why  you  why  can't
[20:49] I  do  it  like  yeah  of  course  you  can  you 
 can  go  make  the  same  mistake  as  me  but 
 wise  men  learn  from  the  mistakes  of 
 others  if  you  then  think  about  this
[20:55] environment  the  party  nighttime  you  know 
 collabs  type  of  [ __ ]  environment  that 
 leads  to  the  second  point  with  Paul
[21:00] sleep  because  you're  staying  up  late 
 there's  no  way  that  you're  going  to  a 
 club  or  a  party  and  you're  leaving  at
[21:05] half  nine  to  get  back  into  bed  at  10  pm 
 are  you  of  course  not  right  so  you're 
 staying  up  right  you've  gone  to  a  party 
 you're  going  to  stay  up  late  and  that
[21:10] can  be  fine  every  now  and  then  it  can  be 
 fine  but  if  when  you're  like  a  proper 
 student  and  you've  actually  got  some
[21:15] Ambitions  and  you  want  to  build  some 
 muscle  you  want  to  look  good  you  want  to 
 have  high  testosterone  like  a  rock  hard 
 dick  bro  you  can't  be  staying  up  late
[21:20] three  four  five  times  a  week  staying  up 
 like  three  a.m  4  a.m  that's  the  [ __ ]  I 
 used  to  do  bro  literally  staying  up  till
[21:25] 3am  was  like  an  absolutely  normal  thing 
 and  sometimes  we'd  push  it  to  six  seven 
 you  know  sometimes  just  do  an  all  night
[21:31] and  not  even  sleep  and  everything  when 
 you're  20  years  old  you  don't  really 
 feel  like  you  know  you  don't  really  feel 
 the  consequences  and  you  know  why  you
[21:36] don't  it's  because  you  just  feel  like 
 [ __ ]  in  general  people  who  say  like  oh 
 you're  Invincible  when  you're  like
[21:41] you're  20  years  old  you  can  go  drinking 
 all  the  time  no  the  reason  why  you  feel 
 all  sickly  and  you  get  fresh  is  flu  and
[21:46] all  this  [ __ ]  it's  because  you're 
 literally  mildly  sick  literally 
 throughout  the  entire  year  it's  only 
 once  you  actually  start  to  eat  clean
[21:52] sleep  right  train  hard  you  start  to 
 realize  okay  this  is  what  like  I'm 
 supposed  to  feel  like  now  if  I  go  on  a
[21:57] night  out  and  drink  some  some  alcohol 
 I'll  feel  how  different  it  is  it's  not 
 because  I'm  25  and  you  know  at  22  I  was
[22:03] like  Invincible  like  three  year 
 different  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  obviously 
 it's  not  it's  just  because  I'm  more 
 aware  of  it  now  now  I'm  actually  living
[22:08] in  hell  healthy  life  now  I  can  feel  how 
 different  it  is  if  I  go  out  now  and 
 drink  I  feel  [ __ ]  and  this  is  the
[22:13] feeling  I  would  have  had  around  the 
 clock  around  the  year  instead  of  just 
 sporadically  the  sixth  thing  destroying
[22:18] testosterone  levels  which  is  a  really 
 big  one  is  the  modern  diet  not  just  that 
 you  know  it's  processed  and  it's 
 unnatural  just  that  it's  got  so  much
[22:24] [ __ ]  in  it  it's  got  so  much  sugar  sugar 
 directly  decreases  your  testosterone  I 
 don't  want  to go  totally  into  this
[22:29] because  I  made  a  full  I've  got  two  full 
 like  Diet  guides  I've  done  the  perfect 
 diet  and  I've  also  done  like  the  full
[22:35] diet  advice  that  could  change  lives  I 
 could  save  lives  both  filament  Linked  In 
 the  card  description  below  they're  very
[22:40] good  videos  in  my  opinion  I  really  do 
 think  that  like  I  conveyed  the  message 
 properly  those  videos  both  of  them  have 
 got  like  over  a  million  views  each  so
[22:46] obviously  that  says  something  so  just  go 
 and  have  a  look  at  those  videos  if  you 
 think  your  diet's  not  great  for 
 testosterone  for  health  go  and  have  a
[22:51] look  at  those  videos  the  seventh  thing 
 that's  destroying  testosterone  levels 
 people  are  simply  too  fat  for  about  70
[22:57] of  the  UK's  population  for  most  Western 
 countries  about  70  of  people  are  fat  not
[23:02] just  overweight  fat  30  of  people  in 
 Western  countries  are  obese  obese  means
[23:07] like  250  pounds  300  pounds  it's  almost 
 too  controversial  to  say  that  these  days 
 for  me  to  simply  just  even  saying  the
[23:13] word  fat  seems  quite  unacceptable  these 
 days  isn't  it  it's  not  very  PC  is  it 
 we've  got  a  state  hashtag  stay  woke  yeah
[23:20] stay  woke  with  your  limp  dick  that's 
 what  they  want  bro  but  yeah  70  of  people 
 fat  when  you're  fat  your  testosterone
[23:25] levels  dip  down  and  you  also  look  like 
 [ __ ]  and  you  also  feel  like  [ __ ]  you  get 
 no  [ __ ]  all  these  little  fat  guys
[23:30] well  but  I  still  get  a  bit  okay  yeah 
 sure  you  do  okay  when  your  body  fat 
 percentage  is  too  high  you  don't  even 
 feel  like  a  man  honestly  like  you  begin
[23:35] to  feel  like  effeminate  and  your 
 estrogen  kicks  up  your  testosterone  goes 
 down  like  literally  this  like  proven
[23:40] studies  to  show  the  higher  body  fat 
 percentage  you  are  the  lower  your 
 testosterone  will  go  down  at  the  same
[23:45] time  we  don't  want  to  be  ultra  Ultra 
 lean  but  the  reason  why  I'm  not  gonna 
 include  that  as  a  point  here  is  because
[23:50] that's  not  an  issue  for  literally  Mo 
 like  almost  any  person  to  be  too  lean 
 it's  like  a  bodybuilders  issue  like  if
[23:56] you're  a  full-on  steroid  taking 
 bodybuilder  going  for  a  competition  and 
 you're  gonna  cut  down  to  seven  percent 
 body  fat  yeah  your  testosterone  is  going
[24:02] to  go  down  but  pretty  much  you  and  I  are 
 never  gonna  get  to  seven  percent  body 
 part  if  you  think  that  you've  ever  been 
 there  you're  totally  mistaken  you
[24:08] haven't  not  you're  so  certain  you  know 
 if  there's  some  dick  head  watching  this 
 who  says  yeah  I've  been  at  six  minutes 
 shut  the  [ __ ]  up  no  you  know  like  unless
[24:13] you  were  a  professional  bodybuilder 
 going  into  a  show  and  stuff  fair  enough 
 if  you're  some  average  guy  yeah  who  goes 
 to  the  gym  and  you  know  cuts  down  and
[24:18] you  went  on  low  calories  you  were  at 
 like  10  body  fat  and  you  thought  it  was 
 like  six  literally  like  no  one  gets
[24:23] below  10  on  accident  it's  literally 
 impossible  you  have  to  like  fully 
 meticulously  track  every  grain  of  rice
[24:29] to  get  that  low  so  I  don't  think  low 
 body  fat  is  an  issue  for  most  people  I 
 think  too  high  body  fat  is  an  issue  and
[24:34] the  way  to  fix  that  the  previous  point 
 just  go  and  research  diet  General  this 
 pisses  me  off  right  you  know  all  the
[24:39] years  that  we  went  into  the  education 
 system  did  you  ever  get  told  about  diet 
 and  nutrition  did  you  ever  have  a  class
[24:44] or  not  through  high  school  we  got  told 
 so  much  [ __ ]  about  [ __ ]  osmosis  and
[24:49] the  propaganda  like  whitewashed  history 
 of  the  UK  where  they  only  show  like  the 
 UK  you  know  I'm  from  the  UK  like  they
[24:55] only  show  your  country  in  good  light  if 
 you're  American  they  do  this  as  well 
 like  you  do  realize  the  history  that  you 
 learned  in  your  schools  isn't  actually
[25:00] the  real  history  like  it's  actually  very 
 different  from  what  you  learned  you 
 realize  once  you  get  out  of  school  and
[25:05] you  actually  like  start  becoming  like  a 
 real  student  outside  of  school  you 
 realize  like  oh  the  [ __ ]  that  you 
 learned  in  terms  of  history  and
[25:10] geography  and  all  this  [ __ ]  it's  like 
 it's  all  just  propaganda  bro  it's 
 propaganda  to  make  you  weak  and  docile
[25:15] to  make  you  fit  into  the  perfect  little 
 brain  dead  employee  afterwards  and 
 that's  why  they'd  rather  keep  you  like
[25:20] unhealthy  and  fat  and  low  testosterone 
 because  otherwise  you'll  revital  against 
 the  system  but  I  don't  know  maybe  that's
[25:25] a  conspiracy  theory  but  who  knows  if  you 
 feel  offended  then  you  know  that  there's 
 gonna  be  some  truth  to  that  right  now 
 click  and  watch  this  video  right  now  do
[25:30] the  hard  work  especially  when  you  don't 
 feel  like  it  mwah
"
zX8gfNQmVfQ,"[00:00] just  speak  to  a  Jeffrey 
 Jeffrey's  had  a  crush  on  Jessica  for  so
[00:05] long  but  he  just  can't  muster  up  the 
 courage  to  speak  to  her  he  stares  at  her 
 in  class  every  single  day  what  do  you
[00:12] think  happens  next 
 she  gets  a  boyfriend  Jeffrey's  so  upset
[00:18] he  should  have  just  talked  to  her  Adonis 
 Adonis  understands  women  just  like
[00:23] Pakistan  I'm  tired  of  you  doing  the  tax 
 one  bro  just  like  Pakistani  men  and  know 
 how  to  avoid  taxes  donnish  understands
[00:30] women  just  like  Jeffrey  understands  the 
 female  characters  on  League  of  Legends 
 obsessively  his  conversations  with  women
[00:36] are  full  of  sexual  tension  excitement 
 and  interest  I  was  in  Army  Cadets  when  I
[00:43] was  a  teenager  and  inside  you  know  you'd 
 go  for  like  training  to  train  to  be  in 
 the  Army  when  you're  14  years  old  you'd
[00:49] go  and  like  learn  how  to  like  do  knots 
 and  ties  and  stuff  there  was  a 
 particular  part  where  it  would  be  sat 
 almost  like  a  classroom  and  the
[00:54] instructor  in  front  of  us  would  be 
 teaching  us  like  the  phonetic  alphabets 
 a  for  Alpha  B  for  beta  I  couldn't  even
[01:00] focus  on  what  he  was  saying  because  my 
 eyes  were  just  glued  onto  the  girl  that 
 I  had  a  crush  on  bro  she  was  so  [ __ ]
[01:05] cute  bro  I  had  such  a  big  crush  on  this 
 girl  who  was  in  Army  Cadets  with  me  and 
 I  said  nothing  to  her  day  in  and  day  out
[01:12] every  time  like  it  was  time  to  go  to 
 Cadets  maybe  two  three  times  a  week  I 
 would  literally  just  kind  of  like  stare 
 at  her  and  I  would  do  this  which  makes
[01:18] me  so  [ __ ]  cringe  now  instead  of 
 saying  anything  I  would  literally  be  sat 
 there  in  the  classroom  room  tilted  back 
 on  my  chair  and  biting  my  pen  lid  I'll
[01:25] be  doing  this  whilst  looking  at  her
[01:30] let's  go  like  this  bro 
 and  I  had  no  [ __ ]  confidence  enough
[01:35] to  speak  to  her  I  thought  this  was  game 
 I  thought  like  I  was  maybe  14  at  the 
 time  but  I  thought  this  was  game  bro  I
[01:41] thought  I  looked  like  smooth  and  like 
 hot  as  [ __ ]  and  everything  doing  this 
 and  eventually  there's  this  big  events 
 for  Cadets  where  hundreds  of  us  from
[01:46] different  groups  different  detachments 
 go  and  like  meet  up  in  like  this  big 
 city  and  there's  like  some  big  compound
[01:51] that's  been  reserved  for  us  and  it's 
 like  this  organized  thing  where  there's 
 gonna  be  like  a  big  dance  like  a  ball  at 
 the  end  that  we've  all  got  like  suits
[01:57] and  dresses  for  and  everything  and  I 
 remember  one  of  our  instructors  one  of 
 like  the  sort  of  female  sort  of  more
[02:02] senior  girls  who  were  still  like  you 
 know  quite  young  she  randomly  just  asked 
 me  once  like  oh  Hamza  look  would  you  go 
 to  the  dance  with  her
[02:07] um  yeah  yeah  of  course  I  would  yeah  what 
 happened  was  that  she  had  the  other  girl
[02:12] that  I  like  she  had  like  no  one  else  to 
 go  with  and  you  know  I'm  last  place  but 
 yeah  it's  fine  bro  like  if  she's  stuck 
 with  me  it's  fine  a  day  into  this  sort
[02:18] of  big  event  she  just  kind  of  like  in 
 front  of  everyone  kind  of  says  that  she 
 has  a  crush  on  someone  else  and  that  she
[02:23] wants  to  go  out  with  him  and  even  one  of 
 like  my  friends  there  as  well  said  oh 
 but  what  about  hamster  like  he  said  you
[02:28] know  you  should  go  out  you  should  go 
 with  Amazon  and  she's  like  yeah  yeah  and 
 I  was  like  oh  no  don't  worry  about  me
[02:33] like  should  go  you  should  go  with  that 
 guy 
 oh  man  maybe  your  father  or  your  uncle
[02:39] hasn't  told  you  this  just  yet  but 
 fortune  favors  the  Bold  you  can't  be  shy 
 around  women  you  need  to  grab  whatever
[02:45] confidence  you  have  whatever  level  of 
 Courage  that  you  have  and  just  take 
 action  and  say  something  and  be  honest
[02:50] that  you  like  this  girl  being  shy  and 
 being  you  know  taking  your  time  with  it 
 it  makes  you  just  seem  less  attractive
[02:55] and  I  know  what  you're  thinking  and  you 
 could  probably  relate  to  you  know  my 
 story  but  I  don't  know  but  you  know  it 
 doesn't  feel  right  and  it's  not  the
[03:00] right  time  I'm  gonna  wait  for  the  right 
 time  to  say  something  but  the  thing  is 
 when  you're  like  a  certain  level  of  guy 
 when  you  don't  have  that  much  of
[03:05] experience  with  girls  or  you're  not  that 
 confident  you're  always  gonna  feel  this 
 level  of  resistance  before  you're  about
[03:10] to  like  speak  to  a  girl  and  tell  her 
 that  you  like  her  courage  is  when  you 
 feel  that  feeling  of  fear  but  you  do  the
[03:16] thing  anyway  you  have  to  understand  that 
 you  have  inside  of  you  this  emotion 
 that's  telling  you  like  oh  no  but  it's 
 going  to  be  scary  if  we  talk  to  her  but
[03:22] you  can  do  the  action  even  if  you  feel 
 this  emotion  you  don't  need  to  feel 
 absolutely  fine  to  go  speak  to  her  you
[03:29] just  need  to  do  the  action  no  matter 
 what  you're  feeling  girls  are  attracted 
 to  like  courageous  confident  guys  who
[03:34] even  if  they're  experiencing  some  kind 
 kind  of  negative  fearful  emotion  do  the 
 hard  work  anyway  and  you  might  be
[03:40] thinking  I'm  scared  of  rejection  well 
 yeah  of  course  you  are  rejection  is  like 
 a  totally  scary  thing  but  only  really
[03:46] for  the  first  50  rejections  of  your  life 
 by  now  you  watching  this  you  probably 
 experience  rejection  maybe  10  times  in
[03:52] your  entire  life  maybe  20  times 
 obviously  online  texting  [ __ ]  like  you 
 know  some  girl  that  you've  never  even
[03:57] met  before  on  Tinder  or  something  stops 
 replying  to  your  message  that  doesn't 
 count  but  like  a  real  rejection  of  you 
 walking  up  to  a  girl  saying  something  in
[04:03] the  sense  that  you  like  her  and  then  her 
 saying  oh  no  sorry  I've  got  a  boyfriend 
 most  young  guys  have  only  been  rejected 
 like  three  times  and  it  hurts  so
[04:09] significantly  but  the  pain  of  rejection 
 starts  up  here  and  it  goes  down 
 dramatically  with  every  single  one  that
[04:14] you  get  and  I  promise  you  that  any  of 
 the  guys  who  are  slightly  older  than  you 
 who  are  quite  experienced  with  women  and 
 you  know  who  get  like  quite  a  lot  of
[04:20] girls  have  been  rejected  by  10  times  as 
 many  as  you  can  think  honestly  I  may 
 have  been  rejected  by  probably  close  to
[04:26] 300  400  500  somewhere  around  that  range 
 in  person  in  person  and  that's  not  even
[04:31] including  like  the  random  times  like 
 some  girl  on  Instagram  or  Tinder  that 
 like  doesn't  reply  to  your  message  to  be 
 good  with  girls  honestly  a  lot  of  it's
[04:37] just  quantity  it's  just  a  lot  of 
 practice  how  is  it  that  girls  actually 
 want  you  to  talk  to  them  they  just  want
[04:42] you  to  like  be  honest  and  upfront  with 
 what  you  actually  want  from  us  so  many 
 guys  especially  the  younger  guys  who
[04:47] don't  have  much  confidence  like  you  go 
 about  it  in  this  like  just  this  [ __ ] 
 kind  of  way  where  you  just  kind  of  act 
 like  you  don't  really  like  her  for  what
[04:53] for  what  reason  what  gain  is  there  for 
 you  to  pretend  that  you  don't  really 
 like  it  and  that  you've  got  no  interest 
 in  it  you  know  there's  the  kind  of  cool
[04:59] Chad  looking  guy  who  doesn't  act  but 
 just  that  isn't  really  that  interested 
 in  her  and  that's  kind  of  attractive  but
[05:04] when  it's  inauthentic  when  you  are 
 actually  obsessively  thinking  about  this 
 girl  and  you  try  and  act  too  cool  and
[05:09] like  pretend  like  oh  I'm  not  gonna  speak 
 to  her  like  I'm  gonna  wait  till  the 
 right  time  it's  not  attractive  bro  and 
 the  reason  why  we  do  that  the  reason  why
[05:15] we  don't  go  and  speak  to  these  girls  is 
 because  we're  just  scared  of  rejection 
 because  we're  scared  of  like  the  bad 
 thing  that  could  happen  because  we  feel
[05:20] quite  fearful  you  can't  be  scared  of 
 rejection  because  regret  hurts  more  than 
 rejection  not  speaking  to  that  girl  that
[05:26] you  randomly  see  that  one  time  that  you 
 could  have  called  approach  hurts  more 
 than  you  just  going  up  to  speak  to  her 
 and  her  just  saying  oh  sorry  I've  got  a
[05:32] boyfriend  so  what  should  you  actually 
 say  when  you're  next  to  a  girl  that  you 
 probably  we  already  know  the  advice  oh
[05:37] you  should  ask  questions  and  you  should 
 be  interested  in  them  that  advice  is 
 like  really  basic  and  the  guys  who
[05:42] follow  it  end  up  feeling  that  they're  in 
 an  interview  with  the  girl  and  you 
 probably  felt  this  too  you've  probably 
 felt  that  you've  been  in  this  one-sided
[05:47] conversation  where  you're  asking  her 
 questions  and  she's  answering  and  it 
 just  feels  like  an  interview  maybe  she's
[05:52] asking  you  the  question  out  of  like 
 politeness  you  say  like  oh  what's  your 
 favorite  type  of  music  and  she  says  oh 
 yeah  like  drum  and  bass  what's  your
[05:58] favorite  type  of  music  yeah  well  I 
 really  like  90s  bro  and  the  conversation 
 you  know  for  a  fact  is  not  the  kind  of
[06:04] one  that  she's  having  with  Chad  so  what 
 conversation  are  these  girls  actually 
 having  which  sexually  excites  them  and
[06:09] it's  definitely  not  the  kind  of  one  that 
 you're  having  which  just  feels  like  an 
 interview  this  is  exactly  what  you  do
[06:14] instead  of  asking  questions  and  making 
 your  conversation  with  her  kind  of  like 
 an  interview  you  instead  tease  her
[06:19] teasing  a  girl  is  far  far  more  enjoyable 
 than  going  through  like  this  dry  boring
[06:25] ass  interview  questions  about  what  kind 
 of  music  do  you  like  you  tease  her  in 
 almost  like  a  slightly  mocking  tone  with 
 like  a  slight  insult  you  don't  want  to
[06:31] just  tease  her  by  saying  oh  yeah  you're 
 a  fat  [ __ ]  some  [ __ ]  but  you  want  to 
 tease  her  in  a  way  that's  quite  clear
[06:36] really  like  not  true  so  it's  not  going 
 to  hurt  her  feelings  for  example  with  my 
 girl  now  that  I'm  dating  for  our  first
[06:41] date  we  sat  in  a  cafe  together  and  we 
 both  had  like  a  hot  drink  and  we  were  in 
 Thailand  right  so  we  met  in  Thailand 
 she's  wearing  like  this  beautiful  black
[06:47] dress  and  this  one  Cafe  was  pretty  warm 
 so  she  started  to  sweat  as  you  know  it's 
 normal  to  do  in  Thailand  and  I  just
[06:52] started  making  fun  of  her  for  sweating  I 
 was  oh  you  did  squat  in  the  in  the 
 bathroom  like  to  warm  up  before  he  comes 
 speaking  to  me  and  stuff  and  you  know
[06:57] she  had  like  a  bit  of  sweat  and  wiping 
 it  off  her  and  said  oh  you're  so  sweet 
 you  know  just  teasing  around  with  that 
 that  made  our  conversation  flow  so  well
[07:04] to  the  point  that  I  was  leaving  Thailand 
 that  same  day  by  the  way that  was  my 
 last  day  on  Thailand  I  literally  just 
 had  like  a  last  minute  date  with  this
[07:09] girl  it  was  so  good  she  was  meant  to 
 stay  in  Thailand  with  a  brother  for  like 
 months  in  the  future  we  had  such  a  good
[07:14] time  together  on  that  day  that  she 
 literally  left  her  travels  early  came 
 back  to  the  UK  to  be  with  me  so  I  made
[07:20] such  a  great  impression  on  our  first 
 date  because  I  focus  entirely  on  this 
 kind  of  teasing  light-hearted  Vibe  is
[07:25] Sexual  Energy  before  getting  into  the 
 more  sort  of  serious  conversation  oh 
 [ __ ]  me  holy  [ __ ]  bro  when  I  was  in
[07:30] university  I  was  a  [ __ ]  boy  right  I  was 
 good  at  sleeping  with  girls  from  like 
 Tinder  and  clubs  and  everything  and  me
[07:35] and  my  one  friend  Levi  we  went  out  onto 
 this  club  night  inside  the  club  you  know 
 we  kissed  girls  and  stuff  but  none  of
[07:40] the  girls  like  were  coming  out  with  us 
 but  we  leave  the  club  we're  about  to  go 
 home  we've  got  an  Uber  and  we  see  these 
 two  like  cute  looking  like  bro  sexy
[07:46] looking  girls  like  hot  looking  girls  it 
 was  very  interesting  because  the  two 
 girls  we  saw  were  like  exactly  our  type
[07:51] so  we  go  up  and  start  spitting  game  to 
 these  girls  and  we  start  telling  them  oh 
 you're  not  coming  to  Aruba  come  back  to 
 our  place  and  everything  we  all  have
[07:56] like  music  we  got  drinks  and  everything 
 and  the  girls  are  weighing  it  up  now 
 yeah  go  on  the  girls  are  vibing  us  right 
 so  we  bring  both  girls  back  to  our
[08:02] apartments  and  I  started  kissing  my 
 girlfriend  with  a  black  haired  girl  and 
 I  bring  her  into  my  room  and  out  of 
 nowhere  bro  the  other  girl  walks  in  just
[08:09] kind  of  like  not  interested  she  walks  in 
 stops  me  and  my  girl  and  kind  of  tells 
 my  girl  come  on  Luke  we're  going  I'm
[08:15] like  what  the  [ __ ]  so  what  you  know  like 
 why  is  my  friend  not  held  it  down  come 
 on  bro  just  take  care  of  your  girl  for 
 like  another  five  minutes  bro  all  I
[08:21] needed  was  five  minutes  bro  he  sat  there 
 on  his  bed  just  looking  defeated  on  my 
 bro  what  the  [ __ ]  all  you  have  to  do  was 
 just  like  keep  her  busy  like  if  you're
[08:26] not  gonna  [ __ ]  fine  but  like  I  was 
 about  to  bro  what  the  [ __ ]  like  why  is 
 your  girl  coming  to  my  room  and 
 interrupted  me  and  taking  her  away  and
[08:32] they  just  went  home  now  and  he  just 
 looks  at  me  he's  like  oh  bro  I've  got  no 
 [ __ ]  game  like  he  usually  is  kind  of
[08:38] a  smooth  guy  but  this  is  literally  what 
 happened  this  guy  brings  his  girl  into 
 his  room  and  they  sit  there  with  like
[08:43] the  bright  light  on  no  music  playing  or 
 anything  they  just  sat  there  at  the  edge 
 of  his  bed  and  he's  just  asking  her
[08:48] interview  questions  so  like  uh  what  kind 
 of  music  do  you  like
[08:53] come  around  some  of  his  girl  just  got 
 bored  with  the  conversation  literally 
 stood  up  left  him  came  inside  my  room 
 just  said  oh  yeah  come  on  we're  leaving
[08:58] you  can't  be  asking  girls  these  boring 
 ass  questions  I  know  that  sort  of
[09:03] conventional  advice  tells  you  that  you 
 should  take  an  interest  in  the  girl  and 
 you  should  ask  her  about  her  Hobbies  bro 
 girls  don't  want  to  speak  about  their
[09:08] Hobbies  that's  boring  as  [ __ ]  they  want 
 you  to  tease  them  to  have  like  a  little 
 bit  of  playful  banter  to  like  play
[09:14] wrestle  with  each  other  they  want  you  to 
 speak  about  like  your  work  which  you're 
 extremely  passionate  and  ambitious  about 
 do  you  want  to  know  one  of  the  single
[09:20] conversations  that  I've  had  which  has 
 increased  a  girl's  attraction  to  me  to 
 the  sky  limit  is  with  this  girl  when  I
[09:25] told  her  about  my  plans  for  YouTube  with 
 my  leadership  of  this  movement  and  I 
 looked  her  in  the  eyes  and  said  that  I'm 
 going  to  the  top
[09:30] do  you  want  to  join  me  imagine  how 
 [ __ ]  interesting  how  emotional  that
[09:35] makes  a  woman  feel  when  you  speak  to  her 
 in  a  certain  way  well  you  don't  just  ask 
 these  little  like  you  know  silly 
 questions  like  oh  did  you  do  the
[09:41] homework  today  what's  your  music  typo 
 like  just  this  like  little  weak  ass  bait 
 of  mail  sorry  boy  kind  of  like
[09:46] conversations  and  instead  you  speak  to 
 her  like  a  man  and  a  man  either  speaks 
 to  a  woman  with  like  so  much  ambition
[09:51] and  tells  her  yes  like  I'm  gonna  make  it 
 I'm  gonna  I'm  gonna  be  so  successful  or 
 he  speaks  to  her  like  he's  almost  like
[09:56] playing  around  with  her  and  he's  just 
 kind  of  like  laughing  around  with  it 
 he's  teasing  her  and  stuff  he  doesn't 
 take  us  too  seriously  honestly  most  of
[10:02] the  conversations  that  I  have  with  my 
 girl  it's  just  me  just  teasing  her  and 
 that  like  I  see  her  so  bubbly  so  like 
 goofy  so  like  laughing  with  me  am  I

wZify-FZZqM,"[00:00] Jeffrey  looks  into  his  dirty  mirror  and 
 he  is  disgusted  with  his  body  how  do  I 
 get  rid  of  this  he  says  while  he  grabs
[00:06] onto  his  lower  belly  fat  but  Jeffrey 
 you've  only  been  going  to  the  gym  for  a 
 couple  of  weeks  have  patience
[00:13] Adonis  has  the  physique  of  a  Greek  God 
 these  results  didn't  arrive  in  a  week  or
[00:19] a  month  or  even  a  year  Adonis  has  been 
 working  hard  in  the  gym  for  decades  in
[00:24] fact  when  Adonis  was  in  the  womb  he  was 
 bench  pressing  this  is  how  he  has  built 
 the  perfect  male  physique  picture  this
[00:30] I'm  a  16  year  old  skinny  fat  Brown  kid 
 and  I've  just  really  really  really  gone
[00:36] horny  I'm  in  high  school  and  totally 
 noticing  the  girls  around  me  and  I  want 
 to  actually  start  to  date  but  I  look
[00:41] into  the  mirror  and  I  don't  feel 
 attracted  particularly  because  I  had 
 grown  up  quite  skinny  for  most  of  my 
 life  and  yet  at  this  point  I'd  been
[00:46] eating  the  school  lunches  the  [ __ ] 
 disgusting  Western  diet  literally  just 
 eating  like  carbs  and  bread  and  [ __ ]
[00:52] pizzas  and  [ __ ]  whatever  why  do  they 
 feed  that  [ __ ]  to  kids  bro  you  really 
 are  what  you  eat  bro  I  know  this  is  a
[00:57] separate  topic  but  you  really  are  what 
 you  eat  don't  trust  anyone  who  tells  you 
 you  can  eat  whatever  you  want  as  long  as 
 you  eat  this  the  right  calories  it's
[01:02] [ __ ]  [ __ ]  it's  [ __ ]  evil 
 advice  so  me  and  the  school  meals  for 
 about  a  year  I  gained  fat  and  I'm  15  16
[01:07] years  old  and  I'm  kind  of  chubby  now  I 
 remember  one  day  bro  I  walked  into  my 
 school  classroom  with  my  [ __ ]  my
[01:13] friends  were  there  and  just  abruptly 
 they  walked  up  to  me  and  said  oh  yeah 
 we've  all  decided  like  you're  the 
 fattest  one  now  you're  out  of  all  of  us
[01:19] and  then  bro  there  was  a  little  fat  kid 
 next  to  me  bro  I  still  remember  him  he 
 was  he  was  definitely  fatter  than  me  but 
 I  was  like  no  no  he's  he's  fine  no  no
[01:24] you  are  you've  gotten  really  fat  answer 
 it  was  really  embarrassing  but  you  know 
 what  I  actually  looked  back  with 
 gratitude  because  it's  so  interesting
[01:30] they  said  that  I  hated  it  you  know  I  got 
 so  upset  and  stuff  three  months  later  I 
 was  lean  again  it  actually  changed  my
[01:35] life  being  body  shamed  so  you're  a  fat 
 [ __ ]  bro  I  hope  this  helps  you 
 so  age  17  I  started  weightlifting
[01:41] because  my  brother  got  me  into  it  so  my 
 brother  first  went  on  a  low  calorie  diet 
 like  literally  just  ate  like  [ __ ] 
 chicken  and  vegetables  and  [ __ ]
[01:46] disgusting  about  it  and  he  lost  weight 
 then  he  got  me  to  do  the  same  thing  we 
 were  eating  literally  600  calorie
[01:51] [ __ ]  stupid  bro  600  calories  a  day  I 
 think  that's  like  stunted  my  puberty 
 growth  now  I've  got  like  very  skinny
[01:56] wrists  and  [ __ ]  so  600  calories  a  day 
 bro  lost  some  weight  and  stuff  and  then 
 he  started  going  to  the  gym  and  watching
[02:01] like  the  old  school  YouTubers  Fitness 
 YouTubers  the  good  ones  so  there  was 
 like  Scooby  he  watched  the  Hodge  twins  I
[02:06] started  watching  them  as  well  these  were 
 like  the  good  guys  bro  these  [ __ ] 
 YouTubers  were  Prime  man  wait  let  me  put
[02:11] some  respect  on  his  name  bro  Scooby 
 1961.  oh  so  that's  that's  probably  when 
 he  was  born  he's  still  making  videos  man
[02:16] he  was  making  videos  like  how  to 
 dumbbell  press  like  on  the  floor  of  your 
 home  and  stuff  that's  the  kind  of  guy  he
[02:21] was  like  for  this  video  title  healthy 
 meals  for  students  and  other  busy  people 
 six-pack  abs  and  gain  muscle  with  good
[02:27] nutrition  13  years  ago  [ __ ]  wholesome 
 so  this  was  Scooby  my  brother  really 
 liked  him  then  I  started  watching  him
[02:32] there's  a  couple  of  other  guys  I  think 
 athlean  X  was  around  the  scene  as  well 
 yeah  this  was  like  the  Golden  Era  of
[02:37] like  YouTube  Fitness  it's  very  [ __ ]  now 
 almost  YouTubers  are  just  [ __ ] 
 disgusting  people  just  telling  you  to
[02:42] eat  [ __ ]  Krispy  Kreme  donuts  and 
 stuff  but  yeah  they  were  good  people  man 
 I  started  watching  them  going  to  the  gym 
 training  and  I  got  more  and  more  into
[02:48] the  niche  my  brother  stayed  there  with 
 like  oh  yeah  you  know  just  like  eat 
 protein  and  stuff  and  they  focus  on 
 other  things  I  got  way  more  into  the
[02:53] niche  of  like  the  aesthetic  lifestyle 
 and  I  started  watching  like  the  OG's  Joe 
 Delaney  most  Samuels  and  I  fully
[02:58] ingrained  my  personality  to  be  a  guy 
 who's  going  to  the  gym  getting  more 
 musculine  wanting  to  use  that  to  get
[03:03] girls  into  party  and  everything  you  know 
 like  those  are  Degen  days  but  it  was 
 kind  of  nice  when  I  was  like  18  years
[03:08] old  so  I've  been  working  out  now  for 
 many  years  honestly  like  about  eight 
 years  nine  years  if  you  work  out  hard
[03:14] for  like  nine  years  you  can  be  way 
 bigger  way  more  muscular  than  me 
 honestly  for  the  first  like  five  years 
 of  my  training  even  though  I  was  really
[03:20] into  it  I  just  wasn't  very  disciplined 
 so  I  was  just  working  out  like  a  [ __ ] 
 like  I'd  get  to  like  for  example  if  I 
 had  you  know  10  reps  really  did  have  10
[03:26] reps  in  the  bank  I'd  get  to  six  fuel  the 
 burn  and  stuff  and  just  put  the  weights 
 down  and  just  like  go  on  my  phone  for  a 
 bit  so  even  though  I  really  cared  about
[03:31] the  journey  I  didn't  have  the  discipline 
 and  I  was  eating  [ __ ]  food  and  my  sleep 
 was  really  bad  so  obviously  like  I
[03:36] wasn't  like  you  know  making  as  much 
 progress  as  possible  but  about  two  years 
 ago  I  I  just  skyrocketed  my  discipline
[03:41] really  got  shredded  doing  gymnastic 
 training  just  eating  clean  as  [ __ ] 
 improving  my  sleep  and  my  physique
[03:46] changed  so  much  in  just  the  space  of 
 like  six  months  like  I've  said  this  in 
 just  a  recent  video  I've  created  like  a
[03:52] global  movement  I've  helped  hundreds 
 maybe  thousands  of  men  and  honestly  the 
 best  thing  that  I've  still  done  is  just
[03:57] build  my  physique  because  it  really  was 
 the  first  thing  that  I  actually  had  like 
 this  desire  in  the  real  world  to  do  it
[04:02] was  the  thing  that  got  me  away  from 
 video  games  because  playing  video  games 
 just  seemed  pointless  as  soon  as  I 
 realized  you  could  level  up  in  real  life
[04:07] I  just  became  silly  to  be  on  RuneScape 
 leveling  up  my  strength  skill  instead  of 
 just  going  to  the  gym  and  leveling  up  my
[04:13] IRL  strength  skill  there  so  it  made  me 
 quit  video  games  it  helped  me  to  get 
 girls  and  stop  being  lonely  changed  my
[04:18] life  forever  if  you're  on  this  right  now 
 and  you're  wondering  how  long  does  it 
 take  to  get  jacked  and  you  know  without 
 taking  anything  it's  hard  to  say  because
[04:24] honestly  it  changes  very  much  between 
 people  I  have  been  totally  a  guy  who
[04:29] says  like  you  know  don't  think  about 
 genetics  and  stuff  but  at  least  for  this 
 let's  just  talk  right  I'm  not  saying 
 that  you  should  be  sat  here  and  upset 
 saying  your  genetics  are  bad  because
[04:35] either  way  you're  gonna  get  to  the  same 
 point  but  I  have  actually  seen  in  my  own 
 eyes  some  people  who  got  seemingly  good
[04:40] genetics  or  testosterone  whatever  it  is 
 and  they  make  progress  incredibly  fast 
 I'm  talking  literally  six  months  of  a
[04:46] guy  with  like  pretty  good  genetics  he 
 builds  a  more  attractive  physique  than  a 
 guy  who's  put  it  in  three  years  I  found
[04:51] personally  that  people  of  my  sort  of 
 race  of  like  brown  India  and  Pakistan  we
[04:56] have  like  the  worst  muscle  building 
 genetics  most  guys  who  start  with  my 
 sort  of  genetics  and  my  Heritage 
 literally  starts  getting  fat  a  year
[05:02] later  two  years  later  they  still  look 
 kind  of  skinny  fat  where  I  found  this 
 interesting  thing  once  that  the  gene 
 variants  in  Africa  is  actually  the
[05:08] biggest  even  in  every  other  country  so 
 like  a  person  from  Nigeria  is 
 genetically  more  different  than  a  person
[05:14] from  like  Kenya  or  something  like  this 
 than  literally  like  someone  from  Israel 
 is  to  someone  from  America  it's  like  the
[05:19] biggest  Gene  diversity  is  in  Africa 
 that's  why  you  see  like  the  Fallen  Elite 
 athletes  from  there  my  uni  friend  who  is
[05:24] Kenyan  and  he  went  to  the  gym  for  about 
 three  months  and  he  looked  better  than 
 me  then  I  went  for  about  three  years  he
[05:29] literally  looked  better  than  me  I  have  a 
 course  where  I've  taught  like  how  to 
 build  your  dream  body  and  I  see  people's 
 progress  pictures  I  see  some  guys  who
[05:34] have  the  same  gymnastics  as  me  one  year 
 in  you  know  if  they're  looking  better 
 and  better  but  they're  not  like 
 aesthetic  they  don't  look  amazing
[05:39] actually  some  other  guys  that  showed 
 progress  pictures  and  it  seems  real 
 because  I've  seen  them  in  my  Discord  and 
 everything  for  months  they've  literally
[05:44] been  working  out  for  like  six  months  and 
 they  look  better  than  I  did  like  two 
 years  four  years  later  so  the  genetics
[05:49] can  definitely  play  a  part  but  I've  had 
 to  give  you  just  a  very  random  time 
 scale  I'd  say  by  around  two  to  three
[05:54] years  you  should  be  that  muscular  guy 
 two  to  three  years  if  you're  not  seen  as 
 like  the  muscular  guy  if  you  don't  have
[05:59] like  a  good  amount  of  muscle  where  like 
 people  are  at  War  you  know  if  you're 
 like  flexing  someone  be  like  oh  it  means 
 you've  been  doing  something  totally
[06:04] wrong  and  you  need  to  accept  this  I 
 found  a  bodybuilding  it's  such  a 
 beautiful  Journey  because  if  you've  been
[06:09] bullshitting  yourself  it  will  show  now 
 fair  enough  you  know  some  people  have 
 got  genetics  and  stuff  but  your  race  of 
 muscle  growth  is  your  own  personal
[06:14] Journey  so  you  you  know  after  a  couple 
 of  months  you  know  if  your  rate  is  fast 
 or  slow  and  then  after  that  if  you  had 
 slow  growth  and  three  years  in  you  don't
[06:20] even  look  good  it's  because  you've  been 
 bullshitting  yourself  and  you  must 
 accept  this  is  maybe  you've  been  working 
 out  like  a  posse  maybe  you've  just  been
[06:25] a  [ __ ]  complete  [ __ ]  and  maybe 
 you're  just  like  like  I  used  to  just  put 
 the  weight  down  even  though  you're  not 
 even  close  to  failure  maybe  you've  just
[06:30] been  missing  too  many  days  because  you 
 say  you're  busy  maybe  you've  been 
 sleeping  like  a  dumbass  or  you  need  to 
 accept  these  things  I  wish  someone  told
[06:36] me  this  when  I  was  younger  I  wish  you 
 know  someone  who's  more  into  this  just 
 told  me  you  you  know  in  University  like 
 hey  you  say  that  this  is  the  most
[06:41] important  thing  of  your  life  why  the 
 [ __ ]  are  you  staying  up  to  like  4am 
 partying  then  dumbass  you  know  you're
[06:46] not  Invincible  I  wish  someone  told  me 
 that  back  in  the  day  obviously  it's  kind 
 of  common  sense  but  like  I  didn't  think 
 about  it  when  I  was  like  you  know  going
[06:51] out  partying  taking  drugs  drinking 
 alcohol  and  stuff  eating  [ __ ]  food  I 
 wish  someone  sat  down  and  said  like  you 
 do  realize  the  [ __ ]  food  the  sugar  and
[06:57] stuff  that  you're  eating  it's  just  gonna 
 gain  body  fat  and  no  muscle  at  all  why 
 don't  you  just  go  and  eat  chicken  and 
 rice  every  day  you  need  to  figure  out
[07:02] what  right  now  what's  holding  you  back 
 so  two  to  three  years  you  should  be  like 
 muscular  you  should  show  like  a  really
[07:07] really  good  amount  of  muscle  to  the 
 point  that  like  everyone  around  you  can 
 tell  that  you  work  out  there's  two  big
[07:12] mistakes  that  I  made  that  honestly  have 
 slowed  my  progress  down  by  about  two  to 
 three  years  and  it  probably  is  doing  it
[07:17] to  you  because  like  no  one  actually  like 
 made  this  so  clear  to  me  number  one 
 cutting  too  much  losing  too  much  body 
 weight  and  like  one  inside  gonna  be  on  a
[07:23] calorie  deficit  wanting  to  be  lean  to 
 begin  with  you  need  to  build  it  it's  the 
 whole  point  of  like  bodybuilding  of 
 building  muscle  is  that  you  should  bulk
[07:29] you  should  eat  more  calories  good 
 calories  not  [ __ ]  but  like  you  know 
 not  [ __ ]  pancakes  but  like  [ __ ] 
 chicken  and  rice  and  stuff  you  need  to
[07:34] eat  more  calories  of  that  to  gain  weight 
 you're  probably  not  making  muscle  in  a 
 calorie  deficit  honestly  like  potion
[07:39] Progressive  overload  getting  an  extra 
 rep  or  an  extra  increase  in  weight  is  so 
 difficult  even  on  a  bulk  never  mind  on  a
[07:44] calorie  deficit  I  wasted  so  many  years 
 of  my  life  just  trying  to  get  like  lean 
 before  I  even  had  the  muscle  to  you  know
[07:49] really  show  it  off  but  actually  the 
 worst  mistake  that  I  made  even  just 
 recently  even  for  the  most  of  the  last
[07:55] year  is  such  a  silly  one  that  no  one 
 really  spoke  about  because  all  these 
 [ __ ]  Fitness  YouTubers  have  been 
 doing  it  wrong  I  was  training  like  a
[08:01] weightlifter  like  a  power  lifter  instead 
 of  a  bodybuilder  every  Fitness  YouTuber 
 video  you've  seen  says  the  same  thing
[08:06] don't  they  every  single  one  of  them  just 
 a  [ __ ]  copy  paste  all  day  a  heavy 
 compound  lifts  bodybuilders  don't  do
[08:11] that  [ __ ]  Bro  all  these  [ __ ]  Fitness 
 YouTubers  telling  you  like  heavy  combat 
 oh  don't  do  isolation  exercise  why  would
[08:16] you  waste  your time  doing  curls  because 
 you  want  to  build  biceps  any  guy  who's 
 telling  you  right  now  like  oh  don't  do 
 curls  just  do  pull  up  oh  don't  don't
[08:22] train  you  why  would  you  just  do 
 isolation  just  do  lots  of  benchmarks 
 just  do  heavy  bench  press  five  times 
 five  bro  I  know  I  seems  silly  I  know
[08:27] that  every  other  YouTuber  is  going  to 
 disagree  with  me  and  you're  probably 
 thinking  wait  wait  but  more  qualified 
 bigger  guys  than  Hamza  have  been  saying
[08:33] other  things  so  obviously  they  must  be 
 right  I'm  just  wrong  you  can  take  their 
 advice  and  if  you  see  good  progress  fine 
 but  I'm  telling  you  right  now  what  you
[08:38] want  if  you  watch  this  video  is 
 hypertrophy  what  you  want  is  just  muscle 
 gain  right  muscle  gain  is  very  little
[08:44] and  just  low  Roi  if  you're  doing  heavy 
 sets  of  like  two  three  four  five  six
[08:49] seven  even  eight  reps  you  know  you've 
 always  heard  like  the  rep  ranges  one  to 
 five  is  like  strength  and  ship  eight  is
[08:54] hyper  trophy  Pro  I  found  you'll  get  the 
 best  gains  of  your  life  if  you  do  more 
 than  10  reps  10  to  like  15  10  to  20  is
[09:00] the  best  range  for  building  muscle 
 because  it's  light  enough  that  you 
 really  get  the  [ __ ]  good  squeeze  if 
 all  these  guys  saying  oh  yeah  do  heavy
[09:06] squats  just  do  five  times  five  do  three 
 rep  squats  bro  you're  not  going  to  build 
 much  muscle  from  that  it's  entirely 
 fatiguing  you're  more  likely  to  get
[09:11] injuries  which  if  you've  got  good  form 
 find  your  little  void  but  like  you  know 
 over  an  entire  year  of  training  if 
 you're  lifting  three  reps  or  five  reps
[09:17] you  probably  are  gonna  get  one  kind  of 
 injury  if  you're  doing  bodybuilder 
 training  probably  not  you  know  there's 
 this  culture  online  like  oh  you're  not
[09:22] really  training  if  you're  not  doing 
 heavy  weights  tell  those  same  fat  power 
 lifters  to  do  a  15  rep  set  of  squats  go
[09:27] on  if  you  think  you're  discipline  bro 
 you  think  you're  discipline  because  you 
 can  lift  heavy  ways  you  can  do  a  one  rep 
 deadlift  bro  doing  a  one  rep  isn't
[09:34] actually  hard  because  you  can  just  hit 
 it  I  mean  you  hit  it  or  you  don't  hit  it 
 it's  simple  right  it's  not  actually  that 
 difficult  you  know  what's  actually
[09:39] difficult  go  and  do  a  30  reps  if  you 
 want  to  train  your  discipline  I'm  going 
 to  do  a  20  to  30  rep  set  of  something
[09:44] and  now  let's  see  how  disciplined  your 
 mind  actually  is  do  one  set  of  30  reps
[09:49] of  lateral  raises  of  light  weights  till 
 the  point  that  you're  [ __ ]  like 
 weirdly  [ __ ]  like  shaking  like  this 
 and  you'll  realize  that  all  those  like
[09:55] heavy  weight  sets  that  you  did  were  just 
 [ __ ]  Coke  if  I  could  go  back  now  I'd 
 tell  younger  Hamza  you're  a  bodybuilder 
 not  a  weightlifter  do  not  watch  any  of
[10:01] these  [ __ ]  online  that  are  telling 
 you  heavy  compound  lifts  I  tell  them 
 lift  but  within  the  10  to  20  rep  range 
 for  every  exercise  including  compound
[10:07] like  you  should  do  some  you  know  big 
 compound  movements  squats  and  bench  and 
 stuff  that's  still  nice  of  course  Lots 
 don't  do  them  for  three  Reps  don't  do
[10:13] them  you  don't  need  to  like  increase 
 your  strength  if  you're  a  bodybuilder  it 
 doesn't  like  there's  no  need  if  you  just 
 care  about  you're  lifting  the  weight  and
[10:18] it's  kind  of  fun  fair  enough  but  if  you 
 are  here  today  because  you  want  to  be 
 like  a  mini  bodybuilder  you  don't  want
[10:23] to  be  a  massive  steroid  one  but  you  know 
 you  just  want  to  build  a  good  fizzy  you 
 don't  need  to  be  strong  for  it  because 
 strength  and  muscle  are  two  different
[10:28] things  there's  been  studies  to  show  they 
 are  correlated  yeah  of  course  they  are 
 but  correlation  does  not  mean  causation
[10:33] trading  and  the  five  rep  range  is  not 
 gonna  build  anywhere  near  as  much  muscle 
 it's  training  in  the  10  to  15  rep  range
[10:38] simple  as  that  I  just  wanted  to  be  more 
 attractive  bro  I  was  tired  of  being 
 lonely  I  wanted  to  get  girls  and  so  I 
 started  eventually  going  to  the  right
[10:43] workout  routines  which  I'll  link  in  the 
 description  if  you  do  want  to  see  them 
 and  there's  seven  free  workout  routines 
 Link  in  the  description  go  click  that
[10:48] right  now  and  I  actually  built  a  body 
 now  that  I'm  proud  of  how  long  does  it 
 take  about  two  to  five  years  to  be
[10:53] jacked  click  and  watch  this  video  right 
 now  do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah
"
xkOtEad7c6U,"[00:00] for  the  first  time  in  some  weeks  Jeffrey 
 has  left  his  house  and  now  he's  looking 
 for  some  women  to  speak  to  Okay  there
[00:05] she  is 
 I'm  gonna  do  it  Jeffrey  starts  sprinting 
 towards  her  Jessica  notes  him  charging
[00:10] at  her  and  she  starts  to  run  away  why 
 does  no  one  talk  to  me
[00:15] I've  done  it  it  honest  sees  the  whole 
 thing  that  just  happened  to  Jeffrey  let 
 me  ask  you  a  question  young  Jeffrey  do
[00:20] you  think  you're  attractive  to  women 
 Jeffrey  stutters  and  then  puts  his  head 
 down  and  then  Adonis  looks  to  his  left
[00:26] and  right  and  sees  a  whole  generation  of 
 men  who  are  lonely  this  is  a  problem
[00:31] that's  worth  solving  there's  multiple 
 steps  that  you  can  take  to  turn  up  the
[00:36] attraction  that  you  get  from  women  and 
 if  this  was  some  kind  of  Click  bait 
 video  which  wasn't  really  going  to  help 
 you  you  know  this  clickbait  like  number
[00:41] one  do  50  push-ups  in  the  mode  I'd  say 
 something  really  clickbait  to  entertain 
 you  but  the  first  way  to  find  out  if
[00:46] you're  attractive  to  women  or  literally 
 even  Step  Zero  is  something  that  a  lot 
 of  guys  aren't  going  to  understand
[00:51] they're  going  to  click  away  but  if  you 
 can  take  this  seriously  and  literally 
 listen  to  these  words  with  your  full 
 attention  I  promise  this  will  change
[00:56] your  life  forever  because  it  did  for  me 
 it's  around  10  12  years  ago  for  me  age 
 13  15.  I  was  genuinely  convinced  that  no
[01:03] girls  would  be  attracted  to  me  I  truly 
 had  this  belief  in  my  mind  that  I  was 
 literally  ugly  you  know  I  wasn't  like  a
[01:09] really  attractive  guy  but  I  wasn't  like 
 totally  ugly  I  was  in  the  UK  and  I  had 
 this  belief  that  the  girls  there  weren't
[01:14] attracted  to  Brown  guys  I  kind  of  had 
 this  like  anti  like  brown  anti-muslim 
 kind  of  mindset  it's  all  I  really  saw  on
[01:21] TV  was  like  oh  like  the  Muslims  are 
 terrorists  and  look  immigrations  are 
 problems  I  always  felt  like  bad  for 
 being  brown  skin  I  genuinely  believe
[01:27] that  no  girls  would  be  attracted  to  me 
 truly  and  I  know  that  there's  a  lot  of 
 guys  who  feel  this  way  and  one  lucky  day
[01:32] something  just  clicked  in  my  mind  when 
 this  singer  went  really  viral  in  the  UK 
 and  his  name  was  Zayn  Malik  he's  a
[01:38] singer  of  like  One  Direction  or 
 something  isn't  he's  pretty  attractive 
 guy  right  this  was  back  in  like  the 
 Facebook  days  so  I  don't  know  if  you
[01:43] were  like  on  social  media  back  then  but 
 this  was  back  in  Facebook  literally  10 
 years  ago  when  girls  would  share  like 
 just  pictures  of  guys  oh  my  God  he's  so
[01:49] hot  and  girls  started  to  do  this  for 
 Zayn  Malik  I  literally  saw  in  front  of 
 my  own  eyes  the  girls  that  I  had  crushes
[01:54] on  but  never  had  the  confidence  to  speak 
 to  because  I  was  sure  that  they  didn't 
 like  brown  guys  they  were  literally
[01:59] downloading  and  then  uploading  a  photo 
 of  this  Pakistani  guy  onto  their 
 Facebook  page  and  just  suddenly  that  one
[02:05] day  that  belief  in  my  mind  got  destroyed 
 and  I  realized  that  it  wasn't  being 
 brown  skinned  that  was  holding  me  back
[02:10] so  what  was  it  a  bunch  of  things  that  I 
 had  to  fix  I  was  addicted  to  porn  at  the 
 time  I  was  just  playing  video  games
[02:15] genuinely  had  a  look  at  myself  and 
 thought  yeah  to  be  honest  if  I  was  a 
 girl  I  probably  wouldn't  be  attracted  to 
 this  version  of  me  like  I'd  love  if  a
[02:21] girl  was  attracted  to  me  and  she  played 
 video  games  too  and  she  just  wanted  to 
 date  a  loser  but  then  I  can't  really 
 blame  her  if  she  doesn't  it  all  started
[02:27] for  me  with  these  deep  internal  beliefs 
 and  you  can  probably  understand  why  I've 
 gave  you  this  like  disclaimer  just  a  few
[02:32] minutes  ago  that  this  isn't  like  a  very 
 attractive  clickbait  thing  for  us  to 
 talk  about  I'd  just  be  like  number  one
[02:37] make  sure  you  wear  pants  and  then  do  the 
 belt  buckle  like  this  yes  here's 
 something  that  you  can  do  right  now  huh
[02:42] it  goes  deep  into  I  think  for  the 
 majority  of  guys  they  are  held  back  not 
 by  real  world  things  but  simply  by  their
[02:48] beliefs  and  of  course  we  can  understand 
 that  because  the  things  that  are 
 happening  in  the  dating  scene  these  days 
 it's  very  cut  throats  and  so  of  course
[02:54] that  leads  to  negative  thinking  and 
 negative  beliefs  in  the  minds  of  men 
 around  the  world  and  you've  probably  had 
 these  kinds  of  thoughts  too  even  if
[02:59] you've  not  wanted  to  consciously  admit 
 it  you're  thinking  about  those  videos 
 that  you've  watched  where  some  guys  made 
 like  a  profile  on  Tinder  attending  he's
[03:04] a  woman  and  he's  just  pictures  of  like 
 very  unattractive  obese  women  and  they 
 get  400  matches  per  day  and  they
[03:10] literally  get  like  really  attractive 
 successful  guys  messaging  them  being 
 flirty  and  you're  thinking  how  would 
 this  kind  of  woman  no  offense  to  her  but
[03:16] you  know  you  just  got  to  say  it  like 
 this  unattractive  woman  gets  a  hundred 
 times  more  interest  than  I  am  what's
[03:22] happening  in  the  modern  dating  scene  is 
 leading  to  a  lot  of  people  with  very 
 negative  beliefs  about  themselves  and  if
[03:29] I  can  give  you  just  one  piece  of  advice 
 in  terms  of  dating  especially  in  terms 
 of  being  a  man  and  dating  a  woman  and
[03:34] actually  wanting  to  be  the  kind  of  guy 
 that  she  like  totally  is  addicted  to 
 right  because  there's  different  kinds  of
[03:39] Dynamics  and  dating  isn't  there 
 sometimes  the  boyfriend's  a  bit  of  a 
 charm  and  the  girl  kind  of  bosses  him 
 around  and  sometimes  the  girl  cheats  on
[03:44] it  but  then  sometimes  just  sometimes  you 
 might  have  seen  this  or  maybe  you  don't 
 even  believe  it  but  sometimes  there's 
 like  an  absolute  like  Chad  kind  of  guy
[03:50] where  the  girl  is  so  totally  submissive 
 and  addicted  to  him  and  if  you  want  to 
 get  to  this  kind  of  place  I've  said  a
[03:56] lot  of  times  you  know  the  most  important 
 thing  is  building  an  aesthetic  body  or 
 maybe  status  or  money  or  confidence  well 
 all  of  those  things  are  actually  above
[04:02] the  foundation  this  is  the  absolute  core 
 part  the  foundation  and  guess  what  it  is 
 it's  your  beliefs  about  yourself  because
[04:08] you  know  if  you  think  of  that  Chad  guy 
 who  gets  so  many  girls  you  know  we  can 
 say  oh  yeah  he  gets  more  likes  on  his
[04:13] Tinder  pictures  because  he's  really 
 attractive  yeah  sure  but  the  reason  why 
 girls  actually  treat  him  nicely  is
[04:18] because  he  believes  that  he  deserves  it 
 I'm  telling  you  this  is  the  most 
 important  thing  if  you  want  to  find  out 
 if  you're  attractive  to  women  and  also
[04:23] if  you  want  to  become  more  attractive  to 
 women  start  to  observe  and  improve  the 
 thoughts  and  beliefs  that  you  have  about
[04:29] your  dating  life  sometimes  you  have  to 
 in  a  delusional  way  just  trick  yourself 
 into  thinking  yeah  I'm  actually  really
[04:35] really  hard  I'm  an  alpha  male  and  girls 
 really  really  want  me  I  know  that  sounds 
 so  silly  and  I  wouldn't  say  something 
 like  that  which  is  cringe  if  it  didn't
[04:41] work  but  I  promise  you  right  now  the  guy 
 is  that  these  girls  are  actually  really 
 really  into  I'm  telling  you  those  guys
[04:46] are  thinking  this  about  themselves  those 
 guys  they  know  they're  hot  and  sometimes 
 I  see  those  guys  and  sometimes  they're
[04:51] not  even  attractive  sometimes  they're 
 genuinely  like  five  out  of  ten  six  out 
 of  ten  but  the  kind  of  aura  that  he  has
[04:56] the  belief  that  he  has  the  kind  of 
 personality  and  identity  that  he  has  is 
 absolutely  irresistible  imagine  this
[05:02] like  Chad  Dynamic  this  guy  is  an 
 ultimate  Chad  right  but  imagine  he  has  a 
 Jeffrey  mind  about  himself  imagine  he
[05:07] looks  really  attractive  he  gets  a  lot  of 
 Tinder  matches  but  imagine  he  was  like 
 really  really  insecure  and  imagine  he's
[05:12] like  really  clingy  and  really  like  weird 
 with  the  girl  you  know  his  mind  is  just 
 messed  up  but  he's  like  physically 
 attractive  well  if  he's  physically
[05:17] attractive  he'll  get  as  many  matches  on 
 Tinder  and  likes  on  Instagram  right  but 
 I'm  actually  gets  a  girlfriend  and
[05:22] imagine  how  he's  gonna  navigate  that 
 relationship  if  his  beliefs  are  all 
 negative  well  that  relationship  is  going
[05:27] to  be  very  very  toxic  and  negative  and 
 eventually  probably  end  in  heartbreak 
 isn't  it  even  if  he's  a  child  even  if
[05:32] he's  really  really  attractive  this  is 
 like  Step  Zero  it's  good  mental  health 
 about  yourself  because  honestly  no  one
[05:37] wants  to  date  someone  who  doesn't  have 
 good  mental  health  think  about  that  now 
 of  course  someone  might  want  to  date 
 someone  who's  really  attractive  and  and
[05:43] they  don't  have  good  mental  health  but 
 if  you  could  just  change  that  and 
 improve  someone's  mental  health  and  make 
 them  a  little  bit  happier  pretty  much
[05:48] every  single  person  would  say  yes  about 
 their  partner  for  that  of  course  right 
 so  then  why  are  we  walking  around  with 
 such  negative  beliefs  about  ourselves  in
[05:54] our  mind  and  I'm  wondering  why  people 
 treat  us  in  the  same  way  that  we  believe 
 you  know  this  is  getting  a  bit  deep  and
[05:59] weird  to  explain  but  it  seems  so  obvious 
 that  of  course  people  treat  us  in  a 
 certain  way  and  that's  why  we  believe
[06:04] things  about  ourselves  right  but 
 actually  more  and  more  it's  becoming 
 proven  that  it's  actually  the  opposite
[06:09] way  around  it's  not  that  people  see  us 
 and  treat  us  in  a  certain  way  so  we 
 believe  that  thing  about  ourselves  it's
[06:14] actually  that  we  believe  something  about 
 ourselves  and  then  people  treat  us  in 
 that  way  and  to  prove  this  well  you're
[06:20] treated  different  by  different  people 
 aren't  you  sometimes  you  go  to  a  new 
 place  with  so  much  more  confidence 
 because  your  belief  about  yourself  has
[06:25] changed  just  maybe  for  an  hour  and 
 people  treat  you  that  way  don't  they  but 
 then  sometimes  you've  got  the  same 
 beliefs  when  you're  around  the  same
[06:31] people  and  then  they  treat  you  that  way 
 if  how  people  treat  you  can  change  based 
 on  where  you  are  and  how  you  feel  well
[06:36] then  it  probably  is  that  your  beliefs 
 start  the  experience  first  and  then 
 people  react  to  your  beliefs  and  of
[06:42] course  it  still  works  the  other  way 
 around  100  I'm  not  saying  like  how 
 someone  treats  us  they're  never  going  to 
 change  anything  about  us  of  course  it  is
[06:47] but  it's  a  lot  more  positive  and  helpful 
 if  we  think  about  it  first  from  our 
 control  of  the  world  why  don't  we  take
[06:52] some  time  today  and  really  think  a 
 little  bit  more  positive  okay  am  I 
 attractive  to  women  yeah  you  know  what 
 yeah  yes  I  am  I  am  pretty  attractive  to
[06:58] women  look  at  all  these  positive  traits 
 that  I  have  about  myself  I'm  fairly  in 
 shape  I'm  actually  a  pretty  like  good
[07:03] guy  and  yeah  I  know  that  I'm  a  work  in 
 progress  but  that's  actually  kind  of 
 attractive  too  so  if  you  start  to  pick 
 up  on  all  of  these  positive  things  about
[07:09] yourself  and  suddenly  like  you're 
 actually  sitting  up  straight  up  with  a 
 bigger  smile  better  eye  contact  and  that 
 makes  you  more  attractive  the  truth  is
[07:15] that  women  find  anywhere  from  like  50  to 
 80  of  men  unattractive  so  there's  been
[07:20] studies  done  on  dating  apps  and  you  know 
 they  ask  women  okay  what  percentage  of 
 the  profiles  do  you  find  attractive  and
[07:25] the  answer  is  20  and  you  know  what  the 
 word  they  use  wasn't  attractive  it  was 
 actually  average  women  rated  80  of  men
[07:32] below  average  think  about  that  women 
 rated  80  of  men  below  average  that
[07:37] doesn't  mathematically  work  because 
 below  average  should  be  49  right  but 
 because  the  dating  Market  is  so  skewed
[07:42] with  you  know  everyone  can  date  online 
 so  we  see  more  options  and  then  also 
 this  psychological  sort  of  thing  that's 
 happening  to  women  especially  with  like
[07:48] there's  a  lot  of  factors  that 
 essentially  have  shown  women  the  best 
 men  of  the  entire  world  which  means  that 
 80  of  men  they're  seeing  is  below
[07:54] average  because  the  best  guy  that  a  girl 
 can  get  is  no  longer  the  guy  in  her 
 classroom  or  her  hometown  is  it  there's
[07:59] a  guy  in  a  different  country  who's  five 
 times  richer  than  all  of  her  peers  who's 
 messaging  her  if  you're  in  like  a  normal
[08:04] job  like  an  office  space  job  there's  a 
 woman  in  there  right  now  who's  speaking 
 to  a  guy  who's  makes  10  times  more
[08:09] income  per  year  than  any  of  the  guys 
 that  she  works  with  because  he's  in  a 
 different  country  right  now  this  means
[08:14] that  the  day-in  market  is  incredibly 
 competitive  so  competitive  and  a  lot  of
[08:19] guys  see  this  level  of  competition  and 
 just  kind  of  like  break  down  I  think 
 this  is  not  to  be  concerned  but  I  do
[08:24] think  this  is  like  a  symptom  of  low 
 testosterone  a  lot  of  guys  with  low 
 testosterone  see  how  competitive  the 
 dating  Market  is  and  then  just  think  oh
[08:29] no  like  I  don't  want  to  compete  I'm  just 
 going  to  play  video  games  and  watch  porn 
 and  maybe  I'll  consider  getting  like  a 
 flashlight  or  a  doll  or  something  but  if
[08:35] you  relish  this  competition  so  if  you 
 see  how  hard  it  is  for  the  day  in  market 
 for  love  for  sex  but  dating  and  you  want
[08:41] to  run  headphone  first  towards  this 
 competition  with  enough  work  maybe  two 
 years  two  years  of  focus  of  doing  the
[08:47] right  things  that  will  help  you  here  you 
 will  see  incredible  results  you  know 
 this  isn't  some  like  clickbait  lie
[08:53] because  if  it  was  a  tell  you  yeah  just 
 follow  up  with  this  program  and  then  you 
 what  there's  two  days  from  now  let's  go
[08:58] get  you  late  bro  for  most  guys  it's 
 gonna  take  about  two  years  of  hard  work 
 sacrifice  and  a  lot  of  guys  aren't 
 willing  to  take  that  because  they  say
[09:04] the  juice  isn't  worth  the  squeeze  I 
 personally  think  it  absolutely  is  I 
 think  well  I  know  by  looking  at  research
[09:09] and  investigations  and  studies  like 
 relationships  especially  the  Romantic 
 relationships  that  you  have  your  wife
[09:14] the  mother  of  your  children  is  literally 
 one  of  the  most  important  parts  of  your 
 life  so  I  think  of  course  it's  worth  the
[09:19] effort  of  course  it  is  it's  answer  the 
 question  of  the  title  of  this  video  are 
 you  attracted  to  women  it's  as  simple  as
[09:24] just  asking  how  do  women  behave  towards 
 you  I  usually  heavily  disagree  with  the 
 black  pillars  which  is  like  an  online
[09:29] community  of  guys  who  are  very  like 
 hopeless  but  there  is  one  black  pill 
 video  that  I've  watched  which  is  by  a
[09:34] YouTuber  called  wheat  waffles  and  I 
 really  really  thought  that  this  was  a 
 fantastic  way  he  said  that  no  matter
[09:39] what  another  guy  says  about  you  if 
 you're  attractive  or  not  all  what  he 
 rated  you  doesn't  matter  you  know  if  you
[09:44] are  a  sub  5  know  me  or  Chad  based  on  how 
 women  react  towards  you  you  know  some
[09:50] guy  can  rape  me  like  a  six  out  of  ten 
 for  example  this  has  happened  before  a 
 bunch  of  these  black  pillars  have  read 
 me  like  a  four  out  of  ten  which  I  swear
[09:55] I'm  higher  than  that  I  promise  but 
 they've  written  me  like  a  four  out  of 
 ten  five  out  of  ten  six  out  of  ten  but 
 what  actually  matters  is  not  what
[10:00] another  man  says  to  you  what  matters  to 
 see  if  you  are  attractive  to  women  if
[10:05] you  are  very  unattractive  normal  or  like 
 very  attractive  it's  the  C  just  simply 
 how  do  women  treat  you  most  guys  will  be
[10:11] somewhere  in  the  normal  range  which  is 
 that  yeah  they  might  over  a  couple  of 
 years  have  some  level  of  interest  from 
 some  girls  they  might  be  you  know  every
[10:17] now  and  then  texting  a  girl  who's  kind 
 of  reciprocating  it  but  sometimes  she 
 flakes  sometimes  she  like  doesn't  want 
 to  meet  them  they  might  end  up  getting
[10:22] into  like  some  kind  of  relationship  but 
 they  have  some  kind  of  problems  and  the 
 girl  in  the  relationship  with  them  isn't
[10:27] even  like  totally  devoted  to  them  most 
 guys  are  in  that  category  but  you  all 
 know  you're  in  like  the  Chad  like  high
[10:32] tier  category  when  girls  are  not 
 throwing  themselves  at  you  that's  like 
 really  high  status  if  you're  like  a 
 rapper  and  girls  are  throwing  their  bra
[10:37] to  you  I  like  from  a  lot  of  like 
 high-tier  men  it's  like  a  girl  will  walk 
 past  look  at  you  proper  smile  and
[10:42] actually  that's  her  way  of  like  cold 
 approaching  you  it's  obviously  it's 
 still  your  job  to  go  over  and  speak  to 
 her  it'll  be  easy  on  Tinder  or  Instagram
[10:48] to  message  a  girl  and  maybe  using  those 
 apps  once  a  week  or  so  it  would  meet  a 
 girl  easily  for  like  a  date  or  something 
 and  if  you're  on  the  way  or  the  end  of
[10:54] that  can  feel  very  upsetting  and  lonely 
 to  then  feel  like  what  happens  to  these 
 guys  who  are  considered  like  quite
[11:00] unattractive  which  is  that  they'll  get 
 zero  matches  a  day  on  Tinder  they'll  get 
 no  girl  barely  ever  really  smiling  at
[11:06] them  if  they  are  smiling  at  them  it's 
 kind  of  like  you  know  just  being  polite 
 instead  of  out  of  Attraction  no  matter 
 which  kind  of  group  you're  in  if  you
[11:12] just  take  a  moment  to  like  look  back 
 through  some  memories  and  just  consider 
 how  like  women  have  treated  you  have
[11:17] they  almost  avoided  you  have  they  been  a 
 little  bit  indifferent  but  maybe  there 
 are  like  you  know  the  Odd  Girl  Who  seems 
 to  be  kind  of  into  you  but  you  know
[11:23] she's  not  that  attractive  or  anything 
 like  that  or  they've  been  like  so 
 obvious  that  girls  have  been  into  and 
 you  just  know  for  a  factor  in  this  top
[11:28] tier  once  you  know  that  you  kind  of  know 
 okay  are  you  attractive  to  women  or  not 
 dance  is  kind  of  simple  honestly  a  lot
[11:33] of  guys  are  a  little  bit  confused  with 
 this  concept  but  the  answer  is  very 
 simple  once  you  get  hit  with  some  brutal 
 truths  we've  been  told  by  so  many  people
[11:40] the  system  The  Matrix  a  woman's 
 attraction  is  unclear  oh  there's  subtle
[11:45] signs  to  her  attraction  towards  you  no 
 there  was  one  post  on  the  old  red  pill 
 subreddit  that  changed  my  life  forever
[11:51] and  it  was  titled  you  are  not  her  top 
 option  and  maybe  I'll  make  a  whole  video 
 about  this  one  post  because  it  just  it
[11:56] was  so  common  sense  but  I  kind  of  needed 
 to  hear  it  I'll  just  go  very  briefly 
 because  I  think  I'll  make  a  whole  video
[12:01] about  this  and  it  just  said  you  are  not 
 her  top  option  when  you're  there 
 neurotically  checking  your  phone 
 WhatsApp  messages  to  see  okay  she's  not
[12:07] replied  yet  she  was  online  after  I  sent 
 that  message  but  so  she  didn't  click  on 
 the  message  why  she  not  replied  and  you 
 know  you're  overthinking  about  if  she's
[12:13] going  to  reply  or  not  or  your  other 
 thing  and  if  she's  gonna  come  to  the 
 date  or  not  you've  sent  her  the  message 
 like  oh  hey  excited  to  see  you  later  at
[12:18] 7pm  you're  gonna  come  right  and  she's 
 not  replied  just  yet  you're  getting  a 
 bit  paranoid  you're  not  her  top  option
[12:23] because  if  you  are  her  top  option  if  she 
 is  attracted  to  you  bro  trust  me  you 
 will  know  I've  even  seen  online  even  in 
 like  the  sort  of  pickup  communities  that
[12:29] yeah  a  woman's  attraction  is  really 
 subtle  honestly  no  if  she's  into  you  you 
 will  know  you  don't  need  a  video  like
[12:34] this  because  people  have  told  you  that 
 oh  yeah  yeah  you  know  she  might  be  into 
 you  but  she'll  never  show  it  trust  me 
 bro  when  she's  into  a  guy  she  shows  it
[12:40] sometimes  she'll  message  the  guy  first 
 saying  oh  hey  Alexa  what  are  you  doing 
 tonight  whatever  conditioning 
 brainwashing  that  we've  propaganda  that
[12:46] we've  been  through  as  led  us  to  this 
 moments  where  you  need  a  video  to  just 
 walk  through  like  oh  yeah  like  if  she's
[12:51] into  you  you'll  see  her  attraction 
 physically  she'll  hold  eye  contact  with 
 you  a  lot  more  she'll  be  nicer  to  you
[12:56] she'll  smile  when  you're  around  her 
 she'll  touch  you  of  course  those  are 
 symbols  of  her  attraction  towards  you 
 and  like  we've  been  told  like  no  no  that
[13:02] doesn't  mean  she's  attracted  to  you 
 actually  she  could  be  attracted  to  you 
 just  in  an  invisible  way  just  wait  10 
 more  years  and  you'll  find  out  the  guy
[13:07] who  she's  attracted  to  right  now  she's 
 laughing  at  his  joke  that  wasn't  even 
 funny  and  like  touching  his  arm  as  she
[13:12] laughs  if  she's  doing  that  to  you  she's 
 probably  maybe  into  you  she's  not  doing 
 that  to  you  she's  probably  not  into  you
[13:17] I'm  sorry  if  this  hurts  but  sometimes 
 you  need  like  a  little  bit  of  like  a 
 slap  in  the  face  of  reality  because 
 honestly  when  I  was  15  16  like  I  needed
[13:23] this  there  I  am  double  texting  the  same 
 girl  again  she's  giving  me  one  word 
 replies  and  I'm  still  trying  to  think
[13:28] yeah  yeah  obviously  because  she's 
 texting  me  back  she  really  likes  me 
 right  one  little  bonus  thing  I'll  just 
 give  you  one  of  the  things  I've  learned
[13:33] from  like  my  experience  with  women  just 
 because  she  texts  you  or  snapchatts  you
[13:38] or  sends  you  DMS  on  Instagram  just 
 because  she  does  that  does  not  actually 
 mean  that  she's  been  to  you  it's  quite
[13:43] harsh  for  me  to  say  this  but  there  are 
 actually  a  lot  of  women  out  there 
 honestly  I  think  most  women  just  like  to
[13:48] get  notifications  on  their  phone 
 honestly  most  people  I  think  almost  all 
 people  like  to  get  notifications  on
[13:53] their  phone  because  you  know  triggers 
 like  this  dopamine  thing  inside  of  us 
 and  it  feels  good  to  see  like  oh  we  got 
 lots  of  messages  oh  yes  I  am  worthy  of
[13:58] lover  she  likes  getting  texts  on  her 
 phone  and  so  yeah  she'll  reply  to  you 
 and  you'll  be  like  oh  yeah  she  replied
[14:03] oh  oh  she  replied  okay  it  took  her  seven 
 minutes  to  reply  so  I'm  gonna  reply  in 
 for  14  minutes  yeah  I'm  I'm  in  chat  bro
[14:09] she  replies  to  everyone  some  slower  than 
 others  some  faster  than  others  what  I've 
 seen  especially  with  a  bit  of  the
[14:14] younger  girls  I'm  25  so  you  know  what 
 I've  seen  with  like  20  year  olds  or  18 
 year  olds  21  year  olds  is  that  they  will
[14:19] reply  to  guys  they're  not  even 
 interested  in  if  you  ask  them  they'll 
 say  oh  yeah  we're  just  friends  and
[14:24] they'll  just  string  them  along 
 essentially  you  know  they'll  speak  and 
 maybe  that  guy  will  invite  her  to  do
[14:29] something  and  she'll  say  oh  yeah  let's 
 do  it  and  then  the  same  day  or  you  know 
 the  day  that  they've  organized  to  do 
 something  the  guy  will  text  like  hey
[14:35] you're  still  good  for  today  and  she'll 
 be  like  oh  no  sorry  I've  got  to  do 
 something  but  like  oh  let's  do  Friday 
 instead  and  the  guy  said  okay  you  know 
 she  flakes  but  like  Fridays  you  know  she
[14:41] she  said  Friday  so  that's  good  yeah  I'm 
 gonna  see  your  Friday  I'm  gonna  see  on 
 Friday  guys  I'm  gonna  see  you  on  Friday 
 and  then  Friday  rolls  around  hey  hey  so
[14:47] you're  good  for  Friday  at  6pm  and  she's 
 like  oh  my  God  no  I  forgot  about  this 
 thing  my  dad  died
[14:52] I don't  know  fair  enough 
 guys  so  this  Saturday  okay  he's  just 
 getting  stronger  long  strung  along  to
[14:57] live  reach  the  60-day  Snapchat  streak 
 there  was  a  picture  bro  this  is  rental 
 in  Mama  there  was  a  picture  I  took  this
[15:02] girl's  phone  once  right  so  we're  sat  in 
 the  back  of  the  car  at  night  time 
 playing  cards  right  I  took  her  phone  and
[15:07] I  remember  she  was  on  Snapchat  and  there 
 were  so  many  guys  I'm  playing  around 
 with  her  like  wrestling  her  in  the  back
[15:12] of  the  car  whilst  we're  playing  cards 
 and  eventually  I  imagine  you  know  how 
 the  back  of  the  car  looks  right  so  you 
 sit  here  and  there's  kind  of  like  space
[15:17] between  your  legs  to  the  front  shirt  I 
 kind  of  like  throw  her  into  that  space 
 and  she's  like  stuck  a  bit  and  I've  like
[15:22] pushed  it  down  with  my  legs  and  I'm 
 starting  to  like  look  at  how  many  guys 
 she's  been  in  40  days  Snapchat  streaks
[15:27] 50-day  Snapchat  streaks  and  I'm  just 
 thinking  about  like  she's  stringing 
 along  all  these  guys  who  genuinely  think
[15:32] like  they're  so  close  to  being  in  a 
 relationship  with  her  and  maybe  I 
 shouldn't  have  done  this  to  like  hurt 
 those  guys  feelings  but  they  kind  of
[15:37] needed  to  see  this  I  didn't  send  anyone 
 like  a  message  or  anything  but  I  just 
 took  a  picture  and  put  it  onto  her
[15:42] Snapchat  story  of  her  in  the  back  of  the 
 car  down  like  where  your  feet  would 
 normally  be  so  like  press  down  there
[15:47] with  my  foot  on  her  head  with  a  picture 
 like  captured  like  she's  in  timeout  and 
 still  when  those  guys  saw  that  picture
[15:54] with  the  girl  that  they  had  a  40-day 
 Snapchat  streak  with  with  a  brown  like 
 leg  and  a  foot  on  her  head  pushing  her
[16:00] down  with  like  a  funny  caption  saying 
 she's  inside  mouth  still  kept  on 
 speaking  to  her  developing  feelings  for
[16:05] her  a  lot  of  guys  just  are  so  delusional 
 I  imagine  seeing  like  your  crush  post
[16:10] something  like  that  and  when  she  tells 
 you  I  know  it's  just  my  friend  and 
 you're  like  okay  it's  just  her  friend  we
[16:15] weren't  friends  bro  even  if  you  don't 
 want  to  be  a  degenerate  you  know  this 
 was  like  casual  sex  stuff  so  it's  not 
 good  for  you  or  anything  but  even  if  you
[16:20] don't  want  to  be  like  a  degenerate  or 
 anything  like  that  the  thing  is  you  kind 
 of  want  to  be  that  guy  on  the  other  side
[16:25] of  the  phone  like  in  my  position  of  like 
 being  that  guy  who's  got  you  don't  want 
 to  be  the  guy  who's  that  got  his  foot  on
[16:30] her  head  and  that's  kind  of 
 disrespectful  but  you  want  to  be  that 
 guy  who's  on  the  other  side  who  she's 
 meeting  up  well  this  40-day  SnapChat
[16:35] streak  Journey  that  they've  had  together 
 you  want  to  be  the  guy  who  she's  meeting 
 up  and  actually  being  intimate  with  and
[16:40] getting  closer  with  you  do  not  want  to 
 be  the  guy  on  the  other  side  of  the 
 screen  waiting  for  her  to  reply  and 
 opening  up  a  story  kind  of  like  a  late
[16:46] night  thing  of  like  wait  what's 
 happening  here  it's  like  oh  man  she's  oh 
 she's  with  a  guy  no  no  oh  oh  she  said 
 it's  just  friends  oh  okay  okay  when
[16:52] you're  her  top  option  you'll  know  when 
 you're  attracted  to  women  you'll  know  if 
 it  isn't  100  clear  to  you  then  you're
[16:58] not  and  I  know  that  sucks  to  hear  and  I 
 know  that  that  will  hurt  a  lot  of  young 
 men's  feelings  watching  this  like  that
[17:03] pain  that  level  of  like  disgust 
 resentments  annoyance  that  you  feel 
 right  now  can  be  used  so  productively  to
[17:09] eventually  not  quickly  but  eventually 
 get  to  that  point  where  you  are  actually 
 attracted  to  women  and  there's  multiple
[17:14] things  to  do  one  analyze  your  beliefs 
 but  two  be  physically  more  attractive  I 
 have  a  40  minute  Lux  maxing  guide  on  how
[17:20] to  actually  like  literally  physically 
 look  better  and  that's  very  important 
 because  as  much  as  I  like  to  talk  about 
 the  psychological  things  the  truth  is
[17:25] how  you  physically  look  is  going  to 
 determine  how  many  matches  you  get  on 
 Tinder  how  many  DMS  gets  open  on
[17:30] Instagram  or  how  many  like  good  pictures 
 you  can  take  and  you  get  more  likes  and 
 all  this  and  yeah  of  course  all  of  this 
 is  like  online  dating  it's  not  good  for
[17:36] you  but  this  is  the  way  that  a  lot  of 
 girls  do  kind  of  like  look  at  you  these 
 days  they  look  at  you  online  even  then
[17:41] if  you've  lost  Max  you  look  better  in 
 person  anyway  so  maybe  you'll  want  to  go 
 watch  that  full  guide  let's  listen  to 
 some  words  from  Adonis  about  this  the
[17:47] average  man  lacks  ambition  drive  and 
 masculinity  women  simply  aren't 
 attracted  to  that  men  of  old  we're
[17:53] strong  they  dangerous  and  driven  that  is 
 what  women  want  in  a  man  if  you  can
[17:58] watch  this  video  right  now  do  the  hard 
 work  especially  when  you  don't  feel  like 
 it

4HasHl8N1hc,"[00:00] jeffrey's  phone  notification  goes  off 
 again  it's  her 
 he's  so  happy  that  she's  replying  she
[00:05] seems  so  interested  in  him 
 jeffrey's  finally  happy  but  she  keeps
[00:10] making  excuses  not  to  meet  him 
 jeffrey  sees  her  snapchat  story  and  and 
 she's  with  another  guy
[00:15] it's  been  weeks  it's  been  months  and 
 eventually  the  girl  that  jeffrey's  been 
 texting  gets  into  a  relationship  with
[00:20] the  guy  that  she's  been  [ __ ]  all  this 
 time 
 adonis  adonis  texts  girls  in  the  proper
[00:26] way  adonis  is  the  guy  in  the  girl's 
 snapchat  stories 
 and  he's  the  only  one  in  her  mind
[00:48] [Music]
[00:54] all  of  the  advice  that  i  see  online  for 
 texting  girls  is  absolute  trash  normal 
 simpy  little  spurgy  people  tell  you  to
[01:00] do  meme  sensing  her  memes  make  her  laugh 
 ugh  and  the  red  pills  alpha  males  text 
 game
[01:05] is  is  too  avoidant  it  doesn't  kill  a 
 connection  and  it's  too  much 
 it  just  only  focuses  on  texting  for
[01:11] logistics  both  ways  are  trash  i'm  going 
 to  teach  you  my  way  which  is  far  better 
 than  all  of  them  first  of  all  my  name  is 
 hamza
[01:16] i  help  young  men  go  through  the  jeffree 
 2  adonis  transformation  through 
 self-improvement  you're  clearly 
 interested  in  that  scroll  down  right  now
[01:22] click  on  the  subscribe  and  the  post 
 notification  button  and  it's  a  win-win 
 for  both  of  us  so  i  have  personally
[01:27] tried  all  the  different  styles  of 
 texting  when  i  was  in  college  and  i  was 
 about  17  to  18  i  was  doing  the  whole
[01:33] funny  memes  message  her  all  day  make  her 
 feel  good  and  and  send  her  like  all  the 
 funny  stuff  and  make  jokes  with  her
[01:38] and  text  her  and  write  x  next  to  the 
 message  and  stuff  when  i  was  in 
 university  and  i  was  going  through  my 
 degenerate  years  i  was  doing  the  full  on
[01:45] just  read  a  pill  text  for  logistics  my 
 first  message  to  a  new  girl  with  deadass 
 be 
 meet  me  tonight  and  so  it  was  a  numbers
[01:51] game  and  and  it  did  technically  work  but 
 not 
 as  effective  as  my  current  way  to  text
[01:56] my  current  way  to  text  i'd  say  the  most 
 mature  way  that  i've  actually  been  a  guy 
 who  uses  text  to  communicate
[02:01] is  i  i  text  in  a  very  like  business 
 somewhat  formal  manner  but  i  also  send
[02:08] emotional  connecting  messages  to  and 
 we're  gonna  break  that  down  so  here 
 is  the  step-by-step  strategy  to  turn  a
[02:14] stranger 
 into  a  lover  step  number  one  is  the 
 initial  connection 
 it's  when  you  match  with  a  girl  on  a
[02:20] dating  app  it's  when  you  maybe  she 
 follows 
 you  on  instagram  or  when  you  approach 
 her  and  you  get  her  number  step  number
[02:25] two  is  the  first  message  that  you're 
 going  to  send  her 
 and  it's  a  simple  hi  plus  a  genuine 
 compliment  now  all  the
[02:30] although  the  red  pill  guys  especially 
 i've  never  complimented  them  never 
 never  validate  her  bro  i  don't  give  a
[02:35] [ __ ]  bro  if  i  think  a  girl 
 is  cute  i'm  going  to  tell  her  that 
 authenticity  and  that  genuine
[02:41] genuine  indianity  is  why  i'm  attractive 
 and  why  i  seem  confident 
 i'm  not  going  to  hold  back  if  i  feel  a
[02:47] certain  way  about  someone  i'm  not  going 
 to  hold  back  and  telling  them  forget  the 
 rest  of  this  video  forget  most  of  the 
 advice  you've  ever  seen  in  terms  of
[02:52] interacting  with  women  when  your  brain 
 generates  a  thought  and  you  don't 
 express  that  thought  you've  already  lost
[02:57] that  authenticity 
 is  how  you  automatically  polarize  women 
 the  women  who  would  actually  be
[03:03] compatible  with  you 
 that's  all  you  need  to  know  like  i  could 
 end  the  video  right  here  text  out  what 
 your  brain  says  if  your  brain  says  some
[03:08] stupid 
 trust  me  when  i  say  that  if  you  actually 
 texted  that  sort  of  stuff  to  every  girl
[03:13] you  would  eventually  find  the  girl  who 
 who  truly  truly  is  compatible  with  you 
 all  of  the  texan  advice  is  such  trash
[03:19] because  it's  too  different  from  what 
 your  natural  brain 
 is  like  and  so  eventually  you  start
[03:24] matching  with  girls  for  your  nothing 
 like  and  of  course  that  just  kind  of 
 dies  down  because  you  can't  keep  up  this 
 false  like  charade  so  in  this  first
[03:30] message  it's  just  a  simple  hi 
 hey  whatever  and  a  genuine  compliment 
 that  my  brain 
 automatically  generates  for  her  i'm
[03:36] telling  you  this  is  the  reason  why  i 
 seem  spontaneous  and  attractive 
 i  have  the  confidence  to  just  express
[03:41] how  i  feel  about  someone  and  if 
 if  she's  anything  like  me  if  she's 
 compatible  with  me  she's  attracted  to
[03:46] that 
 step  number  three  after  your  first 
 message  this  is  this  is  one  of  the  most 
 important  parts  of  this
[03:51] is  to  not  let  her  lead  the  conversation 
 now  let's  say 
 you  send  the  message  hi  you're  cute  very
[03:57] very  simple  right  and  she  says  oh  hi 
 thank  you  her 
 how  are  you  pause  jeffrey's  and  all  of 
 those  perks  will  be  like
[04:03] i  i'm  good  how  are  you  conversation  dead 
 she  thinks  you're  boring
[04:08] most  girls  are  boring  most  girls  are  bad 
 like  we  can  say  they're  bad  at  texting 
 because  they  don't  actually  have  to  be 
 good  at  texting  because  they've  got  the
[04:13] god  level  abundance 
 most  girls  are  pretty  boring  and  they've 
 got  very  very  basic  social  skills  you
[04:18] can  call  me  sexist  but  it  is  the  truth 
 she's  going  to  text  you  some  boring 
 [ __ ]  it's  like  hey 
 how  are  you  now  if  you're  a  sperg  if
[04:24] you're  a  jeffrey 
 let  her  lead  the  conversation  and  reply 
 to  her  questions  now 
 i  text  in  almost  a  weirdly  autistic  way
[04:31] no  it  is  a  business  you  know  formal  way 
 emotional  connection  like  i  said  before 
 but  it's  almost  autistic  in  the  sense 
 that
[04:36] when  she  texts  me  a  message  like  how  are 
 you  i  respond  as  if  i  haven't  even  read 
 that  she's  wrote  that  because  i  will
[04:41] not  let  her  lead  the  conversation 
 straight  into  the  garbage 
 i  don't  answer  boring  questions  like
[04:46] that  she  texts  me  hey  hamza 
 how  are  you  what's  it  to  you  [ __ ]  why 
 are you  asking  me  for  personal
[04:51] information  i'm  not  telling  you  so  keep 
 that  in  mind  and  then  step  four  is  that 
 you  lead  the  conversation  to  where  you
[04:56] want  it  which  it  should  be 
 to  meet  up  within  a  maximum  of  a  couple 
 of  days  if  you  cannot  meet  up
[05:01] i  don't  really  respect  you  personally 
 i'm  just  going  to  give  you  my  personal 
 opinion  here  if  you  can't  meet  her
[05:06] within  a  few  days  chances  are  you  are 
 very  low  value  and  you're  texting  her 
 because
[05:11] she's  the  only  girl  that  you  currently 
 can  get  and  so  oh  you  know  she  lives  in 
 a  different  country  and 
 and  um  you  can't  see  her  for  three  weeks
[05:17] or  whatever  it  kind  of  shows  me 
 at  least  and  it  shows  everyone  else  and 
 it  shows  you  and  it  shows  her  that  you
[05:22] don't  exactly  have 
 much  respect  for  yourself  because  you 
 didn't  want  a  texting  body  did  you  you
[05:27] wanted  to  connect  with  this  girl  and 
 quite  frankly  especially  for  men 
 even  for  women  the  physical  elements  of
[05:33] our  relationship  with  a  woman  and  our 
 love  of  the  woman  is 
 incredibly  important  and  if  you  cannot
[05:38] meet  her  within  a  few  days 
 it  just  dies  so  in  step  four  you  are 
 going  to  lead  the  conversation  to  where
[05:43] you  want  it  which  is  to  organize  a  date 
 within  the  next  few  days 
 and  so  let's  talk  about  that  date  so 
 step  five  is  to  structure  this  date  and
[05:50] it's  going  to  be  something  specifically 
 that  you  were  going  to  do  anyway  that 
 makes  it  incredibly  easy  and  also  more
[05:56] attractive  to  invite  this  girl  to  do 
 that  and  this  is  where  the  sexiness  of 
 this  guide  goes  away  and  all  the  spurgs
[06:01] will  start  getting  disinterested  because 
 they  don't  do  anything  fun  that's  like 
 that  that's  the  sad  fact  is
[06:06] if  you're  only  doing  fun  stuff  if  you're 
 only  planning  fun  stuff  when  you  meet 
 with  a  girl  and  if  you  probably  don't
[06:11] even  do  fun  stuff  with  girls 
 then  you're  not  going  to  be  attractive 
 anyway  this  is  why  most  young  guys  are 
 so  repulsive  to  women  because  you  don't
[06:17] do  anything  of  them  watch  these  dumb 
 self-improvement  videos  what  are you 
 going  to  texas  go  like  hey  do  you  want 
 to  watch  hamza's  new
[06:22] new  video  like  that  that  would  be  a 
 basically  i'm  not  going  to  lie  but 
 she  wants  to  enter  your  life  she  doesn't
[06:27] want  your  life 
 to  be  changed  because  of  her  so  you 
 should  already  be  doing  fun
[06:33] cool  adventurous  stuff  but  the  thing  is 
 you  don't  that's  why  you're  watching 
 this  type 
 autistic  level  video  right  now  how  to
[06:38] text  girls  if  you  were  doing  fun  stuff 
 you  wouldn't  need  this  guide  but  my 
 videos  are  for  jefferies  and  so  i  will
[06:43] help  you  through  this  okay  what  you  need 
 to  start  doing  which  is  stupid  like 
 basic  ass  advice  they're  gonna  get 
 pissed  off  at  you  have  to  leave  your
[06:48] house  and  actually  go  try  new  things 
 like  how  many  times  have  you  heard  that 
 piece  of 
 one  piece  of  advice  from  your  mother  and
[06:53] from  me  try 
 new  things  like  it's  a  simple  i'll  give 
 you  the  basic  autistic  level
[06:59] help  here  it's  as  simple  as  going  onto 
 google  going  onto  google  maps  maybe  and 
 just  seeing  a  few  different  places
[07:04] around  you 
 oh  there's  a  there's  a  bar  over  here 
 there's  a  park  over  here  there's  a 
 comedy  club  here  that's  what  you're
[07:10] going  to  invite  her  to  but  first 
 you're  going  to  go  to  those  places 
 anyway  and  so  for  step  five  how  you're
[07:15] gonna  invite  her  onto  the  date  this  is 
 the  message  you're  gonna  send 
 i'm  going  to  do  x  would  you  like  to  join
[07:20] me  that's  instantly 
 ten  times  more  attractive  than  the 
 standards  that  guy  said  which  is  like  oh 
 do  you  wanna 
 do  when  i  hang  out  sometimes  you  wanna
[07:26] netflix  and  chill  do  you wanna  like 
 do  do  something  now  step  six  in  cases 
 she  wasn't  very
[07:31] extremely  responsive  to  that  and  she 
 didn't  immediately  say  yes  is  to 
 rearrange  the  date  a  couple  of  times
[07:36] i'll  leave  it  up  to  you  i  would  suggest 
 once  a 
 maximum  of  three  times  that  if  she  says
[07:42] oh  uh  i  can't  do  that  or  i'm  not  really 
 into  that  she  mostly  she'll  say  oh  i'm 
 sorry  i  can't  do  um
[07:47] friday  night  and  so  you  say  okay  no 
 worries  what's  your  schedule  looking 
 like 
 she  should  make  it  easy  for  you  to  get
[07:52] this  date  booked  in  if  it  feels 
 difficult  to  get  it  booked  in 
 she's  not  really  that  interested  in  you
[07:57] and  if  you  do  somehow  like  trick  her 
 into 
 coming  out  on  the  day  she's  going  to  be 
 like  the  type  of  girl  because  she's  not
[08:02] interested  in  you  she's  not  even 
 attracted  to  you  she's  just  going  to  be 
 on  our  phone  whilst 
 you're  out  together  you  only  want  to  be
[08:07] meeting  girls  who  actually  are  really 
 attracted  to  you  which  is  again  this 
 unsexy  answer
[08:12] because  you  have  to  go  and  do  a  few 
 years  of  self-improvement  first  before 
 women  are  actually  attracted  to  you  and 
 all  the  black  people's  bugs  like
[08:17] what  about  genetics  what  about  oh  what 
 about  looks  how  your  navel  can  voltage 
 shut  up  so  after  you've  tried  to  book  in
[08:22] a  date  let's  say  two 
 to  one  to  three  times  if  it's  still  not 
 working  cut  your  losses  stop  messaging
[08:27] her 
 maybe  potentially  in  like  a  month  when 
 you  randomly  see  the  messages  again 
 because  you've  been  scrolling  down  your
[08:32] phone  for  some  reason 
 maybe  send  another  message  then  and  go 
 from  there  but  generally  if  i  can't  get
[08:37] a  date  booked  for  the  same  week  i  know 
 that  we're  never  gonna  meet  and  it's 
 easier  for  me  to  just  kind  of 
 forget  this  girl  exists  then  to  continue
[08:43] trying  to  set  it  up  for  the  future 
 so  step  seven  is  like  the  date  is  now 
 booked  you're  planning  to  meet
[08:48] at  you  know  7  p.m  on  friday  up  until 
 then 
 every  now  and  then  when  your  your  brain
[08:53] expresses  it  to  you 
 you're  now  going  to  send  what  i  just 
 call  emotional  connection
[08:58] texts  which  is  a  simple  at  this  stage 
 let's  say  you  know  you've  just  kind  of 
 met  this  girl  through  a  dating  app  and
[09:03] you  spoke  to  her  literally  just  10 
 messages 
 it's  as  simple  as  just  randomly  the  next 
 day  just  texting  are  like
[09:08] excited  to  see  you  tomorrow  as  simple  as 
 that  it's  it's  something 
 that  if  you  feel  that  way  text  her
[09:14] because  it  makes  people  feel  good  when 
 you  do  this  and  think  about  it  for 
 yourself  if  a  girl  texted  you  like  that 
 you  would  feel  awesome  now  if  a  girl  has
[09:20] actually  booked  a  date  with  you  and 
 she's  going  to  meet  you 
 she's  attracted  to  you  she's  interested
[09:25] in  you  she  likes  something  about  you  now 
 if 
 she  considers  you  somewhat  high  value 
 she's  like  she  doesn't  know  you  like  i 
 do  i  know  you're  a  spoke  but
[09:31] and  that  means  that  if  you  send  her  one 
 of  these  like  emotional  connecting  text 
 messages  it's
[09:36] actually  going  to  make  her  feel  good  and 
 all  the  the 
 like  the  pill  guys  black  pill  red  pill
[09:41] whatever  all  these  like  little  weirdly 
 internet  people  will  disagree  with  me 
 and  say  no  no  don't  make  us  feel  good
[09:46] whatever  but  why  not  make  someone  feel 
 good  especially  the  thing  is  if  she's 
 into  you  which  if
[09:51] she's  got  to  be  if  she's  booking  like 
 you  know  she  can  book  the  date  and  i 
 obviously  like  have  other  guys  booked 
 and  not  meet  you  and  stuff  but  we're
[09:56] gonna  assume  that  she's  into  us  because 
 it's  only  way  that  we  can 
 truly  operate  if  she's  into  you  then  why
[10:01] not  make  her  feel  good  so  up  until 
 you're  gonna  meet  maybe  you'll  send  one 
 to  two  messages  per  day  which  is  just 
 kind  of  like  this  emotional  connection
[10:07] you're  not  gonna  send 
 funny  memes  or  anything  or  stuff  to  try 
 and  make  her  laugh  it's  only  about 
 building  up  a  little  bit  of  a  connection
[10:13] where  you  just  kind  of  express  what  your 
 brain  is  genuinely  saying  about  her 
 so  in  your  mind  through  the  next  day
[10:18] you'll  get  a  thing  like  oh 
 i'm  meeting  her  meeting  that  girl  on 
 friday  you  can  literally  just
[10:23] like  tell  her  i  just  got  this  thought  in 
 my  mind  like  oh  oh  i  mean  that  girl  on 
 fridays  that  is
[10:28] authentic  now  straight  away  all  the  guys 
 will  disagree  with  me  again  but  the 
 thing  is 
 if  that  is  the  type  of  person  you  are  if
[10:33] that  is  what  your  brain  if  that  is  what 
 you  have  genuinely  thought 
 then  if  you  express  that  genuine  thought
[10:40] you  will 
 filter  out  anyone  who's  not  compatible 
 with  you  so  if  you  let's  say  you  send  it 
 to  like  a  bad  [ __ ]
[10:45] and  she's  like  wait  this  guy  is  kind  of 
 weird  like  he's  he's  sending  me  these 
 these  loving 
 lovey-dovey  texts  but  like  i  usually
[10:51] just  sleep  with  guys  who 
 who  spit  in  my  mouth  well  then  you're 
 clearly  not  compatible  with  her  as  men 
 you  have  to  realize  that  we  still  need
[10:56] standards  and  the  standards  that  we  need 
 because  we  would  sleep  with 
 anyone  the  standards  that  we  need  is
[11:02] that  we  will  only  want  to  continue 
 things  with  girls  who  are  gen 
 who  are  attracted  to  our  genuine
[11:07] authenticity 
 like  that's  the  standard  if  you  if  you 
 show  your  authentic  self
[11:12] and  a  woman  isn't  attracted  to  that  then 
 she  isn't  up  to  your  standard  so  step 
 eight  of  this  texting  process  is  then  to
[11:18] meet  for  the  day  to  have  a  fun  time 
 maybe  you'll  even  sleep  with  her 
 and  especially  if  you  do  sleep  with  or 
 even  if  if  you  just  kind  of  connect  in
[11:24] any  other  way  here  right  now  is  when 
 it's  very  important  to  express  that  same 
 type  of  texting  behavior  that  you've
[11:29] been  doing 
 so  let's  say  you  meet  for  the  day  you 
 have  a  good  time  after  that  you're  still 
 going  to  text  an  exact  same  somewhat
[11:35] business 
 formal  manner  with  also  the  emotional 
 connecting  text  in  between  so  the 
 business  formal  manner  is  how  you  get
[11:41] the  dates  booked 
 and  the  emotional  connection  text  is  how 
 you  just  kind  of  express  how  you're 
 feeling  about  her
[11:46] it's  so  important  to  do  those  emotional 
 texts  because  that  is  how  you  filter  out 
 the  women  who  are  actually 
 for  you  so  this  texting  strategy  kind  of
[11:53] like  cringy  insult  to  color  strategy  but 
 if  that's  what  it  is  it  is  it  invokes 
 your  honesty  your  authenticity  and  your
[11:59] confidence  and  that's  why  it  works 
 that's  why  it  works  better  than  every 
 other  guy  that  i've 
 personally  followed  let's  go  through
[12:05] some  frequently  asked  questions  now  the 
 best  question  that  you  could  ask  which 
 no  one  asks 
 is  what  is  the  best  mindset  that  i
[12:11] should  hold  when  texting  girls 
 if  you  can  get  the  mindset  nailed  down 
 honestly  you'll  be  successful  but  no  one
[12:16] asks  about  that 
 everyone's  like  oh  which  meme  should  i 
 send  how  should  i  send  her  a  message 
 three  days  or  five  days  later
[12:22] 17  minutes  so  no  just  shut  up  bro  the 
 mindset  is  all  that  matters  what  is  the 
 best  mindset  that  you  can  have  it's
[12:27] number  one  to  know  that  for  men  it  is 
 always  a  numbers  game  which  means  that 
 in  the  beginning  stages  you  need  quite  a
[12:33] low  emotional  investment  into  this  one 
 particular  girl  you  need  to  convey 
 abundance
[12:38] what  that  means  is  that  you  either  need 
 to  have  other  women  in  your  life 
 or  you  need  to  pretend  like  you  have
[12:44] other  women  in  your  life  you  need  to 
 just  kind  of  like  act 
 like  you  do  the  reason  for  this  mindset
[12:49] is  because  quite  frankly 
 you're  not  going  to  meet  up  99  of  the
[12:54] girls  that  you  ever  interact  with  let's 
 just  be  honest 
 99  of  the  girls  that  you  you  match  with 
 on  tinder  that  you  meet  in  public  and
[13:00] whatever  you 
 you're  never  actually  going  to  meet  them 
 you're  probably  going  to  be  about  one 
 percent  of  them  because  put  it  this  way
[13:05] you've you've  come  across  probably 
 hundreds  probably  thousands 
 of  girls  on  social  media  day  in  apps  and 
 everything  and  how  many  girls  have  you
[13:11] actually  like  truly  truly  met  up 
 over  the  last  few  years  probably  like 
 tens  right 
 so  it's  about  one  percent  and  so  you
[13:18] need  to  have  that  in  mind  that  there  is 
 about  a  one  percent  chance  that  you  meet 
 this  girl  and  don't  let  that  you  know 
 kind  of  like  depress  you  or  anything
[13:23] just  think  to  yourself  okay 
 there's  probably  a  one  percent  chance 
 like  i'm  not  really  gonna  care  so  much 
 right  now  you  still  if  you  end  up  you
[13:29] know 
 thinking  about  her  then  you're  gonna 
 express  that  thought  but  you're  also 
 gonna  think  yeah  there  was  a  one  percent
[13:34] chance  anyway  so  if  she  for  example 
 ignores  your  message  or  she  says  you 
 know  she  can't  meet  you  whatever  she's 
 not
[13:39] interested  in  you  there's  only  a  one 
 percent  chance  you're  gonna  meet  her 
 anyway  so  you  just  get  on  to  the  next 
 one  and  the  second  probably  more
[13:44] important  mindset  that  you  should  really 
 really  note  down  is  that  girls  just  want 
 to  have  fun 
 girls  go  where  the  fun  is  now  if  you're
[13:50] living  a  fun  life 
 girls  will  automatically  enter  your  life 
 now  if  you're  trying  to  have
[13:55] fun  through  texts  girls  will 
 automatically  leave  your  life 
 she  can't  be  your  fun  she  has  to  be
[14:01] invited 
 into  the  fun  again  this  is  why  most 
 young  guys  are  terrible  with  girls
[14:06] because  you're  not  actually  living  a  fun 
 life  you're  not  actually  doing  anything 
 like  good  with  your  life  quite  frankly
[14:11] you're  trying  to  have  fun 
 texting  girls  girls  don't  want  to  have 
 fun  texting  they  just  want  to  enter 
 an  already  fun  lifestyle  the  second
[14:17] probably  most  asked  question  is  how 
 often  should  i  text  how  long  should  i 
 wait 
 between  my  text  that  tells  me  you're  a
[14:22] bit  of  a  sperg  and  you're  just 
 overthinking  it  when  you  see  her  message 
 and  you're  currently  in  a  personal  life
[14:28] mood  reply 
 so  what  i  mean  by  personal  life  is  that 
 you're  currently  not  for  example
[14:33] studying  you're  currently  not  for 
 example  working  so  in  my  specific 
 example 
 i'm  i'm  working  i'm  doing  my  business
[14:38] work  till  probably  about  five 
 till  eight  pm  or  something  and  i'm  in 
 business  mode  for  my  business  i  go  on  to
[14:43] whatsapp  a  lot  to  message  my  clients 
 and  whatsapp  is  generally  where  i  also 
 message  girls  too  i  will  see  her  message
[14:49] and  i  won't  reply  because  i'm  not 
 currently  in  a  personal  life  mode  but  as 
 soon  as  i'm  in  a  personal  life  mode  and
[14:54] she  sent  me  a  message 
 i'm  gonna  reply  don't  do  the  the 
 internet  of  like  oh  double  her  time  and
[14:59] and  stuff  because 
 it  takes  away  from  your  authenticity  now 
 preferably
[15:04] you're  already  like  too  busy  to  be 
 replying  quickly  now  if  you  see  her 
 message  all  the  time  and  you're  if
[15:09] you're 
 almost  always  in  a  personal  life  mode  to 
 the  point  that  you  feel  like  you  can 
 reply  constantly
[15:14] that  shows  me  that  you're  a  loser  and 
 that  shows  me  that  you've  got  bigger 
 problems  than 
 learning  how  to  text  if  it  sounds  like
[15:19] you  you're  probably  getting  pissed  off 
 that  i  just  insulted  you  you  should 
 consider  a  dopamine  detox  and  it  will 
 change  your  life  but 
 i  think  you're  probably  not  going  to  do
[15:25] that  because  you  sound  like  a  spur  third 
 very  important  question  is  what  if  we 
 can't  meet  because  of 
 x  what  if  we  can't  meet  because  she
[15:32] lives  in  a  different  country 
 or  because  she  lives  really  far  away  or 
 because  of  the  covered  lockdown  rules  or
[15:37] anything  and  to  that  i  want  to  respond 
 with  a  question  to  you 
 do  you  really  want  a  text  in  buddy  now
[15:42] you  might  think  oh  yes  uh  like  texting 
 is  kind  of  fun  i've  enjoyed  texting  her 
 [ __ ]  you've  enjoyed  texting  her  but
[15:48] it  isn't  the  texting 
 that  you  actually  wanted  to  do  you've 
 just  enjoyed  connecting  with  a  woman  but
[15:53] this  level  of  connection  through 
 text  messages  is  nothing  compared  to  the 
 the  real  life  connection
[15:59] like  an  internet  relationship  is  not  a 
 substitute  for  a  real  relationship 
 high  value  men  do  not  have  relationships
[16:05] through  the  internet  so  again 
 if  you're  considering  something  like 
 this  you  really  do  have  to  take  like  a
[16:10] look  at  yourself  and  think 
 why  am  i  settling  for  this  finally  the 
 last  major  question  is  what  if  i
[16:15] truly  truly  enjoy  texting  can  i  send  her 
 memes  you  know  that's  mutual  interest  we 
 like  memes  and  to  that  i  want  to  bring
[16:21] back  the  formal 
 point  that  i  had  that  girls  just  want  to 
 have  fun  and  the  issue  is  that  if  she's 
 having
[16:26] a  fun  text  conversation  with  what  seems 
 like  a  boring  guy 
 and  boring  guys  like  you're  a  boring  guy
[16:31] if  you're  talking  about  memes  and  let's 
 be  honest  your  life's  not  that  great 
 she's  then  going  to  keep  you  at  that 
 level  of  just  texting  think  about  what
[16:36] you're  conveying  to  her 
 your  life's  not  that  interesting  you're 
 over  investing  into  this  girl
[16:41] you're  spending  your  own  time  trying  to 
 make  her  laugh  and  sending  memes  and 
 funny  pictures  and  stuff
[16:46] she's  actually  getting  some  fun  out  of 
 the  conversation  she's  messaging  you 
 back  and  everything  it's  so 
 exciting  for  you  to  get  this  this
[16:51] connection  with  a  woman  the  issue  is 
 that  she's 
 essentially  getting  the  best  of  you 
 already  which  is  that  she  knows  you're
[16:56] not  gonna  be  much  better  in  person  and 
 so  she's  never  gonna  actually  meet  you 
 you've  just  reduced  yourself  to  a
[17:01] notification  on  her  phone  now  you're 
 happy 
 with  that  in  terms  of  what  you  get  from 
 her  which  is  her  notification  on  your
[17:07] phone 
 because  that's  you  know  if  it  validates 
 you  getting  this  this  cute  girl's 
 like  name  on  pop-up  on  your  phone  but
[17:13] that  was  never  what  you  wanted  anyway 
 the  issue  with  these  fun  text 
 conversations  that  the  younger  guys  say
[17:18] like  oh  you  know  text  games  absolutely 
 necessary  she  won't  meet  you  unless  you 
 text  her  for  17  days  first 
 it  shows  what  type  of  guy  you  are  she  is
[17:25] going  to  enjoy  those  conversations  she 
 is  going  to  enjoy  those  memes 
 but  she's  never  then  gonna  actually
[17:30] think  oh  let  me  go  meet  this  guy  she 
 wants  to  meet  the  guy  who  she's  one 
 attracted  to 
 who  she's  interested  in  and  three  that
[17:35] she  wants  to  see  more  of  she  wants  to 
 figure  you  out  if  you're  already  giving 
 her 
 everything  through  text  she  doesn't  need
[17:41] to  meet  you  you'll  be  reduced  to  just 
 that  texting  buddy  for  her  and  she's  got 
 a  lot  of  those  sexy  buddies  like  maybe
[17:46] it's  my 
 ego  something  bro  when  i  and  my  heart 
 goes  out  when  i  meet  a  girl  and
[17:51] always  the  same  thing  where  she's  got  10 
 guys  unopened  on  her  snapchat  and  her 
 instagram  and  her  text
[17:56] my  heart  goes  out  to  these  losers 
 because  they're  sending  her  paragraphs 
 on  paragraphs 
 on  paragraphs  they've  been  having  such
[18:01] deep  conversations  and 
 these  girls  meet  me  when  i  send  them  a 
 sentence  if  you  think  that  i'm  boasting
[18:06] this  this  channel  is  probably  not  for 
 you  i'm  just  telling  you 
 what  has  truly  worked  for  me  over  the 
 last  year  of  of  this  type  of  development
[18:12] over  the  last  like  five  six  years  of 
 this  developments  the  business  formal 
 manner 
 sending  emotional  connection  text  in  the
[18:19] middle  now  since  you've  watched  all  this 
 video  what  i'll  do  is  i'll  give  you  a 
 little  extra  treat 
 and  i'll  just  have  a  bunch  of 
 screenshots  of  my  real  text  to  go  so  you
[18:25] can  just  have  a  look  for  some  like 
 inspiration  do  not  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
"
Xw-eTq5cw3Y,"[00:00] Jeffrey  is  a  racist  for  some  reason  he 
 just  hates  people  who  believes  in  God 
 now  of  course  there's  some  normal
[00:05] atheist  but  Jeffrey  is  a  hater  he  spends 
 his  time  on  Reddit  and  in  the  YouTube 
 comments  section  swearing  at  people  God
[00:11] doesn't  exist 
 come  on  Jeffrey  people  are  entitled  to 
 their  own  beliefs  Adonis
[00:18] when  you  think  of  Adonis  what  kind  of 
 man  do  you  think  he  would  be  would  he  be 
 a  Reddit  atheist  or  would  he  be  a  Godly
[00:25] Man  wouldn't  a  man  like  Adonis  raise  his 
 children  in  a  way  to  fear  God  wouldn't
[00:30] he  prefer  to  have  a  woman  whose  whole 
 Community  believes  in  God  and  follows  a 
 structured  system  to  live  their  lives  by
[00:36] Adonis  is  a  man  of  values  and  he  gets 
 that  from  his  religion  I  hated  being
[00:41] brown  skinned  I  hated  identifying  as  a 
 Muslim  I  was  born  in  Pakistan  and  we
[00:47] moved  to  the  UK  when  I  was  just  a  few 
 years  old  and  my  parents  raised  me  to  be 
 a  Muslim  and  by  the  time  I  got  a  few
[00:52] years  old  and  9  11  had  happened  all  I 
 saw  on  the  TV  was  issues  with  brown
[00:57] people  as  a  young  child  it  became 
 confirmed  in  my  mind  that  being  Brown 
 was  a  bad  thing  being  Muslim  meant  that
[01:02] I  was  a  terrorist  it  was  a  source  of 
 ridicule  and  bullying  in  school  till
[01:07] eventually  I  started  adopting  more  of 
 this  like  white  British  culture  but  I 
 never  really  fit  in  with  the  people  here
[01:13] I  made  jokes  about  my  own  race  and  my 
 own  religion  and  you  know  I  was  like  the 
 self-deprecating  little  Pakistani  guy
[01:18] who's  like  making  jokes  about  brown 
 people  and  everything  and  like  calling 
 myself  a  terrorist  just  to  try  and  make 
 the  white  boys  laugh  when  I  look  back
[01:23] now  like  you  know  it's  cringe  and  I  it's 
 kind  of  annoying  when  I  think  of  that 
 little  [ __ ]  version  of  me  but  I  also
[01:28] just  see  like  this  young  boy  who  was  so 
 pressured  by  the  society  and  the  media 
 around  him  that  convinced  him  that  being
[01:33] Brown  was  a  bad  thing  that  being 
 religious  was  a  bad  thing  that  being 
 Muslim  meant  that you're  a  terrorist  and 
 that's  all  I  saw  every  single  day  on  the
[01:39] TV  every  single  day  here  in  the  news  and 
 everything  that  okay  brown  people  are 
 bad  and  you  know  about  Muslims  are 
 terrorists  and  so  of  course  I  didn't
[01:44] want  to  identify  with  that  when  there 
 would  be  like  some  kind  of  terrorist 
 attack  I  would  literally  personally  feel 
 shame  and  I  would  rarely  want  to  deviate
[01:50] away  from  those  people  and  act  extra 
 white  next  to  my  friends  I  abandoned  my 
 race  My  Religion  my  faith  my  God  and  I
[01:58] indulged  in  the  pleasures  of  the  West 
 the  degeneracy  that's  available  here  you 
 know  there's  those  Temptations  whether
[02:03] you're  a  religious  man  or  not  there's 
 those  temptations  that  you  will  have 
 those  desires  promiscuity  of  [ __ ]
[02:08] these  girls  here  of  watching  porn  taking 
 drugs  of  partying  and  drinking  alcohol 
 enjoying  yourself  I  did  all  of  that  you
[02:13] can  literally  see  my  journey  through 
 these  hundreds  of  videos  that  I've  made 
 you  can  see  that  this  is  real  that  I
[02:18] indulged  in  that  lifestyle  we  have 
 hundreds  of  videos  of  me  in  parties 
 hooking  up  with  girls  I  enjoyed  that
[02:23] lifestyle  all  that  the  Godless  West  has 
 to  offer  and  here  I  am  today  in  front  of 
 you  saying
[02:28] it  wasn't  that  great  why  is  it  that  you 
 see  men  like  Andrew  Tate  who  again  has 
 experienced  like  all  that  the  West  has
[02:33] to  offer  all  these  hedonistic  Pleasures 
 convert  into  Islam  because  once  you've 
 fulfilled  all  of  these  Primal  desires  of
[02:38] yours  you're  left  with  this  spiritual 
 numbness  this  emptiness  but  then  also
[02:43] this  paranoia  this  fear  of  what  may 
 arise  when  you  are  a  Godless  man  now  if
[02:49] you're  watching  this  and  you're  thinking 
 this  is  weird  and  wait  whites  Hamza 
 preaching  religion  to  us  I  don't  want 
 you  to  feel  like  you're  not  welcome  so
[02:54] much  I'm  not  religious  religious  not  yet 
 I've  been  atheist  for  literally  most  of 
 my  life  and  only  just  in  the  last  few
[02:59] months  have  I  realized  like  something 
 has  got  to  change  now  Tate  has  recently 
 just  come  out  and  said  that  he's  Muslim
[03:05] and  he's  a  man  that  I  respect  I  hope 
 that  this  video  doesn't  seem  like  I'm 
 just  imitating  him  or  copying  him 
 because  this  is  a  major  life  decision
[03:10] that  we're  talking  about  but  he's  a  man 
 that  I  respect  and  when  he's  gave  the 
 arguments  for  and  against  believing  in 
 God  for  and  against  being  religious  it
[03:16] makes  total  sense  to  me  there  was 
 something  that  I  realized  a  while  ago 
 I've  been  reading  the  book  sapiens  it's
[03:21] like  a  very  famous  book  you  might  have 
 heard  of  it  it's  kind  of  like  the 
 history  of  how  our  species  is  you  know
[03:26] like  humans  as  like  sapiens  have  develop 
 and  it  goes  on  to  say  that  one  of  our 
 most  important  developments  was  how
[03:32] advanced  our  brain  got  to  the  point  that 
 we  could  start  to  think  of  things  that 
 aren't  exactly  right  in  front  of  us  we
[03:38] can  imagine  just  think  about  that  we  can 
 literally  imagine  things  we  can 
 fantasize  about  things  we  can  think  of
[03:43] something  that  is  not  in  front  of  us 
 right  now  and  share  that  story  to  our 
 fellow  man  and  that's  what  causes  us  to 
 unite  because  before  we  had  this
[03:49] Advanced  Brain  we  were  neanderthals  just 
 bashing  each  other  with  rocks  and  as 
 soon  as  our  Consciousness  got  to  that 
 level  where  we  could  believe  in
[03:54] something  bigger  than  us  we  joined 
 together  to  say 
 there's  such  a  thing  called  God  and
[03:59] maybe  if  we  follow  what  he  says  and  be 
 good  people  we'll  prosper  and  if  we 
 delay  gratification  we'll  get  into
[04:05] heaven  now  if  you've  watched  a  bunch  of 
 my  videos  what  is  the  most  important 
 concept  of  self-improvement  that  I  ever 
 talk  about  instant  gratification  versus
[04:11] delayed  gratification  the  ultimate  delay 
 gratification  is  the  promise  of  Heaven 
 be  good  in  this  life  for  a  better
[04:17] afterlife  I  teach  you  nothing  original 
 whatsoever  everything  that  I  say  comes 
 from  religion  be  a  good  person  be  kind
[04:23] be  generous  meditate  be  grateful  be  a 
 strong  person  have  a  family  rejected 
 generacy  and  Hedonism  but  I  realized  a
[04:29] while  ago  when  I  was  reading  this  book 
 sapiens  that  you  know  we  have  this 
 Advanced  Brain  that  we  can  believe  in 
 things  it  made  me  realize  that  as  a
[04:35] human  being  because  of  the  capability  of 
 our  Advanced  Brain  we  are  always  going
[04:40] to  worship  something  I'm  gonna  say  this 
 again  you  are  always  worshiping 
 something  if  you're  an  atheist  which  I
[04:46] am  so  I'm  not  being  hateful  or  anything 
 but  I  am  too  but  if  you're  an  atheist 
 and  you  don't  believe  in  God  you're 
 still  worshiping  something  you  still
[04:52] have  some  kind  of  God  okay  it's  not  a 
 religious  God  it's  not  the  god  from  the 
 Bible  it's  not  Allah  but  you  still 
 worship  something  you  know  I  carried
[04:58] this  concept  I  hope  this  makes  sense  I 
 carried  this  concept  in  my  mind  okay 
 you're  always  worshiping  something 
 religious  people  worship  a  God  and  a
[05:03] holy  book  atheists  what  do  they  worship 
 what  do  atheists  scream  and  go  crazy
[05:08] about  what  do  people  in  like  this 
 Godless  country  I'm  in  the  UK  what  do 
 people  worship  here  Brothers  gang
[05:14] members  if  you're  uncertain  about  that 
 you  can  search  on  YouTube  right  now 
 search  for  some  rapper  and  write  concert 
 at  the  end  of  it  and  you  will  see  all
[05:20] these  people  crazy  crazy  oh  my  god  oh 
 that's 
 their  God  when  you  live  in  a  Godless
[05:26] country  you're  still  being  given  people 
 to  worship  now  the  issue  is  the  person 
 that  you're  worshiping  isn't  this  holy
[05:31] Almighty  power  it's  not  like  this  force 
 of  good  it's  this  random  [ __ ]  Thug 
 degenerate  who's  got  women  twerking  in
[05:37] his  music  video  and  he's  talking  about 
 stabbing  people  and  taking  drugs  and 
 maybe  you've  known  this  already  because
[05:42] I've  kind  of  known  this  for  a  while  so 
 what's  the  new  revelation  that  I've  had 
 well  I  am  quite  certain  that  this  is  how 
 these  countries  will  fall  once  you  start
[05:48] to  open  your  eyes  to  this  possibility 
 that  the  country  that  we  are  in  doesn't 
 always  have  to  stay  safe  there's
[05:53] countries  out  there  right  now  they're  in 
 a  middle  of  a  war  now  I've  lived  in  the 
 UK  maybe  you're  in  the  UK  or  some
[05:58] country  in  the  west  which  seems 
 relatively  safe  we've  never  had  a  war  in 
 our  lifetimes  on  our  own  soil  the
[06:03] thought  of  being  dominated  by  a 
 different  country  if  you  live  in  the  UK 
 or  the  US  it  seems  something  like  that
[06:08] wouldn't  happen  because  yeah  the  America 
 is  really  really  strong  is  it  because 
 the  people  here  are  weak  there's  no
[06:13] doubt  about  that  whatsoever  the  people 
 here  are  weak  the  people  in  the  west  are 
 weak  there's  no  families  there's  all 
 reasons  for  a  man  to  be  strong  anymore
[06:18] because  there's  no  families  there's  no 
 like  I  hate  this  time  there's  no  good 
 women  older  women  have  fallen  prey  it's
[06:23] like  the  evil  propaganda  telling  them  to 
 devalue  themselves  religion  tells  women 
 to  Value  themselves  so  highly  and  tells
[06:29] men  to  Value  women  so  highly  that  you 
 keep  them  in  this  almost  this  state  of 
 like  semi-worship  and  the  Godless  West
[06:35] tells  women  to  degrade  themselves  to  the 
 point  that  they  literally  lose  their 
 value  because  it  tells  them  that  Purity
[06:40] is  not  an  important  thing  every  single 
 man  if  he  is  totally  just  you  know  you
[06:45] could  be  watching  this  disagreeing  with 
 me  right  now  you  could  be  some  male 
 feminist  if  you  just  stay  silent  don't 
 ever  speak  about  this  to  anyone  else  but
[06:50] if  you  just  see  how  you  feel  at  the 
 thought  of  a  woman  being  Godless  and 
 sleeping  around  and  enjoying  the
[06:55] Hedonism  of  the  West  if  you  think  of 
 your  future  wife  getting  [ __ ]  down  by 
 Childs  and  she  matched  with  this  guy  on
[07:00] Tinder  it  gives  you  this  gut  feeling  of 
 pain  inside  of  every  single  man  is  this 
 gut  feeling  of  pain  that  a  Godless  woman
[07:06] it's  not  right  it's  not  attractive  it's 
 not  what  we  want  but  outside  because  of 
 this  propaganda  because  of  this  pressure
[07:11] that  I  have  this  fear  of  being  canceled 
 by  speaking  about  this  right  now  you  go 
 girl  oh  don't  be  sexist  don't  be
[07:16] misogynist  Pierce  Morgan  saying  this  to 
 Andrew  Taylor  oh  that's  misogynist  Tate 
 just  said  this  in  a  recent  podcast  of
[07:21] his  that  Islam  is  a  cure  for  degeneracy 
 I  can't  think  of  any  other  better  cure  I
[07:26] honestly  can't  I  was  so  certain  for  all 
 of  my  life  that  I  would  you  know  it  was 
 never  something  that  important  to  me  but
[07:32] it  was  like  kind  of  certain  yeah  just 
 I'd  be  an  atheist  for  the  rest  of  my 
 life  like  I  don't  believe  in  God  right 
 maybe  you've  seen  over  the  last  like  one
[07:37] year  or  so  that  I've  really  started  to 
 consider  this  more  and  more  to  the  point 
 now  that  I'm  literally  reading  the  Quran
[07:42] my  mom  used  to  make  me  read  that  when  I 
 was  a  child  and  you  know  I  never  really 
 wanted  to  I  always  like  struggled  or 
 whatever  and  now  I've  actively  started
[07:48] reading  it  by  my  own  accord  and  I  called 
 my  mum  two  days  ago  and  told  her  and  I 
 just  saw  like  the  biggest  smile  on  her
[07:53] face  when  I  told  her  that  I  started 
 reading  you  know  our  holy  book  and  she 
 just  got  like  so  happy  she  told  me  it 
 was  the  right  thing  she  told  me  that
[07:58] this  you  know  this  was  the  way  forward 
 right  here  right  now  you  either  fully 
 believe  me  you  agree  with  me  and  you're
[08:03] like  yeah  this  is  amazing  Amazon  might 
 turn  Muslim  you  know  he'll  be  one  of  our 
 brothers  that's  amazing  and  that's 
 awesome  but  maybe  if  you're  watching
[08:08] this  right  now  and  you're  just  feeling 
 weird  and  thinking  okay  this  guy  is 
 preaching  to  us  I  don't  care  about 
 religion  religion  is  not  important  trust
[08:13] me  when  I  say  I  felt  exactly  the  same 
 way  for  all  of  my  life  maybe  you're  not 
 there  just  yet  but  there  will  be  a  point
[08:18] as  you  keep  advancing  your 
 self-improvement  especially  when  you 
 start  looking  into  like  The  Wider  scale
[08:23] of  things  you  start  are  really 
 investigating  why  countries  rise  and 
 fall  you  start  investigating  the  kind  of
[08:28] country  that  you  want  to  raise  your 
 children  and  then  you  start  to  realize 
 that  countries  that  eventually  give  up 
 their  culture  their  values  and  their
[08:33] religion  end  up  getting  [ __ ] 
 decimated  by  another  country  that's  kept 
 their  hardcore  values  there  are  no
[08:40] nuclear  families  here  there's  no  reason 
 for  a  man  to  be  strong  in  this  country 
 and  so  we  see  that  every  man  here  is
[08:45] weak  I'm  talking  about  the  UK  but  you 
 know  what's  interesting  where  are  the 
 strong  British  men  in  Spain  in  Dubai  the
[08:51] most  successful  most  wealthy  the  hardest 
 working  guys  here  in  the  west  they  make 
 their  money  and  then  they  go  to  a
[08:56] different  country  so  these  countries 
 can't  even  retain  like  the  strong  men 
 who  would  have  kept  societies  like  this
[09:01] balanced  the  strong  men  of  these 
 countries  don't  even  want  to  stay  here 
 if  you  ask  these  people  right  here  right
[09:06] now  would  they  fight  for  this  country 
 they'd  look  at  you  weird  they  would 
 literally  look  at  you  with  ketamine 
 around  their  nose  right  now  looking  at
[09:12] you  like  oh  what  were  you  talking  about 
 oh  just  passes  the  packet  like  we  talk 
 about  let's  go  to  the  public  I'm  just
[09:18] having  a  wank  if  you  feel  safe  right 
 here  right  now  in  these  countries  I  am 
 sure  that  you  have  not  opened  your  eyes
[09:24] to  the  brutal  truth  the  brutal  facts 
 that  are  happening  around  the  world  I 
 made  a  video  which  was  my  most
[09:29] uncensored  most  brutal  most  important 
 video  yeah  it's  titled  Tick  Tock  is 
 worse  than  you  thought  if  you  haven't
[09:34] seen  that  already  I  highly  suggest  you 
 watch  all  of  that  it's  not  like  a  normal 
 anti-social  media  video  I  rarely  show
[09:39] you  the  research  that  shows  that  Tick 
 Tock  is  the  greatest  weapon  of  war  that 
 we've  ever  experienced  Tick  Tock  is 
 literally  more  deadlier  than  any  nuclear
[09:45] weapon  that  we've  ever  devised  once  you 
 look  at  the  research  of  that  and  you  see 
 the  country  behind  that  and  you  see  that
[09:50] countries  right  here  right  now  are 
 preparing  for  war  whilst  your  country 
 celebrates  [ __ ]  your  country
[09:56] celebrates  degeneracy  it  celebrates 
 removing  men  from  the  household  it
[10:01] literally  actively  helps  no  it  actively 
 forces  fathers  out  of  the  household
[10:06] which  means  that  children  may  be  like 
 yourself  are  raised  by  single  mothers 
 becoming  weak  lacking  values  and  you  do
[10:12] realize  that  there's  such  a  thing  called 
 drafts  you  do  realize  that  there  is  a 
 possibility  that  you  may  be  forced  to
[10:17] fight  for  your  country  and  you  probably 
 don't  even  see  it  as  your  country  the 
 first  thing  people  in  this  country  do
[10:22] when  they  make  money  is  they  leave 
 there's  two  music  videos  that  I've 
 watched  recently  I  don't  watch  this  kind
[10:27] of  [ __ ]  content  but  there  was  two 
 that  my  friend  Sam  kind  of  told  me  to 
 watch  one  of  them  you  can  go  and  have  a 
 look  right  now  it's  called  messy  in
[10:33] heaven  and  it's  made  by  like  some  random 
 girl  who's  just  she's  saying  that  Jesus 
 Took  cocaine  like  you  know  it's  a
[10:38] [ __ ]  degenerate  [ __ ]  it  just  shows 
 her  and  her  friends  like  enjoying 
 themselves  drinking  taking  drugs  oh  in 
 parties  bro  when  I  tell  you  right  now
[10:43] that  that  music  video  is  such  an 
 accurate  depiction  of  a  night  out  in 
 British  culture  where  these  people  will
[10:48] come  in  early  start  drinking  then  go  out 
 and  start  smoking  in  the  middle  of  the 
 Rave  and  they're  all  [ __ ]  up and  stuff 
 this  is  what  the  people  are  doing  here
[10:53] that's  like  what  Godless  young  people  do 
 and  then  there  was  another  video  that 
 Sam  showed  me  was  like  some  random
[10:58] rapper  just  you  know  like  some  American 
 rapper  with  like  a  bunch  of  like  jewelry 
 on  and  everything  he's  got  like  girls
[11:03] twerking  around  him  and  everything  you 
 know  it's  just  a  stereotypical  like  rap 
 song  if  that  guy  walks  through  the
[11:08] streets  and  people  knew  he  was  there  he 
 would  be  bombarded  all  of  his  worshipers 
 would  go  and  like  kneel  before  him  it's
[11:14] a  random  rapper  when  they  do  concerts 
 people  literally  kneel  before  them  and 
 like  girls  throw  that  is  that  your 
 future  wife  throwing  her  bra  to  this
[11:19] rapper  is  that  you're  gonna  be  your 
 future  wife  in  this  country  oh  but  I 
 just  like  going  to  concerts  to  dance 
 with  my  girls  some  run  rapper  as  your
[11:25] future  wife's  bra  if  you've  read  the 
 book  Hard  Times  quite  strong  man  you're 
 already  panicking  at  this  Global  State
[11:30] of  Affairs  and  if  you've  not  read  that 
 book  right  now  maybe  your  eyes  are  still 
 closed  and  maybe  you  think  that  I'm  some 
 weirdo  all  those  guys  who  don't
[11:35] understand  this  concept  are  probably 
 clicked  off  the  video  and  thinking  yeah 
 I'm  just  going  crazy  whatever  if  you 
 haven't  already  the  book  Hard  Times
[11:40] create  strong  men  by  Stefan  O'Neill  is  a 
 10  out  of  10  must  read  and  you  must 
 start  reading  it  now  if  there's  one 
 thing  I  can  command  you  to  do  if  that
[11:46] you  have  any  like  level  of  like 
 adherence  to  what  I  say  if  there's  one 
 thing  I  can  make  you  do  go  find  the  book 
 Hard  Times  create  strong  men  and  start
[11:52] reading  it  right  now  as  you  start 
 reading  it  you  will  Panic  you  will 
 literally  start  a  fear  for  the  physical
[11:57] safety  of  your  family  you  will  start  to 
 think  okay  [ __ ]  I  need  to  make  more 
 money  and  get  my  family  out  of  this 
 country  fast  it's  been  written  in  books
[12:03] of  the  exact  pattern  that  we're  going 
 through  a  guy  who  wrote  this  book  who 
 mysteriously  died  after  writing  it
[12:08] predicted  exactly  what's  happening  and 
 he  mentioned  the  term  which  I've  spoke 
 about  in  a  previous  video  called 
 subversion  subversion  is  when  you
[12:13] destroy  a  country's  cultures  and  value 
 so  that  it  becomes  weak  from  the  inside 
 and  you  do  this  before  you  even  go  to
[12:18] war  with  them  So  eventually  when  you're 
 going  to  war  you're  gonna  go  fight  some 
 guy  who's  on  day  Zero  of  notefab  you're 
 gonna  go  fight  some  guy  who  doesn't  even
[12:23] have  a  family  to  fight  wait  for  I've 
 said  this  so  many  times  bro  imagine 
 these  countries  going  to  war  with  a
[12:28] country  who  still  values  family  and 
 religion  imagine  an  atheist  hey  boy  390
[12:33] grams  of  Tesla  I  can't  even  take  that 
 bit  out  because  YouTube  will  [ __ ] 
 can't  tell  me  if  I  use  a  word  like  oh  I
[12:38] got  canceled  on  skillshare  for  talking 
 about  the  death  of  masculinity  in  these 
 countries  when  you  destroy  masculinity
[12:43] in  the  young  men  of  your  why  it  doesn't 
 make  [ __ ]  sense  when  you  think  about 
 it  why  are  these  countries  destroying
[12:48] their  own  men's  masculinity  because  they 
 live  in  a  state  of  [ __ ]  comfort  and 
 they  think  that  now  this  is  troubling 
 this  is  toxic  you  see  our  videos  of
[12:54] helping  young  men  rise  up  and  cure  their 
 addiction  support  and  social  media  into 
 junk  food  we  are  seen  as  Toxic  by  our
[13:00] own  countries  we  are  trying  to  become 
 strong  so  that  we  may  protect  our  own 
 countries  and  they  literally  see  us  as
[13:05] toxic  and  they  want  to  silence  us  every 
 video  that  I  record  these  days  bro  I 
 don't  even  know  which  one's  gonna  get  me
[13:10] totally  silenced  two  years  of  hard  work 
 employees  who  rely  on  the  income  that  we
[13:15] make  and  I  don't  even  know  which  random 
 video  I  make  is  just  totally  gonna 
 remove  everything  how  crazy  is  that
[13:21] YouTube  is  a  western  company  I  think 
 it's  like  a  US  company  and  it's  sees 
 content  from  guys  who  are  trying  to  make
[13:26] these  countries  stronger  and  it  will 
 literally  silence  you  we've  got  to  the 
 State  of  Affairs  where  companies  and
[13:32] people  and  leaders  in  these  like  Western 
 Godless  countries  aren't  even  supporting 
 their  own  country  and  so  of  course  when
[13:38] you  see  a  strong  successful  man  being 
 silenced  being  hate  on  being  called 
 toxic  where  do  you  see  them  all  go  they
[13:43] don't  stay  in  these  [ __ ]  countries 
 anymore  you  see  Tate  just  move  over  like 
 you  know  he  was  started  in  UK  then  he
[13:48] moved  over  to  Romania  then  he's  moved  to 
 Dubai  I'm  going  to  Dubai  you  see  Iman 
 move  to  Dubai  bro  everyone's  moving  East
[13:53] every  smart  rich  person  is  moving  East 
 and  literally  they're  all  moving  to  a 
 Muslim  country  why  think  about  that
[13:58] these  guys  are  probably  Your  Role  Models 
 all  of  your  role  models  are  moving  to  a 
 Muslim  country  and  all  of  the  broke  guys
[14:04] are  still  going  out  to  the  pub  and  you 
 see  them  like  lying  down  on  the  floor 
 like  the  other  gritty  dirty  floor  at  the 
 end  of  the  night  I  was  like  oh  I'm  so
[14:10] [ __ ]  like  oh  I  had  too  many  jager 
 bombs  lad  you  know  there's  countries 
 because  of  religion  that  totally
[14:15] inhibits  especially  the  sexual  just 
 freedom  but  just  the  sexual  freedom  of 
 their  young  people  Islam  restricts  that
[14:20] Islam  restricts  the  sexual  freedom  of 
 the  young  people  there  you  only  get  to 
 have  sex  and  your  own  only  get  to
[14:25] experience  the  opposite  sex  once  you're 
 about  to  get  married  and  guess  what 
 happens  then  a  young  Muslim  guy  and  a 
 young  Muslim  girl  since  they're
[14:30] restricted  from  being  able  to  you  know 
 date  or  have  sex  or  anything  they're 
 focused  on  being  productive  good
[14:35] citizens  in  a  right  like  in  an  enforced 
 Islamic  country  people  go  through  the 
 school  system  focus  on  their  studies  and
[14:41] so  they  produce  some  top  level  doctors 
 and  engineers  and  their  country  gets 
 stronger  hear  what  happens  through  the
[14:46] school  system  here  if  you're  in  the  UK 
 or  the  US  what  happens  during  school 
 sure  there  might  be  some  like  nerds  who 
 are  like  you  know  focused  even  they
[14:51] think  about  it  those  people  are 
 demonized  they're  the  person  who's 
 actually  focused  in  school  is  demonized 
 and  called  a  nerd  like  I  just  call  this
[14:56] guy  a  nerd  bro  but  for  the  majority  of 
 people  in  the  school  system  like  you 
 know  the  new  generation  of  workers  who 
 are  supposed  to  defend  the  country
[15:02] they're  too  busy  thinking  oh  has  she 
 replied  oh  did  he  just  [ __ ]  me  and  now 
 he's  not  replying  anymore  think  about 
 how  much  of  their  brain  power  was  being
[15:08] taken  away  by  the  openness  of  the  sexual 
 Revolution  here  bro  kids  are  having  sex 
 at  age  30  in  here  do  you  really  think
[15:13] they're  focused  on  their  studies  do  you 
 really  think  this  country  is  going  to 
 produce  like  the  best  workers  that  it 
 could  do  I've  had  the  chance  to  invest
[15:19] money  you  know  this  company  is  making  a 
 good  amount  of  money  and  I  try  and 
 reinvest  as  much  of  it  as  possible  back 
 into  the  business  but  got  to  the  point
[15:25] now  where  our  income's  pretty  high  and 
 it's  time  for  me  to  try  and  invest  into 
 like  you  know  other  companies  other  you 
 know  crypto  stocks  and  stuff  and  you
[15:30] know  the  conventional  advice  that  I've 
 always  heard  is  oh  invest  in  the  S  P  500 
 and  it  would  probably  be  a  good
[15:35] investment  guess  why  I've  not  invested 
 in  those  index  funds  guess  why  I've  not 
 invested  in  those  American  companies  you 
 can  call  me  crazy  but  I  don't  think  they
[15:40] will  stand  it  another  20  years  from  now 
 I  don't  think  that  the  top  us  companies 
 will  either  exist  or  will  still  be  like
[15:45] registered  as  us  companies  20  years  from 
 now  all  these  people  are  still  trying  to 
 like  invest  into  the  West  as  it  [ __ ]
[15:51] degrades  it  makes  no  sense  to  me  it 
 makes  absolutely  no  sense  you  can  see 
 the  degration  of  all  elements  of  a
[15:57] Godless  Western  Society  inflation  mental 
 health  suicide  gang  war  someone's
[16:02] getting  stabbed  every  single  day  in 
 London  like  Tate  says  this  and  I  thought 
 it  was  over  dramatic  I  kind  of  knew  that
[16:07] the  brutal  facts  of  how  unsafe  it  is 
 here  but  when  you  just  bro  if  you  really 
 want  to  [ __ ]  give  yourself  anxiety 
 and  see  how  [ __ ]  this  country  is  just
[16:13] go  on  to  Google  and  just  search  London 
 stabbing  he  was  totally  right  if  you  do 
 this  you'll  ruin  your  [ __ ]  day  I 
 don't  know  if  I  sound  crazy  and
[16:18] everyone's  gonna  think  oh  I'm  just  lost 
 it  now  but  once  you  start  looking  into 
 this  and  you  look  into  this  concept  of
[16:23] these  countries  are  falling  because  of 
 the  degration  of  like  strong  masculine 
 virtues  and  they're  becoming  more 
 feminine  more  emotional  they  becoming
[16:29] more  like  politically  correct  which  is 
 weakness  and  you  start  to  think  okay 
 well  every  part  of  society  is  getting
[16:34] worse  with  this  and  then  you  see  the 
 rise  of  strong  countries  that  are  still 
 enforcing  like  hard  [ __ ]  disciplined
[16:39] rules  you  know  we  always  thought  China 
 was  crazy  you  always  used  to  hear  oh 
 China's  like  Advanced  social  media  and
[16:44] they've  done  this  and  they've  done  this 
 we  thought  oh  yeah  they're  so  crazy  why 
 don't  they  just  like  allow  people  to  go 
 onto  Facebook  this  is  why  they  don't
[16:50] want  Western  degeneracy  to  infiltrate 
 their  culture  there  I  don't  even  think 
 it's  enough  to  just  have  good  values  and
[16:55] be  like  a  good  Muslim  in  this  country  I 
 really  don't  because  I  see 
 this  might  get  me  [ __ ]  hated  by  the
[17:00] Muslim  Community  but  bro  honestly  a  lot 
 of  Muslims  in  these  countries  are  not 
 even  Muslims  they're  just  fakers  a  lot 
 of  like  the  girls  who  have  been  raised
[17:06] by  good  Muslim  parents  eventually  get 
 like  so  [ __ ]  brainwashed  by  their 
 friends  in  the  school  system  and  by  Tick 
 Tock  and  stuff  that  they  turn  into  [ __ ]
[17:12] they  won't  have  sex  but  they  will  suck 
 dick  and  it  seems  [ __ ]  vulgar  I 
 promise  you  that  this  shit's  happening
[17:17] and  100  this  sounds  contradictive  coming 
 from  someone  who's  indulged  in  the 
 degeneracy  here  yo  this  is  the  case  of
[17:22] me  experiencing  these  things  [ __ ] 
 around  enjoying  the  drug  culture  the 
 party  culture  here  and  then  transforming
[17:27] and  telling  you  don't  do  it  and  you  can 
 say  it  to  yourself  wait  but  this  guy's 
 done  it  so  how  is  he  telling  me  not  to 
 do  it  well  the  only  way  that  I  could
[17:32] tell  you  not  to  do  these  things  like  for 
 example  to  not  continue  playing  video 
 games  so  maybe  maybe  reconsider  being  an
[17:38] atheist  maybe  don't  take  drugs  maybe 
 don't  be  so  sex  obsessed  with  the  women 
 here  because  I've  done  them  myself  and
[17:43] I'm  speaking  from  experience  how 
 interesting  is  that  that  you  are  seeing 
 the  rise  of  strong  men  who  are  from
[17:48] Western  countries  who  have  indulged  in 
 every  pleasure  that  the  degenerate 
 Western  world  has  to  offer  and  you  are 
 seeing  these  men  take  a  big  step  away
[17:54] from  the  Western  World  and  tell  you  like 
 it's  not  even  that  great  you're 
 literally  seeing  guy  guys  who  have 
 indulged  in  everything  and  they're
[18:00] telling  you  that  it's  not  that  great  now 
 I'll  speak  directly  to  the  Muslims  who 
 are  watching  this  the  young  Muslims  who
[18:05] might  have  some  kinds  of  Temptations 
 right  now  I  can  emphasize  with  you 
 especially  if  you  live  in  countries  like 
 this  and  all  you're  seeing  is  just  ass
[18:10] every  day  ass  on  Tick  Tock  ass  on  social 
 media  your  school  teacher's  a  stripper 
 because  that's  oh  well  you  know  sex
[18:15] workers  your  school  teachers  got  [ __ ] 
 only  fans  these  days  oh  man  you  know  oh
[18:20] we've  got  to  support  sex  workers  as  a 
 young  Muslim  and  you're  being  sold  sex 
 and  the  Temptation  will  keep  increasing
[18:25] hopefully  you  can  see  a  man  like  me 
 maybe  a  man  like  Tate  and  just  think 
 these  guys  have  indulged  in  that  and 
 they're  literally  still  telling  you  that
[18:30] it's  not  worth  pursuing  I've  started 
 reading  the  Quran  and  maybe  you  should 
 too 
 click  and  watch  this  video  right  now  do
[18:36] the  hard  work  especially  when  you  don't 
 feel  like  it
"
gfgJkBSFqQ4,"[00:07] can  i  tell  you  why  it's  not  funny  if 
 this  was  the  other  way  around  and  a 
 woman  was  sat  here  and  a  bloke  had
[00:12] locked  her  in  a  flat  and  she  had  to  jump 
 out  and  injure  herself  you  lot  would  not 
 be  laughing  somehow  if  it  happens  to  a
[00:17] bloke  that's  funny  that's  not  funny  is 
 it  that  isn't 
 it  all  started  when  the  government
[00:22] replaced  the  father  the  father  role  in 
 the  family  has  been  killed  off  which
[00:27] means  the  biggest  purpose  in  our  lives 
 has  been  destroyed  marriage  divorce  and 
 child  care  laws  are  blatantly  sexist  you
[00:34] are  not  needed  anymore 
 the  average  marriage  lasts  11  years  and 
 then  through  the  divorce  you  will  get
[00:39] the  kids  and  the  finances  why  would  she 
 stay  in  a  relationship  with  little  to  no 
 benefit  but  with  extra  responsibility
[00:45] young  men  have  been  raised  with  no 
 father  figure  or  a  father  who  wasn't 
 around  due  to  overworking  long  hours  in
[00:51] the  capitalistic  materialistic  society 
 that  we  live  in  and  so  we  look  for 
 father  figures  elsewhere  from  the  media
[00:58] from  society  from  our  female  teachers  in 
 school  and  all  of  them  lied  to  us  they 
 fed  us  a  script  that  doesn't  work  they
[01:05] set  us  up  with  a  trajectory  to  fail  just 
 be  yourself  but  you're  actually  a  loser 
 and  we  want  you  to  stay  a  loser  because
[01:11] that's  more  profitable  men  should 
 embrace  their  feminine  side  but  we'll 
 lose  attraction  to  you  if  you  do  treat
[01:16] her  like  a  princess  like  a  queen  but  we 
 won't  treat  you  like  a  king  stop  trying 
 to  be  masculine  but  no  woman's  gonna
[01:21] have  sex  with  you  if  you  do  everyone  in 
 society  has  made  it  so  clear  to  you  to 
 not  sexualize  women  guess  who  the  women
[01:27] are  dating  and  sleeping  with 
 the  men  who  sexualized  them  the  ultimate 
  test  of  the  modern  world  was  to
[01:33] make  all  men  blue  pilled  and  scared  of 
 their  masculinity  when  you  are  this 
 normal  blue  pill  guy  you  get  such  little
[01:39] attraction  from  women  because  you've 
 ultimately  lost  your  masculine  frame 
 most  important  part  of  our  frame  is  that
[01:45] we  are  men  we  are  masculine  we  are 
 supposed  to  be  the  strong  stoic  leader 
 and  listening  to  society  takes  that  away
[01:51] from  you  and  by  listening  to  society's 
 lies  you  ultimately  lost  frame  and  now 
 you're  ugly  to  women  then  the
[01:57] jerk  gets  the  women  that  you  feel  you 
 deserve  and  then  something  happens
[02:02] you  rip  the  script  you  begin  to  do  the 
 opposite  of  everything  society  has
[02:07] advised  you  and  so  women  naturally 
 gravitate  towards  you  you  close  more 
 deals  in  your  business  than  ever  before
[02:13] your  confidence  skyrockets  it's  obvious 
 the  conventional  advice  was  all  one  big
[02:18] test  and  any  man  who  crumbled  to 
 that  test  lost  his  frame  the  only  men
[02:23] who  naturally  overcame  this  test  were 
 those  who  had  a  strong  male  role  model 
 in  their  lives  and  so  i  thank  you
[02:30] i  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  be  that 
 strong  role  model  for  you  you  want  to

9ZUQgMpFxIM,"[00:00] before  we  begin  with  this  video  there 
 are  two  online  courses  that  I  sell  and
[00:05] you  can  have  a  part  of  both  of  them  for 
 free  the  first  is  a  list  of  seven
[00:10] workout  routines  that  will  build  an 
 attractive  body  that's  linked  as  the  top 
 Link  in  the  description  and  that  comes
[00:16] from  my  aesthetic  body  course  and  then 
 the  second  one  is  a  private  course  video 
 that  is  not  on  YouTube  that  explains
[00:22] exactly  the  mistakes  of  what  not  to  do 
 if  you  are  just  about  to  get  intimate
[00:28] with  a  girl  that  you've  brought  back  to 
 your  place  if  you're  interested  in  those 
 the  two  links  are  there  in  the  top  of
[00:33] the  YouTube  description  today  we're 
 going  to  cover  how  purpose  works  as  a
[00:38] masculine  man  and  my  intention  with  this 
 my  hope  is  that  by  the  end  of  this  video
[00:44] you  will  be  convinced  that  this  is  the 
 only  way  to  live
[00:50] you  will  have  some  kind  of  epiphany  some 
 kind  of  mental  realization  through  this
[00:57] video  if  you  sit  through  and  watch  it 
 all 
 which  will  change  the  plan  that  you've
[01:03] had  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 that's  my  hope  with  the  the  scope  of
[01:08] this  like  mini  project  of  this  guide 
 I've  got  my  notes  here  as  well
[01:14] so  you  may  have  heard  of  what  purpose  is 
 or  you  may  have  heard  of  purpose  being 
 talked  about  online  especially  in  this
[01:20] space  of  men's  self-improvements  and 
 masculine  creators  and  you've  probably
[01:25] heard  of  the  phrase  that  guys  use  which 
 is  like  beyond  your  purpose  stay  on  your
[01:30] purpose  focus  on  your  purpose  but 
 oftentimes  a  lot  of  these  online 
 creators  don't  really  seem  to  explain
[01:36] things  past  that  they  just  say  yeah  be 
 on  your  purpose  and  you  kind  of  it 
 imagine  that  to  be  like  yeah  like  be  on
[01:43] your  grind  King  and  being  on  your  grind 
 is  a  really  nice  thing  but  purpose  goes
[01:48] so  far  above  that  and  so  much  more 
 rewarding 
 your  purpose  is  the  thing  that  you  are
[01:55] currently  obsessed  about  if  we  took  away 
 all  distractions  all  simulations
[02:01] everything  anything  stimulating  is  all 
 removed  imagine  you  are  literally  locked
[02:06] into  just  an  empty  box  a  room 
 what  are  you  gonna  think  about
[02:12] what  are  you  gonna  desire
[02:17] it's  almost  always  going  to  be  related 
 to  progress  in  a  certain  endeavor
[02:23] for  a  lot  of  guys  it  may  be 
 progress  in  how  they  look  progress  and
[02:28] how  they  feel  maybe  getting  into  the  gym 
 that's  the  current  Obsession  for  a  lot 
 of  other  guys  it  may  be  about  studying
[02:33] or  their  career  or  making  money 
 something  that  you  are  currently 
 obsessed  about  if  you  did  not  distract
[02:39] or  stimulate  yourself  because  it's  very 
 easy  to  be  obsessed  about  something  that 
 you're  addicted  to  because  of  modern
[02:45] technology  you  know  it's  technically 
 someone  could  be  obsessed  with  some 
 video  game  but  that's  more  so  about
[02:50] modern  addiction  than  it  is  their  core 
 masculine  energy
[02:55] purpose  is 
 the  current  chapter  of  your  life
[03:01] what  chapter  are  you  currently  in  what 
 is  the  thing  that  your  mind  and  your 
 body  and  your  soul  seem  to  obsess  over
[03:08] this  is 
 the  mission
[03:13] and  we'll  clarify  exactly  how  to  find 
 this  Mission  this  purpose  but  first  let 
 me  just  explain  to  you  how  purpose  works
[03:20] inside  of  us  we  have  a  core  purpose  deep 
 deep  inside  of  us
[03:26] and  chances  are  we  don't  actually  know 
 what  this  is  no  none  of  us  actually  know 
 what  this  is  I  certainly  don't  know  what 
 my  core  purpose  is  this  deep  purpose
[03:33] but  surrounding  this  deep  purpose  are 
 layers  of  like  secondary  purposes  layer
[03:40] upon  layer  upon  layer  upon  layer 
 all  the  way  to  where  we  are  now  and  this
[03:47] is  this  one  here  it's  our  current  layer 
 this  is  our  current  purpose  layer
[03:53] what  we  must  do  is  try  to  focus  entirely 
 utterly  and  completely  on  this  purpose
[04:00] layer  to  try  and  peel  it  back  to  try  and 
 fulfill  it  to  try  and  complete  it  so 
 that  we  may  move  on  to  the  next  layer
[04:06] and  then  do  the  exact  same  thing  peel  it 
 back  through  months  maybe  years  of
[04:11] dedication  to  this  one  thing  this 
 mission  that  your  mind  and  your  body 
 obsesses  over  we  align  as  much  as  we  can
[04:16] of  Our  Lives  to  peel  back  this  layer  and 
 then  the  next  one  and  then  the  next  one 
 and  then  the  next  one  and  then
[04:21] eventually  we  should  get  to  this  like 
 core  purpose  this  this
[04:26] original  source  of  energy  of  bliss  of 
 Love  who  like  who  knows  I'm  speculating 
 about  what  it  would  be  at  this  level  I'm
[04:32] not  even  close  to  that  but  what  I  do 
 know  for  certain  is  that  we  have  these 
 layers  and  whatever  one  you  are
[04:38] currently  obsessed  over  is  simply  just  a 
 layer  that  we  need  to  peel  back  to
[04:43] eventually  get  one  step  closer  to  the 
 core  thing  that  we're  trying  to  reach 
 and  this  in  itself  already  symbolizes
[04:50] masculine  energy  if  you  think  about  it 
 you  we  talk  a  lot  about  masculinity  and 
 masculine  energy  and  if  I  ask  you  okay
[04:56] what  does  masculine  energy  or  what 
 masculinity  even  is  you  know  we'd  say 
 like  oh  yeah  discipline  and  you  know
[05:01] being  a  man  and  lifting  some  weights  and 
 stuff  and  those  things  symbolize 
 masculine  energy  but  the  true  masculine
[05:07] energy  is  all  simply  just  about  progress 
 progress  progress
[05:14] it's  always  just  this  this  goal  striving 
 energy  inside  of  us  when  you  think  about
[05:20] the  way  that  a  man  a  masculine  man  has 
 luck  makes  love
[05:25] it's  about  progress  to  that  end  point 
 for  women  it's  different  women  don't 
 obsess  over  some  end  points  when  they're
[05:31] making  love  they  obsess  over  the  current 
 second  but  for  man  the  the  objective  is
[05:37] that  end  point  the  objective  for  all  our 
 life  no  matter  what  we're  doing  is  to
[05:42] the  end  points 
 when  we  eat  a  meal  you  know  it'd  be  an 
 awesome  mindfulness  meditation  practice
[05:47] to  enjoy  every  single  bite  but  we're 
 almost  looking  forward  to  the  completion 
 of  the  meal  so  that  we  can  then  start  to
[05:53] make  progress  onto  the  next  thing  that 
 is  exactly  how  our  purpose  layers  work 
 and  so  you  can  start  to  see  purpose
[05:59] layers  as  chapters  of  your  life  this 
 chapter  must  be  complete  this  thing  that
[06:04] you're  obsessing  over  let's  say  for 
 example  it's  studying  because  you  have 
 these  this  uh  test  coming  up  six  months
[06:11] from  now  12  months  from  now  and  that 
 test  means  a  lot  to  you  the  current 
 layer  of  your  life  the  purpose  layer  is
[06:17] the  study  and  to  perform  well  in  those 
 tests  why  because  then  the  next  one  is
[06:23] to  then  get  the  job  then  the  next  one  is 
 to  get  a  promotion  in  that  job  then  the
[06:28] next  one  is  to  start  your  own  Clinic 
 we're  always  trying  to  make  progress 
 going  forward  and  so  now  that  you
[06:33] understand  purpose  layers 
 you  can  start  to  try  and
[06:38] understand  which  layer  you're  on  right 
 now  and  where  that  would  most  likely
[06:43] lead  to 
 the  thing  that  you're  currently  obsessed 
 over  that  mission  that  you  need  to
[06:48] complete  right  now  just  like  we  have 
 this  need  to  complete  a  meal  or  this 
 need  to  complete  like  a  sexual  session
[06:55] to  get  to  that  point  of  climax 
 whatever  it  is  for  you
[07:00] that  is  your  current  purpose
[07:06] so  how  do  you  find  this  let's  say  right 
 now 
 it  was  easy  for  you  to  find  yep  of
[07:11] course  this  is  my  purpose  like  okay 
 sweet  but  let's  say  that  there's  quite  a 
 lot  of  men  out  there  who  don't  actually 
 know  the  current  purpose  layer  is  now
[07:18] I'll  happily  admit  to  you  I  don't  know 
 what  the  core  you  know  the  core  the  the 
 middle  of  all  this  is
[07:26] but  I  know  the  layer  and  maybe  you  do 
 but  there  are  some  guys  out  there  who 
 don't  actually  know  okay  how  do  I  find
[07:31] which  layer  am  I  on  and  this  is  why  it's 
 so  important  these  two  words  that  I 
 really  really  think  you  need  to  to  keep
[07:37] in  your  mind 
 destruction  stimulation
[07:42] these  two  things  need  to  be  avoided  if 
 you  actually  want  to  find  out  your 
 current  purpose  layer  so  I  must  ask  you
[07:47] if  you're  a  man  watching  this  right  now 
 and  you're  thinking  wait  I  don't  know 
 the  layer  of  my  purpose  that  I'm 
 currently  on  I  feel  a  bit  directionless
[07:53] I  am  guaranteeing  that  it  is  because  you 
 distract  yourself  and  you  stimulate 
 yourself  too  much  the  way  the  shortcuts
[07:59] are  finding  the  current  purpose  layer  is 
 to  get  rid  of  distractions  get  rid  of 
 stimulation  and  to  sit  in  some  kind  of
[08:05] boring  environment  this  unstimulating 
 environment  where  then  your  brain  can
[08:12] finally  start  to  tick  over  and  realize 
 what's  important  in  your  life  and  so 
 there  is  a  piece  of  advice  that  I've
[08:17] gave  before  accidentally  without  even 
 realizing  how  just  how  valuable  this 
 piece  of  advice  is  and  that  is
[08:23] to  sit  and  to  stare  at  your  wall  to  just 
 stare  at  an  empty  wall  not  a  computer
[08:29] screen  not  to  have  your  phone  or  laptop 
 ready  even  to  journal  or  anything 
 nothing  maybe  a  piece  of  paper  and  a  pen
[08:35] but  just  a  sit  down  maybe  for  hours 
 maybe  for  days  and  don't  be  silly  oh  he
[08:41] said  for  days  now  I'm  gonna  die  of  of 
 starvation  don't  be  silly  but  for  a  good
[08:46] amount  of  time  that  feels  totally 
 uncomfortable  it's  stare  at  the  wall
[08:52] spend  time  not  distracting  yourself 
 spend  time  not  deep  in  the  internet
[08:57] these  modern  inventions  that  hook  our 
 attention  including  YouTube  videos  just
[09:03] like  this  one  you  know  this  can  be  an 
 excellent  source  of  inspiration 
 education  maybe  entertainment  but  in  the
[09:10] end  the  most  important  thing  in  your 
 life  should  be  your  development  as  a  man 
 and  so  maybe  you  are  at  the  point  in
[09:15] life  where  you  need  to  get  rid  of  all 
 the  fluff  maybe  including  my  videos  and 
 literally  just  spend  some  time  some
[09:21] hours  some  days  doing  nothing  to  shut 
 away  to  call  in  sick  from  school  or  work
[09:26] and  to  literally  just  think 
 just  think 
 if  you  can  make  that  promise  to  yourself
[09:32] to  not  quickly  check  on  Instagram  or  to 
 you  know  let  me  uh  check  Discord  quickly 
 oh
[09:37] to  just  allow  your  brain  to  just  free 
 form  just  think  the  message  will  be  sent 
 to  you  your  brain  and  your  body  and  your
[09:43] soul  will  align  and  it  will  tell  you 
 okay  this  is  what  we're  missing  now  this 
 is  the  thing  that  we  need  to  strive  for
[09:50] and  for  most  young  men  it  is  to  do  with 
 either  finances  to  make  money  maybe  to
[09:55] study  and  to  get  into  that  career  or  the 
 University  or  something  to  do  with  like
[10:00] your  physical  fitness  because  that's 
 like  incredibly  important  as  young  men 
 so  a  lot  of  young  guys  have  like  the
[10:05] total  Obsession  of  like  Fitness  or 
 wanting  to  lose  weight  wanting  to  build 
 muscle  you  must  find  your  purpose  layer
[10:11] for  us  to  continue  with  this  video
[10:17] once  you  get  this  idea 
 and  it  will  just  be  that  it  will  just  be 
 an  idea
[10:23] uh  a  vision  an  inclination  of  what  your 
 purpose  layer  could  be
[10:28] that's  when  you  should  throw  yourself 
 into  it  fully 
 so  let's  say  right  now  I'm  a  younger  man
[10:33] who  feels  a  little  bit  directionless  I'm 
 in  school  I'm  in  college  or  something 
 but  it  doesn't  really  feel  like  the
[10:39] thing  that  I  want  to  do  and  you  know  I 
 finish  the  classes  then  I  come  home  and 
 I  just  play  some  video  games  and  I  just
[10:44] kind  of  waste  time  and  go  on  Discord  and 
 stuff  and  I  just  feel  like  a  purposeless 
 young  man  well  I'd  follow  the  advice
[10:49] that  I  just  said  before  and  I'd  you  know 
 I'd  stop  everything  I  wouldn't  go  to 
 class  for  like  two  three  days  you  know
[10:54] maybe  for  the  weekend  would  be  smarter 
 and  I'd  literally  just  stare  at  my  wall 
 and  journal  and  journal  and  journal  and
[10:59] journal  to  my  fingers  ache  about  what  I 
 actually  want  from  my  life  of  what 
 actually  has  meaning  what's  the  point  of
[11:05] of  living  of  my  existence  I  would 
 contemplate  on  my  death  on  my  mother's 
 death  I  would  think  about  these  random
[11:11] deep  things  like  I  would  literally 
 visualize  passing  away  I'd  visualize  my 
 parents  passing  away  just  to  kind  of  you
[11:17] know  start  to  like  spark  some  some 
 thought  some  introspectiveness  and  then 
 it  may  hit  me
[11:22] that 
 what  I  should  actually  be  really 
 obsessing  over  and  spending  my  time  on
[11:28] is 
 health  physical  and  mental  health  to
[11:33] make  sure  I  am  quite  healthy  but  then 
 also  to  learn  the  things  that  creates 
 Health  in  a  person  to  then  also  teach
[11:39] that  to  my  parents  to  make  sure  that 
 they  can  live  a  long  healthy  life  so 
 then  my  mind  starts  to  obsess  over  this
[11:45] this  singular  Vision  like  almost  like  an 
 image  of  just  my  mum  looking  kind  of  old
[11:52] but  also  healthy  at  the  same  time  now 
 this  is  a  very  specific  example  that  I'm 
 giving  you  here  just  you  know  we're
[11:57] imagining  some  random  guy  who's  having 
 these  thoughts 
 that  is  all  it  will  be  for  you
[12:03] perhaps  just  an  image  in  your  mind  a 
 vision  a  feeling  it  will  never  be  a
[12:08] clear  direct  plan  okay  let's  do  this 
 right  now  it  will  never  be  like  that  it 
 will  just  be  some  kind  of  inspiration
[12:14] for  me  personally  my  most  recent  like 
 vision  of  my  new  purpose  layer  was  just
[12:21] a  very  short  mental  movie  of  me  doing 
 Jiu  Jitsu  with  another  another  guy  I'm
[12:27] lean  I  have  I'm  wearing  a  shirt  that's 
 like  skin  tight  like  I'm  very  lean  I'm 
 like  10  body  fat  maybe  even  less  a  shirt
[12:33] is  skin  tight  on  my  on  my  arms  or  my 
 stomach  and  everything  I  don't  have  a 
 stomach  at  all  I've  got  like  a  full-on
[12:38] eight-pack  and  everything  never  been 
 this  lean  before  and  I'm  rolling  around 
 in  this  like  in  a  jiu  jitsu
[12:44] um  training  session  we're  rolling  and  I 
 look  incredible  not  not  in  this  vanity
[12:51] attractiveness  Aesthetics  way  but  like 
 the  way  that  I  move  is  so  impressive  I
[12:56] look  light  I  look  like  an  athlete  I'm 
 flowing  so  perfectly  like  I'm  actually
[13:01] good  at  this  sport  that  I've  been 
 training  for  a  while  it  was  just  this 
 that's  all  it  was  for  me  it  was  just
[13:07] this 
 mental  movie 
 this 
 idea
[13:13] of  being  a  fighter  and  actually  a  pretty 
 good  one 
 that's  how  it  starts
[13:18] once  you  have  this  original  vision  and 
 this  idea  of  what  your  purpose  layer
[13:23] could  be  the  real  way  to  really  find  out 
 exactly  what  your  purpose  layer  is  and  a
[13:28] lot  of  guys  struggle  with  this  but  it's 
 the  take  action  immediately  to  somewhat
[13:34] of  an  extreme  level  to  throw  yourself 
 into  it  fully
[13:39] there's  a  phrase  from  the  book  The  Way 
 of  the  superior  man  by  David  Dieter
[13:44] which  I  absolutely  love  which  is  align 
 100  of  your  life  to  your  purpose
[13:49] I'll  say  that  again  align  100  of  your 
 life  to  your  purpose
[13:54] once  you  start  to  figure  out  okay  what 
 is  your  purpose  layer  you  know  the 
 current  thing  that  we  need  to  work  on
[14:00] the  current  mission  that  we  need  to  peel 
 back  till  we  get  to  the  next  one  and  the 
 next  one  and  the  next  one  it  would  be
[14:05] the  best  thing  that  you  could  possibly 
 do 
 aligning  100  of  the  decisions  you  make
[14:11] the  place  you  live  the  foods  you  eat  the 
 people  you  talk  to  to  this  purpose  layer
[14:16] to  peel  it  back 
 so  for  example  for  me  I  had  this  vision 
 of  like  this  fighting  you  know  this  um
[14:22] rolling  around  doing  Jiu  Jitsu  being 
 like  an  athlete 
 and  so  I  could  try  and  fulfill  this
[14:29] layer  of  my  purpose  like  a  no  I'm  not  I 
 was  gonna  say  no  offense  I  don't  don't
[14:34] want  it  to  seem  like  I'm  saying  this  is 
 you  but  like  how  a  mediocre  man-made  a
[14:39] mediocre  man  would  get  the  same 
 visualization  that  I  did  okay  yeah  oh 
 yeah  I'm  an  athlete  sweet  and  what  he
[14:44] would  do  is  he'd  start  to  he'd  sign  up 
 to  a  Jujitsu  class  and  he'd  go  five
[14:50] times  a  week 
 nice 
 that  man  is  better  than  90  of  the
[14:57] population  of  men 
 95  perhaps 
 and  yet  he's  still  a  mediocre  man
[15:04] you  see  once  you  know  your  purpose  layer 
 maybe  yours  is  studying  right  now  and
[15:09] you  study  for  an  hour  a  day 
 and  then  you  know  you  go  play  some  video 
 games  and  everything  yeah  that  means
[15:14] that  you're  you're  barely  a  mediocre  man 
 and  I'm  not  saying  this  again  to  be
[15:19] insulting  or  anything  to  be  a  superior 
 man  to  be  like  actually  a  masculine  man
[15:24] who  is  on  his  purpose  we  need  to  push 
 closer  to  100  of  your  life  aligned  to
[15:31] this  layer  of  your  of  your  purpose  so 
 for  example  the  media  command  will  get 
 the  vision  that  I  did  and  he'd  start
[15:37] training  a  few  hours  a  week  the  superior 
 man 
 would  go  and  live  in  a  fight  Camp  the
[15:43] superior  man  them  the  man  who's  really 
 like  on  this  would  literally  go  and  live
[15:48] amongst  the  fighters  and  the  Warriors 
 and  live  amongst  them  eat  amongst  them 
 and  be  revolving  around  this  lifestyle
[15:55] as  much  as  possible  when  he's  not 
 training  he's  eating  right  when  he's  not 
 training  or  eating  right  he's  speaking
[16:01] with  other  Fighters  and  asking  them 
 questions 
 there's  a  there's  levels  to  how  much  you
[16:06] can  dedicate  to  your  purpose  and  you  can 
 say  well  of  course  you  know  we've  got 
 commitments  and  we  can't  throw  you  know
[16:11] we  can't  all  just  like  quit  University 
 or  anything  like  this
[16:17] but  the  more  masculine  you  want  to 
 become  the  more  that  you  have  to  align 
 to  your  purpose
[16:24] and  so  this  is  where  it  gets  interesting 
 because  this 
 is  where  some  sacrifices  need  to  be  made
[16:31] and  this  is  actually  where 
 the  life  that  we're  gonna  live  as  young
[16:36] masculine  men 
 it's  going  to  be  so  different  that  we 
 almost  need  like  a  paradigm  shift  like
[16:42] me  and  you  need  to  discuss  a  different 
 kind  of  lifestyle  that  we've  never 
 actually  heard  of  before  because  the  the
[16:48] media  machine  you  know  your  current 
 beliefs  and  perceptions  and  plans  of
[16:54] life  you  know  that  they're  very  very 
 influenced  by  the  things  you've  seen  in 
 like  movies  and  by  modern  standards  you
[16:59] understand  this  right  as  much  as  we 
 would  like  to  be  like  based  guys  the 
 truth  is  a  lot  of  what  we  perceive  Our
[17:06] Lives  to  be  in  a  lot  of  the  beliefs  that 
 we  have  are  actually  made  from  things 
 like  Hollywood  movies  that  we  watch  when
[17:12] we  were  children  and  so  it  is  normal 
 think  about  this  in  inside  of  our  minds 
 even  as  young  masculine  men  inside  of
[17:18] our  minds  roughly  you'll  probably  agree 
 is  this  life  plan  that  okay  we're  young
[17:23] we're  going  to  build  up  all  these  things 
 I'm  gonna  get  into  fitness  and  then  I'm 
 gonna  start  attracting  some  girls  and
[17:28] I'm  gonna  get  into  this  career  or  this 
 business  make  up  a  lot  of  money  and  I'll 
 travel  and  everything  and  then  there'll
[17:33] be  a  point  when  I  will  then  do  the  same 
 thing  for  a  very  long  time  I  will  have  a
[17:38] family  and  I  will  raise  that  family  for 
 18  years  or  longer  I  will  find  a  woman
[17:43] and  I  will  be  with  her  for  20  years  or 
 40  years  or  for  the  rest  of  my  life  we 
 have  this  perception  that  good  equals
[17:49] long-term  stability  good  equals  no 
 change  we  have  this  perception  that  a
[17:54] man  is  supposed  to  build  himself  up  to 
 an  okay  level  and  then  essentially  just 
 do  the  same  thing  for  the  rest  of  his
[17:59] life  that  the  man  who  settles  down  and 
 has  a  family  is  winning
[18:05] and  surely  it  is  right  families  probably 
 the  most  important  thing  right
[18:10] now 
 what  if  it's  not
[18:16] what  if  our  perceptions  of  the  wild  man 
 who  lives  a  masculine  life  of  purpose
[18:21] have  been  brainwashed  and  conditioned  to 
 be  negative
[18:26] because  I  want  you  to  imagine  just  right 
 now  imagine  some  random  Hollywood  movie 
 or  TV  show  that  you've  watched  and
[18:32] imagine  the  40  year  old  man  who 
 eventually  starts  to  be  more  masculine
[18:38] and  discovers  his  purpose  how  is  he 
 portrayed  in  these  movies  this  fourth 
 year  old  man  who's  got  family  and
[18:43] everything  he  realizes  his  purpose  here 
 is  kind  of  done  now  he  shouldn't  abandon 
 his  family  but  he's  got  something  new  to
[18:49] work  on  something  new  that  he's  really 
 starting  to  care  about 
 the  media  portrays  him  as  a  man  who's
[18:57] going  through  a  midlife  crisis  as  a  man 
 who  just  doesn't  know  who  he  is  anymore 
 and  he's  been  a  nuisance  and  his  wife
[19:04] eventually  calms  him  down  come  on  Timmy 
 you're  not  supposed  to  ride  mobile  like 
 she's  saying  this  to  her  40  year  old
[19:10] husband  come  on  like  Timmy  you're  going 
 crazy  huh  look  everyone  he's  got  a 
 motorbike  because  he's  40  years  old  and
[19:15] he's  having  a  midlife  crisis  look  he 
 wants  to  try  this  new  thing  and  he's  not 
 so  good  at  it  come  on  come  back  home
[19:20] back  to  normality  back  to  a  life  of  a 
 lack  of  purpose  and  meaning  come  on
[19:28] yeah  you're  at  risk  of  killing  yourself 
 but  come  on 
 you're  a  mule  you're  supposed  to  just  be
[19:34] a  mule  just  work  just  work  just  work 
 provide  and  then  die
[19:41] don't  be  masculine 
 don't  change  anything  about  your  life
[19:48] don't  be  purposeful  don't  try  new  things 
 you're  supposed  to  be  a  mule  got  it
[19:53] Timmy  come  on  back  to  normality
[19:58] this  is  what  we  see  in  the  modern 
 propaganda  machine  don't  we 
 and
[20:04] similarly  on  you  know  these  movies  these 
 TV  shows  the  good  standing  long-term
[20:10] stable  man  who  works  the  exact  same  job 
 for  40  years  straight  and  you  know  he's
[20:15] really  good  with  his  family  that's  seen 
 as  a  really  positive  thing  now  you  know 
 it  might  seem  weird  what  I'm  saying  here 
 because  I'm  you  know  it  might  seem  like
[20:21] he's  I'm  just  saying  to  not  value  family 
 no  no  it's  not  that  I'm  saying  to 
 devalue  family  it's  what  I'm  saying  is
[20:27] to  understand  that  your  purpose  this 
 layer  that  you  have  to  fulfill  will
[20:32] constantly  keep  changing  and  they  will 
 most  likely  be  a  bit  like  a  purpose 
 layer  to  have  children  and  to  raise  them
[20:38] but  then  your  purpose  layer  will  update 
 and  it  will  change  and  there  will  be
[20:43] more  that  you  have  to  do  with  your  life 
 more  than  just  being  a  father  who  pays 
 for  his  children  and  his  wife
[20:49] there  will  be  more 
 now  I  don't  have  children  I  I  don't
[20:55] shouldn't  even  be  able  to  like  you  know 
 talk  about  what  a  father  should  do  you 
 know  we  can  leave  that  to  men  who  are 
 way  more  experienced  in  that  area  but
[21:02] the  more  that  I  understand  and  learn 
 about  purpose  the  more  that  I'm  starting 
 to  Envision  this  life  that  I  want  you  to
[21:08] visualize  we've  thought  that  okay  you 
 know  build  ourselves  up  in  our  20s  have 
 some  kind  of  career  or  business  that  you
[21:14] know  really  really  pops  off  and  we  get 
 really  successful  and  then  we  just  kind 
 of  you  know  it's  almost  like  a  vague 
 gray  thing  of  like  oh  yeah  and  then  the
[21:20] years  will  slip  by  really  fast  and  we'll 
 just  keep  doing  the  same  thing  the  same 
 business  the  same  career  for  the  rest  of
[21:25] our  lives  till  eventually  we  like  we 
 just  want  to  retire  we  probably  won't 
 want  to  retire  because  retirement's 
 boring  so  we'll  just  continue  the  same
[21:31] thing  forever  that's  how  kind  of  our 
 perception  of  things  but  I  want  you  to 
 visualize  right  now  what  if  we  chased
[21:37] the  layer  of  our  purpose  always  what  if 
 we  are  every  single  time  we  had  a  new
[21:42] layer  we  threw  in  100  of  our  life  to  it 
 we  aligned  as  much  of  our  life  to  it
[21:48] I  want  you  to  start  to  visualize 
 potentially 
 this  new  lifestyle
[21:54] where  it's  like  you've  lived  so  many 
 many 
 lives  in  one  wherefore  two  years  of  your
[22:02] life  you  were  so  into  this  one  thing 
 like  for  example  becoming  a  fighter  and 
 you  were  living  in  Brazil  doing  Jiu
[22:08] Jitsu  or  you  were  in  Thailand  learning 
 Muay  Thai  every  single  day  for  four 
 hours  that  was  your  life  that  was  how
[22:13] you  lived  and  then  when  that  layer  of 
 purpose  was  complete  and  it  was  time  to
[22:18] get  into  sailing  you  got  into  sailing 
 and  you  you  did  that  for  six  months  or  a
[22:23] year  to  till  that  layer  of  purpose  was 
 complete  and  then  it  was  time  for  you  to 
 learn  this  random  language  or  for  you  to 
 learn  about  artificial  intelligence
[22:29] because  this  was  the  thing  that  now  okay 
 I  need  to  understand  this  I  need  to 
 understand  this 
 and  it's  like  you've  lived  multiple  many
[22:35] many  lives  and  that  usually  is  seen  as  a 
 bad  thing  because  long-term  stability  of 
 a  career  or  a  business  is  usually  like
[22:41] the  player  right  long-term  thinking  is  a 
 good  thing  right 
 and  it  would  seem  so  weird  if  I  told  you
[22:46] that  perhaps  long-term  thinking  maybe
[22:51] weirdly 
 catastrophic  for  masculine  men
[22:57] because  this  idea  of  okay  just  get  to  a 
 point  and  then  do  the  same  thing  for  40 
 years  it  defies  what  your  purpose  most
[23:04] likely  how  your  purpose  is  going  to  be 
 working
[23:12] now  this  is  the  point  right  now 
 where  you  figured  out  your  purpose  layer
[23:17] and  you're  starting  to  realize  okay  I 
 should  align  100  of  my  life  to  peeling 
 back  these  layers  and  just  seeing  where
[23:23] that  would  take  me 
 to  peel  back  the  current  purpose  layer
[23:29] it's  going  to  require  sacrifice 
 mine  right  now  seems  to  be  based  on  two
[23:36] things  mine  is  on  fighting  you  know 
 becoming  that  athlete  and  also  very 
 interestingly  like  there's  another  like
[23:41] almost  half  purpose  that  I  have  which  is 
 about  investing  to  like  stack  like
[23:46] long-term  serious  Investments  That  Then 
 retire  like  my  family  and  everything
[23:51] right  those  are  like  my  two  focuses 
 to  make  progress  in  this  purpose  layer
[23:57] you  have  to  sacrifice  things 
 and  that  seems  obvious  right  so  if 
 you're  a  young  guy  right  now  and  your
[24:02] purpose  your  obsession  seems  to  be  on 
 your  Fitness  and  you  really  want  to 
 build  like  a  good  body  you  really  want 
 to  lose  some  weight  so  you  can  finally
[24:08] feel  like  you're  like  a  respectable 
 younger  man  that  you're  full  of 
 confidence  and  that  means  so  much  to  you
[24:13] you're  gonna  need  to  sacrifice  the 
 things 
 that  you  know  you've  got  to  get  rid  of
[24:19] the  junk  food 
 the  the  sleep-ins 
 of  course  sleep  is  important  but  you
[24:25] know  like  oh  you've  stayed  up  till  1am 
 playing  games  and  stuff  and  now  you're
[24:30] gonna  wake  up  at  11  P.M  tomorrow  sleep 
 Disturbed  blue  light  at  night  time  and
[24:35] everything  you're  gonna  need  to 
 sacrifice  those  snacks  you're  gonna  need 
 to  sacrifice  going  on  like  meeting  your
[24:40] friends  for  lunch  because  you  always  go 
 to  unhealthy  places
[24:46] to  make  a  lot  of  progress  in  the  layer 
 of  your  purpose  you  need  to  be  okay  with
[24:52] making  sacrifices  this  is  where  most 
 guys  find  it  very  difficult  to  make 
 progress  and  why  most  men  are  stuck  in
[24:59] this  this  man  child  stage  of  not 
 fulfilling  their  purpose  is  because
[25:04] making  a  sacrifice  is  incredibly  hard 
 especially  in  the  modern  day  you  know
[25:09] it's  sacrificing 
 in  the  modern  days  difficult  because 
 food  has  been  made  to  be  addictive
[25:15] technology  has  been  made  to  be  addictive 
 so  we  feel  genuine  spiritual  physical
[25:20] mental  pain  when  we  try  to  sacrifice 
 something  that  we  have  like  a  mild 
 addiction  to
[25:29] I  sacrificed 
 some  level  of  Fame  for  my  purpose  I
[25:35] could  have  kept  on  going  with  this  like 
 YouTube  content  consumption  machine  with 
 a  massive  team  to  keep  thinking  okay
[25:40] let's  get  to  5  million  Subs  this  year 
 then  10  million  next  year  that  was  the 
 track  that  I  was  going  for
[25:46] and  I  kept  on  pushing  it  even  though  my 
 purpose  changed  in  my  mind  and  my  heart 
 I  kept  on  just  going  through  the  same
[25:51] thing  because  I  didn't  want  to  sacrifice 
 like  this  YouTube  career  that  I  had 
 built  up
[25:57] So  eventually  it  hit  me  like  this  is  the 
 thing  I  have  to  sacrifice  now  of  course 
 I  can  every  now  and  then  I  can  sit  down
[26:02] for  an  hour  and  you  know  try  and  teach 
 you  something  that  will  genuinely  try 
 and  help  you  just  because  you  know  it's 
 like
[26:07] I  like  kind  of  talking  and  teaching 
 that's  kind  of  nice 
 but  what  we  had  previously  and  the  huge
[26:13] level  we  were  trying  to  push  for  you 
 know  myself  and  my  team  I  sacrificed 
 that  because  it  was  a  huge  distraction
[26:19] away  from  the  new  thing  that  I  wanted  to 
 do  I  don't  want  to  record  videos  every 
 single  day  I  don't  want  to  try  and  get
[26:24] like  lots  of  lots  of  views  and  and  watch 
 time  and  you  know  more  subscribers  I 
 don't  care  about  any  of  that  I  had  to
[26:30] sacrifice  it  so  that  I  could  focus  more 
 on  fighting  and  investing  and  you  know 
 to  have  like  my  brain  and  my  time  freed
[26:37] up 
 so  what  you've  seen  in  front  of  you  just 
 in  the  last  week  is
[26:43] a  example  of  sacrifice 
 and so  I  want  you  to  think  right  now  of
[26:49] where  you're  up  to 
 what  your  purpose  layer  is  and  this  is 
 so  interesting  right  I  want  you  to  think
[26:56] of  the  things  that  you  could  potentially 
 sacrifice  so  that  you  could  make  more 
 progress  in  this  purpose  layer  you  know
[27:02] to  peel  it  back  to  like  fulfill  it  this 
 mission  of  yours  right 
 and  there's  gonna  be  something  perhaps
[27:07] it's  already  happened  there's  gonna  be 
 something  that  there  is  a  potential 
 sacrifice  a  very  valuable  thing  to
[27:13] sacrifice  like  it'll  make  a  lot  of 
 progress  if  you  did  and  your  brain  will 
 argue  against  it  because  of  the
[27:19] addiction  to  the  thing 
 you  what  I  found  is  that  the  thing  that
[27:24] you  need  to  sacrifice  is  actually  the 
 thing  that  your  own  brain  will  defend 
 the  most  but  it's  almost  like  your  brain
[27:30] is  going  to  start  to  split  in  half  right 
 now  and  this  is  going  to  give  you  like 
 slightly  mental  problems  your  brain  is 
 going  to  start  to  argue  with  itself  of
[27:36] whether  or  not  this  this  thing  that's  in 
 your  mind  that  you  could  sacrifice 
 should  be  sacrificed  and  you're  like
[27:41] okay  I  know  I  know  technically  that 
 that's  a  bad  thing  for  my  purpose  layer 
 but  then  you  know  I  really  like  it  and
[27:47] what  if  I  do  this  and  what  if  I  cope 
 like  this  and  I'll  keep  coping  I'll  keep 
 coping  and  I'll  keep  coping  and  I'll 
 keep  making  excuses  right
[27:53] it's  okay  right 
 sure  you  can  you  know  whatever  the
[27:59] excuse  is  in  your  mind  whatever  this 
 thing  that  you  need  to  sacrifice  maybe 
 it's  junk  food  for  a  fat  guy  maybe  it's
[28:04] a  weed  for  a  stone  or  whatever  it  is 
 right  there's  some  usually  instant 
 gratification  by  the  dopamine  bad  habits
[28:10] that  you  need  to  sacrifice  to  make  the 
 real  progress  to  your  purpose  and  when 
 you  refuse  to  do  it  you  live  like  a
[28:16] shell  of  the  man  that  you're  supposed  to 
 you  lose  respect  for  yourself  it's  like 
 metaphorically  your  dick  gets  smaller
[28:26] when  you  don't  live  to  your  purpose  as 
 close  to  a  hundred  percent  and  there  is 
 something  clear  in  your  mind  that  you
[28:32] should  sacrifice  but  you're  not 
 sacrificing  it 
 it  starts  to  fully  destroy  your
[28:39] perception  of  yourself  it  starts  to  make 
 you  feel  weak  it  starts  to  make  you  feel 
 insecure  your  ability  to  hold  eye
[28:45] contact  with  people  especially  women's 
 thoughts  that  drastically  go  down 
 your  ability  to  still  have  like  an  open
[28:51] confident  body  language  especially  when 
 another  man  who's  somewhat  intimidating 
 who's  bigger  in  size  than  you  walks  in
[28:58] and  he  holds  your  eye  contact  and  you 
 look  away  or  you  you  seem  to  speak  with 
 like  a  higher  pitched  voice  you  become
[29:03] less  of  a  man  when  you  don't  sacrifice 
 the  thing  that  you're  supposed  to  do
[29:08] and  I  know  this  because  two  years  ago 
 for  me  it  was  weed 
 the  purpose  layer  that  I  had  in  2022
[29:15] years  ago  just  before  the  start  of  covet 
 was  to  become  an  entrepreneur  and  to 
 make  money  online  and  to  get  to  achieve
[29:21] Freedom  through  that  I  wanted  to 
 specifically  make  money  online  and  be  in 
 Thailand  which  I've  kind  of  achieved  now 
 but  it's  like  doesn't  really  you  know
[29:27] that  was  the  all-purpose  layer  anyway 
 right  so  early  2020  that's  what  I  wanted 
 to  do  I  wanted  to  be  an  entrepreneur
[29:32] make  money  online  and  everything  and  the 
 thing  that  was  stopping  me  the  thing 
 that  I  needed  to  sacrifice  but  I  kept  on 
 delaying  it  was  smoking  weed  because
[29:38] yeah  you  know  but  it's  really  nice  at 
 the  end  of  a  hard  day  and  I've  been 
 really  working  hard  and  it's  relaxing
[29:43] and  it's  really  fun  and  you  know  I've 
 got  a  girl  there  who  makes  the  sex 
 better  and  everything  and  you  know 
 you've  got  to  have  a  break  sometimes  and
[29:48] everything  it's  kind  of  nice  to  smoke 
 and  you  sometimes  I  smoke  and  I  journal 
 and  I  like  to  smoke  and  it's  chilling
[29:53] here 
 imagine  that  version  of  me  who's  making
[29:58] these  excuses  who  knew  what  he  should  do 
 who  knew  what  he  should  sacrifice  but 
 didn't  make  those  choices
[30:05] imagine  that  version  of  me 
 who  had  this  mental  turbulence  in  his
[30:10] mind 
 do  you  think  I  would  have  been  totally 
 present  and  loving  and  masculine  then  or
[30:17] do  you  think  I  would  have  neurotically 
 had  like 
 self-obsessed  thoughts  anxious  thoughts
[30:22] in  my  mind 
 do  you  think  not  to  be  vulgar  but  when  I
[30:27] did  have  sex  my  erection  would  have  been 
 Rock  Hard  or  do  you  think  every  now  and 
 then  it  would  have  just  went  softer  for
[30:32] seemingly  no  reason  because  all  of  these 
 things  are  correlated
[30:37] all  of  them  are 
 your  level  of  masculinity  of  course  is
[30:42] colorated  to  the  the  firmness  of  your 
 erection  of  course  it  is
[30:48] and  so  rewind  back  two  years  from  now 
 2020  you  know  making  these  excuses  I
[30:53] don't  want  to  stop  smoking  weed  even 
 though  I  have  this  very  clear  purpose 
 layer  which  is  to  become  an  entrepreneur 
 and  achieve  the  freedom
[30:59] and  I'm  not  making  that  choice  I'm  not 
 making  that  sacrifice  and  I  didn't  for 
 months  and  months  and  months  and  I  hate
[31:05] in  my  life 
 and  I  started  to  hate  myself  and  I 
 started  to  look  at  myself  in  the  mirror
[31:10] with  this  like  vacant  dead-eyed 
 expression  high  so  high  so  stoned  at
[31:17] like  1am 
 looking  at  myself  in  the  mirrors  if  I'm 
 like 
 like  this
[31:23] whilst  I'm  having  like  a  piss  or 
 something 
 no  care  in  the  world
[31:34] is  that  the  kind  of  life  that  we  should 
 live 
 now  when  you  think  about  me  like  me  like
[31:40] you  know  what  you  know  of  me  right 
 that's  very  different  to  who  I  am  today 
 but  when  you  think  about  that  version  of
[31:45] me 
 and  think  that  what  it  took  for  me  to 
 make  progress  to  become  the  man  that  I
[31:50] am  today 
 was  sacrificing  something  that  I  didn't 
 want  to  sacrifice
[31:56] isn't  it  very  easy  for  you  to  sit  there 
 right  now  and  think  okay  that's  silly 
 like  he  should  have  just  sacrificed  weed
[32:01] faster  of  course  he  should  right  think 
 about  how  much  I  was  losing  out  on 
 it's  like
[32:06] it's  a  no-brainer 
 when  you  think  about  it  from  someone 
 else's  perspective  you're  thinking  about
[32:12] it  from  me  yeah  it's  a  no-brainer  that 
 you  should  quit  smoking  weed  hams  of 
 course  right  and  I'm  talking  about  like 
 you  know  two  years  ago  right
[32:18] well  then  for  me  to  think  about  that 
 with  you  it's  a  no-brainer  that  this 
 thing  that  you're  not  sacrificing  that
[32:23] you  probably  should  it's  a  no-brainer 
 for  me  to  think  wait  bro  this  thing  that 
 you're  not  sacrificing  whatever  it  is
[32:28] for  you 
 it  is  a  no-brainer 
 that  you  should
[32:34] because  the  gain  of  aligning  100  of  your 
 life  to  your  purpose  that  peel  back  this 
 layer  is  is  huge  so  this  thing  in  your
[32:41] mind  right  now  this  bad  habit  that  you 
 don't  want  to  get  rid  of  that  you  keep 
 coping  and  saying  that  oh  no  but  it 
 could  be  okay  like  if  it's  like  this
[32:46] could  be  okay  it's  only  a  little  bit
[32:54] you  know  exactly  what  you  should  do  and 
 up  until  you  do  that  you  will  you  will 
 not  feel  like  a  full  true  man  and  when
[33:00] you  do  make  that  decision  finally 
 it's  like  you  will  just  be  filled  with
[33:05] this  extra  level  of 
 shiva-like  masculine  energy
[33:11] you  will  literally  walk  up  straighter 
 like  your  chest  will  stick  out  more 
 you'll  gain  muscle  faster  like  all  these
[33:17] masculine  random  things  will  be  better 
 the  more  that  you  align  yourself  to  your 
 purpose  and  it  takes  sacrifice
[33:30] this  is  also  the  points  where  every  step 
 of  the  journey  every  bit  of  progress
[33:37] that  you  make  feels  amazing 
 so  when  you  know  what  your  your  current
[33:43] purpose  layer  your  mission  is  and  you 
 make  progress  towards  it
[33:48] you  feel 
 happy  blissful
[33:53] free 
 it's  amazing  imagine  you  really  really 
 care  about  your  body  transformation  and
[33:59] you  go  and  hit  a  great  workout  and  then 
 you  also  end  the  day  on  the  perfect 
 macronutrients  you  feel  amazing  it's
[34:05] like  that  thing  today  has  just  given  you 
 life  you  go  to  bed  literally  with  a
[34:10] smile  on  your  face  excited  for  tomorrow 
 let's  do  it  again  let's  do  it  again 
 let's  do  it  again  the  masculine  man
[34:16] has  most  of  all  about  making  progress  to 
 something  meaningful  and  this  is  why  men
[34:22] who  are  actually  on  their  purpose  men 
 who  are  doing  the  right  things  men  who 
 have  set  those  goals  and  are  on  on  track
[34:28] to  achieve  those  goals  men  who  said  that 
 they  were  going  to  hit  six  workouts  this 
 week  and  literally  are  on  the  sixth
[34:33] workout  this  week  that's  why  and  how  and 
 when  as  men  we  feel  good
[34:38] You've  Been  Told 
 by  again  like  you  know  these  like 
 Outsiders  these  unmasculine  people  these
[34:44] feminine  men  these  male  feminists  these 
 women  who  are  masculine  but  then  they 
 tell  you  not  to  be  masculine  you've  been
[34:50] told  by  these  people  who  don't  even  like 
 you  that  as  a  man  you  should  just  be 
 happy  whenever  you  indulge  that  it's
[34:56] okay  to  be  weak  it's  okay  to  be  soft 
 it's  okay  to  be  fat  well  it's  not 
 you  want  to  know  how  I  know  it's  not  you
[35:01] know  you  want  to  know  how  I  can  give  a 
 guaranteed  statement 
 of  truth  of  objective  universal  truth
[35:08] because  we  feel  terrible  when  we're  not 
 achieving  something  we  as  men  feel  awful 
 when  we're  not  making  progress  that  is
[35:14] why  you  see  the  hordes  of  millions  of 
 men  who  are  who  sink  deeper  and  deeper 
 into  technology  because  they  need  to
[35:20] stimulate  and  distract  themselves 
 because  these  kinds  of  men  who  aren't 
 making  progress  in  goals  literally  would
[35:25] feel  terrible  if  they  just  sat  there  for 
 one  minute  in  total  Consciousness  if  not
[35:30] distracting  themselves  imagine  you  talk 
 a  guy  who  genuinely  had  not  made  real 
 good  progress  to  some  kind  of  important
[35:35] goal  or  purpose  for  the  last  year  you 
 know  he's  just  been  wasting  away  like  a 
 Jeffrey  he's  just  been  playing  video
[35:40] games  smoking  weed  and  stuff  and  the 
 thing  is  he  can  still  say  that  he's  kind 
 of  enjoying  himself  because  he  plays  the
[35:45] newest  video  game  and  he  smokes  more 
 weed  and  you  know  he  does  all  those 
 things  imagine  taking  that  guy  locking 
 him  into  a  room  where  he  doesn't  have
[35:51] his  phone  or  anything  he  would  hate  it 
 wouldn't  it  so  we  can  say  with  certainty
[35:56] because  we  can  also  compare  that  to  the 
 man  who's  imagine  the  man  who's  been 
 making  so  much  progress  imagine  the  man
[36:01] who  genuinely  set  this  very  like  you 
 know  worthwhile  goal  this  purpose  that 
 he  knows  that  he  should  fulfill  and  he's
[36:07] made  amazing  progress  to  that  imagine 
 the  man  who  literally  has  hit  the 
 perfect  macronutrient  so  that  he's  had
[36:12] the  perfect  workout  today  he's  also  done 
 his  business  work  right  and  then  we  lock 
 that  man  into  into  an  empty  room
[36:17] that  at  that  this  second  man  who's  made 
 a  good  amount  of  progress  in  progress 
 he's  going  to  be  smiling  there  doing
[36:22] push-ups  he's  like  okay  whatever  I  don't 
 care  like  I've  already  hit  my  macros  for 
 today  I've  already  like  checked  off  all
[36:27] the  boxes  today  I  feel  awesome
[36:32] so  you  want  to  know  the  secrets  to 
 feeling  good  to  feeling  happy  to  feeling
[36:37] Pleasant  and  joyful  and  and  humorous  as 
 a  man
[36:43] make  progress  in  your  purpose  Leia 
 it's  that  simple 
 your  happiness  does  not  come  from
[36:48] stimulation  your  happiness  does  not  come 
 from  Indulgence  of  drugs  or  video  games 
 or  any  of  these  things  from  weed  or  any
[36:54] of  these  things 
 it  comes  from  progress  to  your  purpose
[36:59] layer 
 if  as  a  man  you  are  making  good  progress 
 to  your  purpose  you  will  feel  happy
[37:05] around  the  clock  but  if  you  are  not 
 making  good  progress  to  your  purpose 
 based  on  your  own  perception  of  your  you
[37:12] know  your  strength  your  dedication  and 
 everything  based  on  your  own  talents 
 you  will  feel  bad
[37:17] so  I  want  you  to  just  take  a  quick 
 little  second  right  now  and  to  just  kind 
 of  think  okay
[37:22] it's  currently  you  know  as  I'm  recording 
 this  it's  February  2023  maybe  you're 
 watching  it  at  a  different  time  but  it's
[37:27] February  2023  we've  been  in  this  new 
 year  now  for  one  month  and  one  week  or 
 so  how  happy  and  pleasant  and  positive
[37:34] have  I  been  for  this  last  month  ask 
 yourself  that  question  how  happy 
 Pleasant  and  positive  have  you  felt  in
[37:41] the  last  month 
 unless  there's  been  some  kind  of  like 
 very  unpl  like  you  know  some  significant
[37:47] event  like  a  family  member  passes  but 
 let's  say  it's  just  a  normal  you  know 
 last  month  no  one  has  passed  away  or
[37:52] anything  like  that  right  there's  no  like 
 serious  car  accidents  or  anything  right 
 it's  just  Monday  normal  life
[37:58] if  you  answer  this  question  like  yeah 
 actually  I've  been  really  happy  chances 
 are  that  you've  been  making  a  really 
 good  amount  of  progress  to  your  purpose
[38:04] now  if  you  answer  this  question  and  say 
 no  I'm  actually  depressed  and  I  take 
 antidepressants  and  it's  not  because  of
[38:09] purpose  or  anything  no  no  it's  a 
 clinical  problem  it's  a  biological  thing 
 and  I  take  anti-anti  anxiety  medication
[38:16] and  no  it's  not  because  I  I  spend  all 
 day  on  the  Internet  or  anything  it's 
 because  of  something  else
[38:22] there's  men  out  there  who  don't  feel 
 good  who  haven't  felt  good  in  a  long 
 time  who  need  to  like  take  pills  and 
 everything  to  still  not  even  feel  good
[38:31] simply  because  they're  not  making 
 progress 
 when  you  make  progress  understand  this
[38:36] when  you  make  progress  to  your  purpose 
 you  feel  good  every  step  of  the  way  you 
 feel  good
[38:41] so you  can  just  start  to  evaluate  how 
 good  your  days  feel 
 and  that  will  tell  you  how  much  more
[38:48] like  you  can  put  in 
 and  you  would  be  surprised  by  the  way 
 you  know  I'm  telling  you  okay  align  as
[38:53] much  as  of  your  life  as  you  can  to  your 
 purpose  you  would  be  surprised  at  just 
 how  much  you  can  actually  do
[39:00] you  know  with  all 
 all  of  like  the  advice  that  men  get
[39:05] toxic  advice  that  men  get  not  not  from 
 hopefully  not  from  men  like  me  but  from
[39:10] like  the  male  family  you  know  from  like 
 those  people  who  give  us  advice  they 
 tell  us  open  up  and  be  emotional  and  cry
[39:16] and  it's  okay  to  be  weak  it's  okay  to  be 
 feminine  all  those  people  say  this  to  us 
 the  thing  is  with  all  of  the  advice  they
[39:22] give  us 
 it  doesn't  actually  work 
 The  Man  Who  Lies  around  who  says  it's
[39:28] okay  to  be  weak  who  plays  video  games 
 that's  stereotypical  guys  on
[39:33] antidepressants 
 you  see  the  rise  of  like  the 
 antidepressant  influencer  giving
[39:38] happiness  and  mental  health  advice  to 
 other  guys
[39:43] why  we  should  we  listen  to  them 
 to  be  happy  all  you  have  to  do  is  is
[39:49] make  progress  to  your  purpose  if  you're 
 not  happy 
 and  there  hasn't  been  some  kind  of
[39:54] chaotic  events  recently  like  some  car 
 accident  or  family  member  death  it's 
 simply  because  you've  not  made  enough
[39:59] progress  it's  as  simple  as  that 
 all  right
[40:04] so  now  we've  made  a  lot  of  progress  to 
 this  purpose  layer  and  this  is  where  it
[40:09] gets  interesting  now 
 it's  completed 
 so  whatever  you  know  this  big  mission  is
[40:15] on  in  your  mind  right  now  whether  it's 
 studying  or  getting  really  fit  or 
 whatever  right  this  is  the  thing  we're 
 obsessing  over  obsessing  over  obsessing
[40:21] over  it's  going  to  be  so  good  once  we've 
 completed  this  thing  once  I've  done  that 
 exam  and  I've  got  the  grade  that's  going
[40:26] to  get  me  into  University  it's  going  to 
 be  so  good  once  I  build  the  body  it's 
 going  to  be  so  good  I'm  peeling  back 
 this  layer  of  my  line  in  as  much  of  my
[40:31] life  as  I  can  to  it  and  it's  done 
 oh
[40:36] it's  done 
 so 
 this  is  how  it  feels  when  you  complete  a
[40:42] layer  of  your  purpose 
 just  like  that  it's  the  it's  the
[40:47] equivalent  of  like  just  a  board  shrug 
 for  so  long  we  hyped  up  this  thing  I've
[40:53] made  a  long  video  explaining  okay  the 
 benefits  of  purpose  whoa  and  when  you 
 actually  complete  a  layer  of  your
[40:58] purpose  it  literally  just  feels  like 
 whatever  so  actually  it's  kind  of  stupid
[41:03] you'll  specifically  look  at  the  layer  of 
 purpose  that  you've  spent  so  long  on  and 
 you're  almost  like  downplay  it  it  almost
[41:09] will  seem  silly  it'll  almost  seem  a 
 little  bit  stupid  it'll  seem  like  it  was 
 kind  of  like  a  waste  of  time  it'll  be
[41:14] weird  right  you're  right  now  you're 
 thinking  wait  wait  I'm  never  gonna  be 
 like  that  wait  what  no  no  I'm  studying 
 I'm  gonna  get  a  good  grade  and  it's
[41:19] gonna  be  super  important  I  promise  you 
 when  you  complete  the  layer  of  your 
 purpose  you're  gonna  look  back  to  all  of
[41:24] the  work  you've  just  put  in  in  this  one 
 particular  thing  when  you  truly  complete 
 it  right  and  it's  almost  gonna  seem
[41:30] weird  why  you  put  in  that  much  work  into 
 it  and  it's  going  to  be  so 
 anti-climactic  it's  going  to  be  kind  of
[41:35] boring  you're  going  to  be  just  thinking 
 okay  what  was  the  point  in  all  that  it 
 was  just  silly  this  is  how  I  feel  about
[41:40] the  big  YouTube  operation  that  we  had 
 and  one  and  a  half million  subscribers 
 that  meant  so  much  to  me  I  was  literally
[41:45] like  writing  down  these  goals  sticking 
 piece  of  papers  with  like  you  know  1 
 million  subscribers  five  1.5  like  all
[41:51] around  my  wall  as  if  it  was  the  most 
 important  thing  ever  now  I  look  at  it  as 
 if  it  was  just  like  that  she's  silly
[41:56] this  is  how  it  actually  works  once  you 
 complete  a  layer  of  your  purpose 
 something  inside  of  us  has  been
[42:02] meticulously  made  to  make  us 
 move  away  from  it
[42:09] this  is  so  interesting  something  inside 
 of  us  as  men  in  general  has  been  made  so
[42:14] that  we  feel  some  kind  of  boredom  and 
 indifference  and  almost  like  slightly
[42:19] resentful  for  the  time  that  we've  just 
 spent  on  this  goal  you've  probably  heard 
 of  this  too 
 isn't  it  kind  of  normal  commenter  here
[42:26] of  a  man  who  achieves  like  this  big  goal 
 that  he  had  set  out  and  then  he  just 
 kind  of  feels  depressed  afterwards  he
[42:32] just  kind  of  feels  bored  afterwards 
 you've  thought  that  hitting  a  million 
 subscribers  would  make  you  really  happy
[42:37] you  think  this  right  now  right  if  you're 
 like  a  young  YouTuber  you  think  right 
 here  right  now  one  million  subscribers 
 would  make  me  so  happy  I  guarantee  you
[42:43] right  now  you  know  how  it  actually  feels 
 from  a  guy  who's  genuinely  got  that  at 
 999  000  you  feel  like  this
[42:49] at  a  million  you  feel  like  this 
 there's  no  difference  achieving  some  Big
[42:54] Goal  as  a  guy  literally  does  not  make 
 you  feel  any  different  and  so  you're 
 maybe  wondering  okay
[42:59] why  why is  it  like  this 
 well  remember  what  I  just  said  before
[43:05] that  we  as  a  man  feel  good  when  we  make 
 progress
[43:10] to  some  meaningful  goals  a  layer  of  our 
 purpose  the  reason  why  when  you  open  up
[43:15] and  fulfill  a  layer  of  your  purpose  when 
 you  complete  a  big  goal  and  you  have 
 these  accomplishment  that  you've  been 
 working  so  hard  for  the  reason  why  after
[43:21] you've  done  it  doesn't  even  feel  that 
 good  is  because  straight  away
[43:27] you  are  now  ready  to  make  progress  in 
 the  next  thing  and  so  a  lot  of  men  stay
[43:34] here 
 in  this  this  feeling  of  like  sadness  and
[43:39] thinking  wait  why  did  I  work  so  hard  for 
 this  thing  it's  pointless  and  you  know 
 they  waste  time  and  maybe  they  over
[43:44] indulge  in  partying  and  drugs  they're 
 celebrating  stuff 
 and  it  just  this  is  like  something  that
[43:49] that  freaks  men  out  and  you  might  not  be 
 here  just  yet  it  might  seem  really  weird 
 to  you  and  you're  so  convinced  that
[43:54] you're  not  going  to  be  like  this  chances 
 are  you  probably  are 
 it  just  seems  strange  and  the  reason  why
[44:00] it's  so  anti-climatic  when  you  complete 
 a  layer  of  your  purpose
[44:05] is  because 
 you've  got  to  be  ready  for  the  next  one 
 we  as  men  feel  good  when  we  make
[44:11] progress 
 when  we  accomplish  something  you  know 
 the  moment  of  Celebration  that  we've
[44:16] done  the  thing  it  often  feels 
 anticlimactic  it  often  does  if  not  then
[44:21] in  the  moment  of  Celebration  then 
 afterwards  you're  you  often  look  back  to 
 the  thing  that  you've  dedicated  your
[44:26] life  to  for  the  last  few  years  and  you 
 think  it's  just  silly  Mike  Tyson  he  did
[44:31] some  kind  of  interview  with  a  news 
 reporter  brings  him  in  to  see  his  belts 
 and  all  this  and  you  know  the  news
[44:36] reporter  shows  and  pictures  and 
 everything  of  him  with  the  belts  and 
 Mike  Tyson  literally  says  it's  all
[44:41] garbage  it  doesn't  mean  anything  it's 
 all  garbage 
 that's  a  little  bit  like  how  you  will
[44:47] feel  about  when  this  moment  that  you've 
 completed  a  layer  of  your  purpose  that's 
 how  well  literally  I  was  speaking  to  my
[44:52] best  friend  Sam  about  the  YouTube 
 channel  I  Paul  it's  just  stupid  it's 
 just  it's  just  silly  now  of  course  it's
[44:57] not  from  your  perspective  if  you're  like 
 a  pretty  big  fan  of  mine  you'll  probably 
 be  thinking  that  this  is  weird  but
[45:03] literally  just  three  days  ago  I'm 
 literally  looking  at  the  whole  channel 
 the  videos  and  thinking  bro  it's  just 
 stupid  it's  just  stupid  it's  just  silly
[45:08] it's  just  like  oh  Jeffrey  I'm  just 
 making  fun  of  it  myself  and  I'm  almost 
 saying  the  exact  same  things  that  Mike
[45:14] Tyson  said  about  his  heavyweight  belts 
 this  doesn't  mean  that  objectively  it's 
 a  stupid  thing  because  objectively  Mike
[45:20] Tyson  became  a  legend  forever 
 objectively  like  the  videos  that  I've
[45:25] made  have  probably  helped  quite  a  lot  of 
 guys  out  there  so  it's  not  a  stupid 
 thing  and  yet  it  feels  like  it  is  for
[45:30] you  once  you've  completed  it  and  the 
 reason  why  is  most  likely  this  is  like 
 so  divine
[45:36] creation  inside  of  us  it's  so  that  we 
 don't  get 
 hooked  onto  this  one  thing  that  now
[45:42] we've  completed  and  it  allows  us  space 
 to  then  focus  on  the  next  thing  so  once
[45:47] you've  completed  this  this  layer  of  your 
 purpose  that  you've  spent  so  long  on 
 you've  studied  for  this  exam  and  you  got
[45:52] the  grade  that  you  wanted  and  now  you're 
 in  college  well 
 it's  time  to  now  focus  on  the  next  layer
[45:59] as  a  man  it  is  always  constant  striving 
 for  progress  on  the  layer  that  we're  in
[46:05] and  sometimes 
 you  won't  even  enjoy  celebrating  for  an
[46:10] hour  once  you've  completed  a  layer 
 sometimes  you'll  complete  a  layer  and
[46:15] literally  just  want  to  start  moving  on 
 to  the  next  one  immediately  sometimes 
 you'll  want  to  move  on  to  the  next  one 
 before  you've  even  totally  completed
[46:20] this  one 
 this  is  how  it  will  feel
[46:25] anticlimactic  bored  but  not  because  this 
 isn't  a  journey  that's  worth  going  on
[46:31] but  simply  just  because  we're  supposed 
 to  feel  quite  disinterested  in  this  old
[46:37] thing  which  is  no  longer  our  purpose 
 and  so  we  go  back  to  the  previous  stage
[46:42] remember  where  we  don't  really  know  our 
 purpose  so  we  kind  of  are  open  and  we 
 don't  distract  ourselves  we  don't
[46:47] stimulate  ourselves  we  stare  at  our  wall 
 we're  kind  of  open  to  new  ideas  and  then 
 we  get  that  vision
[46:52] and  that's  when  we  discover  the  next 
 layer  of  the  purpose  and  we  do  the  exact 
 same  progress  process  again
[47:00] there's  a  few  things  that  I'll  mention 
 here 
 which  is  very  this  is  very  specific
[47:05] things  right  so  you  won't  hear  this 
 anywhere  else  but  I  am  pretty  sure  that 
 a  lot  of  men  at  this  point  of  the
[47:11] completion  of  a  purpose  actually 
 physically  gets  sick  this  is  something 
 I've  physically  seen  in  in  myself  and  in
[47:18] loads  of  other  men  when  a  man  is 
 constantly  working  on  his  purpose  this 
 big  goal  and  he  eventually  completes  it
[47:24] he  accomplishes  it  it's  like  he  gets 
 this  genuine  feeling  of  sickness  he's
[47:29] genuinely  like  he's  stuffy  his  nose  is 
 running  he's  got  a  dry  throat  he's  got  a 
 headache  everything  this  literally  just
[47:34] happened  to  me  like  four  days  ago  I  just 
 picked  up  a  fever  out  of  nowhere  for 
 like  one  whole  day  I'm  like  curled  up  in
[47:39] bed  and  stuff  and  the  reason  why  I  think 
 this  happens  and  I've  seen  this  in  in 
 with  my  friend  first  man  the  the  guy  who
[47:44] does  the  YouTube  videos  I've  seen  it 
 with  him  where  like  he  works  really 
 really  hard  to  get  this  to  the  certain
[47:49] point  and  as  soon  as  it  was  done  he  was 
 sick  for  like  two  weeks  I've  seen  this 
 so  many  times  with  different  guys
[47:54] they'll  accomplish  the  goal  the  purpose 
 and  then  literally  physically  get  sick
[47:59] and  the  reason  why  this  may  happen  is 
 because  we  as  men  especially  when  we 
 achieve  living  our  purpose
[48:05] it's  like  you're  strong  every  step  that 
 you  take  towards  your  purpose  makes  you 
 physically  strong  physically  mentally
[48:10] everything  you  feel  so  good  aligning 
 yourself  to  your  purpose  and  trying  to 
 peel  back  that  layer  and  then  eventually
[48:16] when  you  have  peel  the  layer  it's  like 
 now  it  all  hits  it  all  resets  it's  like 
 okay  you're  essentially  you  know  on  Step
[48:22] Zero  of  completing  the  next  purpose  so 
 you're  not  like  you  haven't  made  a
[48:27] significant  amount  of  progress  in  this 
 next  layer  so  it's  almost  like  you're  at 
 the  beginning  again  and  you're  hit  now
[48:32] with  all  of  the  the  diseases  and 
 sicknesses  that  you've  picked  up  over 
 the  last  while  but  that  you've  pushed
[48:38] off  because  of  this  mental  like  strength 
 that  you  have  this  is  perhaps  why  we
[48:43] hear  stories  of  masculine  men  who  worked 
 hard  their  entire  lives  who  were
[48:48] literally  65  70  75  years  old  still 
 working  some  kind  of  job  or  project  and
[48:53] the  moment  that  they  truly  retired  they 
 died  like  a  week  after  you've  probably
[48:58] heard  of  this  kind  of  thing  before 
 having  you  that  there'll  be  a  guy  who's 
 lit  like  an  old  man  who's  literally 
 worked  hard  his  entire  life  and  as  soon
[49:04] as  he  retires  like  two  weeks  later  he 
 dies 
 because  we're  not  supposed  to  stop
[49:11] we're  not  supposed  to  stop  we're  not 
 supposed  to  retire  we're  not  supposed  to
[49:16] take  vacations  or  holidays  these  are 
 modern  day 
 feminine  inventions
[49:23] because  life  as  a  man  is  supposed  to  be 
 this  constant  peeling  of  your  layer  the
[49:29] discovery  of  a  new  layer 
 and  then  peeling  again  and  again  and 
 again
[49:34] and  that  can  seem  kind  of 
 upsetting  Kana  it  can  seem  kind  of  like
[49:39] oh  boring  or  maybe  agitating  like  but 
 but  when  does  it  when  does  it  complete
[49:44] when  does  it  stop  like  I  want  it  to  stop 
 like  you  know  when  do  I  get  to  like  live 
 my  life
[49:49] well 
 this  this  is  your  life 
 this  is  perhaps  the  most  beautiful  kind
[49:54] of  life  that  you  could  live  as  a  life  of 
 of  constant  progress  to  things  that 
 actually  mean  a  lot  to  you
[50:01] and  who  knows  what  happens  once  you  peel 
 back  so  many  layers  and  you  get  to  a 
 point  where  there's  no  more  layers  than
[50:06] it  is  just  this  core  thing  inside  of  you 
 at  the  end  of  this  video  I  will
[50:11] speculate  what  it  feels  like  to  like 
 literally  have  all  the  layers  peeled 
 back
[50:16] but  just  for  now  I  am  sure  that  there's 
 going  to  be  some  young  guys  watching
[50:21] this  who  almost  have  a  sense  of  like 
 slightly  like  agitation  and  hatred  for 
 this  potential  life  that  I'm  mentioning
[50:26] which  is  okay  we  constantly  peel  back 
 the  layer  we  don't  even  enjoy  the 
 celebration  we  don't  even  like  the
[50:31] accomplishment  then  we  peel  back  the 
 next  one  then  the  next  one  then  the  next 
 one  we  don't  take  time  off  for  anything 
 we  just  constantly  keep  peeling  them
[50:36] back  it  seems  like  you  know  I  can 
 imagine  there's  going  to  be  quite  a  few 
 guys  who  don't  like  this  the  idea  of
[50:42] this  and  maybe  this  is  because  of 
 difference  maybe  this  is  because  you're 
 more  feminine  than  you're  supposed  to  be
[50:47] because  of  brainwashing  and  conditioning 
 that  goes  on  especially  in  Western 
 countries  maybe  this  is  because  again
[50:53] from  this  you  know  the  modern  media 
 machine  the  Hollywood  movies  and  the  TV 
 shows  you've  been  sold  this  idea  that
[50:59] like  man  love  man  loves  to  look  forward 
 to  vacations  and  he  has  to  work  and  work
[51:05] and  work  and  then  oh  yes  vacation  and 
 holidays  coming  up  soon  I  can't  wait  to 
 have  freedom  yet  that  is  life  guys  like
[51:10] you've  been  sold  this  message  from 
 movies  and  everything  from  people  from 
 school  holidays  and  everything  okay  we
[51:16] love  to  wait  for  the  holidays  the 
 holidays  is  when  life  is  actually  lived 
 and  yet
[51:21] no 
 if  we  really  take  some  time  right  now  to 
 think
[51:28] a  man's  life  is  not  on  holiday 
 a  man's  life
[51:33] is  in  training  it's  in  war 
 that's  what  makes  our  life  worth  living
[51:41] because  if  you  delay  and  if  you  want  to 
 live  this  life  like  most  men  do  right 
 the  modern  media  machine  really  like  you
[51:47] know  the  media  Hollywood  movies  they've 
 written  like  just  governments  and  and 
 everything  right  the  The  Narrative  of
[51:52] the  normal  people  is  that  a  man  should 
 get  a  job  when  he's  18  or  something  and
[51:57] then  just  work  and  work  and  work  and 
 work  and  work  till  he's  like  65  and  then
[52:02] retire  and  now  he  gets  to  enjoy  his  life 
 the  big  payout  things  are  going  to  be
[52:08] different  things  are  going  to  be 
 different  when  you  get  that  promotion 
 things  are  going  to  be  different  how 
 about  that  cost
[52:17] gonna  be  different 
 and  yet  we  can  learn  from  the  men  who
[52:22] have  believed  these  lies  and  things 
 aren't  different 
 they  die  after  retirements  he  gets  the
[52:27] new  car  and  doesn't  even  feel  any 
 difference
[52:32] I  don't  think  that's  the  way  that  we're 
 supposed  to  live  even  though  that  is 
 like  the  like  this  is  kind  of  hard  to 
 talk  about  because  this  is  like
[52:38] literally  the  normal  belief  in  our  brain 
 is  yeah  work  is  bad
[52:43] normal  life  is  bad  weekend's  good 
 holiday  good  retirement  good
[52:49] but  if  you're  watching  my  content  you're 
 probably  a  little  bit  more  based  than 
 the  normal  person  and  you  already
[52:54] understand  retirement's  probably  a  scam 
 We're  Not  Gonna  you  know  the  government 
 or  your  old  company  is  not  just  going  to
[52:59] give  you  free  money  obviously  they're 
 gonna  like  they'll  stop  retiring  you 
 know  what  I mean  like  so  we  don't 
 believe  most  of  these  lies  right  we're
[53:05] not  living  you  and  I  aren't  living  for 
 the  weekend  or  anything  so  when 
 you  think  about  this  life  where  you  live
[53:11] to  your  purpose  and  then  you  peel  back 
 the  purpose  and  it's  finished  and  then 
 it's  just  you  may  as  well  just  make  Pro
[53:16] works  in  the  next  one  you  can  start  to 
 see  that  although  that  may  seem  a  little 
 bit  depressive  to  think  okay  well  my
[53:22] life's  just  going  to  be  constantly 
 working  with  no  retirement  no  break  or 
 anything
[53:27] I  want  you  to  genuinely  think  okay 
 how  much  fun  do  you  really  have  when
[53:32] you're  not  productive  how  much  fun  do 
 you  really  have  when  you're  not  doing 
 anything  because  the  thing  is  right  you
[53:38] have  a  lot  of  fun  on  your  time  off  when 
 you  play  video  games  and  when  you  do 
 something  right  fair  enough  but  when 
 you're  playing  video  games  you're  just
[53:43] stimulate  you're  like  you're  simulating 
 a  masculine  life  that  you're  literally 
 simulating  Brotherhood  competition
[53:48] everything  right 
 how  much  fun  does  the  average  man  have 
 on  holiday
[53:54] where  he  has  to  pretend  that  he's  having 
 a  good  time  when  he  sits  on  the  beach 
 and  like  you  know  going  to  the  beach  is 
 nice  oh  yeah  sweet  oh  nice  take  a
[54:00] picture  yeah  sweet  and  then  once  you've 
 been  on  the  beach  like  an  hour  it's  like 
 okay  well  yeah  it's  a  bit  boring  now
[54:06] foreign 
 you  see  a  man  comes  alive  not  in  times 
 of  rest  in  times  of  like  you  know
[54:13] enjoyment  and  holiday  no 
 we  come  alive  and  we  are  in  a  total  of
[54:18] Flow  State  and  present  like  there's  no 
 thoughts  in  our  brain  when  we're  in 
 training  and  we're  good  when  we're
[54:23] making  progress  to  something  that  means 
 a  lot  to  us 
 so  maybe  it's  worth  it  if  we  consider
[54:29] you  know  what  maybe  my  ideal  life  would 
 probably  be  just  constant  [ __ ]  just
[54:35] constant  progress  constant  progress 
 constant  progress  to  all  these 
 purposeful  layers  and  imagine  how  far  I
[54:41] could  go  imagine  the  life  that  I  could 
 live  which  is  comprised  almost  by  like  a
[54:46] hundred  mini  lives  in  one
[54:52] that  could  be  a  beautiful  existence
[55:02] one  point  that  I've  made  here  when  it 
 comes  to  completing  the  layer  of  your
[55:07] your  purpose  and  I've  learned  this  again 
 from  the  book  The  Way  of  the  superior 
 man  is  that  you  should  complete  the
[55:14] layer 
 in  a  way  that  doesn't  harm  anyone  else 
 so  oftentimes  you  will  have  a  layer  of
[55:20] your  purpose  that's  just  totally 
 independent  and  it's  solo  and  it's  just 
 about  you  okay  you've  completed  it
[55:25] you've  lost  the  weight  now  it's  time  to 
 focus  on  something  else  okay  sweet 
 but  there  will  be  times  maybe  not  just
[55:30] yet  but  it'll  be  important  for  you  to 
 learn  this  lesson  there  will  be  times 
 when  you  fulfill  a  layer  of  your  purpose
[55:35] by  having  the  help  or  you  know  being 
 around  other  people  to  help  you  whether
[55:40] it's  for  example  like  for  me  you  know  to 
 spread  my  message  of  self-improvement 
 that  was  my  layer  of  my  purpose  I
[55:45] employed  a  bunch  of  people  to  help  me  do 
 that  video  editors  and  personal 
 assistant  and  sales  staff  and  all  this
[55:50] right  so  I  I  had  like  15  people  that  I 
 was  paying  for  as  employees  that  I  was 
 paying  for  to  run  this  YouTube  channel
[55:55] not  like  a  video  like  this  but  like  if 
 you've  seen  you  know  my  previous  videos 
 there's  video  editors  and  admin  and  all
[56:01] this  stuff  right 
 so  one  thing  is  that  once  you've 
 completed  a  layer  of  your  purpose  and
[56:06] it's  time  to  align  the  rep  like  all  of 
 your  life  to  the  next  layer  it's  to  just
[56:11] make  sure  you  spend  enough  time  really 
 making  sure  that  you  don't  harm  anyone
[56:17] by  changing  your  your  focus  to  the  new 
 layer  when  you  do  Discover  it  so  in  my
[56:23] case  my  purpose  layer  was  to  spread  the 
 message  of  self-improvement  on  YouTube 
 to  grow  the  YouTube  channel  to  get  a
[56:28] million  subscribers  1.5  million 
 subscribers  we  got  there  I  completed  the 
 layer  of  my  purpose  it  just  seemed
[56:33] pointless  to  continue  I'm  looking  at  it 
 like  okay  this  is  just  silly  I  don't 
 want  to  do  this  anymore  my  focus  is
[56:38] elsewhere  I  just  want  to  sit  down  and 
 record  a  video  every  now  and  then  but 
 with  no  team  or  anything  like  this  I
[56:43] don't  want  the  expenses  I  don't  want  to 
 spend  50  000  pounds  a  month  running  this 
 Channel  or  anything
[56:48] I  read  this  chapter  of  the  way  the 
 superior  man  from  this  book  and  it's
[56:53] said  that  you  should  make  sure  that  you 
 should  cut  off  the  ties  with  everyone 
 properly  otherwise  if  you  leave  this
[57:00] layer  of  your  purpose  in  the  wrong  way 
 it  can  come  back  to  bite  you
[57:06] so  what  I  actually  wanted  to  do 
 genuinely  what  I  wanted  to  do  as  soon  as
[57:11] I  completed  like  you  know  the  previous 
 layer  of  my  purpose  to  grow  the  YouTube 
 channel  literally  just  let  everyone  else 
 everyone  go  okay  goodbye  and  focus  on  my
[57:17] new  thing 
 I  wanted  to  do  that  but  for  quite  a 
 while  I'm  debating  this  decision  because
[57:23] I  realized  like  this  15  guys  who  are  my 
 employees  who  who  rely  on  me  who  need  me
[57:29] who  need  the  money  that  I  paid  them  and 
 so  I  delayed  the  decision  for  a  long 
 time  to  be  100  sure  that  this  is  the
[57:35] direction  that  I  wanted  to  take  and  then 
 eventually  when  I  was  sure  I  started  to 
 like  really  I  spent  an  entire  day
[57:41] thinking  about  okay  what's  the  best  way 
 to  treat  these  guys  okay  this  is  what 
 I'm  gonna  do  to  all  of  my  employees  I'm 
 going  to  pay  them  a  severance  package
[57:47] which  I  don't  have  to  do  because  they 
 were  all  Freelancers  they  were  all  you 
 know  like  they're  not  like  actual  real 
 government  style  employees  that  we've
[57:53] done  through  a  contract  they  were  all 
 Freelancers  you  don't  have  to  pay  a 
 freelancer  like  a  severance  or  anything
[57:58] but  I  thought  wait  some  of  these  guys 
 have  have  worked  for  me 
 for  months  and  months  and  months  so  I'm
[58:04] going  to  literally  just  essentially  give 
 them  free  money  just  so  that  like  when 
 we  split  up  they've  got  like  kind  of
[58:09] like  their  normal  wage  for  another  two 
 weeks  or  four  weeks  so  I  gave  out  more 
 than  ten  thousand  dollars  I  think  about
[58:15] fifteen  thousand  dollars  like  just  like 
 this  essentially  free  money  to  give  to 
 these  guys  just  because  they  had  relied
[58:20] on  me  previously  then  I  spent  over  an 
 hour  which  was  quite  tedious  to  like 
 record  a  testimonial  for  everyone  on  my
[58:26] team  hey  guys  it's  Hamza  and  I'm 
 recording  this  testimonial  for  my  editor 
 Mo  he's  done  a  really  good  job  if  you
[58:31] want  to  hire  him  I  can  support  it 
 whatever 
 so  I  did  that  then  soon  you're  going  to
[58:36] see  a  community  post  on  the  main  Channel 
 where  I'm  also  going  to  post  everyone's 
 like  all  my  ex  employees  links  so  that
[58:42] they  can  find  new  work  as  well  so  it's 
 like  I've  really  tried  to  set  these  guys 
 up  who  have  just  letting  go  with  new
[58:49] work  opportunities  and  to  set  them  up 
 nicely  because  I  realize  that  you  don't 
 want  to  end  a  purpose  layer  by  hurting
[58:57] people  in  any  kind  of  way  because  that 
 might  come  back  to  bite  you  that  might 
 then  eventually  become  like  a  new
[59:03] purpose  layer  that  then  oh  I've  got  to 
 help  that  guy  that  I've  really  abandoned 
 before
[59:08] so  that's  a  very  specific  like  instance 
 that  I  had  you  know  I  had  employees 
 maybe  you  won't  have  this  but  there  is  a
[59:13] chance  that  at  some  point  in  your  life 
 there's  gonna  be  someone  who's  a  part  of
[59:18] your  purpose  layer  and  once  that  layer 
 is  complete  you  won't  actually  probably 
 need  that  person  in  your  life  anymore
[59:23] and  it  should  be  very  good  for  you  to 
 just  remember  this  message  make  sure  you 
 treat  them  really  well  because  it  will
[59:29] haunt  you  in  the  future  like  you  know  at 
 the  moment  of  a  completion  of  a  purpose 
 it's  so  easy  to  think  yeah  whatever  I
[59:35] don't  care  about  this  thing  anymore  I 
 don't  care  about  anyone  related  to  this 
 thing  I'm  focused  on  this  other  thing  of 
 course  remember  because  it's  like  that
[59:40] feeling  of  like  yep  I  don't  care  about 
 this  anymore  it  just  feels  indifferent  I 
 just  feel  bored  and  everything  there's  a
[59:45] little  insect  on  my  little  oh  come  on 
 it's  very  inter  uh  it's  very  easy  to  act
[59:52] like  that  and  so  this  is  just  a  quick 
 warning  don't  complete  the  layer  of 
 purpose  and  just  forget  everyone  who  was
[59:58] involved  there  make  sure  you  treat  them 
 nicely 
 now  this  is  a  very  interesting  one  that
[60:04] I've  not  seen  mentioned  anywhere  else 
 but  let's  say  you've  just  completed  a 
 layer  of  your  purpose  so  the  layer  could
[60:10] be 
 the  YouTube  channel  the  layer  could  be 
 you  know  getting  the  grade  or  the  you 
 know  like  whatever  the  big  Obsession  was
[60:16] the  mission  was  for  you  this  is 
 something  I  realized  as  soon  as  you've 
 completed  a  layer  of  your  purpose
[60:24] try  to  Min  try  to  continue  even  on  the 
 new  purpose  layer  that  you  eventually
[60:29] find  try  to  continue  the  maintenance 
 volume  of  the  previous  thing  so  let  me
[60:34] tell  you  an  example  right  in  terms  of 
 Fitness  right 
 part  of  my  purpose  layer  for  a  long  time
[60:40] was  to  build  an  aesthetic  physique  to 
 build  muscle  into  like  you  know  have  a 
 good  physique  that  was  inspiring  that
[60:46] made  me  look  good  that  got  me  girls  and 
 everything  that  this  was  a  huge 
 Obsession  in  my  mind  right  and  I  kind  of 
 you  know  I  don't  have  the  perfect
[60:51] physique  or  anything  but  I  certainly 
 completed  how  important  this  was  it  was 
 a  layer  of  my  purpose  and  I  completed  it
[60:58] but  you  know  what  I  did  which  was  quite 
 smart  and  this  was  years  ago  with  before 
 I  even  knew  it  I  carried  on  training  now
[61:05] this  seems  like  common  sense  right  so  my 
 big  goal  was  to  build  a  body  that  I'm 
 proud  of  that  I  really  like
[61:11] I  built  it  and  then  I  could  have  just 
 stopped  after  that  I  could  have  just  yep 
 I  built  it  and  now  I'm  not  gonna  train
[61:16] anymore  now  that  sounds  stupid  doesn't 
 it 
 but  when  you 
 understand  that  like  I  completed  the
[61:22] layer  and  now  my  new  layer  is  about 
 fighting  my  new  layers  about  martial 
 arts  which  is  a  completely  different
[61:28] kind  of  sport  to  train  for  it  might 
 actually  make  sense  and  it  might  be 
 understandable  if  I  told  you  oh  yeah  by
[61:33] the  way  I'm  not  really  going  to  the  gym 
 and  doing  resistance  training  and 
 bodybuilding  and  weightlifting  anymore
[61:38] because  I'm  literally  just  focused  on 
 fighting  if  I  said  that  it  like  it 
 wouldn't  be  absolutely  crazy  would  it
[61:44] you'd  be  thinking  oh  it's  a  waste  mine 
 you  built  a  nice  physique  and  if  you 
 want  to  get  into  fighting  fair  enough 
 but  you  could  probably  maintain  it  but
[61:50] like  if  I  was  like  no  no  I  just  care 
 about  fighting  just  care  about  fighting 
 good  but  okay  fair  enough  do  I  mean 
 right
[61:55] but  what  I  realized  was  and  this  has 
 happened  to  me  multiple  times  what  I've 
 realized  is  that  when  you've  completed  a
[62:01] layer  of  your  purpose 
 and  you've  built  the  physique  for 
 example  or  you've  built  the  business  and
[62:06] you've  made  the  money  or  whatever  it  is 
 if  you  don't  maintain  that  thing  that 
 you've  just  completed
[62:12] it  will  deteriorate 
 and  when  it  deteriorates  enough  it  will
[62:17] actually  become  a  purpose  layer  once 
 again 
 so  let's  say  I've  built  a  really  good
[62:23] physique  and  I'm  thinking  okay  you  know 
 I've  built  a  really  good  physique  I've 
 sold  an  online  course  training  program
[62:28] about  it  so  now  I'm  profiting  from  it 
 now  my  focus  is  elsewhere  I  don't  really 
 need  to  train  that  much  or  whatever  I
[62:33] don't  really  care  about  it  anymore  I'm 
 gonna  focus  on  business  my  new  purpose 
 layer  whatever  and  then  eventually  you
[62:38] look  at  yourself  in  the  mirror  and 
 realize  oh  wait  my  physique  doesn't  look 
 anywhere  near  as  good  and  I'm  trying  to
[62:43] focus  on  business  work  but  now  in  my 
 mind  the  new  obsession  the  purpose  layer 
 is  to  build  the  physique  again
[62:49] so  if  you  let  it  slip  the  thing  that 
 you've  just  built  then  the  purpose  layer 
 that  you've  just  completed  if  you
[62:55] actually  let  that  deteriorate  even 
 though  it's  finished  it  will  become  a 
 layer  once  more
[63:00] so  even  though  this  is  common  sense 
 build  the  physique  and  at  least  maintain
[63:06] it  for  the  rest  of  your  life 
 does  that  make  sense  it's  common  sense 
 but  it's  like  it's  just  something  that  I
[63:12] think  is  valuable  to  discuss  because 
 I  could  throw  myself  in  fully  right  now 
 into  fighting  and  I'd  be  sick  right  you
[63:18] know  martial  arts  whatever  I  wouldn't 
 even  train  bodybuilding  let's  say  right 
 which  means  that  I've  got  extra  recovery 
 and  it's  better  so  that  this  way  I'm
[63:23] less  stiff  and  everything  but  then  maybe 
 a  month  from  now  maybe  six  months  from 
 now  whilst  I'm  in  the  middle  of  like  my
[63:28] martial  arts  like  uh  purpose  layer 
 there's  going  to  be  a  time  when  I  look 
 at  myself  in  the  mirror  and  see  how  much
[63:33] muscle  mass  I've  lost  and  I  like  as  much 
 as  I  want  to  focus  on  fighting
[63:38] the  the  lack  of  muscle  mass  which  means 
 a  lot  to  me  because  I've  worked  very 
 hard  for  this  it  wasn't  like  a  layer  of 
 my  purpose  to  develop  myself  to  have
[63:44] like  a  physique  that  I'm  proud  of 
 it  will  start  to  weigh  on  my  mind  to  the 
 point  that  now  that  is  the  obsession
[63:49] that  is  the  purpose  that  I  need  to  make 
 progress  on  so  when  you  do  complete  a
[63:54] layer  of  your  purpose  find  what's  called 
 this  is  very  specific  there's  a  term
[64:00] called  the  minimum  effective  volume  Mev 
 in  other  words  the  maintenance  volume
[64:06] for  you  to  like  keep  on  holding  on  to 
 what  you  have  gained  so  can  you  see  now
[64:14] why  I'm  I  see  him  like  I've  kind  of  left 
 YouTube  and  yeah  here  I  am  on  YouTube
[64:21] the  minimum  effective  volume  the 
 maintenance  volume  because  I  grew  this
[64:26] YouTube  channel  when  I  was  a  part  of  my 
 my  purpose  then  the  layer  was  complete 
 now  I  could  throw  myself  one  only  solely
[64:34] into  fighting  and  that's  probably  could 
 be  a  good  idea  but  the  thing  is  there 
 would  be  a  time  six  months  from  now  I'm
[64:39] fully  focused  on  fighting  and  I'm  like 
 oh  man  like  I  kind  of  miss  YouTube  and 
 like  oh  the  channels  went  down  so  much
[64:45] imagine  if  I  didn't  post  at  all  for  six 
 months  right  okay  good  goodbye  guys  I'm 
 done  with  YouTube  I'd  look  at  it  I'd  be
[64:51] proper  sad  and  stuff  and  I'd  probably 
 wanna 
 sauce  it  again  because  the  purpose  is
[64:56] back 
 so  what  I'm  doing  with  my  physique  by 
 training  a  few  times  a  week  is  very
[65:02] similar  to  what  I'm  doing  with  YouTube 
 now  which  is  that  I  built  up  something
[65:07] you  know  I  completed  the  purpose  layer 
 and  now  I'm  just  maintaining  it  with  the
[65:12] smallest  amount  of  time  and  energy 
 investment  needed  whilst  I  still  do  have
[65:17] another  like  layer  of  my  purpose  that 
 I'm  focused  on  that's  why  I'll  upload
[65:22] maybe  a  couple  times  per  month  to  this 
 channel  to  kind  of  maintain  a  good  level
[65:27] so  that  I  don't  get  this  like  feeling  of 
 like  oh  man  I  really  want  to  go  and  do 
 that  thing  again
[65:32] because 
 no  one  wants  to  be  that  60  year  old  guy
[65:38] who  looks  at  you  in  the  gym  or  looks  at 
 you  elsewhere  and  says  like  oh  well  you 
 know  I  used  to  be  fit  and  strong  when  I 
 was  your  age  I  used  to  be  able  to  bench
[65:44] seven  plates  and  squat  seven  thousand 
 pounds  but  I  can't  anymore  because  my 
 knee  hurts
[65:49] and  then  he  just  looks  old  and  saggy  and 
 everything  no  one  wants  to  be  that  guy
[65:54] you  want  to  be  the  guy 
 who's  60  years  old  who  started
[65:59] weightlifting  going  to  the  gym  at  our 
 age  and  he's  still  jacked
[66:04] you  want  to  be  the  guy  who's  maintained 
 a  list  of  accomplishments  like  you  a  guy
[66:09] who's  maintained  facets  of  his  life 
 these  like  skills  through  his  life
[66:14] because  it  seems  silly  right  I  I 
 genuinely  I  ask  myself  and  I  was
[66:19] thinking  okay 
 I  built  this  physique  but  I've  got  a  new 
 purpose  layer  and  I  remember  that  okay 
 I'm  supposed  to  align  100  of  my  life  to
[66:26] this  and  so  if  I  keep  bodybuilding 
 that's  gonna  take  some  away  from  this 
 but  then  I  realized  and  I  was  like  wait
[66:32] I'm  definitely  going  to  regret  it  I'm 
 definitely  going  to  want  to  build  the 
 muscle  back  again  and  then  I  thought
[66:37] about  fighting  let's  say  okay  my  current 
 purpose  layers  on  fighting  martial  arts 
 everything  okay  sweet  I'm  gonna  get 
 really  good  at  fighting  that
[66:43] visualization  I  had  where  I'm  doing  Jiu 
 Jitsu  with  the  guy  and  I  look  really 
 good  that's  going  to  come  alive  within
[66:48] six  months  or  12  months  from  now  it's 
 gonna  be  amazing  right  then  I  thought  to 
 myself  okay  imagine  if  I  throw 
 everything  into  fighting  it's  so  good
[66:54] and  then  I  become  like  a  really  good 
 fighter  then  this  layer  of  my  purpose 
 gets  peeled  what  I  just  never  go  to
[67:00] martial  arts  clubs  again 
 no  it'd  be  an  amazing  thing  to  carry  for
[67:07] the  rest  of  my  life  wouldn't  it  and  now 
 I  want  you  to  start  a  picture  the  man 
 that  you'd  become  20  to  40  years  from
[67:14] now  when  you've  got  this  with  like  10 
 different  things
[67:19] that  for  a  few  years  of  your  life  you 
 really  really  focus  and  obsess  over  your 
 physique  and  then  after  that  you  started
[67:25] to  do  a  maintenance  amount  and  you  still 
 got  a  really  good  amount  of  muscle  mass 
 then  for  a  few  years  you're  totally
[67:30] obsessed  over  fighting  in  martial  arts 
 and  you  got  really  good  you  won  fights 
 and  everything  and  then  after  that  you
[67:35] didn't  train  as  hard  but  you  certainly 
 kept  it  up  with  one  to  two  to  three 
 sessions  per  week  so  that  when  you're  40
[67:41] years  old  and  your  son's  looking  up  at 
 you  he's  looking  up  at  a  man  who's  built 
 like  a  Greek  god  who  can  fight  like  a
[67:48] warrior  like  a  Spartan 
 who's  wealthy  like  a  businessman  like  an
[67:53] entrepreneur 
 who's  cultured  like  a  man  who's  traveled
[67:58] the  world  and  you  have  this  list 
 of  things  that  you  can  look  back  on
[68:03] these  purpose  layers  these  chapters  of 
 your  life 
 and  that's  when  this  accomplishment  is
[68:10] gonna  feel  good 
 so  make  sure  when  you  do  complete  some
[68:15] kind  of  part  of  your  the  layer  of  your 
 purpose 
 you  maintain  it  so  this  is  even  let's
[68:21] say  something  which  I  don't  really  have 
 much  experience  of  anymore  but  let's  say 
 something  you're  in  the  education  system
[68:26] you're  still  in  school  right  and  your 
 current  purpose  layer  is  studying  to  get 
 this  good  grade  so  that  you  can  go  into
[68:31] University  you're  studying  medicine  for 
 example  right  so  you're  studying 
 medicine  then  you're  going  to  get  the
[68:36] the  University  degree  and  then  you  can 
 go  work  after  that  right  well  a  lot  of
[68:41] people  who  aren't  really 
 Superior  Juan  you  know  masculine  they'll
[68:46] study  they'll  get  the  degree  and  then 
 they'll  work 
 and  these  people  never  actually  become
[68:52] that  successful 
 you  want  another  kind  of  person  who 
 becomes  truly  successful  well  he  studies
[68:57] for  the  degree 
 he  gets  the  degree  he  gets  the  job 
 and  he  keeps  studying
[69:03] he  maintains  or  even  grows  his  level  of 
 knowledge  for  the  rest  of  his  life
[69:10] whatever  you're  doing  right  now  to 
 complete  and  peel  back  this  layer  of 
 your  purpose  studying  training  working
[69:17] whatever  once  it  is  completed  and  you 
 have  this  accomplishments  that  you  know
[69:22] that  we've  been  working  hard  for 
 maintain  it  or  even  continue  to  grow  it
[69:27] in  the  most  efficient  effective  way 
 possible  so  a  weird  tip  that  I  can  give
[69:32] you  right  now  which  is  so  specific  is 
 there's  a  book  called
[69:37] the  four  hour  work  week  by  Tim  Ferriss 
 the  four  hour  work  week  by  Tim  Ferriss 
 this  book  explains  how  to  do  things
[69:44] mostly  like  your  own  business  work  very 
 very  time  efficiently  if  you  follow  this
[69:50] book  but  even  for 
 Fitness  even  for  studying  whatever  it  is 
 that  you're  doing  it  will  actually  help
[69:56] you  to  once  you've  peel  back  this  layer 
 to  keep  maintaining  this  thing  in  a  way
[70:02] that  won't  deteriorate  how  much  progress 
 you  make  in  your  new  layer  so  that's
[70:07] something  to  look  into 
 foreign
[70:15] you've  peeled  back  multiple  layers  of 
 your  purpose  at  this  point
[70:20] and  there's  a  phrase  now  again  from  the 
 same  book  I've  learned  everything  about
[70:25] masculinity  from  this  one  book  The  Way 
 of  the  superior  man  by  David  Dieter  if 
 you're  interested  maybe  after  this  video
[70:30] you  can  literally  just  Search  the  book 
 title  on  YouTube  and  then  my  name  next 
 to  it  Hamza  the  way  of  the  superior  man
[70:36] I've  done  like  a  one  hour  guide  on  this 
 book  which  is  like  the  book  is 
 life-changing  right
[70:41] there's  another  phrase  from  this  book 
 which  is  really  relevant  which  is  that
[70:47] be  willing  to  change  everything  in  your 
 life 
 be  willing  to  change  everything  in  your
[70:53] life  for  your  purpose  so  this  is 
 something  I  briefly  mentioned  to  you 
 before  which  is  that  once  we've
[70:58] completed  a  layer  you  know  we'll  spend 
 some  time  in  speculation 
 introspectiveness  whilst  they're  at  a
[71:03] war  then  we'll  discover  the  next  one  as 
 soon  as  you  discover  the  next  part  of 
 your  purpose  the  next  layer  the  vision
[71:10] align  100  of  your  life  to  it  this  means 
 that  you  will  have  to  constantly  as  a
[71:15] Young  Man  uproot  your  life  and  move  to 
 where  it  is  that  you  need  to  go  to  to
[71:21] achieve  this  this  Obsession  this  layer 
 of  your  purpose  to  do  as  much  as  you  can
[71:28] this 
 is  where 
 I'm  uncertain  of  how  things  should  be
[71:36] because 
 conventional  success  advice  you  know  if 
 I  was  going  to  give  you  good
[71:41] self-improvement  advice  what  would  I 
 tell  you  I'll  tell  you  okay  delay 
 gratification
[71:46] always 
 make  decisions  based  on  the  longer  term
[71:52] 10  years  down  the  line  20  years  down  the 
 line  when  you're  going  to  start  a 
 business  think  about  it  for  20  years 
 right
[71:57] but  then  this  is  where  I'm  now  I'm  even 
 uncertain  because  I  want  you  to  just
[72:02] picture  Okay  imagine  the  man  the 
 masculine  man  the  superior  man  the 
 spiritual  man  who  navigates  and
[72:07] penetrates  his  life  in  a  way  that  he's 
 peeling  back  these  layers 
 one  by  one  by  one  by  one
[72:13] should  this  man 
 perceive  that  he's  gonna  be  in  the  same
[72:18] business  for  20  years 
 because  that's  usually  good  advice  right 
 if  you  know  if  we  tell  a  young  man  that
[72:24] okay  get  into  artificial  intelligence 
 and  then  you  kind  of  have  the  perception 
 Yep  this  is  the  thing  I'm  going  to  do 
 for  the  rest  of  my  life  but
[72:30] but  if  you  were  truly  a  purposeful  man 
 who  was  peeling  back  every  layer  of  your
[72:36] purpose 
 would  you 
 would  you  continue  doing  the  same  thing
[72:42] for  20  years  with  you  know  the  major 
 part  of  your  life  or  perhaps  if  this  is 
 the  way  that  we  want  to  live  if  this  is
[72:48] the  kind  of  life  that  we  think  we  should 
 live  not  a  life  of  stability  of 
 long-term  stability  with  the  same  career
[72:54] or  same  business  and  those  things  are 
 extremely  valuable  so  so  valuable  the 
 most  successful  people  the  most  wealthy
[73:00] people  of  the  of  the  planet  have  done 
 the  same  things  for  40  years 
 right
[73:07] but  then  what  is  success  based  on 
 is  the  billionaire  businessman  a
[73:14] successful  man  because  he's  had  a 
 company  that  for  20  years  30  years 
 that's  performed  really  really  well  even
[73:20] though  for  most  of  that  time 
 he's  actually  wanted  to  do  something
[73:25] different  but  he  can't  because  of  the 
 accountability  of  staying  in  the 
 business  and  we  all  look  up  to  this  guy
[73:30] we  all  look  up  to  Bill  Gates  as  you  know 
 the  really  really  successful  Tech  guy 
 who's  become  who's  really  really  wealthy
[73:36] and  everything  right 
 we  look  up  to  the  people  who've  been 
 doing  the  same  thing  for  so  long  that
[73:42] they  become  widely  good  at  that  thing 
 but  what's  happening  inside  of  them
[73:48] are  they  gonna  die  happily  knowing  that 
 that's  the  thing  they  did  for  40  years 
 maybe  maybe
[73:54] men  are  just  so  different  some  men  are 
 supposed  you  know  that  was  his  purpose 
 for  40  years  straight
[74:00] but  chances  are 
 it's  actually  not 
 chances  are  for  for  most  men  out  there
[74:07] we're  supposed  to  do  like  complete  you 
 know  this  layer  of  our  purpose  is 
 supposed  to  last  for  anywhere  from
[74:13] months  to  years  and  once  the  the  purpose 
 layer  has  been  completed  and  peeled  off
[74:19] and  we  start  to  understand  what  the  next 
 layer  is
[74:25] it  should  be  time  to  align  100  of  our 
 life  to  this  next  layer
[74:30] but  then  there's  things  that  stop  us 
 there  could  be  you  know  that  ongoing
[74:36] career  that  you  spend  so  long  on  your 
 life  on  and  this  is  where  I  told  you 
 about  that  like  anti-masculine  male
[74:43] media  propaganda  comes  in  because  think 
 about  it  think  about  this  right  now 
 right  our  perception  of  let's  say  you
[74:50] know  there's  some  career  man  right  some 
 guy  who's  got  a  career  and  it's  a  really 
 really  good  career  like  a  hike  end  up
[74:55] career  he  might  get  the  CEO  role  you 
 know  this  prestigious  role  in  another 
 few  years  he's  been  in  the  same  kind  of
[75:01] company  for  so  long  making  huge  progress 
 huge  status  we're  all  looking  up  to  him 
 as  a  successful  man  right
[75:09] if  he  left  this  career  and  said  to  us  oh
[75:14] well  yeah  I  finished  my  purpose  and  now 
 my  purpose  is  to  go  uh
[75:19] hike  up  every  mountain  of  the  world  and 
 see  the  Great 
 skyline  of  the  world
[75:25] would  look  at  him  like  he  was  absolutely 
 crazy 
 but  why
[75:31] we  look  at  the  guy  who's  done  the  same 
 thing  and  built  up  a  long-term  success
[75:36] in  his  career  or  business  with 
 so  much  inspiration  like  wow  that  is  a
[75:41] successful  guy
[75:47] but  Izzy 
 because  success  based  on  the  metric  of 
 wealth  okay  fine  yes  sweet  he  is  but  the
[75:53] thing  is  you  don't  need  that  much  wealth 
 to  live  a  wealthy  life  honestly  like 
 this  you  know  successful  business  and
[75:59] man  Bill  Gates  they've  got  billions  bro 
 you  only  need  like  two  million  to  live 
 off  like  a  really  good  life  for  the  rest
[76:04] of  your  life  right  let's  say  five 
 million  10  million  right 
 so  how  much
[76:10] are  these  guys  potentially  sacrificing
[76:15] in  terms  of  their  masculine  purpose 
 because  chances  are  if  you've  done  the 
 same  thing  for  a  while  that  that  kind  of
[76:20] man  that  we  look  up  to  the  Jeff  Bezos 
 Bill  Gates 
 their  purpose  will  change  now  the
[76:27] smartest  entrepreneurs  that  we  see  what 
 are  they  doing  Elon  Musk  even  Bill  Gates 
 is  doing  this  they've  got  this  main
[76:34] business  you  know  the  long-term 
 successful  business  right  Microsoft  and 
 Tesla  and  everything  but
[76:40] when  they  get  a  little  bit  bored  from 
 that  main  thing  and  they  have  like  a  new 
 purpose  layer
[76:46] they  pursue  it  as  part  of  the  business 
 Tesla  isn't  just  about  the  cars  anymore
[76:51] it's  like  they're  inventing  a  lot  of 
 stuff  like  rocket  ships  and  everything 
 right  Bill  Gates  as  well  it's  like  it's
[76:56] not  just  about  Microsoft  I'm  pretty  sure 
 Bill  Gates  doesn't  even  work  in 
 Microsoft  anymore  he  moved  on  to  his
[77:01] charity  Foundation  where  he  started  to 
 focus  on  like  the  deaths  caused  by 
 diarrhea  and  unclean  water  because  that
[77:07] would  have  become  his  new  purpose  layer 
 we  don't  think  Bill  Gates  is  crazy  do  we 
 he  built  Microsoft  he's  a  billionaire
[77:13] he's  wildly  successful  he's  like  one  of 
 the  most  impactful  people  of  the  entire
[77:18] planet  you  know  there's  people  who  have 
 like  negative  perceptions  of  it  but  he 
 has  changed  the  world  forever  right
[77:24] there  would  have  been  a  point  in  Bill 
 Gates  life  where  he  was  the  head  of 
 Microsoft  and  it  would  have  seen
[77:30] absolutely  crazy  for  us  common  folk  to 
 to  see  him  say  he's  stepping  down  and
[77:36] employing  a  new  CEO  instead 
 he  built  Microsoft  he  was  the  head  of
[77:41] Microsoft  and  eventually  he  replaced 
 himself  well  maybe  whatever  happened  in 
 the  businesses  you  know  like  there's
[77:46] always  like  these  weird  like  office 
 politics  type  of  stuff  right  but  let's 
 say  if  that's  what  happened  and  there
[77:51] was  a  CEO  who  replaced  him  and  Bill 
 Gates  was  happy  to  step  down  and  to 
 focus  on  something  else  we  would  have
[77:56] thought  that  was  crazy  how  could  you 
 leave  that  much  success  you  built  up  so 
 much  like  you  should  have  just  stayed  in
[78:01] there 
 but  his  purpose  was  complete
[78:07] and  so  maybe  as  a  man  sometimes  we  have 
 to  make  this  sacrifice  to  our  status  to
[78:12] our  image  to  our  wealth 
 to  keep  pursuing
[78:17] these  purpose  layers 
 keep  peeling  them  back
[78:22] and  it  can  seem  so  crazy  from  an  outside 
 perspective  to  think  wait  why  would  you
[78:27] sacrifice  that  thing  that  you  had  going 
 for  you 
 but  that  thing  that  you  had  going  for
[78:32] you  no  longer  does  anything  for  you 
 because  the  new  thing  that  you  need  to
[78:38] make  progress  on  that  you  need  to  align 
 as  much  of  your  life  as  possible 
 it's  different
[78:44] this  is  why  I  think  our  perceptions  of  a 
 successful  male  life
[78:50] perhaps  have  have  been  brainwashed  so 
 that  we  pursue  things  like  long-term
[78:56] stability  which  sounds  awesome 
 but  I'm  not  sure  that  that's  how  a 
 masculine  man  would  live
[79:03] I'm  beginning  to  realize  that  at  least 
 for  me 
 the  way  that  I  may  navigate  the  rest  of
[79:08] my  life  is  in 
 multi-year  compartments  multi-year
[79:15] chapters  where  I'm  currently  in  a 
 chapter  of  my  life  that's  about  being  in
[79:20] different  countries  like  Thailand  and 
 training  martial  arts  and  this  is  what  I 
 I'm  completely  focused  on  and  every
[79:25] decision  I  make  is  based  on  this  and 
 then  when  this  layer  of  purpose  is  open 
 or  completed  or  fulfilled  and  I  start  to
[79:32] discover  the  next  layer  that's  the  next 
 chapter  of  my  life  and  I  focus  entirely 
 on  that  and
[79:37] I  still  go  about  things  in  a  long-term 
 way  you  know  it'd  be  silly  for  me  to 
 like  get  into  martial  arts  in  a
[79:42] short-term  way  of  like  yeah  I  wanna  I 
 wanna  have  a  uh  an  amateur  fight  next 
 week  yeah  uh  Parkinson's  law  you  know
[79:48] like  oh  yeah  like  short-term  stuff  it'd 
 be  silly  to  do  that  you  know  it's  good 
 until  I  still  think  long  term  to  set
[79:53] long-term  goals  and  everything  because 
 you  don't  know  how  long  your  purpose 
 layer  is  going  to  last  for 
 but  it  may  be  valuable  for  us  to  just
[79:59] think  you  know  what 
 trying  to  think  what  I  do  20  years  from
[80:05] now  10  years  from  now  might  not  actually 
 be  that  valuable  because  my  purpose
[80:10] layer  seems  to  change  every  six  to  six 
 months  to  three  years  Max
[80:20] it  seems  crazy  to  what  I'm  kind  of 
 saying  here  which  is  that  we  shouldn't 
 live  the  normal  life  of  stability  of
[80:26] this  long-term  commitment  to  to  people 
 to  maybe  to  family  this  seems  like  I  I
[80:32] don't  even  know  right  but 
 I'm  imagining
[80:37] a  30  year  old  man 
 who  did  everything  he  was  supposed  to  do
[80:42] he  went  through  college  and  everything 
 and  then  he  met  a  nice  girl  then  they 
 got  married  and  they  had  children  and
[80:47] everything  and  I  want  you  to  imagine  if 
 you're  this  guy 
 and  suddenly  it  feels  like
[80:55] your  purpose  layer  has  been  complete 
 and  the  next  thing  you've  got  to  do  is 
 totally  different
[81:03] you  would  be  a  bad  person 
 you've  got  people  who  rely  on  you  you've 
 got  a  family  and  everything  you'd  be
[81:08] about  you'd  be  seen  as  a  bad  person  but 
 I  want  you  to  imagine  if  this  was  you 
 how  you  would  feel  knowing  that  you  had
[81:14] these  commitments  that  you've  got  to 
 hold  to 
 even  though  you  now  know  that  your
[81:19] purpose  layer  is  different  than  you 
 can't  get  away  this  is  your  family 
 you've  got  to  now
[81:27] a  lot  of  men  are  experiencing  that 
 and  the  men  who  do  make  you  know  some
[81:33] kind  of  progress  to  the  new  purpose 
 layer 
 they're  ridiculed
[81:38] they're  shown  as  you  know  on  TV  as  these 
 guys  who  get  motorbikes  and  their  wives 
 nagging  them  and  you  know  he's  having  a
[81:43] midlife  crisis  everyone  oh  Dad  are  you 
 having  a  midlife  crisis  oh  look  dad
[81:48] actually  wants  to  be  masculine  oh  come 
 on  dad
[81:54] by  no  means  as  at  all  am  I  saying 
 abandon  your  children  abandon  your
[81:59] family  but 
 it's  just  this  lifestyle  of  how  purpose
[82:04] works  is  making  me  think  of  wow  like  I 
 thought
[82:09] making  the  commitment  to  a  woman  to 
 marry  to  have  children  I  thought  that 
 was  a  huge  commitment  already  I'm
[82:15] beginning  to  realize  it  is  so  much  more 
 than  I  thought  because  one  extra  thing 
 that  you've  got  to  now  think  about
[82:20] before  you  commit  yourself  to  a  woman 
 before  you  you  have  children  is  to  think
[82:25] okay  what's  gonna  happen  to  these 
 purpose  layers  of  yours  because  if  you 
 just  stop  and  peel  back  one  layer  and
[82:31] then  the  next  one  is  to  go  and  travel 
 the  world  or  something  that  you  can't  do 
 with  children  because  they  need  to  stay 
 in  school  you  will  feel  like  a  shell  of
[82:37] a  man  remember  those  problems  I  talked 
 about 
 where  you  gain  body  fat  it's  you 
 struggle  to  to  build  muscle  your
[82:42] testosterone  goes  down  your  erections 
 get  weaker  is  that  not  the  symptoms  of 
 the  modern  man  who's  stuck  in  a
[82:47] relationship  that  no  longer  kind  of 
 serves  him  but  then  he  has  to  stay  in 
 there  because  it's  evil  if  he  doesn't  I
[82:52] don't  have  all  the  answers 
 but  what  I  do  know 
 is  that  a  man  who  leaves  his  purpose
[82:58] unfulfilled  who  doesn't  make  progress  to 
 it  does  not  feel  good
[83:03] and  so  it's  just  an  extra  like 
 precaution  that  perhaps  we  should  really 
 think  about  before  we  make  a  big
[83:09] commitment  whether  it's  with  family  or 
 it's  with  a  military  career  that  you've 
 got  to  sign  up  for  it's  four  to  eight  to
[83:15] twelve  years  or  or  college  you  know  a 
 four-year  commitment  before  we  sign  up 
 to  these  to  really  ask  ourselves  okay
[83:20] where  is  my  purpose  layer  gonna  go  what 
 if  I  get  a  year  into  this  five  years 
 into  this  and  my  layer  gets  fulfilled
[83:25] but  if  there's  still  time  that  I've  got 
 to  put  into  this  there's  still  people 
 who  rely  on  me
[83:31] it  seems  evil  to  think  these  things 
 but  it's  for  your  own  benefit  and  you
[83:36] don't  really  have  to  tell  anyone  that 
 you're  thinking  wait  what  if  my  purpose 
 layer  gets  complete  with  this  person  you 
 don't  have  to  tell  anyone  but  just  try
[83:42] and  think  to  yourself  okay  what  would 
 happen 
 and  then  now  really  start  to  consider
[83:47] okay  is  this  definitely  the  right  time 
 to  have  children  or  to  marry  this  woman
[83:53] because  a  lot  of  guys  are  getting 
 married  young  which  usually  would  be  a 
 good  thing  but
[83:58] the  same  guys  are  then  getting  divorced 
 a  year  later  or  five  years  later  or 
 something
[84:05] I  can  only  speculate  what  happens  past 
 this  in  terms  of  your  purpose  this  is
[84:10] the  the  kind  of  the  stage  I  am  on  now 
 where  I've  completed  multiple  layers  of 
 my  purpose  and  my  understanding  of
[84:16] purpose  really  seems  to  get  be  getting 
 better  and  better  by  no  means  am  I  some 
 professional  and  I  certainly  have  so
[84:23] much  more  to  learn  and  so  many  more 
 layers  to  peel  back  I  can  only  speculate 
 what  to  do  from  here  which  is  okay  just
[84:29] keep  going  forward  with  the  exact  same 
 pattern  of  aligning  as  much  of  your  life 
 as  possible  to  the  purpose  peel  it  back
[84:35] and  then  again  and  again  and  again  and 
 again 
 it's  left  me  a  little  bit
[84:41] sighted  and  almost  concerned  and  worried 
 for  the  future  because  I'm  so  excited 
 that  I  kind  of  I'm  starting  to  get  like
[84:47] a  Life  Plan  of  like  okay  my  life  will 
 most  likely  be  lived  in  like  chapters  of
[84:52] an  obsession  of  this  one  thing  at  a  time 
 that  I  will  align  everything  else 
 relationships  and  everything  else  into
[84:57] but  then  when  that  part  of  my  life  gets 
 completed  checked  off  peeled  back  and
[85:03] it's  time  for  the  next  layer  of  my 
 purpose  it's 
 I'm  worried  in  the  sense  that  like 
 perhaps
[85:08] I  shouldn't  set  any  long-term  goals  or 
 commitments  because  things  can  change  so
[85:13] much  you  know  people  keep  asking  me  what 
 my  plans  are  for  the  rest  of  the  year 
 people  keep  asking  me  what  my  plans  are 
 for  five  years  ten  years  and  I  had
[85:20] really  good  answers  for  all  this  it 
 seems  really  smart  to  say  yep  my 
 Five-Year  Plan  is  this  and  here's  my 
 business  plan  and  in  my  in  10  years  I'll
[85:26] have  this  I  used  to  be  really  really 
 into  that  stuff  of  like  yeah  really 
 having  a  long-term  plan  now  I  look  at  it
[85:31] and  say  wait 
 but  you  can't 
 because  most  likely  you  are  going  to
[85:36] fulfill  well  if  you  plan  to  you're  going 
 to  fulfill  the  layer  of  your  purpose  and 
 then  everything  should  be  different
[85:41] after  that  now  at  the  same  time  I'm  also 
 realizing  that  you  should  actually  have
[85:46] a  long-term  plan  for  the  current  purpose 
 layer  you're  on  because  you  don't  know 
 how  long  it's  going  to  last  but  you 
 should  be  open  to  when  it  feels  like
[85:52] you've  you've  completed  the  layer  and 
 you  truly  have  completed  the  layer
[85:57] you  should  be  open  to  dropping 
 everything  all  the  plants 
 I  told  you
[86:02] months  ago  that  I  was  going  to  hit  5 
 million  subscribers  at  the  end  of  this 
 year  in  December  2023  I  was  gonna  hit  a
[86:09] I'm  projecting  into  the  future  right 
 every  single  time  that  I  set  a  goal  for 
 the  sub  count  of  YouTube  I  was  right
[86:16] exactly  right  every  single  time  so  I'm 
 sure  that  I  was  going  to  hit  5  million 
 subscribers  I  had  this  long  term  plan
[86:21] and  I  had  to  just  cut  a  shot  there  when 
 I  realized  that  my  purpose  here  was  done 
 that's  the  equivalence  or  an  example  of
[86:29] what  we  may  need  to  do  once  we  realize 
 we're  in  the  middle  of  something  that  we 
 thought  was  going  to  last  a  lot  longer
[86:34] but  we're  actually  just  done  with  it  now 
 in  the  book  The  Way  the  superior  man  he
[86:40] does  mention 
 maybe  you're  bsing  yourself  maybe  you're 
 just  like  being  a  bit  lazy  or  you're
[86:45] just  feeling  a  bit  like 
 week  or  whatever  there's  always  a 
 possibility  that  you  haven't  actually
[86:50] completed  the  layer  of  your  purpose  and 
 you're  just  being  lazy  there's  always  a 
 possibility  and  so  you  should  have  close
[86:55] friends  ask  like  you  know  kind  of 
 critique  you  and  hold  you  accountable 
 you  should  journal  and  ask  yourself  okay
[87:00] am  I  actually  being  lazy  or  have  I 
 genuinely  fulfilled  this  layer  of  my
[87:05] purpose  and  I  did  this  multiple  times 
 and  you  know  I  kept  on  daily  uploads  for 
 the  YouTube  channel  for  over  a  year  so
[87:10] it's  like  I  knew  it  wasn't  about 
 laziness  or  anything  I  was  disciplined 
 enough  to  do  that  it  was  generally  just
[87:15] time  for  me  to  move  on  past  this  this 
 layer  of  my  purpose
[87:20] that  is  all  that  I  have  for  you  today 
 that  is  my  current  understanding  of  how
[87:26] purpose  works  as  a  young  masculine  man 
 and  I  truly  hope  that  this  video  May
[87:31] serve  you  some  kind  of  educational  value 
 that  you  might  even  want  to  save  to  your 
 watch  later  playlist  and  come  back  to  it
[87:38] over  and  over  because  one  thing  I  will 
 tell  you  from  my  own  research  and 
 learning  on  purpose  is  that  there  were
[87:44] so  many  things  that  I  I  learned  and  read 
 that  I  didn't  actually  understand  but  I
[87:49] kind  of  remembered  six  months  later  when 
 it  now  became  relevant  purpose  is  this
[87:54] one  topic  that  I  keep  seeming  to  like 
 keep  coming  back  to  places  that  I've 
 learned  about  it  especially  in  the  book
[87:59] The  Way  of  the  superior  man  and  I  keep 
 just  coming  back  when  I've  learned  or 
 you  know  I've  experienced  something  new
[88:04] with  my  life  and  I  hope  that  this  video 
 could  be  a  source  of  Education  that  you
[88:09] do  this  with  that  you  think  you  know 
 right  now  yeah  this  video  is  kind  of 
 nice  sweet  and  literally  three  months 
 from  now  or  six  months  from  now  or  a
[88:15] year  from  now  you  remember  this  video 
 when  something  in  your  life  actually 
 happened  you're  like  oh  that's  what
[88:20] Hamza  meant  he  said  this  and  then  you 
 come  back  to  this  video  and  you're  like 
 oh  yeah  okay  so  this  other  thing  he  said
[88:25] that's  interesting  because  I've  not 
 experienced  that  just  yet
[88:34] that's  all  I've  got 
 take  care  of  yourself  bro

 he  doesn't  understand  why  he  wants  to  be 
 motivated  and  disciplined  to  do  his  work
[00:05] to  go  to  the  gym  and  eat  clean  but  he 
 keeps  making  the  wrong  decisions  he 
 keeps  choosing  to  eat  the  junk  food  even
[00:10] though  he  wants  to  lose  weight  he  keeps 
 procrastinating  even  though  he  wants  to 
 be  productive  it's  like  he's  fighting  an
[00:15] uphill  battle  he's  swimming  upstream  if 
 only  he  knew  that  there  was  a  real 
 reason  why  he  was  struggling
[00:23] adonis 
 adonis  struggled  when  he  was  younger  too

[00:29] procrastinate  when  he  was  sent  forward 
 into  the  trials  and  tribulations  of  his 
 tribe  adonis  faltered  he  slipped  he
[00:34] fumbled  he  was  lazy  but  slowly  and 
 surely  he  figured  it  out  he  realized 
 that  it  was  not  the  physical  world  that

 problems  that  you're  experiencing  across

 fap  or  eating  clean  like  you've  really 
 wanted  to  lose  weight  you  really  want  to
[02:30] eat  clean  but  your  brain  for  some  reason

 thoughts  and  you  just  feel  quite  bad  if

 problems  you've  been  looking  at  it  the 
 wrong  way  and  no  one  has  explained  this

 symptoms  in  two  weeks  from  now  i'm  going 
 to  tell  you  my  story  related  to  mental
[05:29] health  and  you  can  skip  this  section  if 
 you  want  to  if  you  just  want  to  go 
 straight  into  the  guide  although  i  do 
 think  there  is  going  to  be  some  kind  of
[05:34] value  if  you  sit  through  and  just  listen 
 to  my  story  because  you'll  find  that 
 you'll  be  able  to  relate  to  me  and  the
[05:39] more  you  can  relate  to  me  the  more  that 
 you'll  kind  of  take  my  advice  seriously 
 i  didn't  realize  that  mental  health  was
[05:44] a  thing  up  until  just  a  few  years  ago 
 but  when  i  look  back  especially  at  times 
 in  high  school  when  i  was  14  15  16  years
[05:51] old  i  was  definitely  experiencing  the 
 symptoms  then  without  realizing  it  i  was 
 having  quite  negative  thoughts  i  was
[05:56] quite  anxious  always  like  worrying  about 
 you  know  if  the  teachers  would  call  my 
 parents  and  tell  them  that  i  was
[06:01] misbehaving  i  struggled  a  lot  being  able 
 to  concentrate  in  school  so  imagine 
 you're  in  the  classroom  and  the  teacher
[06:07] you  know  is  at  the  front  of  the  room  and 
 she's  trying  to  teach  you  something 
 she's  writing  down  on  the  board  she's 
 talking  to  the  class  and  i  would  want  to
[06:12] concentrate  i  would  want  to  get  high 
 grades  in  school  i  just  couldn't 
 concentrate  on  what  she  was  saying  she'd
[06:17] be  talking  to  us  and  my  mind  would  just 
 be  thinking  about  other  things  that  were 
 totally  irrelevant  to  my  studies  i  was
[06:23] very  consumed  in  video  games  and  this  is 
 a  psychological  term  called  escapism
[06:28] which  is  kind  of  like  escaping  reality 
 and  instead  going  into  this  virtual 
 reality  where  we  can  be  and  do  whatever
[06:34] we  want  because  in  real  life  i  was 
 a  sad  anxious  lonely  abused  little  kid
[06:41] with  not  a  lot  of  confidence  not  a  lot 
 of  friends  no  attraction  from  girls  but
[06:46] in  the  virtual  world  in  the  video  games 
 that  i  would  play  i  was  a  warrior  i  was 
 a  chef  i  was  a  knight  i  was  a  magician  i
[06:52] got  to  try  all  of  these  different  lives 
 and  so  it  was  so  nice  to  be  able  to  play 
 video  games  and  really  just  obsess  over
[06:57] them  in  my  mind  i  had  other  symptoms  as 
 well  i  was  binge  eating  so  imagine  a  14 
 year  old  and  i  just  had  this
[07:02] uncontrollable  urge  to  just  eat  as  much 
 junk  food  as  possible  why  was  this 
 happening  why  did  i  have  poor  mental
[07:08] health  at  this  age  i  was  traumatized  and 
 i  was  getting  more  and  more  trauma  every
[07:14] single  day  i  was  being  abused  at  home 
 abused  by  my  family  i  was  being  abused 
 in  school  honestly  like  school  was
[07:20] traumatizing  by  itself  and  a  teacher  is 
 unhappy  with  you  and  you  can't 
 concentrate  or  maybe  you  know  i  was
[07:25] talking  in  class  and  the  teacher  like  a 
 grown  adult  would  get  close  to  my  face 
 and  scream  and  threaten  me  some  of  the
[07:31] teachers  knew  what  was  happening  at  home 
 i  was  getting  abused  i  was  getting  like 
 physically  emotionally  hurt  by  my
[07:36] parents  by  my  brother  and  some  teachers 
 knew  what  was  happening  and  they  would 
 threaten  me  they'd  look  me  in  the  eyes
[07:41] with  a  certain  look  on  her  face  and  just 
 say  something  like  i'll  call  your  father
[07:46] and  we'll  see  what  he'll  do  to  you  we'll 
 see  what  he  has  to  say  about  that  when 
 you're  i  was  going  to  say  when  you're
[07:51] young  honestly  at  any  age  if  you  feel 
 compulsively  unsafe  and  you  kind  of  have
[07:56] to  stay  in  that  situation  you  can't  you 
 know  fortunately  be  able  to  like  leave 
 your  home  or  get  out  of  like  a  dangerous
[08:02] situation  when  you're  stuck  there  like 
 you're  stuck  with  your  family  you're 
 stuck  in  school  your  body  and  your 
 nervous  system  and  your  mind  deteriorate
[08:09] very  quickly  and  suddenly  you're  put 
 into  this  everlasting  fight-or-flight 
 feeling  and  you  can  probably  relate  to
[08:14] this  if  you  can  relate  to  the 
 experiences  that  i've  just  spoke  about 
 and  you've  experienced  things  like
[08:19] trauma  and  parental  abuse  and  you  could 
 probably  relate  to  this  feeling  of  your 
 fight-or-flight  system  just  always  being
[08:25] activated  so  there's  like  two  systems 
 inside  of  our  body  one  is  the  fight  or 
 flight  and  the  other  one  is  rest  and
[08:30] digest  so  the  rest  in  digest  is  what 
 should  happen  99  of  the  time  your  heart 
 rate  should  be  low  your  entire  body  and
[08:36] your  all  your  organs  and  all  that 
 sciency  stuff  is  just  working  exactly 
 how  it's  supposed  to  and  maybe  one
[08:41] percent  of  the  time  every  now  and  then 
 in  a  moment  of  extreme  stress  and  danger
[08:46] we  should  kick  into  fight  or  flight  and 
 you  know  really  kicking  like  this  is 
 actually  a  good  system  to  have  we 
 shouldn't  hate  on  the  fight  or  flight
[08:51] system  inside  of  us  it's  just  that 
 sometimes  especially  in  the  nature  of 
 child  abuse  when  you're  stuck  in  that 
 environment  like  i  was  when  i  was  a
[08:57] child  realistically  like  if  i  give  you  a 
 very  specific  example  i  don't  want  to 
 create  pictures  in  your  mind  that  can
[09:03] trigger  you  or  anything  so  you  should  be 
 warned  that  like  this  entire  video  is 
 going  to  be  discussing  mental  health
[09:08] abuse  trauma  everything  anxiety  fight  or 
 flight  everything  stress  so  just  be 
 warned  that  you  will  feel  yourself
[09:15] getting  triggered  in  a  trigger  like  i 
 don't  like  that  word  because  it's  too 
 many  like  soft  people  have  used  it  but
[09:20] you  will  find  your  emotions  if  you're 
 really  aware  of  them  as  you  watch  parts 
 of  this  guide  will  be  spiked  and  that's
[09:25] okay  just  be  aware  of  it  as  i  tell  you 
 the  story  or  you  can  skip  forward  so  a 
 realistic  example  of  something  that's
[09:31] practically  happened  in  my  life  let  me 
 give  you  one  example  so  you  can 
 so  you  can  know  in  high  school  we  had
[09:36] these  planners  that's  what  we  would  call 
 them  planners  which  is  like  a  a  booklet 
 which  has  like  the  days  of  the  week  and
[09:41] you  put  in  your  homework  there  and 
 there's  like  comments  from  teachers  so 
 if  you  got  a  comment  from  a  teacher  it 
 was  usually  like  a  bad  thing  you  know
[09:47] the  teacher  would  like  say  okay  give  me 
 your  planner  and  she'd  write  a  letter  to 
 your  parents  right  there  and  you  have  to 
 show  it  to  them  and  stuff  and  so  my  dad
[09:53] would  check  my  planner  every  couple  of 
 days  every  week  or  so  to  see  what 
 homework  i  had  had  and  there  was  this
[09:58] one  particular  time  where  he  asked  me  to 
 see  her  and  he  saw  that  there  was  a 
 homework  that  you  know  had  been  set  and
[10:04] then  he  noticed  that  that  homework  was 
 due  tomorrow  like  the  day  after  we  were 
 reading  it  and  within  an  instant  he
[10:10] slapped  me  hard  and  he  got  angry  and 
 he's  like  why  have  you  left  it  for  the 
 last  day  it  was  just  a  small  like  little
[10:16] small  i  forgot  what  it  was  but 
 essentially  like  the  teacher  set  it  on 
 that  day  so  she  set  it  on  that  day  and
[10:21] she  said  oh  yeah  just  like  quickly  do  it 
 for  tomorrow  and  just  like  that  like  i 
 still  remember  it's  till  this  day  and 
 i've  made  a  lot  of  progress  that  i  don't
[10:27] really  feel  activated  as  i  tell  you  the 
 story  which  is  a  very  very  good  sign  i 
 can't  explain  to  you  like  how  much  like
[10:32] i  will  tell  you  more  of  my  story  but  i 
 can't  explain  to  you  like  i've  put  in  a 
 lot  of  work  into  this  but  that  was  just
[10:37] one  experience  and  so  that  one 
 experience  of  your  caregiver  suddenly 
 attacking  you  you  know  it  jolts  that
[10:43] fight  or  flight  system  inside  of  you  and 
 suddenly  as  a  little  kid  like  you  feel 
 defenseless  and  you  know  like  i'm  always
[10:48] i'm  like  a  freezer  every  time  i  would 
 get  hit  by  my  parents  i  just  kind  of 
 freeze  there  and  just  stop  or  the  kids
[10:53] maybe  they'd  run  away  or  the  kids  they'd 
 like  fight  back  or  anything  i  was  always 
 a  freeze  and  so  when  this  would  happen  i
[10:58] just  you  know  i'd  freeze  my  dad 
 screaming  in  my  face  being  violent  being 
 aggressive  then  my  mum  would  come  in  and
[11:03] it's  like  you  know  just  chaotic  in  the 
 family  just  one  experience  like  that  can 
 be  traumatizing  and  so  trauma  is  when
[11:09] we'll  go  into  this  more  often  but  like 
 as  i  tell  you  these  words  i  don't 
 particularly  feel  activated  but  i  can
[11:15] tell  by  the  way  that  i'm  talking  my  mind 
 keeps  like  going  blank  for  a  split 
 second  i  keep  stopping  my  sentences  you
[11:20] can  see  that  it  still  affects  me  and  i'm 
 so  just  one  instant  like  the  story  i've 
 just  told  you  that  can  be  traumatizing
[11:26] of  itself  your  caregiver  attacking  you 
 and  you  being  really  scared  and  so  you 
 can  literally  get  form  of  ptsd  from  just
[11:33] one  instant  like  that  but  if  you've 
 experienced  childhood  abuse  you  know  by 
 your  parents  and  it's  consistent  and
[11:39] it's  over  the  long  term  hundreds  of 
 incidents  like  that  that's  when  this 
 like  mental  health  issue  really  started
[11:44] to  get  a  lot  more  serious  and  so  when 
 i'm  about  15  16  17  years  old  this  is
[11:50] when  i  first  started  to  notice  violence 
 aggressive  thoughts  in  my  mind  and  i've 
 never  really  been  a  violent  person
[11:56] there's  only  been  a  very  few  select 
 times  that  i've  physically  hurt  another 
 man  i've  never  heard  like  woman
[12:02] physically  before  there's  been  a  few 
 times  where  i've  like  fully  hurt  a  man 
 but  i've  had  a  lot  of  violent  thoughts
[12:08] and  they  started  around  age  15  16  and  it 
 didn't  feel  abnormal  you  know  sometimes 
 you  don't  really  question  the  kind  of
[12:14] thoughts  that  you  get  because  you're 
 just  so  used  to  them  when  i  look  back 
 now  and  i  don't  really  get  these  kind  of 
 thoughts  anymore  there  was  a  lot  and  it
[12:20] was  very  worrying  because  you  might 
 maybe  you're  experiencing  this  like 
 you've  got  to  understand  i  feel  like
[12:25] this  part  of  the  video  is  all  over  the 
 place  because  i'm  like  recounting 
 experiences  i  don't  know  if  there's 
 going to  be  value  in  the  words  i'm 
 saying  right  now  but  i  will  sort  of
[12:31] um  reframe  myself  soon  and  take  a  big 
 deep  breath  after  we're  done  with  my 
 story  and  then  hopefully  i'll  be  able  to
[12:37] instruct  you  for  the  rest  of  the  course 
 age  15  16  onwards  a  lot  of  violent
[12:42] thoughts  in  my  mind  aggressive  thoughts 
 and  to  be  you  know  totally  authentic  i'm 
 going  to  walk  you  through  one  of  the 
 random  thoughts  i  would  get  usually
[12:48] there  would  be  when  i  was  in  the  gym  my 
 brother  built  like  a  home  gym  in  our 
 garage  very  simple  like  bench  press
[12:53] squat  rack  whatever  so  i've  been  uh 
 listening  to  like  music  and  stuff  and  my 
 mind  very  very  frequently  very
[12:59] frequently  would  imagine  someone  being 
 hurtful  towards  me  maybe  my  family
[13:04] member  maybe  a  stranger  someone  being 
 racist  someone's  saying  something 
 someone  bullying  me  someone  like  picking 
 on  me  they  would  imagine  that  and  i
[13:10] would  get  a  sense  of  satisfaction  and 
 confidence  when  i  would  vividly  see 
 myself  very  vividly  hurting  them  and  i
[13:17] would  somewhat  be  acting  this  out  in 
 real  life  one  of  them  would  be  like 
 there's  some  guys  walking  past  me  and
[13:22] for  some  reason  he  just  calls  me  a  pack 
 he's  you  know  he's  been  racist  i  start 
 fighting  him  we  fall  to  the  floor  i've
[13:27] gotten  the  strength  advantage  like  the 
 upper  hand  and  then  my  mind  generates 
 these  very  vivid  thoughts  of  me  gouging
[13:33] his  eyes  out  crushing  his  face  and 
 imagine  having  thoughts  like  this 
 very  frequently  at  this  point  from  what
[13:40] i  can  remember  let's  say  i'm  16  years 
 old  17  18  years  old  it  would  happen  10 
 times  a  day  i'd  be  in  school  i'd  be  in
[13:45] you  know  college  or  whatever  trying  to 
 focus  on  what  the  teacher's  saying  and 
 suddenly  i  just  have  one  of  these  like
[13:50] emotional  outbursts  in  my  mind  then 
 things  got  a  lot  worse  and  so  that  was
[13:55] already  a  pretty  bad  existence  but 
 things  got  worse  i  eventually  left  my 
 family  home  and  i  moved  to  university  so
[14:01] i  started  having  the  time  of  my  life 
 i've  left  my  family  you  know  i can  be 
 like  the  kind  of  man  i  want  to  i  started
[14:06] getting  girls  i  started  like  hooking  up 
 and  going  to  parties  and  clubs  and 
 making  new  friends  and  being  loud  and
[14:11] drinking  and  taking  drugs  and  that 
 spiraled  very  very  quickly  my  biggest 
 aim  when  i  went  to  university  was  not  to
[14:16] study  or  to  be  a  good  student  or 
 anything  it  was  literally  just  make 
 friends  and  just  sleep  with  women  and
[14:21] that's  entirely  what  i  focused  on  and 
 you  know  it's  very  fun  making  progress 
 to  your  goals  especially  as  a  young  man
[14:27] and  you  know  you're  kind  of  carefree 
 you're  like  an  idiot  so  you're  like  oh 
 yeah  you  know  i  slept  with  three  girls 
 last  week  it's  so  amazing  and  the
[14:32] culture  that  this  put  me  into  that  i  put 
 myself  into  this  sort  of  drinking  drugs
[14:37] partying  nightclub  environments  it's 
 very  anxiety-inducing  you  go  to  like  one
[14:42] of  these  clubs  let's  say  in  the  uk  and 
 you  know  it's  a bunch  of  students  there 
 people  don't  really  realize  this  about  a
[14:47] club  or  a  party  because  a  lot  of  people 
 like  kind  of  lie  to  themselves  and  and 
 say  like  you  know  they  go  to  the  clubs
[14:52] or  the  auto  parties  just  to  have  fun  and 
 dance  with  their  friends  and  stuff  but  a 
 lot  of  people  don't  really  see  the 
 evolutionary  psychology  that's  going  on
[14:58] here  it's  a  very  very  primal  environment 
 because  the  underlying  reason  why  men
[15:03] are  going  to  this  kind  of  environment 
 are  parties  and  clubs  is  because  they 
 want  to  hook  up  with  the  girls  there  and
[15:08] the  underlying  reason  why  the  girls 
 there  go  and  spend  hours  getting  ready 
 you  know  makeup  and  stuff  and  a  lot  of 
 girls  lie  and  say  like  oh  no  it's  just
[15:14] for  myself  i'm  just  you  know  they  say 
 the  but  the  underlying  subconscious 
 reason  why  girls  go  there  is  because 
 they  want  to  get  the  attention  of  the
[15:20] guys  who  are  there  and  a  bunch  of  girls 
 also  do  want  to  hook  up  too  so  it's  a 
 very  very  primal  environment  it's  full
[15:25] with  a  bunch  of  like  guys  at  the  peak  of 
 their  testosterone  levels  drinking  in 
 groups  of  them  a  bunch  of  girls
[15:31] stressing  in  very  like  quite  provocative 
 ways  very  sexualized  environments 
 alcohol's  flowing  and  so  it  can  be  a
[15:36] very  anxious  environment  and  i  got  like 
 good  in  this  environment  and  something 
 if  you've  never  really  been  to  clubs  or
[15:41] parties  something  you'll  maybe  find  out 
 all  i  can  tell  you  is  that  every  couple 
 of  nights  there  is  some  kind  of  like
[15:46] incidents  there  is  a  fight  there  is  you 
 know  some  arguments  and  it's  not  even 
 that  significant  after  a  while  just
[15:52] you're  used  to  it  we'd  go  out  me  and  my 
 friends  and  we'd  always  kind  of  know 
 like  oh  yeah  like  you  know  we'd  probably 
 end  up  hitting  someone  today  we'd
[15:57] probably  end  up  like  getting  into  like  a 
 tussle  or  arguments  or  shouting  because 
 this  guy  said  this  so  this  guy's  bumped
[16:02] into  him  and  so  whilst  i  was  over 
 indulging  in  this  environment  and  i  was 
 getting  good  at  it  i  didn't  realize  how
[16:08] much  anxiety  it  was  really  causing  that 
 you  know  that  those  same  violent 
 thoughts  of  like  self-protection  and  you
[16:13] know  to  hurt  another  man  they  started 
 compounding  in  my  mind  exponentially  the 
 origin  for  those  violent  thoughts  for  me
[16:19] would  have  been  my  family  and  it  would 
 have  been  you  know  the  sense  of  like 
 injustice  from  being  abused  by  my
[16:24] caregiver  but  eventually  it  was  very 
 much  compounded  by  this  environment  that 
 i  was  getting  into  and  then  things  got
[16:29] even  more  traumatizing  i  was  the  victim 
 of  a  racist  incident  so  in  manchester
[16:34] there  was  a  bombing  like  a  terrorist 
 attack  in  2018  it  was  in  the  ariane
[16:39] grande  stadium  it  was  like  a  big  musical 
 concert  and  there  was  a  terrorist  attack 
 there  and  a  few  days  after  that  i
[16:45] finished  work  i  go  to  the  train  station 
 to  go  home  and  there's  just  so  much 
 commotion  this  yelling  and  what  was
[16:51] happening  was  that  there  was  two  guys 
 who  were  drunk  who  was  screaming  and
[16:56] being  racist  at  a  muslim  woman  wearing 
 like  a  hijab  and  her  little  girl  that 
 she  had  like  you  know  holding  her
[17:01] clothes  they're  screaming  in  her  face 
 saying  that  she  you  bombed  us  like 
 they're  blaming  her  on  the  attack
[17:06] they're  just  you  know  they're  crazy 
 these  guys  are  crazy  and  everything  but 
 i  remember  getting  there  seeing  this  and
[17:11] something  just  came  inside  of  me  for  the 
 first  time  like  this  was  before  i  could 
 fight  this  was  before  i  was  strong  i
[17:16] just  started  yelling  at  these  guys 
 swearing  at  them  it  enraged  me  and  i 
 think  what  what  enraged  me  more  was  not
[17:23] so  much  just  the  racist  guys  but  the 
 fact  that  there  was  lots  of  other  people 
 on  the  train  station  just  kind  of  like 
 buried  into  their  phones  you  know  trying
[17:29] not  to  pay  attention  to  what's  going  on 
 all  the  commotion  and  even  the  staff  who 
 work  there  but  i  get  it's  like  a  verbal
[17:34] commotion  with  these  guys  and  you  know 
 it  gets  kind  of  scary  there's  two 
 grown-ass  drunk  men  in  front  of  me 
 screaming  at  me  calling  me  like  the
[17:40] and  everything  i  get  onto  my  train 
 eventually 
 i'm  calming  down  a  little  bit  and  just  i
[17:45] don't  know  where  they  walk  past  me  and 
 sit  close  to  me  and  for  like  a  20  minute 
 train  ride  they're  just  swearing  loud
[17:51] racist  everything  everyone's  silent  on 
 the  train  and  we  get  off  well  i  get  off
[17:56] first  i  look  back  and  they  stand  up  and 
 they  see  me  stand  up  and  they're  like 
 following  me  off  the  train  you  know  i 
 have  to  text  my  dad  come  in  come  like
[18:02] help  this  racist  i  literally  still 
 remember  texting  my  dad  this  because  he 
 was  waiting  outside  to  pick  me  up  and  i 
 text  him  this  message  saying  racist  on
[18:08] the  train  come  inside  quick  and  he 
 starts  calling  me  but  i  tell  him  i  can't 
 pick  up  i  don't  know  why  i  didn't  just 
 pick  up  go on  the  phone  call  but  i  tell
[18:13] him  like  come  inside  and  i  walk 
 downstairs  in  the  train  station  he  walks 
 past  me  he's  like  what's  going  on  what's
[18:18] going  on  then  they  walk  down  and  then 
 there's  like  a  big  like  tussle  and 
 everything  big  fighting  and  this  one  guy 
 he  just  keeps  doing  some  creepy  one
[18:24] of  the  drunk  guys  he  just  keeps  like 
 smiling  in  the  really  weird  way  and
[18:29] saying  like  okay  come  here  like  he's 
 he's  kind  of  got  one  hand  behind  his 
 back  and  he's  like  come  here  just  shake 
 my  hand  just  shake  my  hand  and  he  just
[18:34] does  this  so  much  he  does  it  to  me  he 
 does  it  to  my  father  a  bunch  of  times  he 
 just  keeps  like  trying  to  get  close  to 
 us  with  his  hand  behind  his  back  he  was
[18:40] later  on  arrested  and  he  had  an  11-inch 
 knife  on  him  this  was  all  on  the  news  he 
 was  jailed  for  one  and  a half  years  he
[18:46] it  would  have  been  a  lot  longer  but  he 
 didn't  pull  the  knife  out  at  any  point 
 or  he  was  trying  to  wait  for  like  the 
 perfect  opportunity  the  the  police
[18:52] officer  told  me  this  like  if  you 
 actually  pulled  a  knife  out  then  it's 
 way  higher  but  if  you  just  have  it  like 
 on  your  person  then  it's  only  classed  as
[18:57] like  possession  of  a  bladed  article  so 
 we've  got  one  and  a half  years  for  this 
 and  my  anxiety  that  same  thing  that  i've
[19:03] told  you  about  those  violent  thoughts 
 man  that 
 they  increased  heavily  and  so  all  those
[19:08] symptoms  that  i  had  before  like  binge 
 eating  and  violent  thoughts  they 
 compounded  so  much  more  if  i  couldn't
[19:13] focus  in  school  or  university  before 
 this  now  it  was  just  totally  it  felt
[19:18] impossible  and  the  only  thing  that  i 
 really  spent  my  time  doing  at  this  point 
 was  just  waking  up  smoking  weed  and  just 
 binge  eating  food  wanting  to  stay
[19:24] comfortable  in  my  own  little  bubble  and 
 not  even  realizing  that  this  was  a 
 mental  health  issue  after  this  i 
 struggled  heavily  for  around  one  to  two
[19:31] years  and  it's  strange  that  i  can  kind 
 of  conclude  those  two  years  in  just  a 
 single  sentence  so  yeah  i  struggled
[19:36] heavily  but  when  i  think  back  to  those 
 hundreds  of  days  where  i  woke  up  feeling
[19:41] depressed  and  so  anxious  where  every 
 single  day  i  was  seeing  the  physique 
 that  you  know  meant  so  much  to  me  like
[19:47] fitness  means  a  lot  to  me  and  i  was 
 seeing  my  physique  and  my  strength  and 
 my  skill  my  endurance  all  just  go  down
[19:52] every  single  day  because  i  was  choosing 
 comfort  over  discipline  i  was  just 
 somewhat  like  scared  to  leave  the  house
[19:57] i  never  wanted  to  admit  it  but  i  just 
 you  know  i  it  felt  so  much  more 
 comfortable  to  think  to  myself  yeah  i'll 
 stay  in  all  day  i  got  into  a
[20:02] relationship  that  was  pretty  toxic  and 
 not  very  loving  and  that  was  my 
 responsibility  that  was  my  that  was  my
[20:08] fault  i'll  take  full  responsibility  for 
 that  and  it's  sad  man  i  literally  i 
 experienced  somewhat  of  the  height  of  my
[20:13] life  at  the  start  of  university  with 
 like  friends  and  and  partying  and  girls
[20:18] and  everything  and  my  life  just  went 
 straight  down  all  because  of  mental 
 health  but  what's  interesting  is  that
[20:23] through  all  this  i  didn't  even  know  that 
 mental  health  was  the  problem  it  became 
 more  apparent  to  me  after  i  finished
[20:28] university  and  i  started  looking  for 
 jobs  and  i  got  into  that  young  person's 
 existential  crisis  which  you  don't  know
[20:34] what  to  do  with  your  life  the  jobs 
 you're  working  aren't  really  that  good  i 
 started  working  a  customer  service  job
[20:39] in  a  complaints  department  which 
 literally  would  make  me  cry  but  and  this 
 is  when  i  started  to  look  into 
 entrepreneurship  and  online  businesses
[20:44] but  i  literally  always  struggled  to 
 actually  being  productive  especially  by 
 myself  in  school  we  have  like  a  teacher
[20:50] an  authority  figure  maybe  if  you're  a 
 young  man  you  have  like  your  parents  who 
 are  looking  at  you  and  saying  okay  do
[20:55] this  work  right  now  when  you  leave  the 
 education  system  you're  not  really 
 prepared  for  that  so  you  become  your  own
[21:00] boss  and  that  became  extra  stressful 
 because  i  just  wasn't  doing  any  work 
 that  i  would  set  by  myself  i  would  say
[21:05] to  myself  okay  i  want  to  make  this 
 website  you  know  i  want  to  do  like  this 
 business  task  today  what  do  you  think  i
[21:10] did  i'd  wake  up  and  i  just  started 
 smoking  weed  and  then  i  didn't  do  the 
 work  and  it  was  at  this  time  age  21
[21:16] where  i  luckily  just  stumbled  upon 
 people  talking  about  improving  their 
 mental  health  on  reddit  there's  like  an 
 online  discussion  of  like  mental  health
[21:22] resources  it  was  the  start  of  the 
 coveted  lockdown  this  period  of  my  life 
 changed  everything  i  started  researching
[21:28] mental  health  learning  things  about 
 depression  anxiety  gratitude  mindfulness
[21:33] all  the  practical  no  bs  things  that  we 
 can  implement  for  free  that  will  improve 
 our  mental  health  and  that's  what  you're
[21:38] gonna  learn  in  this  guide  i've  said  many 
 times  that  there  are  no  overnight 
 successes  i've  said  many  many  times
[21:44] there's  no  shortcut  to  success  you  have 
 to  work  hard  for  a  long  time  you  have  to 
 be  consistent  you  have  to  be  disciplined
[21:50] but  if  there  is  one  shortcut  to  success 
 it's  improving  your  mental  health  i
[21:55] discovered  mental  health  and  i  started 
 to  actively  improve  it  and  i  promise  you 
 that  this  is  the  case  within  two  weeks
[22:00] my  life  changed  forever  within  two  weeks 
 i  left  that  relationship  that  was  kind 
 of  toxic  i've  not  really  gave  many
[22:06] details  about  it  because  i  spoke  about 
 it  extensively  in  previous  videos  plus  i 
 just  don't  want  to  really  speak  about  it
[22:11] too  much  but  i  left  that  relationship  i 
 was  living  with  her  so  we  lived  together 
 in  an  apartment  and  moved  out  finally
[22:17] moved  out  i  quit  smoking  weed  i  quit 
 eating  junk  food  i  moved  back  home  to  my 
 parents  house  in  the  middle  of  covid  and
[22:23] i  literally  got  into  the  best  shape  of 
 my  life  so  far  i  got  ultra  league  my 
 diet  was  fantastic  i  started  meditating
[22:28] for  20  minutes  then  40  minutes  and  60 
 minutes  a  day  i  was  journaling  i  was 
 working  on  businesses  i  had  the  quickest
[22:33] turnaround  of  my  entire  life  and  that 
 really  just  snowballed  into  the  success 
 that  i  have  today  which  i  feel  is
[22:39] massive  i  want  the  same  thing  for  you  so 
 in  this  guide  we're  going  to  focus  on
[22:44] the  two  most  common  mental  illnesses 
 which  are  depression  and  anxiety  when 
 you  talk  that  online  mood  assessment
[22:50] that  i  linked  at  the  top  of  the 
 description  you  would  have  gotten  a 
 depression  and  anxiety  score  the  goal  of
[22:55] this  guide  is  to  half  those  scores 
 within  just  two  weeks  so  if  you  took
[23:00] that  test  and  you  scored  14  for 
 depression  and  16  for  anxiety  in  just 
 two  weeks  of  following  this  guide  we
[23:05] want  to  get  you  to  seven  on  depression 
 and  eight  on  anxiety  are  massive
[23:10] improvements  let's  talk  about  depression 
 i  believe  depression  is  actually  the 
 most  common  illness  slash  disability  in
[23:17] western  developed  countries  what  is 
 depression  a  lot  of  people  mistakenly 
 think  that  depression  is  like  a  feeling
[23:23] of  sadness  and  like  you  know  like  oh  i 
 feel  depressed  not  necessarily 
 depression  isn't  sadness  it's  more
[23:30] emptiness  nihilism  like  there's  no 
 meaning  or  purpose  to  your  life  why  do
[23:35] we  get  depressed  and  why  is  it  so  common 
 in  the  modern  day  it's  because  we're 
 living  without  purpose  you  and  i  we're
[23:40] young  men  100  years  ago  we  would  have 
 had  a  wife  and  children  at  this  age  we
[23:45] had  a  rock  solid  purpose  we  had  our 
 family  and  there  was  wars  that  we  would 
 be  drafted  off  to  so  our  lives  would
[23:51] have  had  our  mission  we  would  have  been 
 focused  on  something  we  don't  really 
 have  that  anymore  we  don't  have  a 
 mission  we  don't  have  a  clear  purpose
[23:56] for  our  lives  and  so  we  lack  meaning 
 there's  also  another  major  issue  which
[24:01] causes  the  symptoms  of  depression  which 
 is  over  indulging  in  instant 
 gratification  so  i'm  going  to  give  you
[24:06] the  bro  science  explanation  for  why  i 
 think  depression  is  so  common  especially 
 amongst  like  young  unproductive  people
[24:13] you  need  to  learn  two  terms  instant 
 gratification  and  delayed  gratification
[24:18] instant  gratification  comes  from  the 
 activities  that  we  do  that  feel  good 
 right  now  but  they  kind  of  make  our  life
[24:24] worse  in  the  long  run  so  this  is  things 
 like  porn  video  games  watching  tv  eating
[24:29] junk  food  all  of  those  things  feel  good 
 right  now  they  feel  pleasurable  we  want 
 to  do  them  right  now  we're  really
[24:34] motivated  to  do  them  right  now  but  we 
 kind  of  know  that  it  makes  our  life 
 worse  every  time  that  we  over  indulge  in
[24:39] those  things  and  you  know  we  play  video 
 games  like  six  hours  we  kind  of  realize 
 that  oh  yeah  like  you  know  i  just  wasted 
 a  bunch  of  time  which  i  should  have  been
[24:45] doing  my  work  in  or  we  eat  the  junk  food 
 and  it  tastes  really  nice  on  our  lips 
 for  a  few  seconds  but  then  we  just  think
[24:50] oh  why  did  i  eat  that  i've  just  gained 
 so  many  calories  so  instant 
 gratification  activities  feel  good  right 
 now  but  make  your  life  worse  in  the  long
[24:57] run  when  we  over  indulge  in  instant 
 gratification  activities  like  porn  video 
 games  junk  food  like  the  majority  of  us
[25:03] are  doing  our  baseline  happiness 
 enjoyment  and  fulfillment  of  life  goes
[25:08] down  and  down  and  down  we  get  like  a 
 momentary  high  from  these  pleasurable 
 activities  but  the  baseline  that  we  come
[25:14] down  to  goes  down  every  single  time  we 
 overindulge  and  so  the  majority  of  us 
 are  over  indulging  in  porn  and  video
[25:20] games  and  so  our  baseline  happiness  like 
 our  normal  level  of  happiness  and
[25:25] fulfillment  is  very  very  low  to  the 
 point  that  we  just  feel  empty  that  we  we 
 don't  feel  anything  this  is  usually
[25:32] where  the  argument  comes  in  where  people 
 ask  is  depression  curable  is  it  not  just 
 genetics  and  a  lot  of  people  who  have
[25:38] depression  really  really  asserted  that 
 it's  genetics  and  you  know  they  can't 
 change  it's  just  like
[25:43] i've  got  depression  that's  how  i've  got 
 to  live  for  the  rest  of  my  life  and  in 
 my  opinion  that's  a  very 
 self-destructive  belief  i'm  a  big
[25:49] believer  that  you  should  believe  the 
 things  that  benefit  you  and  believing 
 that  oh  well  i  can't  change  anything
[25:54] about  this  doesn't  serve  you  in  any 
 beneficial  way  is  there  progress  that
[25:59] you  could  make  to  improve  your  mental 
 health  yes  so  it's  actually  beneficial 
 for  you  to  make  sure  that  you  haven't
[26:04] convinced  yourself  that  depression  and 
 any  other  mental  illness  is  something 
 that  you  can't  change  because  you  can
[26:10] always  make  some  kind  of  progress  and 
 just  for  an  anecdotal  experience  i've 
 helped  multiple  people  who  were  certain
[26:17] that  their  depression  was  totally 
 genetic  unchangeable  you  know  it's  not 
 it's  not  because  they  play  video  games
[26:22] all  day  they  were  so  certain  that  they 
 were  depressed  for  like  genetic  reasons 
 that  they  were  on  antidepressants  and
[26:27] with  just  two  weeks  of  following  this 
 plan  their  lives  changed  and  they  set  in 
 motion  to  significantly  improve  their
[26:32] mental  health  my  best  friend  sam  he's 
 the  youtuber  named  harbinator  he  was  the 
 first  video  editor  that  i  got  for  my
[26:37] channel  he  was  certain  that  he  had 
 clinical  depression  he  was  on 
 antidepressants  he's  not  anymore  he's
[26:42] the  happiest  most  healthy  most 
 productive  he's  ever  been  in  his  life 
 because  we  have  to  change  his  beliefs 
 and  tell  him  like  why  are  you  belittling
[26:48] your  own  self  and  why  don't  you  just  see 
 what  would  happen  if  you  just  start  to 
 believe  that  you  can  make  some  progress
[26:54] here  and  that's  exactly  what  happened 
 it's  hard  to  convince  someone  who's  so 
 stuck  in  their  ways  thinking  like  nope  i
[27:00] can't  change  it  because  you  know  the 
 doctor  said  it's  genetic  but  whilst 
 we're  talking  about  all  this  depression 
 seems  like  the  enemy  that  we  want  to
[27:06] fight  against  you  know  it's  a  bad  thing 
 that's  happening  to  us  i  don't  think  so 
 i  think  it  would  actually  serve  us  to  be
[27:11] grateful  for  our  depression  we  can  view 
 depression  actually  as  our  ally
[27:16] depression  is  these  emotions  which  is 
 kind  of  like  a  thermostat  telling  us
[27:21] that  something  is  wrong  with  our  lives 
 that  we're  living  without  meaning  that 
 we're  over  indulging  in  bad  habits
[27:26] that's  actually  very  beneficial  when  you 
 think  about  it  your  body  is  literally 
 giving  you  like  an  unpleasant  feeling  of
[27:31] like  emptiness  and  purposelessness 
 you're  getting  that  feeling  on  purpose 
 to  hopefully  direct  you  into  the  right
[27:37] course  of  action  we  should  be  grateful 
 for  depression  because  if  we  didn't  have 
 this  feeling  that  was  showing  us  that  we
[27:42] were  on  the  wrong  track  of  life  you 
 wouldn't  be  watching  this  video  today 
 you  wouldn't  have  ever  really  cared 
 about  improving  your  mental  health  and
[27:48] so  how  do  you  cure  depression  first  off 
 you  need  to  stop  doing  the  things  that 
 are  causing  you  to  feel  that  way  which
[27:53] is  those  instant  gratification 
 activities  and  this  is  like  a  hard 
 swallow  pill  for  a lot  of  people  because
[27:58] they  really  don't  want  to  admit  they're 
 so  certain  that  you  know  video  games  and 
 lack  of  sunlight  and  lack  of  water  and
[28:03] lack  of  proper  nutrition  are  causing 
 them  to  feel  negative  and  empty  and 
 nihilistic  but  it  probably  is  the  case
[28:09] we  need  to  stop  doing  those  bad  habits 
 i'm  going  to  start  doing  the  good  mental 
 health  practices  that  you're  going  to 
 learn  in  this  guide  now  there's  a  very
[28:15] interesting  concept  of  depression  that 
 we  can  talk  about  here  which  is  that 
 having  depression  actually  makes  it  hard
[28:21] if  not  impossible  to  do  the  things  that 
 would  ease  depression  so  when  you  have
[28:26] depression  it  almost  feels  like  you  have 
 an  inability  to  be  productive  and  to  do 
 the  right  things  that  would  ease
[28:31] depression  it's  almost  like  a  catch  22 
 it's  like  a  very  deadly  cycle  and  so  i 
 want  to  reframe  your  mind  here  to
[28:36] empower  you  to  be  able  to  make  some 
 changes  in  your  life  don't  think  about 
 it  as  depression  stopping  you  from  being
[28:41] able  to  do  like  the  good  habits  and  you 
 know  forcing  you  to  stay  on  the  bad 
 habits  and  simply  just  look  at  all  this
[28:46] as  it  is  habits  if  we  can  nail  just  the 
 habits  without  this  extra  belief  like  oh
[28:51] yeah  well  you  know  i'm  handicapped 
 because  i  have  this  issue  and  we  simply 
 just  say  okay  you're  struggling  with  the
[28:56] habit  of  exercise  well  there's  100 
 things  i  can  teach  you  about  that  you're 
 struggling  with  the  habit  of  diet  well
[29:01] there's  a  hundred  things  i  could  teach 
 you  about  that  if  we  simply  change  your 
 habits  you  will  feel  better  and  your 
 score  and  that  mental  health  assessment
[29:07] will  go  down  and  so  now  let's  talk  about 
 anxiety  how  does  it  feel  to  be  anxious
[29:12] it  feels  like  you're  hyper  vigilant 
 you're  like  really  really  aware  you're 
 overthinking  about  bad  things  that  could
[29:18] happen  what's  interesting  is  that 
 anxiety  is  quite  individual  and  unique 
 in  each  person  like  what  their  form  of
[29:24] anxiety  is  so  my  form  of  anxiety  is 
 about  physical  danger  my  anxious
[29:29] thoughts  have  always  been  about  like 
 other  people  like  is  this  guy  gonna 
 attack  me  it's  always  about  like 
 physical  fight  violence  whereas  another
[29:35] person's  anxiety  can  be  social 
 anxiousness  they  could  be  like 
 obsessively  like  anxiously  thinking
[29:40] about  the  social  dynamics  in  this  like 
 group  of  friends  that  they're  in  and 
 they  feel  activated  and  even  though  that
[29:45] seems  like  wait  why  would  you  be  anxious 
 about  you  know  a  group  of  friends  that's 
 still  quite  a  primal  thing  when  you
[29:50] think  about  being  accepted  into  the 
 tribe  that's  a  very  important  part  of 
 animal  and  human  nature  anxiety  can  lead
[29:56] to  panicking  fear  aggressiveness  and  it 
 even  has  very  negative  effects  on  your
[30:01] physical  health  when  you're  anxious  and 
 hyper  vigilant  what's  actually  happening 
 on  a  physiological  level  is  that  you're
[30:07] entering  the  fight  or  flight  mode  so 
 that's  like  the  survival  mode  inside  of 
 us  which  is  kicking  in  and  really
[30:12] telling  us  okay  do  we  fight  this  person 
 or  do  we  run  away  and  when  that  happens 
 when  the  survival  mode  kicks  in  a  lot  of
[30:18] our  normal  bodies  processes  are  stopped 
 so  that  we  can  allocate  resources  to
[30:23] like  the  real  survival  mechanisms  inside 
 of  us  now  again  i'm  going  to  give  you 
 like  a  bro  science  explanation  you  can
[30:28] go  find  like  the  specific  scientific 
 details  if  you  want  but  when  you're 
 anxious  it's  like  your  brain  and  your 
 body's  telling  things  like  for  example
[30:34] your  muscles  to  like  get  ready  for 
 fighting  or  for  running  away  but  by 
 allocating  resources  into  these
[30:39] short-term  survival  things  like  you  know 
 faster  thinking  and  like  stronger  more 
 agile  muscles  resources  get  taken  away
[30:46] from  more  of  our  long-term  health  organs 
 so  for  example  a  lot  of  people  with
[30:51] anxiety  also  suffer  from  like  gut 
 problems  digestive  problems  because 
 that's  like  a  long-term  health  thing
[30:56] which  experiences  like  negativity 
 because  all  of  our  resources  are  being 
 allocated  otherwise  i  know  this  sounds
[31:02] like  maybe  too  much  information  but  like 
 if  i  have  some  kind  of  you  know  intense
[31:07] anxiety  and  moments  a  few  hours  after 
 that  i'm  probably  gonna  have  diarrhea  it 
 doesn't  happen  anywhere  near  as  much  as
[31:13] it  used  to  be  i  know  this  is  like  too 
 much  information  but  you  do  need  to  know 
 these  things  like  i  lived  for  years  and
[31:18] years  and  years  four  or  five 
 six  times  a  day  and  never  once  was  a
[31:24] cylinder  bro  it was  always  like  liquidy 
 pieces  and  i  know  that's  so  much  like 
 information  but  like  i  think  it's  so 
 important  that  you  know  the  the  real
[31:30] unfiltered  truths  of  a  mental  illness 
 like  this  like  it's  not  nice  so  why  do 
 we  get  anxious  why  does  our  body  go  into
[31:35] this  hyper  vigilance  state  now  first  of 
 all  we  have  to  understand  just  like  with 
 depression  like  this  is  something  that
[31:40] we  should  feel  grateful  for  anxiety  is 
 just  our  body's  survival  mechanism 
 trying  to  protect  us  it's  just  that
[31:46] sometimes  when  that  survival  mechanism 
 kicks  in  it  kind  of  gets  glitched  it 
 kind  of  gets  messed  up  and  it  kind  of
[31:52] stays  on  far  longer  than  it  actually 
 should  so  what  may  have  happened  is  that
[31:57] at  a  young  age  there  was  something  quite 
 traumatizing  and  scary  that  happened  to
[32:02] us  most  likely  it  was  something  to  do 
 with  our  parents  just  you  know  being 
 violent  or  whatever  and  so  there's  a
[32:07] chance  that  any  of  these  traumatic 
 incidents  that  our  body  gets  stuck  in 
 this  anxious  state  and  it  just  kicks
[32:12] into  overdrive  trying  to  save  us  and  so 
 then  even  when  we  leave  this  dangerous
[32:17] situation  our  body  and  mind  is  just  on 
 overdrive  just  hypervigilance  just 
 making  sure  we  don't  go  back  to  that
[32:22] same  dangerous  situation  again  it's  of 
 utmost  importance  that  you  reframe  the 
 anxious  thoughts  and  the  feeling  of
[32:28] hyper  vigilance  reframe  your  mind  with 
 this  because  for  so  long  we've  lived 
 thinking  that  these  things  are  bad  if
[32:33] they're  the  enemy  i  don't  want  to  be 
 anxious  i  don't  want  to  be  depressed  we 
 have  to  be  grateful  and  actually  to  see
[32:39] okay  interestingly  this  is  actually  my 
 brain  and  my  body  doing  a  good  thing  for 
 me  anxiety  isn't  the  enemy  it's  trying
[32:46] to  protect  you  because  there  was  a 
 moment  in  your  life  where  you  couldn't 
 protect  yourself  there  was  a  point  when
[32:51] you  you  got  scared  so  heavily  that  now 
 your  body's  just  really  vigilant  it's
[32:56] like  your  body's  just  sending  signals 
 all  around  you're  saying  like  come  on 
 like  we've  got  to  protect  him  that 
 brings  like  a  tear  to  my  eye  because  for
[33:02] so  long  i  hated  this  part  of  me  and  i 
 realized  that  so  much  progress  comes 
 when  you  realize  the  utility  the  value
[33:09] of  depression  and  anxiety  how  do  you 
 cure  anxiety  i  believe  the  single 
 greatest  tool  that  the  practice  that  you
[33:15] can  implement  is  mindfulness  and  you're 
 going  to  learn  about  that  in  this  guide
[33:20] now  let's  go  over  the  actual  practical 
 things  that  you  can  do  to  improve  your 
 mental  health  and  if  there's  just  one
[33:25] tool  that  you  take  from  this  entire 
 guide  that  you  implement  into  your 
 normal  life  let  it  be  gratitude  now
[33:31] gratitude  is  more  like  a  trait  a  skill 
 it's  the  skill  of  counting  your  blessing
[33:36] so  you  know  in  religions  like 
 christianity  and  islam  before  they  eat 
 food  they  say  a  small  prayer  they  say
[33:41] grace  that  they're  grateful  for 
 something  gratitude  is  like  the 
 scientific  version  of  happiness  because
[33:46] happiness  as  you  may  know  it  it's  kind 
 of  a  wishy-washy  emotion  you  don't 
 really  know  when  you'd  get  happy
[33:51] sometimes  you're  happy  for  no  reason 
 sometimes  you  can't  be  happy  even  in  a 
 situation  where  you  should  be  happy
[33:57] gratitude  the  scientific  version  of  that 
 which  you  can  induce  with  total  control 
 and  if  you  follow  the  technique  which
[34:02] i'm  about  to  walk  you  through  your  life 
 will  change  forever  gratitude  is  when 
 you  stop  and  you  force  your  brain  to
[34:07] think  positive  thoughts  about  of  things 
 that  you  appreciate  and  there's  an 
 important  word  which  i  just  said  and
[34:12] that  word  is  false  for  a  lot  of  people 
 thoughts  of  gratitude  aren't  normal  and
[34:17] so  you  almost  have  to  manually  implant 
 them  forcibly  implant  those  thoughts  of 
 gratitude  into  your  mind  try  this
[34:23] actionable  step  right  now  pick  one 
 person  in  your  contact  list  one  person 
 whose  number  you  have  choose  one  person
[34:28] and  send  them  a  text  message  of 
 gratitude  send  them  a  couple  of 
 sentences  maybe  a  paragraph  maybe  two 
 paragraphs  of  you  saying  i'm  grateful
[34:34] for  you  because  of  this  and  just  make  it 
 as  entirely  as  positive  and  as  loving  as
[34:39] you  can  so  just  before  you  send  them 
 this  message  really  just  think  yourself 
 okay  pick  the  person  in  your  mind  who 
 you're  gonna  send  it  to  and  think  of
[34:44] some  happy  memories  that  you  have 
 together  think  of  some  positive  things 
 that  they've  done  for  you  and  things
[34:49] that  you've  done  together  if  you  really 
 just  did  what  i  said  and  really 
 visualize  the  happy  times  you've  had
[34:54] with  someone  and  how  you're  grateful  for 
 that  you  can't  help  but  smile  you  can't 
 help  but  feel  happy  about  this  and  it's
[34:59] so  interesting  that  within  just  a  few 
 seconds  you've  just  put  a  smile  onto 
 your  face  you've  literally  just  induced
[35:05] happiness  onto  yourself  that's  extremely 
 powerful  and  now  you  can  induce  that 
 same  feeling  of  happiness  and  gratitude
[35:11] onto  a  friend  or  a  family  member  so  this 
 is  the  actionable  step  to  take  right  now 
 if  you  really  want  this  guy  to  help  you
[35:16] pause  the  video  right  now  and  go  on  to 
 your  contact  list  on  whatsapp  text 
 message  whatever  pick  one  person  and
[35:21] send  them  like  a  couple  of  sentences 
 maybe  a  paragraph  just  of  you  saying 
 that  you're  grateful  for  them  that's
[35:26] such  a  simple  act  what  you've  just  done 
 you've  literally  just  sent  a  text 
 message  and  yet  you've  become  happier 
 because  of  it  you  can  see  that  the  power
[35:32] of  gratitude  is  massive  and  we  don't 
 utilize  it  enough  and  so  we  want  some 
 kind  of  gratitude  practice  to  become  a
[35:37] habit  for  you  to  maximize  the  benefits 
 of  gratitude  we  want  you  to  do  a 
 practice  like  sending  that  text  message
[35:43] of  gratitude 
 every  day  and  if  you  can  do  that  at  the 
 same  time  so  consistently  that  would
[35:48] transform  your  mental  health  to  such  a 
 level  that  you  might  not  even  be  able  to 
 realize  right  now  imagine  if  every
[35:53] single  day  at  the  same  time  you  sent 
 like  a  nice  loving  message  to  one  person 
 one  friend  one  family  member  for  weeks
[35:59] for  months  and  of  course  after  a  little 
 while  you'd  run  out  of  friends  and 
 family  to  message  and  at  that  point  you
[36:04] could  start  maybe  reaching  out  to  people 
 who  aren't  really  totally  your  friends 
 maybe  you  could  go  on  like  discord
[36:09] servers  like  we  have  a  discord  server 
 for  this  channel  and  there's  a  bunch  of 
 young  guys  on  self-improvement  the 
 discord  link  is  in  the  description  of
[36:15] this  video  if  you  want  to  join  in  it's 
 like  60  70  000  young  men  who  are 
 discussing  self-improvement  no  fat
[36:21] imagine  if  you  end  up  you  know  just 
 speaking  to  someone  there  you  have  a 
 nice  conversation  and  then  you  send  them 
 a  message  of  gratitude  you  could
[36:27] reasonably  find  one  person  every  single 
 day  maybe  it'd  take  you  5-10  minutes  and 
 to  spend  that  time  to  not  only  feel
[36:33] grateful  but  then  to  also  express  it  to 
 someone  it's  such  a  beautiful  habit  that 
 you  can  get  into  there's  all  the
[36:38] gratitude  practices  you  can  try  and  the 
 one  that  i've  personally  done  the  most 
 it's  just  simple  gratitude  journaling
[36:43] and  that's  where  you  literally  just 
 write  down  what  you're  grateful  for  on  a 
 piece  of  paper  on  your  phone  you  just 
 write  i'm  grateful  for
[36:49] this  fireplace  it's  very  very  confident 
 i'm  not  gonna  lie  i  kind  of  panicked
[36:54] when  i  first  set  it  on  fire's  a  bit  you 
 know  sometimes  can  be  a  bit 
 uncontrollable  but  it's  like  i'm  very
[36:59] grateful  for  it  this  is  the  first  time 
 i've  used  like  a  wooden  log  burner  like 
 i  said  i'm  in  scotland  right  now  amongst
[37:04] nature  it's  very  peaceful  place  so  i'm 
 grateful  for  the  airbnb  i'm  staying  in
[37:09] i'm  grateful  for  the  woman  who's  hosting 
 us  here  the  nature  the  animals  the
[37:14] donkeys  and  the  horses  outside  this  is 
 what  i  would  write  down  every  single  day 
 just  three  points  five  points  of  things
[37:20] that  you're  grateful  for  and  you'll  find 
 that  as  you  write  these  thoughts  of 
 gratitude  will  start  to  become  automatic
[37:26] into  your  mind  just  take  a  second  to 
 think  how  nice  that  would  be  that 
 throughout  your  normal  day-to-day  your
[37:31] mind  would  automatically  just  give  you  a 
 thought  of  gratitude  that  would  feel 
 amazing  i  could  literally  just  get  a
[37:36] sudden  boost  of  like  happiness  and 
 appreciation  and  that's  what  we  really 
 want  and  so  we  put  in  a  little  bit  of
[37:41] discipline  and  consistency  in  practices 
 like  a  daily  message  of  gratitude  or 
 gratitude  journaling  same  time  every
[37:47] single  day  we  just  do  it  for  five 
 minutes  ten  minutes  and  the  return  on 
 investment  for  this  is  so  incredible
[37:53] like  i  said  if  there's  one  thing  that 
 you  do  for  your  mental  health  make  it 
 gratitude  let's  talk  about  mindfulness
[37:58] and  you  might  have  heard  of  this  already 
 so  mindfulness  is  often  joined  together 
 with  meditation  and  you  were  expecting
[38:04] meditation  to  come  into  this  mental 
 health  guide  there's  a  reason  why  when 
 you  clicked  on  this  guide  instantly  you 
 knew  that  i'd  be  talking  about
[38:09] meditation  you  inherently  know  and 
 understand  and  believe  that  meditation
[38:14] will  be  good  for  your  mental  health  so  i 
 don't  even  need  to  explain  that  to  you 
 it's  like  very  common  knowledge
[38:19] meditation  is  good  for  your  mental 
 health  it's  better  if  we  spend  our  time 
 practically  speaking  about  how  you  can
[38:24] implement  meditation  into  your  life  if 
 you  haven't  been  able  to  already  i  want 
 to  give  you  advice  that  you've  never
[38:29] heard  anywhere  else  before  first  we  need 
 to  discuss  why  we're  all  so  mindless  so 
 mindfulness  is  what  we  want  mindfulness
[38:36] is  like  present  it's  the  ability  to  be 
 focused  of  what's  happening  here  right 
 now  instead  of  having  just  random
[38:42] thoughts  as  i  speak  these  words  to  you 
 there's  quite  literally  zero  thoughts  in 
 my  mind  every  time  i  sit  down  to  record
[38:47] a  video  or  if  i  live  stream  i  get  into  a 
 total  flow  state  i'm  totally  mindful  and
[38:52] present  that  means  that  as  i  speak  these 
 words  to  you  there's  no  thoughts  of 
 negativity  no  hateful  thoughts  no
[38:57] negative  feelings  inside  of  my  mind  i'm 
 just  existing  and  i'm  just  performing 
 it's  a  blissful  state  being  mindful  and
[39:03] present  and  it  is  a  core  component  of 
 mental  health  and  happiness  but  then  we
[39:08] have  to  ask  each  other  why  are  we  all  so 
 mindless  for  most  of  the  time  what  i've 
 just  said  is  somewhat  of  a  rare
[39:13] occurrence  okay  i'm  satya  i  have  no 
 thoughts  in  my  mind  i'm  totally  present 
 but  for  the  majority  of  people  probably
[39:19] including  yourself  you're  probably 
 mindless  for  a  large  part  of  the  day  and 
 i  am  too  so  there's  certain  moments 
 where  i'm  totally  present  like  i  am  here
[39:25] but  for  a  large  part  of  the  day  i'm 
 still  mindless  and  we  have  to  ask 
 ourselves  why  now  of  course 
 evolutionarily  there's  gonna  be  some
[39:31] benefit  for  us  to  be  able  to  think 
 throughout  the  day  and  stuff  fair  enough 
 you  know  to  get  some  ideas  and  to 
 survive  fine  but  it's  obvious  to  us  that
[39:37] as  a  generation  our  levels  of 
 mindfulness  and  presence  are  so  low  why
[39:42] i  think  if  there's  one  explanation  it's 
 our  smartphones  the  apps  that  we  have  on 
 our  phones  social  media  tick  tock
[39:48] instagram  twitter  what  happens  is  that 
 we  go  onto  these  platforms  and  you  know 
 you  might  have  taken  a  big  step  back
[39:53] from  social  media  i  have  to  i've  deleted 
 all  social  media  but  we  spent  years  on 
 those  platforms  right  now  what  you're
[39:58] doing  is  very  good  you're  watching  like 
 one  full  length  long  video  and  you're 
 giving  it  your  full  attention  you  are
[40:03] giving  it  your  full  ascent  you're  not 
 like  scrolling  down  looking  at  the 
 comments  right  now  are  you  but  when  you 
 sit  down  and  you  give  something  your
[40:08] full  attention  like  this  you're  actually 
 training  your  brain  to  focus  better  the 
 issue  then  is  with  apps  like  tick  tock
[40:14] and  instagram  and  twitter  you're  seeing 
 like  new  data  you  know  new  posts  every 
 what  one  second  half  a  second  you  know
[40:21] you're  just  scrolling  scrolling  scroll 
 it  you're  training  your  brain  to  be  able 
 to  focus  for  half  a  second  and  then 
 quickly  switch  up  and  to  start  thinking
[40:26] about  a  different  piece  of  content  like 
 a  different  topic  our  attention  spans 
 are  not
[40:32] not  ideal  and  i  really  really  fear  for 
 the  young  generation  perhaps  you're  a 
 young  man  watching  this  but  i  fear  for
[40:37] the  young  generation  who  have  been 
 raised  on  ipads  and  iphones  if  you're  my 
 age  i'm  25  so  we  got  these  things  at
[40:43] like  age  15  and  you  know  that's  bad 
 enough  we've  had  technology  like  this 
 like  smartphones  for  like  10  years  but
[40:48] there's  kids  who  have  been  raised  on 
 technology  like  smartphones  and  ipads
[40:53] since  age  four  five  less  i  didn't  mean 
 to  get  into  a  rant  here  man  but  almost 
 every  day  i  go  to  like  cafes  and
[40:59] restaurants  and  i  always  always  see  like 
 a  family  and  the  parents  are  just 
 talking  and  the  little  kids  just  got  an
[41:04] iphone  what's  that  doing  to  their  brain 
 it's  training  them  to  be  able  to  only 
 hold  their  attention  for  a  few  seconds
[41:10] up  until  they  click  on  like  the  next 
 thing  obviously  little  babies  are  on 
 like  youtube  watching  like  cartoons  or
[41:15] something  your  phone  can  be  and  is  for 
 some  people  their  biggest  allies  you  can 
 run  an  entire  business  off  your  phone
[41:21] but  you  can  also  ruin  your  life  from  it 
 right  here  right  now  i  want  you  to  just 
 have  the  humility  and  ask  yourself  which
[41:27] category  are  you  in  are  you  in  truly  the 
 person  who's  using  their  phone  and 
 social  media  truly  don't  lie  to  yourself
[41:33] are  you  truly  doing  that  in  a  productive 
 beneficial  way  totally  beneficial  it's
[41:38] making  you  rich  it's  giving  you  status 
 it's  giving  you  the  things  that  you  want 
 or  are  you  in  the  99.99  of  group  people
[41:44] who  it's  probably  more  of  a  detriment 
 for  up  until  just  a  few  weeks  ago  i  was 
 100  here  but  i've  made  some  really  good
[41:49] steps  and  i  want  to  walk  you  through 
 them  because  i  can  tell  you  how  to 
 increase  your  mindfulness  through  things
[41:54] like  meditation  which  we  will  do  but 
 it's  very  important  for  us  to  spend  some 
 time  to  make  sure  you're  not  decreasing
[41:59] it  significantly  because  even  though 
 meditation  and  other  mindfulness 
 activities  are  really  powerful  i  don't
[42:04] think  they  can  counteract  the  damage 
 that's  done  through  smartphones  and  i 
 think  that's  the  biggest  number  one
[42:09] thing  that  we  need  to  focus  on  to  stop 
 decreasing  our  mindfulness  we  need  to 
 simply  just  decrease  how  we  use  our
[42:14] phones  what  social  media  do  you  still 
 use  you  can  potentially  consider  youtube 
 one  especially  if  you  don't  really  watch
[42:20] long  videos  like  this  and  you  generally 
 watch  like  youtube  shorts  or  shorter 
 five  minute  clickbait  videos  the  first
[42:26] major  step  that  you  can  take  today  to 
 stop  reducing  your  mindfulness  is  to 
 take  a  big  step  back  from  the  worst
[42:33] social  medias  and  i  would  say  they  are 
 tick  tock  100  tick  tock  is  the  worst  for
[42:38] many  reasons  but  it's  particularly  the 
 worst  for  mindfulness  it's  just  too  too
[42:43] quick  and  it's  the  same  with  instagram 
 and  perhaps  even  twitter  there's  just 
 too  much  data  information  new  content
[42:49] that  you're  seeing  every  0.5  seconds  you 
 have  to  take  a  big  step  back  from  this
[42:54] entertaining  kind  of  content  and  at  the 
 very  least  switch  over  to  more 
 educational  if  you  are  going  to  be
[42:59] frying  your  brain  and  lowering  your 
 mindfulness  at  least  don't  do  it  for 
 entertainment  at  least  don't  do  it  just
[43:05] like  waste  time  and  just  pretend  oh  well 
 you  know  i'm  just  unwinding  what  i  did 
 personally  was  that  i  just  stopped  using
[43:10] instagram  and  i  just  started  watching 
 more  educational  videos  on  youtube  i 
 started  watching  more  long  form  podcasts
[43:17] unedited  longer  video  was  kind  of  like 
 this  one  that  simple  change  from 
 reducing  how  much  you  watch  these  like
[43:22] short  form  random  videos  to  the  long 
 form  educational  content  it's  absolutely
[43:28] huge  this  is  what  transformed  my  life 
 and  it  really  helps  me  to  learn  and  to 
 become  more  successful  that  one  change
[43:34] will  truly  alter  the  trajectory  of  where 
 your  levels  of  mindfulness  are  going 
 because  right  now  for  the  majority  of
[43:39] people  it's  going  way  down  but  if  you 
 just  simply  take  a  step  back  from  like 
 these  content  aggravation  sites  tick
[43:45] tock  instagram  twitter  is  there  any 
 others  youtube  shorts  as  well  you'll  be 
 going  into  the  right  direction  now  we
[43:50] can  focus  on  the  primary  things  that 
 increase  your  mindfulness  and  the  number 
 one  best  way  possible  is  meditation  but
[43:56] there  are  also  things  that  improve  your 
 levels  of  mindfulness  that  are  usually 
 not  really  speaking  about  things  that
[44:01] require  presence  and  concentration  and 
 so  the  next  part  of  this  guide  is  going 
 to  be  on  a  topic  that  you  might  have  not
[44:07] really  realized  is  a  linked  with  mental 
 health  and  no  one  has  ever  really  linked 
 the  two  together  we'll  discuss  that
[44:12] shortly  but  first  let's  just  go  through 
 the  benefits  that  you'll  feel  if  you 
 increase  your  mindfulness  and  then  i'll
[44:17] tell  you  exactly  how  to  increase  it  the 
 benefits  you'll  feel  you'll  be  able  to 
 be  present  and  actually  enjoy  what's 
 happening  you  know  there's  a  very  sad
[44:23] reality  of  the  human  experience  is  that 
 we  can  be  in  a  happy  situation  and  not
[44:29] be  happy  it's  very  interesting  isn't  it 
 there's  been  times  when  you  should  have 
 been  happy  you  should  have  been  positive
[44:34] something  good  happened  and  you  didn't 
 really  feel  that  good  interestingly  for 
 the  stoics  amongst  us  or  maybe  you  have
[44:40] a  level  of  emotional  regulation  which  is 
 really  good  there's  been  times  when  you 
 probably  should  have  felt  bad  but  you
[44:45] didn't  you  felt  kind  of  good  more 
 mindful  you  are  the  better  you'll  be 
 able  to  regulate  your  emotions  you'll  be
[44:50] able  to  truly  enjoy  experiences  instead 
 of  just  being  in  an  environment  which 
 should  be  pleasant  and  just  finding
[44:56] yourself  just  over  thinking  about 
 something  irrelevance  you'll  find  it  way 
 easier  with  more  mindfulness  to  make
[45:01] friends  and  to  maintain  really  good 
 relationships  so  much  better  because 
 imagine  if  you  and  i  are  gonna  have  an
[45:07] initial  chat  we're  gonna  have  a 
 conversation  i  see  you  in  my  gym  and 
 you're  like  oh  my  god
[45:12] and  we  come  up  and  i  speak  to  you  right 
 if  i  can  subconsciously  you  know  i  won't 
 really  think  in  my  mind  but  if  i  could
[45:18] subconsciously  tell  you're  not  present 
 for  our  conversation  if  it's  just  kind 
 of  obvious  that  you're  like  thinking
[45:23] about  something  else  if  i'm  speaking  to 
 you  and  it's  obvious  that  you're  not 
 really  listening  we're  not  really  going 
 to  get  along  are  we  and  now  imagine  for
[45:29] deeper  relationships  like  your  family  or 
 a  girl  that  you're  in  love  with  to  be 
 able  to  be  present  with  them  there  and
[45:34] then  just  truly  with  them  focus  on  them 
 that's  a  a  wonderful  gift  that  you  can 
 give  to  them  on  the  other  hand  imagine
[45:40] your  mum  is  talking  to  you  and  you've 
 just  got  thoughts  going  on  in  your  mind
[45:45] and  you're  not  truly  even  listening  to 
 her  people  pick  up  on  these  things  one 
 of  the  most  practical  benefits  of  more
[45:50] mindfulness  is  that  you'll  just  be  able 
 to  focus  and  concentrate  on  work  and 
 study  so  much  better  you  can  probably
[45:55] relate  to  this  for  a  lot  of  people  can't 
 even  read  like  a  lot  of  people  literally 
 struggle  to  read  these  days  if  you
[46:00] grabbed  a  book  right  now  and  the  book 
 was  like  a  little  bit  boring  would  you 
 be  honest  would  you  experience  this
[46:05] maybe  after  reading  a  paragraph  you 
 don't  really  remember  what  you've  just 
 read  because  if  you're  really  aware  of
[46:10] it  you'll  realize  that  you're  almost 
 like  pretending  to  read  whilst  you're 
 thinking  about  something  else  to  be  able
[46:15] to  read  and  study  effectively  you  need 
 to  be  mindful  in  fact  to  be  able  to  do 
 almost  anything  effectively  in  life  you
[46:22] need  to  be  mindful  so  how  do  you  become 
 more  mindful  through  meditation  how  do 
 you  actually  meditate  because  it  seems
[46:27] like  such  a  weird  topic  we're  going  to 
 do  a  very  very  short  meditation  session 
 together  and  it's  going  to  be  on  like  a 
 lot  of  the  sessions  you  may  have  tried
[46:33] previously  because  i'm  going  to  walk  you 
 through  a  very  practical  no  bs  framework 
 for  improving  your  mindfulness  with
[46:39] meditation  it's  a  four-step  framework 
 we're  gonna  start  at  step  one  and  that's 
 to  be  mindful  of  something  that's
[46:44] happening  in  the  present  moment  and  so 
 the  breath  is  commonly  used  in 
 meditation  so  essentially  just  just  be
[46:49] mindful  and  present  and  aware  of  your 
 breath  just  put  all  your  focus  onto  your 
 breath  right  now
[47:00] keep  your  focus  there  just  keep 
 breathing  just  keep  your  focus  onto  your 
 breath
[47:06] now  without  really  realizing  if  we  did 
 this  for  another  5-10  seconds  you  may 
 not  be  consciously  aware  but  step  two  of
[47:13] the  way  to  improve  your  mindfulness  is 
 that  you  actually  lose  your  focus  on  the 
 thing  that  you  are  focusing  on  so  step
[47:18] one  is  to  be  focused  and  present  on  our 
 breath  step  two  is  actually  when  you 
 lose  focus  on  a  thing  but  you  haven't
[47:24] realized  it  just  yet  because  there's  a 
 gap  i  hope  you  can  understand  this  when 
 we  first  lose  awareness  and  we  become
[47:29] mindless  we  don't  actually  realize  we're 
 not  aware  that  we  are  currently  mindless 
 for  at  least  some  time  up  until  there's
[47:35] almost  like  an  aha  moment  and  we're  like 
 oh  i'm  mindless  so  step  one  is  focus  on 
 our  breath
[47:40] step  two  after  a  few  seconds  we've  lost 
 awareness  but  we're  not  even  aware  that 
 we've  lost  awareness  step  three  is  that
[47:47] now  we  are  aware  that  we  lost  our  focus 
 on  the  breath  so  step  three  is  that 
 moment  where  you  think  oh  i  was  supposed
[47:52] to  be  meditating  and  i  was  just  deep  in 
 thought  about  something  else  and  finally 
 step  four  is  to  just  come  back  to  the 
 thing  that  you  were  focused  on
[47:57] originally  so  step  one  focus  on  your 
 breathing
[48:02] step  two  subconsciously  lose  awareness 
 of  the  thing  we  were  focusing  on  but  you 
 don't  even  realize  it  just  yet
[48:08] i'm  thinking  about  high  school  and  then 
 step  three  is  you  realize  you  were 
 thinking  about  something  else  oh  oh  i
[48:14] was  thinking  about  high  school  when  i 
 should  be  focusing  on  my  breath  okay 
 i'll  go  back  to  the  breath  step  four
[48:21] you  complete  all  four  steps  and  that's 
 like  one  rep  one  squat  one  bicep  curl
[48:26] for  the  brain  interestingly  this  is 
 where  a  lot  of  people  get  upset  when 
 they  try  to  meditate  they  try  to 
 meditate  and  then  they  lose  their  focus
[48:32] and  they  say  they  can't  do  it  but  what 
 you  need  to  understand  is  that  if  we  go 
 through  all  four  steps  it's  like  one
[48:37] bicep  curl  for  the  brain  our  brain's 
 just  gotten  stronger  we've  just  gained 
 10  mindfulness  experience  and  so  we
[48:43] actually  want  to  go  through  these  four 
 steps  as  fast  and  as  often  as  possible
[48:48] what  that  means  is  that  when  you  try  to 
 meditate  and  you  lose  focus  it's
[48:53] actually  a  good  thing  this  is  why  so 
 many  people  struggle  with  meditation 
 they  try  it  and  then  they  don't  enjoy  it
[48:58] because  it's  not  working  for  them 
 they're  not  able  to  clear  their  mind  of 
 thoughts  what  they  don't  realize  is  that 
 every  time  you  lose  your  focus  that's
[49:03] actually  an  opportunity  to  simply  just 
 bring  your  focus  back  to  the  present 
 moment  and  to  gain  that  like  experience
[49:08] in  video  games  you  have  like  xp 
 experience  for  like  the  skill  every  time 
 you  come  back  to  the  present  moment  you
[49:13] come  back  to  your  breath  that's  like  10 
 experience  in  your  mindfulness  skill  you 
 need  to  lose  your  awareness  and  to  think
[49:19] about  something  else  to  be  able  to 
 actually  gain  more  mindfulness  i'm 
 recording  a  full  meditation  video  that
[49:25] you  can  follow  along  to  every  day  and 
 i'll  have  a  card  pop  up  on  screen  as 
 soon  as  it's  released  so  click  on  that
[49:30] card  right  now  you  can  just  load  it  up 
 save  it  to  your  watch  later  and  start 
 listening  to  it  maybe  every  morning  or 
 every  night  time  the  next  tool  to
[49:36] improve  your  mental  health  is 
 challenging  yourself  and  you  might  not 
 have  ever  considered  challenges  to  be  a
[49:41] tool  for  your  mental  health  but  when  we 
 set  challenges  for  ourselves  we  enter 
 what's  called  a  flow  state  a  flow  state
[49:48] is  kind  of  like  an  extreme  state  of 
 presence  and  mindfulness  so  in  the 
 previous  part  of  this  guys  we  just  spoke
[49:54] about  presence  and  mindfulness  and  we 
 said  that's  when  you're  able  to  focus  on 
 what's  going  on  at  the  task  at  hand 
 you'll  have  no  thoughts  but  a  flow  state
[49:59] is  when  you're  so  focused  that  you  lose 
 track  of  the  time  suddenly  two  hours 
 have  gone  by  and  you're  like  what  it
[50:04] felt  like  20  minutes  and  i  did  so  much 
 and  i'm  so  productive  at  least  you  just 
 did  more  work  or  i  did  better  than  i've
[50:09] done  in  the  last  week  it's  only  when  we 
 enter  a  flow  state  that  we  really  tap 
 into  our  ultimate  potential  a  flow  state
[50:15] is  what  athletes  call  being  in  the  zone 
 you  might  have  heard  that  saying  an 
 athlete  will  say  oh  well  you  know  i  just
[50:20] entered  the  zone  that's  a  flow  state 
 that's  extreme  mindfulness  and  presence 
 and  that  comes  from  challenge  you  can
[50:26] only  enter  a  flow  state  being  in  the 
 zone  if  you've  got  some  kind  of 
 challenge  and  there's  so  many  more
[50:31] benefits  to  this  not  just  your  mental 
 health  but  increases  in  testosterone 
 when  you  challenge  yourself  and  when
[50:36] there's  some  kind  of  competition  your 
 testosterone  rises  setting  yourself  some 
 kind  of  challenges  where  you're  so
[50:41] focused  will  lead  to  more  success  and 
 accomplishments  and  it'll  make  you  feel 
 just  happier  and  more  proud  for  yourself
[50:46] so  this  might  seem  like  a  weird  part  of 
 this  guide  we're  talking  about  mental 
 health  why  am  i  talking  about  challenges 
 but  you  see  when  you  set  challenges  it
[50:52] just  kicks  your  brain  into  overdrive  and 
 lets  you  just  totally  focus  on  something 
 rather  than  like  ruminating  on  negative
[50:58] thoughts  so  the  way  that  you  can  improve 
 your  mental  health  and  also  the  rest  of 
 your  life  how  masculine  you  are  how
[51:03] successful  you  are  how  happy  and 
 accomplished  you  are  is  through  setting 
 yourself  some  kind  of  challenges  that
[51:08] you  can  obsess  over  for  example  you 
 could  be  reading  a  book  and  say  to 
 yourself  you  know  what  i'm  going  to 
 finish  this  book  by  the  end  of  the  week
[51:13] or  you  can  say  that  you  want  to  go  on 
 three  runs  this  week  you  want  to  run  for 
 a  total  of  10  kilometers  this  week  and
[51:18] you're  writing  it  down  you're  tracking 
 the  data  and  it's  exciting  because 
 you're  thinking  wait  it's  saturday  and  i 
 still  got  two  kilometers  i  don't  want  to
[51:24] go  right  now  you  know  what  okay  i'm 
 gonna  go  on  a  run  right  now  that  kind  of 
 aggressive  energy  makes  you  feel  good
[51:29] working  hard  on  a  meaningful  goal 
 naturally  makes  us  feel  good  about 
 ourselves  especially  if
[51:34] you  are  the  one  who  has  set  that  goal 
 that  challenge  you  know  it's  an 
 interesting  thing  that  you  go  a  large
[51:40] part  of  your  life  without  ever  setting 
 yourself  to  do  any  kind  of  work  or 
 challenge  because  the  teacher  in  school
[51:46] does  it  for  you  we've  been  conditioned  i 
 don't  mean  to  go  on  a  run  here  but  we've 
 been  conditioned  to  wait  for  an
[51:51] authority  figure  to  tell  us  what  to  do 
 to  set  us  challenges  and  work  we  need  to 
 become  that  authority  figure  for
[51:56] ourselves  it's  like  stand  up  straight 
 with  your  shoulders  back  and  safety  so 
 okay  i  am  going  to  do  this  thing  by  this
[52:01] date  we  can't  always  rely  on  the  teacher 
 or  the  boss  to  tell  us  what  to  do  we
[52:06] need  to  start  setting  challenges  for 
 ourselves  so  here's  the  actionable  step 
 just  take  a  minute  right  now  to  think
[52:12] and  maybe  write  down  one  or  two 
 challenges  goals  that  you  can  set  for 
 yourself  by  the  end  of  this  week  and  if
[52:17] it's  saturday  or  sunday  right  now  then 
 do  it  for  next  sunday  what  is  a 
 challenge  that  you  can  set  for  next
[52:22] sunday  perhaps  it's  to  finish  reading 
 this  book  to  work  out  five  times  to  go 
 on  three  runs  maybe  you  want  to  do  a
[52:28] longer  term  challenge  like  hit  one 
 million  subscribers  before  november 
 that's  mine  if  you're  watching  this 
 video  in  november  have  a  look  at  our
[52:34] channel  subscriber  counts  it's  going  to 
 be  over  1  million  save  yourself  one  or 
 two  challenges  right  now  and  they  could
[52:39] be  short  term  or  long  term  whatever  it 
 is  it's  just  some  kind  of  challenge  that 
 will  make  you  take  like  some  kind  of
[52:44] work  productive  thing  more  seriously  set 
 that  challenge  and  start  to  obsess  over 
 it  when  you  start  to  work  on  that
[52:50] challenge  you  will  naturally  just  feel 
 good  to  improve  your  mental  health  we 
 absolutely  have  to  talk  about  your
[52:55] physical  health  and  your  physical  health 
 may  actually  be  the  single  most 
 important  influence  on  your  mental
[53:01] health  it's  a  sad  state  for  the  majority 
 of  young  men  who  are  just  so  physically
[53:06] unhealthy  you  don't  realize  how  far  we 
 are  away  from  living  like  our  ancestors
[53:11] was  the  majority  of  us  sit  down  for  10 
 hours  a  day  school  makes  you  wake  up 
 when  you're  still  sleep  deprived  we
[53:16] don't  get  much  sunlight  anymore  we  don't 
 have  like  high  levels  of  testosterone 
 with  competition  and  challenge  with  our 
 brothers  we  eat  food  that's  been
[53:21] genetically  modified  with  pesticides  and 
 pumped  full  of  refined  sugars  there's  a
[53:26] lot  of  things  that  are  very  negatively 
 affecting  our  physical  health  and  you'll 
 find  that  if  you  improve  some  things  of
[53:32] your  physical  health  which  we'll  discuss 
 here  your  mental  health  will  improve  as 
 an  indirect  result  of  that  this  section
[53:38] of  the  guide  is  probably  going  to  give 
 you  the  biggest  improvements  in  your 
 mental  health  but  the  reason  why  i've 
 put  this  section  on  physical  health
[53:44] after  the  few  sections  we've  already 
 spoke  about  which  is  gratitude 
 mindfulness  and  challenge  is  that  you
[53:49] actually  need  to  do  these  things  first 
 to  be  able  to  make  progress  in  your 
 physical  health  just  like  everyone  else
[53:55] you've  probably  tried  to  improve  your 
 physical  health  you've  probably  tried  to 
 like  lose  weight  or  go  to  the  gym  or 
 improve  your  sleep  or  eat  cleaner  it's
[54:01] probably  always  felt  like  a  bit  of  a 
 struggle  like  you're  swimming  upstream 
 if  right  now  you're  struggling  with 
 things  like  to  be  able  to  go  to  the  gym
[54:07] consistently  to  be  able  to  eat  clean  you 
 know  there's  that  decision  to  be  made 
 should  you  eat  the  junk  food  and  you
[54:13] know  rationally  you  know  that  you 
 shouldn't  but  if  right  now  you're  still 
 at  the  level  where  you  just  keep 
 choosing  the  wrong  thing  if  you  struggle
[54:19] to  improve  your  sleep  if  you  struggle  to 
 improve  so  many  different  parts  of  your 
 physical  health  if  that  is  relatable  to 
 you  right  now  please  trust  me  when  i  say
[54:25] that  any  effort  you  make  to  try  to 
 improve  your  physical  health  will  be  a 
 waste  of  time  i  know  this  sounds  so
[54:30] weird  if  you  struggle  to  try  to  improve 
 your  physical  health  it's  a  waste  of 
 time  to  try  to  improve  it  directly  if
[54:36] you're  struggling  to  try  to  for  example 
 get  onto  a  good  clean  diet  and  you  know 
 you  keep  saying  i'm  gonna  go  on  a  diet
[54:41] but  then  you  keep  cheating  on  your  diet 
 if  you're  struggling  to  consistently 
 work  out  focusing  on  those  things  will
[54:46] just  constantly  just  keep  you  in  this 
 loop  where  you'll  never  achieve  anything 
 what  you  need  to  do  if  you're  currently
[54:51] struggling  with  things  like  diet  or 
 working  out  or  whatever  you  need  to 
 focus  on  the  previous  three  parts  of
[54:56] this  guide  gratitude  meditation  and 
 challenge  if  you  focus  on  them  instead 
 you'll  find  that  you'll  naturally  be
[55:01] able  to  actually  do  more  of  the  physical 
 health  habits  i  wasn't  able  to  improve 
 my  diet  for  literally  years  for  years  i
[55:07] tried  to  literally  for  years  i  tried  to 
 follow  all  these  fitness  youtubers  who 
 are  telling  me  this  diet's  better  than
[55:12] this  one  and  if  it  fits  your  macros  or 
 calories  income  you  know  they're  telling 
 me  all  these  things  and  i  simply  just 
 couldn't  stop  overeating  i  simply  just
[55:18] couldn't  say  no  to  the  junk  food  and  no 
 one  had  ever  spoke  about  this  before  i 
 realized  after  my  own  experimentation
[55:24] the  one  key  secret  to  be  able  to  improve 
 your  diet  isn't  all  of  these  fancy  diets
[55:29] it's  meditation  you  need  to  have  levels 
 of  mindfulness  gratitude  and  some  kind 
 of  challenge  to  be  able  to  improve  your
[55:34] physical  health  first  so  focus  on  those 
 sections  now  if  you're  going  to  continue 
 watching  this  part  of  the  guide  you're
[55:39] making  this  promise  right  now  that  you 
 already  have  started  to  meditate  and  do 
 some  kind  of  gratitude  practice  and
[55:44] you've  set  yourself  some  kind  of 
 challenge  like  okay  a  reasonable 
 challenge  okay  i  want  to  work  out  twice 
 this  week  you  should  have  all  those
[55:50] things  in  place  first  before  we  really 
 dive  deep  into  these  there's  three  parts 
 of  our  physical  health  that  greatly
[55:55] influence  our  mental  health  and  they  are 
 diet  exercise  and  sleep  your  diet  plays
[56:00] a  huge  role  in  how  you  feel  mentally  and 
 it  would  take  me  a  full  length  video  to 
 be  able  to  explain  it  in  detail  if  you
[56:06] want  my  very  very  detailed  explanation 
 of  diet  and  nutrition  in  a  way  that's
[56:11] explained  in  my  way  which  is  like  no  bs 
 no  fancy  words  just  you  know  just  talk 
 to  me  like  i'm  a  five-year-old  so  i  can
[56:16] really  understand  it  instead  of  all 
 these  like  scientists  telling  me  i 
 made  like  a  45-minute  diet  educational
[56:22] video  that  went  viral  and  i  have  it  up 
 as  a  card  on  screen  so  you  can  click  on 
 that  card  right  now  and  just  pause  that 
 video  and  just  maybe  save  it  to  go  watch
[56:28] later  and  you  can  watch  that  when  you're 
 totally  thinking  about  diets  it  would 
 take  me  far  too  long  to  explain 
 everything  in  terms  of  diet  here  but
[56:34] just  in  short  what  you  know  about  diet 
 and  nutrition  and  your  food  choices  is
[56:39] so  so  limited  and  the  issue  is  the 
 people  who  seem  like  they're  educating 
 you  right  now  you  know  these  fitness
[56:44] influencers  fitness  youtubers  especially 
 they're  all  selling  you  this  lie  which 
 is  based  on  like  you  can  eat  whatever
[56:49] you  want  and  you  can  still  lose  weight 
 and  the  thing  is  that  might  be  true  you 
 know  calories  in  calories  out  if  it  fits
[56:54] your  macros  those  things  might  be  true 
 but  those 
 eating  certain  foods  will  reduce  your
[56:59] health  that  should  not  be  a  big 
 statement  for  all  of  modern  times  we
[57:04] would  follow  this  one  golden  phrase 
 which  is  that  you  are  what  you  eat  and 
 in  the  last  10  years  the  fitness
[57:09] influencers  have  ruined  it  you  know 
 these  fitness  youtubers  they're  very 
 famous  and  they  make  videos  of  them 
 doing  like  10  000  calorie  challenges  and
[57:15] they've  got  abs  and  they're  like  look  at 
 me  i'm  eating  a  donut  you  can  actually 
 eat  a  donut  if  you  eat  the  right 
 calories  and  okay  you  can  be  lean  and
[57:20] eat  whatever  you  want  fine  but  when 
 we're  talking  about  health  the  issue  is 
 that  if  you  eat  something  like  a  donut
[57:25] which  is  full  of  refined  sugars  it  will 
 mess  up  your  gut  microbiome  mess  up 
 almost  like  what's  called  the  second
[57:31] brain  of  your  body  which  is  your  gut  it 
 will  mess  that  up  and  it  will  literally 
 influence  and  deteriorate  your  genes
[57:37] what  we  eat  has  a  huge  way  bigger  impact 
 on  how  we  feel  and  how  our  brain  works
[57:44] than  what  we  think  you  know  there  was  a 
 study  that  showed  that  if  you  give 
 natives  a  western  diet  so  these  guys
[57:49] they're  not  used  to  like  western  foods 
 junk  food  or  whatever  and  if  you  give 
 them  this  diet  their  intelligence
[57:54] literally  drops  the  food  that  we  eat  in 
 the  west  literally  makes  you  dumber  to
[57:59] think  that  your  diet  doesn't  really  play 
 more  of  a  role  than  just  calories  in 
 calories  out  is  so  so  simplified  that  it
[58:06] may  as  well  be  wrong  i  could  go  into  a 
 full-length  rant  here  about  diet  but 
 that  40-minute  guide  that's  popped  up  is
[58:12] like  a  card  on  your  video  screen  right 
 now  that  explains  it  all  and  so  you  can 
 go  and  have  a  look  at  that  now  if  you 
 want  some  simple  no  diet  advice
[58:18] to  follow  right  now  but  i  would  suggest 
 i've  done  so  much  like  research  on  this 
 and  the  sad  thing  is  that  it's  that
[58:23] totally  unsexy  answer  eat  a  variety  of 
 vegetables  fruits  meats  nuts  whole
[58:29] grains  eat  healthy  it's  like  literally 
 that  simple  and  and  the  other  term 
 healthy  is  kind  of  messed  up  now  from
[58:35] these  modern  companies  that  are 
 marketing  themselves  to  be  healthy  but 
 then  they're  actually  full  of  garbage
[58:40] they're  full  of  like  processed 
 ingredients  and  refined  sugars  which  are 
 classified  in  a  different  term  and
[58:45] everything  so  the  only  true  way  that  you 
 can  make  sure  that  you're  eating  as 
 healthy  as  possible  it's  a  cook  up  and
[58:50] eat  single  ingredient  meals  what  that 
 means  is  that  your  meal  is  comprised  of
[58:55] things  which  are  just  single  ingredients 
 for  example  a  potato  like  literally  just 
 a  potato  is  a  single  ingredient  the
[59:01] ingredient  inside  of  potato  is  potato  in 
 fact  potatoes  don't  even  have  an 
 ingredient  list  on  the  back  because  it's
[59:07] literally  just  potato  the  same  with 
 broccoli  the  same  with  salmon  that's 
 what  we  want  we  want  literally  just 
 single  ingredients  meals  and  of  course
[59:14] that's  very  different  from  what  we're 
 used  to  eating  we're  used  to  going  out 
 to  get  fast  food  where  you  start  getting 
 meal  deals  and  crisps  and  sandwiches  and
[59:20] processed  from  like  supermarkets 
 we're  used  to  all  that  so  of  course  it's 
 gonna  take  some  time  to  take  a  step  back
[59:25] from  this  where  i  would  recommend  for 
 you  to  do  this  is  to  choose  just  one 
 meal  of  your  day  and  make  that  a  one
[59:31] ingredient  meal  so  that  doesn't  mean  you 
 like  one  meal  is  literally  just  gonna  be 
 potatoes  just  potatoes  it  means  that
[59:36] everything  on  the  plate  is  a  single 
 ingredient  by  itself  so  potatoes  salmon
[59:42] broccoli  boom  that's  a  meal  right  there 
 that's  a  lot  better  than  for  example 
 having  a  fish  burger  which  has  been
[59:48] processed  and  it's  got  so  much  worse 
 things  and  you  might  be  thinking  but 
 wait  what's  the  difference  because  you
[59:53] know  if  the  macros  are  the  same  but  it's 
 not  about  the  macros  it's  not  about  the 
 calories  that's  such  a  simple  view  you
[59:59] would  have  to  watch  the  full  length 
 it'll  take  me  so  long  to  explain  it 
 again  the  food  you  eat  has  probably  the
[60:05] biggest  impact  on  your  hormones  and  all 
 those  processes  inside  your  body  and
[60:10] you've  got  to  think  what  will  be 
 happening  to  your  mind  and  body  if  you 
 eat  like  the  majority  of  people  you're
[60:16] not  like  them  honestly  like  you're 
 watching  a  video  a  40-minute  one-hour 
 two-hour  long  guide  on  mental  health
[60:23] perhaps  you  haven't  realized  this  just 
 yet  but  like  you  are  literally  so 
 different  maybe  you're  not  at  that  point
[60:28] when  you  know  you  go  do  your  own  grocery 
 shopping  but  if  you  do  and  it  when  you 
 go  on  to  you'll  notice  by  following
[60:34] videos  like  this  education  you're 
 probably  gonna  go  watch  the  diet  guide 
 and  you're  interested  in  like  nutrition 
 and  mental  health  but  when  you  go  out  to
[60:40] like  a  supermarket  you're  you  know 
 pushing  your  trolley  around  it's  got 
 food  you  know  the  groceries  that  you're 
 buying  and  you  kind  of  compared  your
[60:45] trolley  to  the  trolley  of  the  average 
 person  next  to  you  it  will  look  very 
 different  the  trolley  of  like  a  real
[60:51] athlete  not  a  fitness  youtuber  but  a 
 real  athlete  a  warrior  it's  just  a  bunch 
 of  vegetables  meat  single  ingredients
[60:58] some  seasoning  that's  it  nuts  you  know 
 healthy  stuff  like  that  which  is  a 
 single  ingredient  all  natural  and  the
[61:04] trolley  of  like  more  of  a  average  person 
 is  a  bunch  of  processed  sugary 
 cereal  cookies  biscuits  cakes  ready-made
[61:11] meals  these  small  choices  that  you  make 
 truly  have  a  huge  impact  in  how  you  feel
[61:17] mentally  and  if  you  are  a  young  man  and 
 you  don't  have  control  over  your  diets 
 because  your  parents  just  make  your  food
[61:22] what  advice  do  i  have  for  you  that 
 situation  does  kind  of  suck  and  more  and 
 more  i'm  hearing  of  like  young  guys
[61:27] whose  parents  are  quite  unhealthy  and  so 
 they  just  kind  of  assume  this  young 
 man's  going  to  eat  their  own  healthy
[61:32] food  too  if  i  was  you  in  your  position  i 
 would  hope  to  have  the  confidence  to 
 kind  of  like  speak  to  them  and  just  kind 
 of  say  like  oh  like  i  want  to  eat
[61:38] healthier  i  don't  really  want  to  eat 
 mcdonald's  anymore  or  something  and  just 
 see  how  that  goes  and  of  course  some 
 parents  won't  be  okay  with  that  if  it's
[61:44] not  something  you  can  totally  control 
 what  i  would  do  is  just  simply  ask  your 
 parents  for  more  single  ingredient  foods
[61:51] in  your  meal  so  if  your  mom's  gonna  cook 
 something  and  it's  somewhat  unhealthy 
 but  you  could  probably  tell  oh  can  i 
 have  like  more  potatoes  can  i  have  more
[61:57] chicken  and  if  your  parents  are  gonna 
 get  you  something  which  is  unhealthy  and 
 you  just  need  to  eat  it  because 
 otherwise  they'll  like  shout  at  you  or
[62:02] something  and  you  know  they're  gonna  get 
 you  mcdonald's  what  i  would  do  is  still 
 eat  it  and  somewhat  enjoy  it  but  leave  a 
 little  bit  of  it  just  eat  less  of  it
[62:08] just  kind  of  tell  them  like  oh  yeah  i'm 
 not  really  that  hungry  i  really  want 
 something  healthy  i  really  want  potatoes
[62:13] just  normal  potatoes  i  really  want  just 
 normal  chicken  without  you  know  being  in 
 a  burger  or  something  the  second  thing
[62:18] we  said  that  you  can  do  for  your 
 physical  health  that  will  improve  your 
 mental  health  is  exercise  and  this  one's 
 just  really  simple  you  don't  need  me  to
[62:23] explain  the  benefits  of  exercise 
 exercise  at  least  three  times  a  week 
 preferably  five  to  six  maybe  even  seven
[62:29] one  thing  that  a  lot  of  guys  on 
 self-improvement  mess  up  with  is  that 
 they  consider  their  resistance  training
[62:35] you  know  weightlifting  calisthenics  they 
 consider  that  as  the  only  kind  of 
 exercise  that  they  do  and  so  when  you're
[62:41] on  a  weightlifting  program  or  a 
 calisthenics  program  you  have  rest  days 
 and  you  have  training  days  and  maybe  you 
 train  three  times  a  week  or  four  or  five
[62:47] or  six  days  and  you  kind  of  just  want  to 
 rest  and  not  really  think  about  exercise 
 for  the  days  that  you're  off  but  in  fact
[62:53] on  the  rest  days  from  weightlifting  and 
 calisthenics  you're  still  supposed  to 
 move  your  body  our  ancestors  moved  their
[62:59] bodies  every  single  day  they  did  some 
 form  of  cardio  to  maximize  the  mental 
 health  benefits  you  should  work  out  for
[63:04] at  least  20  minutes  maybe  every  single 
 day  and  just  every  now  and  then  take  a 
 full  day  off  but  even  then  on  that  day
[63:10] you  still  don't  want  to  like  lounge 
 around  and  just  be  sat  on  the  couch  and 
 stuff  and  be  sat  on  the  computer  chair 
 for  10  hours  of  the  day  you  still  want
[63:16] to  take  time  to  walk  a  few  kilometers 
 every  single  day  to  maybe  go  on  a  quick 
 run  to  do  some  random  like  shadow  boxing
[63:22] just  something  that  gets  you  a little 
 bit  sweaty  and  pumped  up  and  the  third 
 and  very  important  thing  with  your 
 physical  health  that  impacts  your  mental
[63:28] health  is  sleep  and  sleep  is  so  like  i 
 know  i  speak  about  it  sometimes  but  it 
 is  so
[63:33] overlooked  in  the  majority  of  people  i 
 can  say  for  100  certainty  that  your
[63:38] sleep  is  not  good  enough  it  takes  a  lot 
 of  intention  to  really  improve  your 
 sleep  and  the  majority  of  people  have
[63:44] just  accepted  a  lack  of  sleep  because 
 we're  conditioned  to  through  the
[63:49] education  system  like  you  know  as 
 teenagers  we  need  a  lot  more  sleep  like 
 teenagers  need  more  sleep  than  adults  do
[63:55] and  to  make  a  teenager  wake  up  for  7  00 
 a.m  is  actually  inhumane  if  you  want  to
[64:00] really  learn  about  the  consequences  of 
 not  getting  enough  sleep  and  you  really 
 want  to  feel  a  little  bit  anxious  about
[64:05] this  the  book  why  we  sleep  by  matthew 
 walker  is  a  good  resource  it  kind  of 
 scares  you  and  gives  you  anxiety  in  the
[64:10] sense  that  he'll  literally  just  grill 
 all  the  problems  that  will  happen  when 
 you  have  a  lack  of  sleep  and  maybe  that
[64:16] isn't  really  beneficial  because 
 sometimes  then  that  can  make  you  anxious 
 when  you're  trying  to  sleep  but  it  can 
 be  helpful  to  just  keep  those  things  in
[64:21] mind  so  you  realize  how  important  sleep 
 actually  is  since  i  read  that  book  i
[64:26] talk  sleep  so  much  more  seriously  i  have 
 a  sleep  ring  here  which  i  wear  all  the 
 time  it's  300  and  it  tracks  my  sleep  and
[64:32] gives  me  lots  of  data  and  i'm  also  on  a 
 2 
 500
[64:37] program  with  these  experts  on  sleep  and 
 they're  literally  speaking  to  me  every 
 day  looking  at  the  data  telling  me  like
[64:43] so  many  random  things  that  i  can  do  okay 
 listen  to  this  youtube  videos  like  you 
 know  particular  sounds  listen  to  this
[64:48] when  you  go  to  sleep  and  tell  us  okay 
 we'll  look  at  your  data  and  we'll  see 
 how  you  feel  okay  report  your  sleep  log 
 every  single  day  your  sleep  efficiency
[64:54] your  rem  sleep 
 just  everything  these  guys  are  experts 
 and  i've  been  working  with  them  for  six
[64:59] weeks  and  we  have  a  couple  more  weeks 
 left  and  of  all  the  things  that  i've 
 worked  with  with  this  coach  i've  paid  a 
 lot  of  money  for  i  think  there's  three
[65:05] main  benefits  there's  three  main 
 learning  lessons  that  you  can  take  and 
 you've  essentially  just  gotten  them  for
[65:10] free  so  it's  like  i'm  sharing  the 
 learning  lessons  that  i  got  from  this 
 program  with  you  the  number  one  main 
 thing  that  these  coaches  have  put  on  to
[65:17] me  that  i've  also  heard  from  a  bunch  of 
 like  experts  scientists  and  there's  one 
 who's  really  famous  on  youtube  andrew
[65:23] huberman  all  these  guys  are  saying  that 
 morning  sunlight  is  incredibly  important 
 it's  one  of  like  the  very  few
[65:28] non-negotiables  that  i  have  with  like 
 the  sleep  performance  coach  that  i'm 
 with  that  every  single  morning  as  soon
[65:33] as  the  sun  comes  out  you're  outside  just 
 kind  of  getting  it  into  your  eyeballs 
 andrew  huberman  explains  this  really
[65:39] well  in  a  bunch  of  podcasts  that  he's 
 done  so  you  can  literally  just  search  on 
 youtube  andrew  huberman  morning  sunlight
[65:44] when  you  do  this  and  you  get  sunlight 
 into  your  eyes  first  thing  as  soon  as 
 you  know  the  sun  comes  out  which  in  the
[65:49] uk  right  now  it's  about  6  a.m  when  you 
 do  this  you  get  it  for  5  minutes  10 
 minutes  20  minutes  you'll  find  that
[65:54] you'll  naturally  wake  up  way  earlier  and 
 it's  actually  one  of  the  things  that 
 just  improves  your  health  and  your
[65:59] dopamine  levels  and  you  know  all  the 
 sciencey  stuff  to  such  a  great  level  i 
 think  about  why  that  is  just  think  about
[66:04] what  our  ancestors  did  like  they  would 
 wake  up  to  the  sunlight  and  just  be  out
[66:09] all  day  whereas  we  wake  up  and  we  just 
 stay  inside  the  only  light  that  we  see 
 is  like  the  light  from  our  phones  and
[66:14] laptops  and  one  of  the  very  important 
 points  that  andrew  huberman  makes  about 
 this  is  that  you  must  go  outside  this
[66:19] you  cannot  stay  inside  and  get  the 
 sunlight  from  like  glass  or  anything  or 
 you  know  inside  of  a  car  you  literally
[66:25] just  have  to  be  standing  outside  so 
 there's  a  level  of  discomfort  involved 
 in  that  but  it  the  roi  is  massive  the
[66:31] second  major  thing  that  you  can  do  to 
 improve  your  sleep  which  will  improve 
 your  mental  health  is  to  go  to  sleep  and
[66:36] wake  up  at  the  exact  same  time  every 
 single  day  even  on  weekends  and  so  this 
 means  that  your  wake  up  and  your  bedtime
[66:42] need  to  be  reasonable  and  sustainable  so 
 for  example  if  you're  in  school  or  work
[66:47] your  wake  up  time  could  be  6  a.m  and 
 your  bedtime  could  be  9  p.m  and  that 
 gives  you  a  nine  hour  window  to  sleep
[66:53] the  majority  of  people  mess  this  up 
 because  when  they're  forced  to  wake  up 
 for  something  like  school  or  work  they
[66:59] do  it  but  then  on  the  weekends  when 
 they're  not  they  end  up  having  a  huge 
 lion  which  then  has  like  this  weirdly
[67:05] cascading  effect  even  though  it  feels 
 healthy  to  think  okay  well  you  know  i 
 like  tomorrow  i  may  as  well  sleep  more
[67:10] and  sure  you  might  do  it  that  might  be  a 
 benefit  but  then  when  you  do  sleep  more 
 that  cascading  effect  how  it  kind  of
[67:15] messes  up  the  rest  of  your  day  and  then 
 you  end  up  going  to  sleep  later  just 
 gives  you  this  lack  of  stability  this  is
[67:20] where  the  majority  of  people  mess  up 
 that  even  on  weekends  any  day  you  should 
 be  waking  up  and  going  to  sleep  at
[67:26] pretty  much  the  same  time  and  the  third 
 final  thing  that  you  can  do  to  improve 
 your  sleep  which  you've  heard  before  but
[67:31] no  one  has  really  explained  this  well  is 
 winding  down  before  bed  so  this  is 
 usually  when  someone's  explaining  oh
[67:36] yeah  how  to  improve  your  sleep  and 
 they'll  say  in  such  a  short  way  they'll 
 be  okay  so  wind  down  before  bed  and  you 
 know  just  don't  use  technology  for  two
[67:42] hours  before  bed  i  would  hear  that 
 advice  never  really  take  it  seriously 
 and  you  probably  haven't  either  just  be 
 honest  when  you've  hurt  you've  heard
[67:47] this  before  oh  you  know  wind  down  before 
 bed  but  you've  never  really  taken  the 
 advice  and  i  understand  now  why  because 
 no  one  has  ever  explained  why  that's
[67:53] important  what  actually  happens 
 specifically  what  we  need  to  do  it's  not 
 just  gonna  wind  down  that's  not
[67:58] scientific  what  we  need  to  do  is  lower 
 our  heart  rate  before  bed  so  that  by  the
[68:03] time  we  go  to  sleep  our  heart  rate  is 
 already  at  its  lowest  point  so  when  you 
 have  a  tracker  like  this  or  an  apple
[68:09] watch  and  you  can  see  data  on  your  heart 
 rate  what  we  want  is  to  spend  at  least 
 20  minutes  if  not  about  an  hour  doing
[68:15] the  things  that  drastically  lower  our 
 heart  rate  so  that  when  we  get  into  bed
[68:20] our  heart  rate  is  already  lowered 
 instead  of  our  heart  rate  being  higher 
 and  needing  to  lower  when  we're  trying
[68:25] to  sleep  so  this  ring  is  very  important 
 this  ring  is  called  an  aura  ring  it's 
 like  300  i'm  not  sponsored  by  them  but  i
[68:31] think  it's  a  very  good  investment  and  it 
 gives  you  i'm  gonna  show  you  some  of  my 
 data  to  show  you  right  this  right  now  is
[68:37] data  from  a  night  where  i  wind  it  down 
 properly  before  bedtime  i  spent  like  an 
 hour  literally  i'm  gonna  teach  you  the
[68:43] secret  technique  which  no  one  has  ever 
 spoke  about  in  terms  of  winding  down 
 before  bedtime  but  i  did  this  i  did  the
[68:48] technique  i  fully  wind  it  down  and  you 
 can  see  that  my  heart  rate  was  already 
 low  as  soon  as  i  fell  asleep  which  is
[68:53] fantastic  so  i  had  a  good  night's  sleep 
 here  but  then  this  second  graph  is  from 
 a  night  where  i  didn't  do  this  full  wind
[68:58] down  procedure  you  can  see  that  it  takes 
 me  hours  to  wind  down  and  get  my  lowest 
 heart  rate  the  most  effective  way  to
[69:04] wind  down  before  bedtime  i  have  found 
 this  is  weirdly  really  specific  is  to
[69:09] literally  lie  down  on  the  floor  for  some 
 reason  the  floor  works  so  much  better
[69:14] than  your  bed  lie  down  on  the  floor  face 
 up  no  pillow  literally  just  like 
 starfish  on  the  floor  like  you  would  at
[69:19] the  end  of  a  yoga  session  and  then 
 follow  like  a  very  long  meditation  guide 
 so  again  i'll  have  a  follow-along
[69:24] meditation  youtube  video  uploaded  and  it 
 will  show  us  a  card  on  screen  so  click 
 on  that  right  now  before  bedtime  lie
[69:30] down  on  the  floor  for  like  20  minutes 
 maybe  40  minutes  maybe  an  hour  and 
 literally  just  follow  some  kind  of  like
[69:35] deep  breathing  exercise  it's  just  so 
 interesting  meditating  lying  down  feels
[69:40] a  hundred  times  better  than  trying  to  do 
 it  whilst  like  sat  up  awkwardly  and  your 
 back  kind  of  hurts  and  everything  lying
[69:46] down  on  the  floor  just  feels  so  nice  for 
 some  reason  i  don't  know  if  i'm  just 
 weird  about  this  but  if  you  try  this 
 tonight  half  an  hour  before  you're
[69:52] supposed  to  go  to  bed  lie  down  on  the 
 floor  and  literally  just  focus  on 
 breathing  eyes  closed  no  phone  no 
 nothing  no  pillow  literally  just
[69:58] starfish  on  the  floor  and  then  do  your 
 nighttime  routine  get  into  bed  and 
 you'll  find  that  you're  already  rested 
 and  so  when  you  do  fall  asleep  it's  like
[70:04] your  heart  rate  was  already  relaxed 
 instead  of  needing  to  spend  hours  to 
 relax
[70:09] social  connection  kind  of  means  like 
 having  friends  and  family  and  people 
 that  you  have  some  kind  of  emotional
[70:14] attachment  to  around  you  people  who  you 
 spend  time  with  this  a  book  on  a
[70:19] japanese  concept  and  it  says  that  the 
 single  greatest  aspect  of  longevity  is
[70:25] social  connection  longevity  means  living 
 longer  the  single  greatest  way  to  live 
 longer  is  to  have  friends  if  we  flip
[70:31] that  around  and  we  have  to  discuss  the 
 lack  of  friends 
 loneliness  chances  are  you've
[70:36] experienced  bouts  of  loneliness  those 
 periods  where  you  don't  physically  spend
[70:41] time  to  anyone  that  you  really  really 
 care  about  you  don't  really  have  like  a 
 bunch  of  close  male  friends  who  you  feel
[70:46] like  you  can  trust  you  perhaps  don't 
 have  like  a  girlfriend  love  or  intimacy 
 or  affection  your  family  aren't  around
[70:51] or  maybe  if  your  family  are  around  you 
 don't  have  like  a  great  relationship  you 
 don't  even  hug  each  other  you  don't  even 
 tell  each  other  that  you  you  love  each
[70:56] other  all  of  these  things  greatly  will 
 influence  your  mental  health  i'd  say 
 loneliness  is  kind  of  like  sleep
[71:02] deprivation  in  that  it  makes  100  of  your 
 life  worse  so  for  this  part  of  the  guide 
 we  do  have  to  discuss  the  ability  to
[71:08] make  and  maintain  friends  which  is 
 easier  said  than  done  but  there  is  a 
 mindset  in  regards  to  making  friends
[71:14] that  might  help  you  significantly  and 
 that's  to  realize  that  making  friends 
 and  maintaining  friends  comes  down  to
[71:21] your  social  skills  and  your  social 
 skills  is  kind  of  like  a  skill  in  a 
 video  game  so  remember  when  we  used  to
[71:26] play  video  games  and  you  have  like 
 skills  that  you  could  level  up  and  so 
 you  start  at  level  one  or  level  zero  and
[71:32] then  you  have  to keep  doing  like  certain 
 activities  or  tasks  and  you  gain 
 experience  remember  in  games  experience
[71:37] is  shortened  to  xp  so  you  gain  xp  in 
 this  skill  and  then  you  level  it  up  over 
 time  and  then  as  you  get  a  higher  level
[71:42] you  get  more  of  the  rewards  of  that 
 skill  well  social  skills  are  just  that  a 
 skill  you'll  do  very  well  if  you  start
[71:49] seeing  life  as  a  video  game  and  one  of 
 the  very  very  important  skills  which  the 
 majority  of  us  have  spent  zero  time
[71:55] leveling  up  is  our  social  skills  we 
 understand  how  nice  it  is  to  have 
 friends  but  the  majority  of  us  have
[72:00] never  even  put  in  an  hour  into  leveling 
 up  our  social  skills  and  just  like  in  a 
 video  game  there's  a  two-step  process  to
[72:06] level  up  so  we  pick  the  skill  that  we 
 want  to  level  up  in  this  case  it's 
 social  skills  or  in  a  video  game  like
[72:11] runescape  it's  magic  and  the  first  thing 
 that  we  need  to  do  before  we  can  really 
 even  level  it  up  is  that  we  have  to
[72:17] actually  just  simply  learn  what  actually 
 gets  you  experience  in  this  skill  so
[72:22] when  you  first  start  a  video  game  it's 
 like  you  have  to  click  on  like  the 
 informational  card  you  know  you  click  on 
 like  the  magic  skill  and  it  says  oh  well
[72:28] you  can  gain  magic  experience  by  using 
 this  spell  or  doing  this  or  this  that's 
 the  same  thing  we  have  to  do  with  social
[72:33] skills  we  have  to  actually  learn  what 
 improves  our  social  skills  and  we  can 
 categorize  certain  activities  that  will
[72:38] gain  our  social  skills  experience  so 
 that  this  becomes  very  much  like  a  game 
 for  example  i'd  say  holding  eye  contact
[72:44] and  smiling  at  a  stranger  it  gives  you 
 20  social  skills  experience  stopping  to
[72:49] have  a  chat  with  them  if  you  initiated 
 the  chat  gives  you  a  hundred  social 
 skills  experience  conducting  yourself
[72:54] well  in  that  conversation  with  this 
 stranger  gives  you  200  social  skills 
 experience  you  get  like  a  whole  level  up
[73:00] if  you  do  that  getting  rejected  but 
 maintaining  a  good  positive  mindset 
 gives  you  500  social  skills  experience
[73:07] all  we  need  to  do  is  get  out  into  a 
 social  environment  and  practice  things 
 like  eye  contact  smiling  speaking  to
[73:12] strangers  having  like  a  slightly  longer 
 conversation  with  the  cashier  at  a  shop 
 and  then  we  can  level  it  up  we  can
[73:17] purposely  go  and  try  and  get  rejected  by 
 people  we  can  just  go  and  ask  people 
 almost  like  silly  questions  just  for  the
[73:23] sake  of  experiencing  some  level  of 
 discomfort  you  could  go  into  a  store  and 
 ask  them  can  i  have  that  tv  for  free  and
[73:28] of  course  they're  gonna  say  no  but  you 
 weren't  really  trying  to  get  the  tv  you 
 just  wanted  to  experience  the  discomfort 
 of  just  being  in  a  social  situation  and
[73:34] getting  rejected  by  someone 
 congratulations  just  by  doing  that  weird 
 activity  your  social  skills  just  went  up
[73:39] an  entire  level  the  higher  level  that 
 you  have  in  your  social  skills  the  way
[73:44] more  easier  you'll  find  it  to  meet  new 
 friends  and  also  to  maintain  those 
 friendships  in  a  way  more  valuable
[73:49] relationship  than  you've  ever  had  before 
 you  need  some  humility  right  here  right 
 now  and  i  know  this  is  gonna  hurt  if
[73:54] you're  watching  a  video  like  this 
 your  social  skills  are  trash 
 i'm  never  going  to  sugarcoat  anything
[74:00] for  you  when  you  click  onto  my  channel  i 
 will  always  tell  you  the  total  truth  i'd 
 say  95  of  people  social  skills  are
[74:07] absolutely  trash  i  would  say  mine  are 
 decent  now  and  i've  been  actively
[74:12] working  on  improving  them  for  a  little 
 while  answer  this  question  honestly  have 
 you  read  books  on  social  skills  have  you
[74:17] taken  courses  on  social  skills  have  you 
 went  out  have  you  literally  left  your 
 house  with  the  intention  okay  i'm  gonna
[74:22] gain  some  experience  in  my  social  skills 
 because  the  majority  of  people  have 
 never  done  that  now  interestingly 
 there's  a  group  of  popular  social  people
[74:28] who  have  never  necessarily  improved 
 their  social  skills  they've  never  you 
 know  left  their  house  thinking  about
[74:33] social  skills  they've  never  read  a 
 social  skills  book  and  so  you  might  be 
 wondering  wait  they  have  not  had  to 
 level  theirs  but  they're  really  popular
[74:39] so  what  gives  well  some  people  are  quite 
 fortunate  enough  to  start  with  a 
 positive  feedback  loop  when  they're
[74:44] young  you  know  like  they  were  just 
 raised  right  and  they  just  had  like  a 
 cute  baby  face  or  something  when  they're
[74:49] five  years  old  in  primary  school  and  so 
 everyone  was  kind  of  nice  to  them  they 
 were  nice  to  everyone  else  and  it's  a
[74:54] positive  feedback  loop  and  you  know  they 
 go  through  school  kind  of  feeling  kind 
 of  popular  because  they're  just  a  nice 
 bright  kid  to  spend  time  with  chances
[74:59] are  if  you're  watching  this  video  you're 
 not  that  person  so  we  have  to  put  in 
 some  more  intention  into  leveling  up 
 this  very  valuable  skill  i've  made
[75:05] videos  on  social  skills  and  i've  even 
 done  a  full  skillshare  class  on  social 
 skills  like  a  one  hour  in  something
[75:10] master  class  on  social  skills  which  i'll 
 have  pop  up  as  a  card  so  click  that 
 right  now  if  you  want  to  gain  more
[75:15] knowledge  on  leveling  up  your  social 
 skills  at  this  point  a  lot  of  your  men 
 ask  the  same  question  and  it  might  even
[75:20] be  in  your  mind  right  now  where  do  i  go 
 to  meet  friends  this  question  has  been 
 asked  to  me  so  many  times  and  so  many
[75:25] young  men  are  always  wondering  you  know 
 where  do  i  go  and  your  answers  are 
 always  cliche  and  stereotypical  oh  go  to
[75:30] the  gym  or  try  in  school  or  go  to  go  for 
 a  walk  and  stuff  this  question  and 
 therefore  the  answers  are  fundamentally
[75:36] not  valuable  the  question  is  the  wrong 
 thing  to  ask  you  should  never  be  asking 
 where  do  i  go  to  meet  friends  you  should
[75:42] instead  change  the  question  to  who  do  i 
 become  to  meet  friends  i  don't  want  to
[75:47] go  into  a  full  rant  but  in  the  modern 
 day  we  are  very  very  weak  we're  very 
 weak  and  we  seek  comfort  and  quick
[75:53] results  and  instant  gratification  so  a 
 lot  of  people  and  probably  you  and 
 probably  me  for  the  longest  time  of  my
[75:59] life  we  wanted  to  know  simply  just  okay 
 where  can  we  go  to  make  it  easy  where 
 can  we  go  there's  like  there's  just  an
[76:04] abundance  of  friends  just  wait  waiting 
 for  us  to  meet  them  that's  not  how  it 
 works  you  can't  just  search  for  the
[76:09] quick  shortcut  and  ask  people  where  can 
 i  go  where  it's  easy  to  make  friends  and 
 then  someone  says  oh  go  to  a  martial 
 arts  club  oh  go  to  the  gym  is  that  this
[76:15] never  works  this  advice  never  ever  works 
 for  people  you  know  why 
 someone  will  recommend  to  you  go  to  a
[76:21] martial  arts  club  to  make  friends 
 because  that's  where  they've  made 
 friends  right  you  go  you've  got  a  low 
 level  in  social  skills  and  then  you
[76:27] become  that  kind  of  awkward  guy  in  the 
 martial  arts  club  who  kind  of  comes  in 
 at  the  right  time  you  know  gets  changed
[76:32] does  the  session  gets  changed  and then 
 goes  off  you  won't  become  that  social 
 butterfly  guy  in  there  just  simply
[76:37] because  you've  shown  up  to  the 
 environment  it's  not  about  where  you  go 
 it's  about  who  you  are  so  you  need  some
[76:42] humility  right  now  and  really  honestly 
 answer  this  question  have  you  made  good 
 new  friends  over  the  last  few  months  do
[76:48] you  often  get  into  really  nice  deep 
 loving  spontaneous  conversations  with 
 strangers  because  if  you  don't  that
[76:53] symbolizes  that  you  have  quite  a  low 
 level  in  your  social  skills  and  that  is 
 the  thing  to  focus  on  not  just  simply
[76:58] like  oh  wait  where  should  i  go  to  make 
 friends  it's  who  you  should  become  so 
 let's  ask  that  question  who  should  you 
 become  to  make  more  friends  if  you  want
[77:05] the  mental  health  benefit  of  being 
 surrounded  by  like  a  group  of  guys  who 
 actually  really  care  about  you  who  want
[77:10] to  grow  with  you  because  that's  so 
 incredibly  important  you  know  i  told  you 
 my  journey  at  the  start  of  this  video
[77:15] when  i  left  the  city  that  i  spent  a 
 bunch  of  time  with  when  you  know  i 
 turned  into  like  a  boy  a  party  boy
[77:21] and  i  was  taking  drugs  and  i  moved  back 
 home  to  my  family's  house 
 i  moved  home  and  i  didn't  speak  to
[77:27] anyone  i  wasn't  using  social  media  i 
 didn't  even  tell  any  of  my  old  friends 
 that  i  moved  back  home 
 i  was  just  back  home
[77:34] and  i  was 
 just  by  myself 
 for  months  and  months  and  months
[77:40] i  didn't  even  speak  i  didn't  even  have 
 literally  a  single  friend  i  was  reading
[77:45] the  book  how  to  win  friends  and 
 influence  people  by  dale  carnegie 
 and  as  soon  as  i  would  learn  something
[77:50] from  it  i  would  set  the  book  down  so  you 
 know  i  learned  like  okay  if  you  smile 
 people  will  like  you  more  if  you  ask
[77:56] someone  a  question  based  on  what  they're 
 interested  in  instead  of  you  they'll 
 like  you  more
[78:02] i  would  learn  something  small  like  this 
 i  would  set  the  book  down  and  i  would 
 literally  walk  out  of  my  house  and  go
[78:07] and  use  whatever  i  just  learned  on  a 
 stranger  nearby  i  went  from  having  just 
 really  weird  trash  social  skills  because
[78:13] i  spent  like  two  years  smoking  weed  all 
 day  every  day  so  my  social  skills  were 
 just  trash  you  know  my  brain  would  just 
 kind  of  like  go  blank  when  i'd  be
[78:19] speaking  to  people  and  i  just  slowly 
 started  to  level  it  up  and  gain  social 
 skills  experience  and  you  know  i  was
[78:25] very  busy  and  determined  at  the  time  so 
 i  didn't  necessarily  feel 
 that  bad
[78:30] but  i've  literally  got  private  videos  of 
 myself  that  i  would  record  on  my  phone 
 you  know  like  videos  that  i've  never
[78:35] released  to  youtube  and  it's  literally 
 just  me  speaking  to  like  me  and  i'm  just 
 kind  of  saying  like  oh  your  life's  going
[78:41] really  good  i've  stopped  smoking  weed  my 
 diet's  really  improved  but  there's  one 
 major  problem  like  i'm  just  lonely
[78:47] i  wish  i  had  like  some  boys  like  a 
 brother  to  train  with  in  the  gym 
 i  wish  i  had  people  to  talk  to  after  the
[78:53] youtube  channel  started  to  grow  and  i 
 hired  my  first  employee  after  a  little 
 while  we  would  hop  on  like  video  calls
[78:58] and  you  know  just  start  laughing  about 
 stuff  and  like  we  ended  up  becoming  very 
 very  good  friends  and  he's  my  best
[79:03] friend  to  this  day  his  name's  sam  i  wish 
 for  you  to  have  what  i  have  with  him  a 
 close 
 male  best  friend
[79:09] who  you  can  consider  kind  of  like  a 
 brother  who  has  your  back  who  you  know 
 for  a  fact  would  literally  fight  for  you
[79:14] that's  incredibly  valuable  a  guy  that 
 you  can  be  totally  authentic  with 
 a  guy  that  you  can  message  to  say  like
[79:20] oh  bro  i  feel  like  it's  so  valuable 
 but  you  need  a  certain  level  of  social 
 skills  to  be  able  to  attract  that  kind
[79:25] of  person  because  the  person  that  you 
 want  to  be  friends  with  has  to  want  to 
 be  friends  with  you  so  if  you  take  a
[79:31] minute  right  now  to  think  about  what 
 kind  of  guy  you  want  to  be  friends  with 
 just  like  almost  visualize  him  he's
[79:36] funny  he  he  talks  like  this  he  has  these 
 values  this  is  how  you  spend  time  with 
 him  you  hop  on  like  discord  calls  or
[79:41] maybe  you  meet  in  person  you  go  to  the 
 gym  imagine  the  friend  that  you  want  to 
 make  and  then  imagine  from  his  point  of
[79:46] view  who  he  wants  to  be  friends  with  i 
 know  this  sounds  horrible  but  that  guy 
 probably  doesn't  want  to  be  friends  with
[79:51] like  a  depressed  sad  anxious  young  man 
 he  doesn't  want  to  be  friends  with  like 
 a  really  lazy
[79:56] guy  who's  negative  who  complains  all  the 
 time  he  wants  to  be  friends  with  a  guy 
 who's  quite  upbeat  and  encouraging  who
[80:01] thinks  about  him  who  like  talks  to  him 
 in  a  supportive  way  he  wants  to  be 
 friends  with  a  guy  who's  funny  he  wants
[80:06] to  be  friends  with  a  guy  who's  got  a 
 level  of  like  carefreeness  who's  not 
 overthinking  all  the  time  he  wants  to  be 
 friends  with  a  guy  who  seems  happy  who
[80:12] smiles  who  takes  an  interest  in  him  who 
 invites  him  to  do  some  fun  things  could 
 that  be  you  because  a  lot  of  us  we  have
[80:19] this  like  this  kind  of  personality  where 
 we  can't  see  our  weaknesses 
 and  we  don't  realize  this  a  lot  of  us
[80:24] don't  really  bring  that  much  to  the 
 table  in  terms  of  friendship  i  can  admit 
 for  a  very  long  time  i  was  one  of  these
[80:30] people  it  takes  a  certain  level  of 
 confidence  and  humility  for  you  but  you 
 would  get  my  respect  for  this  if  you
[80:35] held  your  hand  up  and  you  just  said  you 
 know  what 
 i  probably  don't  bring  that  much
[80:40] value  to  a  friendship  right  now  i'm 
 probably  not  that  like  fun  to  be  around 
 i  should  improve  on  that  because  a  lot
[80:46] of  young  guys  have  this  kind  of  really 
 sad  depressed  outlook  on  friendship  and 
 they're  like  oh  you  know  it's  so  hard  to 
 make  friends  and  i  don't  trust  anyone
[80:52] anyway  i'm  a  lone  wolf  but  they  never 
 have  the  humility  to  just  think  yeah 
 like  if  i  was  a  better  person  people
[80:57] would  want  to  be  friends  with  me  so  i 
 know  that  this  is  a  very  hard  to  swallow 
 pill  and  it's  not  very  positive  you  know
[81:02] i'm  kind  of  making  you  say  yeah  i'm  a 
 piece  of  and  that's  why  no  one 
 wants  to  be  friends  with  me  but
[81:07] sometimes  you  have  to  admit  to  yourself 
 yeah  like  i  have  a  little  bit  of  a  peace 
 issue  i'm  always  quite  self-interested  i
[81:12] don't  really  ask  good  questions  to  the 
 other  people  i  don't  take  an  interest  in 
 them  i  don't  really  smile  i  find  that
[81:17] awkward  i'm  not  funny  i'm  not  even  that 
 much  of  a  nice  person  i'm  not  very 
 supportive  i  always  forget  things  about 
 my  friends  because  if  you  can  admit
[81:23] these  things  then  you  can  make  progress 
 on  them  you  should  right  now  have  a  new 
 goal  or  intention  in  mind  which  is  to
[81:28] level  up  your  social  skills  your  social 
 skills  are  literally  the  skill  of 
 meeting  and  making  friends  if  you  want
[81:34] my  help  with  that  again  i'll  have  like 
 my  social  skills  videos  and  master  class 
 come  up  on  the  screen  somewhere  also  if
[81:39] you  want  to  make  friends  online  you  can 
 join  our  discord  server  that  will  be 
 linked  in  the  description  i  think  we
[81:44] have  around  80  000  young  men  who  have 
 joined  this  server  we're  all  on  self
[81:49] improvement  we're  all  talking  about 
 social  skills  and  mental  health  and 
 discipline  and  no  fapping  there's  a
[81:54] bunch  of  guys  from  age  12  to  like  25  30 
 you'll  probably  find  some  people  to
[81:59] speak  to  in  there  one  of  my  mods  in  this 
 server  has  also  created  his  own  platform 
 where  people  can  come  together  and
[82:04] actually  do  in  real  life  meetups  so 
 information  about  that  will  also  be  in 
 the  discord  server  so  if  you're
[82:10] interested  in  that  you'll  join  the 
 discord  server  and  then  there's  like  a 
 separate  platform  to  literally  say  okay 
 which  city  are  you  in  and  there's  a
[82:15] bunch  of  other  people  in  the  same  city 
 as  you  and  they're  literally  saying  like 
 oh  boy  he's  like  let's  all  get  a  day 
 pass  at  this  gym  over  there  and  we  can
[82:20] all  join  together  that's  like  one  of the 
 most  beautiful  things  i've  seen  someone 
 do  and  like  someone  create  on
[82:25] self-improvement  so  shout  out  this  mod's 
 name  on  his  discord  name  is  agro7  so 
 shout  out  to  him  for  making  this  so
[82:31] let's  talk  about  your  environment  and 
 particularly  nature  and  sunlight  and 
 having  a  sense  of  adventure  i  think
[82:36] these  are  very  interesting  environmental 
 factors  to  talk  about  and  they'll 
 significantly  improve  your  mental  health
[82:41] if  you  utilize  them  correctly  as  always 
 i  want  to  give  you  the  bro  science 
 explanation  for  why  things  like  nature
[82:46] sunlight  and  adventure  make  us  feel 
 mentally  healthy  if  you  imagine  how  our
[82:51] ancestors  lived 
 thousands  of  years  ago  they  spent  all  of 
 their  time  out  in  nature  they  would  wake
[82:57] up  at  sunrise  and  literally  be  in  the 
 sun  totally  naked 
 all  day  up  until  the  sun  went  down
[83:03] there's  so  many  like  new  health  benefits 
 that  are  arising  from  people  saying  like 
 oh  yeah  like  you  know  we  should  get
[83:08] sunlight  on  our  poles  and  our 
 and  stuff  like  people  like  there's  real 
 scientific  studies  which  are  showing
[83:13] like  your  testosterone  goes  through  the 
 roof  if  you  get  sunlight  on  your 
 testicles  with  no  clothes  on  our
[83:18] ancestors  were  living  like  that  just  24 
 7.  and  they  were  exploring  when  i  hear 
 like  the  great  tales  of  how  humanity
[83:24] started  and  i  believe  it  started  like 
 somewhere  in  africa  and  you  know  there 
 was  tribes  eventually  a  small  group  from
[83:30] this  tribe  led  by  a  strong  man 
 decided  to  just  adventure  outward  and 
 that's  the  story  of
[83:36] every  community  every  tribe  of  humanity 
 it's  adventure 
 it's  travel  and  we  don't  really  do  that
[83:42] these  days 
 we  travel  to  work  or  to  the  gym  but  that 
 doesn't  really  count  that's  that's  not 
 even  traveling  or  adventure  that's
[83:47] commuting  when  was  the  last  time  you 
 went  on  an  adventure  like  a  real  real 
 adventure  when  was  the  last  time  you
[83:52] left  your  house  and  didn't  know  where 
 you  were  gonna  end  up  be  honest  i  like 
 to  think  of  the  world  like  the  map
[83:58] around  us  kind  of  like  the  map  from 
 grand  theft  auto  you  remember  those 
 games  gta  5  or  gta  3  or  gta  san  andreas
[84:05] and  you  click  on  the  map  on  this  game 
 and  wherever  you  had  previously  been  to 
 would  be  sort  of  visible  on  this  map  and
[84:12] anywhere  that  you  hadn't  discovered 
 would  be  blacked  out  gray  so  the  idea  is 
 okay  the  map  pretty  much  starts  off  as
[84:17] just  blacked  out  and  as  you  explore  more 
 and  more  and  more  the  map  kind  of  gets 
 like  opened  up  and  you  can  see  where
[84:22] you've  been  if  you  imagine  the  map  of 
 your  area  around  your  home  your  city  you 
 feel  like  you  probably  discovered  you
[84:27] know  quite  a  lot  but  if  you  just  imagine 
 that  map  just  like  a  gta  san  andreas  map
[84:33] there's  a  bunch  of  blacked  out  streets 
 like  there  is  a  street  two  minutes  away
[84:38] from  you  right  now  that  you  have  never 
 even  seen  before  there  is  a  house 
 there's  a  building  that  your  eyes  have
[84:44] never  witnessed  before 
 literally  within  a  one  to  two  minute 
 walk  how  crazy  that  you  may  have  lived
[84:49] at  your  address  at  your  home  for  five 
 years  ten  years  twenty  years  two  years 
 and  there's  something  that  you  haven't
[84:54] even  seen  thirty  seconds  away  do  you 
 feel  some  level  of  excitement  when  you 
 think  about  this  i  almost  get  like  an
[84:59] urge  to  quickly  like  slip  my  trainers  on 
 and  just  go  see  that  random  building 
 that  i've  not  seen  this  is  what  we're
[85:04] supposed  to  do  as  humans  we're  supposed 
 to  be  in  awe  of  like  the  natural  beauty
[85:09] around  us  we're  supposed  to  go  for  a 
 long  walk  in  nature  and  not  just  be 
 glued  to  our  phones  or  to  be
[85:15] overthinking  but  to  literally  look  and 
 appreciate  that  one  particular  tree  that 
 like  just  for  some  reason  your  brain
[85:21] your  body  your  soul  really  likes  amongst 
 all  the  other  trees  you're  supposed  to 
 go  out  like  a  child  and  like  pick  your
[85:27] favorite  leaf  off  from  a  tree  or  from 
 the  floor  unless  you  just  look  at  it  and 
 examine  it  and  just  think  how  beautiful
[85:32] it  is  when  was  the  last  time  you  really 
 like  picked  a  leaf  and  actually  really 
 really  looked  at  it  perhaps  one  of  the
[85:37] reasons  why  we  feel  so  mentally 
 unhealthy  we're  just  walking  around  and 
 just  navigating  life  in  a  haze  just  deep
[85:43] in  our  own  thoughts  instead  of 
 appreciating  the  beauty  around  us 
 something  about  being  in  nature
[85:48] especially  amongst  big  vast  open  spaces 
 like  i'm  in  right  now  i'm  in  scotland
[85:53] i'm  staying  on  a  farm  i'm  in  like  a 
 mountainous  area  like  you  can't  see  it 
 right  now  but  there's  a  bunch  of
[85:58] mountains  where  there's  something  about 
 being  in  this  open  space  where  there's 
 mountains  around  it  does  something
[86:03] amazing  to  my  mind  on  the  way  here  my 
 mind  is  thinking  about  youtube  it's 
 thinking  about  drama  it's  thinking  about
[86:09] you  know  small  tactics  and  tasks  that  i 
 can  do  we  can  implement  oh  i've  got  to 
 send  a  message  to  this  guy  or  i've  got
[86:14] to  write  this  thing  down 
 small  things  as  soon  as  i  get  out  into 
 the  vastness  of  nature  my  mind  broadens
[86:20] up  and  i  can't  help  but  think  about 
 the  grand  scale  of  things  i  get  out  into 
 the  mountains  and  my  brain  just  starts
[86:26] automatically  thinking  about  fatherhood 
 it  starts  thinking  about  long-term  plans 
 where  would  i  live  five  years  from  now
[86:31] where  would  i  raise  children  what's  the 
 next  generation  gonna  be  like  what  are 
 the  boys  five  years  old  today  what  are
[86:38] they  struggling  with  do  they  have  mental 
 health  problems  were  they  throwing  an 
 ipad  when  they  were  three  years  old  what
[86:43] will  the  generation  of  those  boys  become 
 20  years  from  now  i'm  thinking  about 
 these  grand  things  when  i'm  out  in  the
[86:49] grandness  of  the  vast  open  space  of 
 nature  and  yet  we  spend  most  of  our  days 
 indoors  tiny  little  rooms  just  staring
[86:55] into  like  a  tiny  little  phone  screen  or 
 computer  screen  like  you're  doing  right 
 now  and  we  wonder  why  our  mental  health
[87:01] is  so  bad  and  like  our  thinking  is  so 
 consumed  by  like  small  things  and  this 
 part  of  the  guide  in  terms  of  nature
[87:07] sunlight  and  adventure  it's  very  very 
 close  to  my  heart  because  again  that 
 story  that  i've  told  you  about  that  i
[87:12] was  living  in  a  city  and  i  was  just 
 waking  up  and  smoking  weed  and  i  was 
 just  staying  in  the  apartment  all  day 
 because  there  was  the  covered  lockdown
[87:18] if  you  could  almost  like  imagine  how  i 
 was  living  you  know  i'm  living  in  this 
 like  small  apartment  with  a  girl  that  i
[87:23] didn't  really  even  like  i'm  waking  up 
 and  just  smoking  weed  straight  away  i'm 
 jacking  off  i'm  fapping  just  in  the
[87:29] other  room  even  though  i've  got  like  a 
 girlfriend  there  i'm  literally  that's 
 how  my  mental  health  was  just 
 addicted  to  porn  just  staying  in  like
[87:36] the  computer  room  all  day  and  then  think 
 about  the  difference  from  that  and  then 
 i  moved  home  and  suddenly  like  this  idea
[87:41] of  adventure  just  popped  into  my  mind 
 and  i'm  i'm  going  out  and  actually 
 looking  at  like  these  vast  open
[87:46] spaces 
 with  like  a  sense  of  a  childish  awe  and 
 i  started  to  go  on  like  small  adventures
[87:52] i  bought  outdoor  gym  equipment  like  i 
 bought  like  equipment  that  i  could  train 
 you  know  my  muscles  with  and  i  would  put
[87:58] it  into  a  backpack  and  i  would  literally 
 just  go  for  like  a  long  walk  or  a  jog 
 just  trying  to  find  somewhere  to  train
[88:03] and  i  would  always  try  to  choose  a  new 
 place  to  train  and  i'd  end  up  like 
 walking  into  like  little  forests  and
[88:08] there's  you  know  like  a  stream  of  water 
 and  i  challenge  myself  to  like  jump 
 across  it  when  you  imagine  that  new  life
[88:14] that  i  was  you  know  jumping  across  these 
 puddles  and  you're  challenging  myself  oh 
 that  looks  kind  of  far  i  don't  know  if  i 
 can  make  it 
 compared  to  just  waking  up  in  a  small
[88:20] little  room  and  just  smoking  weed  every 
 day 
 is  it  any 
 wonder  that  the  majority  of  people  who
[88:27] just  stay  in  these  small  like  houses 
 small  rooms  who  just  stare  at  their
[88:32] computer  screens  and  don't  go  outside 
 don't  get  sunlight  is  it  any  wonder  why 
 the  majority  of  these  kinds  of  people 
 are  depressed  as  a  simple  rule  that  you
[88:37] can  follow  go  and  do  the  things  that  you 
 did  as  a  child  you'd  go  play  out  with 
 your  friends  you  just  go  kick  a  ball
[88:42] around  you'll  jump  over  puddles  you'd 
 climb  a  tree  when  was  the  last  time  that 
 you  climbed  a  tree  i  know  you  sound
[88:47] silly  but  like  you  feel  kind  of 
 depressed  right  now  imagine  if  you  go 
 climb  a  tree  i  don't  think  you  can  be 
 depressed  when  you're  literally  climbing
[88:52] a  tree  i  think  that's  the  instant  cure 
 that  you  needed  i  think  this  section  of 
 the  guide  sounds  really  exciting  and
[88:57] awesome  okay  like  you  know  nature 
 sunlight  adventure  fine  but  you  need  a 
 practical  way  to  implement  this
[89:02] otherwise  you're  just  gonna  feel  kind  of 
 motivated  and  hype  watching  this  video 
 and  then  your  life  isn't  gonna  change 
 you  need  a  practical  way  that  you  can
[89:08] implement  getting  more  nature  sunlight 
 and  adventure  and  the  way  that  i  did  it 
 which  will  probably  work  for  you  is  to
[89:13] start  getting  into  long  distance  cardio 
 now  chances  are  if  you're  watching  my 
 videos  you  might  already  be  into  going
[89:19] to  the  gym  and  doing  weight  lifting  or 
 calisthenics  or  you  might  not  be  but 
 either  way  you  should  really  consider
[89:25] like  the  benefits  of  doing  long  distance 
 cardio  i'm  not  talking  about  sprints  and 
 i'm  not  talking  about  like  you  know 
 going  to  the  gym  and  just  putting  in  the
[89:30] work  on  the  treadmill  like 
 that  that  always  just  is  really  weird 
 for  me  like  people  just  go  to  the  gym
[89:35] unless  you  just  go  jog  on  the  treadmill 
 for  like  30  minutes  why 
 chug  outside
[89:41] but  long  distance  cardio  and  so 
 essentially  go  on  a  very  long  run  and 
 start  tracking  how  far  you  run  so
[89:46] there's  apps  that  you  can  get  on  your 
 phone  literally  just  search  like  running 
 app  there's  like  a  nike  app  and  pretty 
 much  all  those  big  brands  like  everlast
[89:52] whatever  they've  all  got  one  which  is 
 just  for  like  running  and  under  armour 
 has  a  good  one  that  i  use  um  under
[89:57] armour  running  app  if  you  search  that 
 onto  app  store  i'm  pretty  sure  it'd  come 
 up  and  it  you  just  press  start  and  it
[90:02] starts  tracking  like  your  map  and  sees 
 how  far  you've  run  get  into  long 
 distance  running  and  start  like
[90:07] challenging  yourself  to  get  to  like  5k 
 10k  you  could  probably  do  that  in  six
[90:12] months  from  now  but  one  very  important 
 part  to  get  not  only  the  benefits  of  the 
 long  distance  cardio  but  specifically
[90:17] the  benefits  of  this  part  of  the  guide 
 of  nature  sunlight  and  adventure  it's
[90:22] the  focus  more  on  the  adventure  rather 
 than  the  actual  cardio  so  go  out  for  a
[90:27] run  go  out  for  a  long  walk  go  out  for  a 
 bike  ride  but  don't  think  to  yourself 
 okay  you  know  i'm  only  doing  this  just 
 to  get  like  calories  or  whatever  think
[90:32] to  yourself  okay  i'm  actually  going  out 
 for  the  purpose  of  adventure  and  my 
 vehicle  for  that  is  running  or  cycling
[90:39] so  that  means  that  it's  okay  for  example 
 you're  running  you  know  you're  jogging 
 just  looking  around  being  adventurous
[90:44] there's  a  street  that  you've  never  went 
 down  but  you're  pretty  sure  it's  like 
 it's  closed  off  so  you'd  have  to  just 
 literally  run  there  run  back  and  so  it's
[90:49] not  necessarily  efficient  for  like 
 cardio  or  burning  calories  because  you'd 
 rather  just  run  straight  forward  in  a
[90:54] straight  line  but  you're  like  nah 
 it  come  on  like  i  just  want  like  a  sense 
 of  adventure  and  excitement  you  go  there 
 look  around  oh  wow  like  i've  never  seen
[91:00] that  building  before  and  then  run 
 backwards  so  technically  the  amount  of 
 calories  you  burn  doing  this  will  be  a
[91:05] little  bit  less  than  if  you  just  focus 
 on  like  just  running  on  the  treadmill  or 
 something  but  the  mental  health  benefit
[91:10] of  just  exploring  and  being  in  the 
 outdoors  and  seeing  things  that  you've 
 never  seen  before  is  massive  and  one 
 final  extra  benefit  of  exploring  with
[91:17] adventure  and  being  outdoors  it  puts  you 
 into  a  flow  state  so  remember  previously 
 in  the  sky  we  spoke  about  the  flow  state
[91:23] being  a  moment  of 
 intense  presence  a  lack  of  like  thought 
 in  your  mind  you  just  focus  on  what's
[91:29] happening  right  now 
 but  when  you're  experiencing  some  kind 
 of  adventure  and  you're  looking  around
[91:34] at  a  building  that  you've  never  seen  it 
 like  a  park  or  a  tree  that  you've  never 
 seen 
 your  mind's  probably  going  to  be
[91:39] relatively  quiet  which  again  will 
 greatly  improve  your  mental  health 
 kindness  is  another  tool  that  you  can
[91:44] use  to  improve  your  mental  health  and  i 
 learned  this  from  this  free  online 
 course  named  the  science  of  well-being
[91:51] this  instructor  like  this  professor  has 
 made  this  course  online  talking  about 
 mental  health  and  she  brought  in  this
[91:56] study  which  showed  that  people  are 
 actually  happier  if  they  spend  money  on
[92:01] others  rather  than  themselves  so  in  this 
 study  a  participants  are  given  like  five 
 dollars  and  they're  instructed  okay  go
[92:06] spend  it  on  yourself  go  buy  like  a  latte 
 from  starbucks  or  something  or  another 
 group  of  participants  are  given  five
[92:11] dollars  and  they're  instructed  okay  go 
 buy  a  gift  for  a  friend  go  buy  a  latte
[92:16] from  starbucks  for  their  friend  and  they 
 found  a  way  bigger  happiness  increase 
 for  the  people  who  spent  money  on  their
[92:21] friends  and  we  know  this  too  being  kind 
 and  generous  makes  us  feel  good  about 
 ourselves  there's  a  very  interesting
[92:27] conclusion  that  we  can  come  to 
 there's  literally  a  higher  roi 
 return  on  investment  to  being  generous
[92:34] with  your  money  your  time 
 your  compliments 
 than  it  is  to  be  reserved  like  the  money
[92:40] that  you  could  spend  on  someone  and  of 
 course  you  know  it's  all  relative  so  if 
 you're  in  a  different  country  you  don't 
 have  to  spend  the  equivalent  of  five
[92:45] dollars  it  was  all  relative  to  the 
 country  that  you're  in  so  essentially  if 
 you  spent  the  equivalent  of  around
[92:51] 20  minutes  of  the  minimum  wage  of  your 
 country  on  a  friend  that  would  probably
[92:56] be  able  to  get  you  like  a  coffee  a  drink 
 a  bottle  of  water  or  something  like  that 
 if  you've  got  that  for  a  friend  oh  i've
[93:02] got  this  for  you  you'd  feel  happier 
 about  that  than  if  you  got  it  for 
 yourself  and  you  can  scale  this  up
[93:07] massively  so  that  study  just  spoke  about 
 you  know  a  small  gift  of  like  five 
 dollars  buying  a  drink  from  starbucks
[93:12] for  someone  but  you  can  be  a  very 
 purposeful 
 work  driven  young  man
[93:17] and  be  quite  charitable  or  do  some  kind 
 of  work  that  helps  others  i  personally
[93:23] have  found  one  of  the  greatest  mental 
 health  benefits  for  my  own  self  from  the 
 work  that  i  do  for  this  youtube  channel
[93:28] i  spend  quite  a  while  and  of  course  you 
 know  it's  quite  profitable  for  me  you 
 know  to  increase  my  status  i  feel  good
[93:33] about  the  success  that  i've  built  the 
 income  that  i've  got  but  the  work  that  i 
 do  here  is  very  purposeful
[93:39] and  when  i  receive  comments  and  messages 
 and  emails  and  voice  notes  and  when  i
[93:44] had  instagram  i  don't  have  instagram 
 anymore  but  like  when  i  did  have 
 instagram  i  would  receive  obviously
[93:49] 20  messages  a  day  direct  messages  of 
 people  just  saying  like  you've  saved  my 
 life  you  changed  my  life  thank  you  so
[93:55] much  for  your  videos  never  stop 
 uploading  that  made  me  feel  amazing 
 about  myself  kindness  and  generosity
[94:01] is  linked  to  this  feeling  of  being 
 needed  and  that's  so  utterly  important
[94:06] and  we  don't  really  have  that  like  we 
 live  in  very  weird 
 individualistic  times  what  i  mean  by
[94:11] individualistic  is  that  we're  all  kind 
 of  like  separate  people  and  we  no  longer 
 see  ourselves  as  being  part  of  like  a
[94:17] tribe  even  in  your  country  or  community 
 you  don't  really  think  like  oh  yeah  well 
 this  is  this  is  my  my  man  you  know  he's
[94:22] in  the  same  country  as  me  that  means 
 we're  on  the  same  team  you  don't  really 
 think  that  we  don't  have  tribes  anymore
[94:27] we're  not  really  close  knit  anymore  and 
 religion  was  an  amazing 
 way  of  life  for  this  because
[94:32] we  felt  like  we  were  in  the  same  tribe 
 as  everyone  that  we  went  to  church  with 
 and  we  don't  have  that  the  majority  of 
 people  aren't  very  religious  these  days
[94:38] we  don't  really  have  like  a  sense  of 
 community  that  makes  us  feel  important 
 and  so  for  the  majority  of  young  men
[94:45] perhaps  a  reason  why  you  don't  feel  so 
 great  is  because  you  kind  of  know  you 
 kind  of  feel  that  if  you  disappeared
[94:51] nothing  would  really  happen  of  course 
 like  you  know  your  parents  your  family 
 would  be  upset  your  friend  would  be 
 upset  but  like  in  terms  of  the  greater
[94:56] community  the  majority  of  people 
 wouldn't  even  realize  if  you  just 
 disappeared  and  i  know  that  seems  really
[95:02] scary  it  seems  really  dark  to  talk  about 
 but  that's  something  that  remember  we 
 have  to  like  kind  of  talk  and  sort  of 
 admit  these  things  out  loud  and  then  aim
[95:09] to  change  them  if  we  bottle  them  up  and 
 if  we  don't  express  these  thoughts  of
[95:14] humility  to  ourselves  where  we  discuss 
 our  weaknesses  our  weak  points  then 
 we'll  never  make  progress  we  need  to 
 hold  our  hands  up  as  young  men  and  say
[95:20] you  know  what  i'm  not  even  involved  in 
 my  community  that  if  i  just  left  today
[95:25] no  one  would  even  realize 
 that  i'm  not  even  doing  any  purposeful 
 work  that's  changing  the  world  in  any
[95:30] positive  way  i'm  just  working  some 
 minimum  wage  job  in  like  some  place  that 
 i  don't  even  care  about  i'm  not  even
[95:35] helping  anyone  it's  one  of  my  friends 
 who  really  need  me  it's  so  important 
 that  you  become  the  kind  of  man  who  is
[95:41] needed  you  become  the  kind  of  man  who  is 
 doing  such  good  work  for  other  people
[95:46] that  people  need  you 
 because  when  you're  needed  you  can't 
 help  but  feel  this  level  of  like
[95:51] security  abundance  happiness 
 fulfillments  freedom  for  yourself  when 
 you're  not  needed  when  you're  just
[95:56] another  like  average  guy  who's  working 
 like  you  know  some  job  that  doesn't 
 really  matter  and  you  just  spend  your
[96:01] free  time  on  online  you're  not  really 
 doing  anything  it  feels  like  life  is  a 
 bit 
 meaningless  and  pointless  and  this  is
[96:07] where  symptoms  of  depression  arise  and 
 so  consider  being  kind  consider  being 
 purposeful  consider  being  generous
[96:13] consider  doing  things  for  other  people 
 for  helping  them  to  such  a  good  level 
 that  you  will  feel  that  you  are  needed
[96:19] that  you  will  feel  that  other  people  are 
 relying  on  you  and  even  though  that's  a 
 level  of  pressure  and  responsibility
[96:24] it's  a  good  thing  men  are  built  from 
 responsibility  men  are  built  from 
 pressure  so  many  young  guys  are  just
[96:29] living  life  without  responsibility  they 
 just  wake  up  go  to  school  go  to  work  and 
 then  just  come  home  and  just  spend  all
[96:34] day  online  and  then  they  complain  why 
 they're  depressed  you  need  to  take 
 responsibility  for  someone  else  to 
 become  a  man
[96:40] if  you  are  not  responsible  for  someone 
 else  right  now 
 i  hate  to  say  it  but  you  are  not  a  man
[96:45] you're  a  guy  or  a  boy 
 you  turn  into  a  man  when  you  take  the 
 responsibility  of  other  people  and
[96:50] interesting  like  masculine  things  will 
 happen  to  you  when  you  take 
 responsibility  of  other  people  i 
 couldn't  grow  a  beard  for  most  of  my
[96:55] life  all  the  men  in  my  family  could  grow 
 a  full  beard  at  age  16  or  18.  i'm  age  21 
 still  can't  grow  one  but  then  i  started
[97:00] this  youtube  channel  i  started  working 
 for  the  other  guys  that  i  care  about  i 
 started  being  purposeful  i  started
[97:05] leading  a  mission  of  young  men  improving 
 themselves  and  suddenly  i  can  grow  a 
 glorious  beard
[97:10] you  will  become  more  masculine  you  will 
 feel  more  like  a  man  you  will  feel 
 purposeful  when  you  start  helping  others
[97:15] the  reason  why  i'm  speaking  with  so  much 
 emotion  and  conviction  right  now  is 
 because  i  wish  i  could  speak  to  younger 
 hamsa  i  wish  i  could  tell  him  he  doesn't
[97:22] even  realize  this  but  i  wish  i  could 
 tell  him  that  he's  quite  selfish  and  i 
 don't  say  that  as  an  insult  it's  just 
 an  objective  fact  he  only  cared  about
[97:28] himself  true  progress  comes  when  you 
 start  thinking  about  other  people  what's 
 interesting  when  you  think  about  helping
[97:33] someone  else  you  actually  help  yourself 
 to  a  such  a  greater  level  it's  so  easy 
 to  think  oh  i  don't  have  the  capacity  to
[97:38] help  someone  else  i  don't  have  enough 
 money  to  help  someone  else  what's 
 interesting  is  that  if  you  help  someone 
 else  with  their  fitness  with  their  diet
[97:43] your  diet  will  automatically  improve  if 
 you  start  helping  your  fat  friend  lose 
 weight  i  guarantee  your  diet  will
[97:49] improve  more  than  you've  ever  seen  it 
 before  because  now  you're  a  leader  and 
 now  you've  got  responsibility  to  be  a 
 role  model  we  as  men  need  some  kind  of
[97:55] self-transcending  purpose  transcending 
 means  bigger  than  us  we  need  a  purpose  a
[98:01] mission  some  work  some  goals  that  is 
 bigger  than  us  that  involves  helping
[98:06] other  people  for  the  last  two  years  i've 
 dedicated  my  life  to  what  you  see  here  i 
 make  this  joke  quite  often  to  my  friends
[98:11] i  left  the  nine  to  five  you  know  the 
 nine  to  five  rat  race  i  left  the  nine  to 
 five
[98:16] now  i  work  five  to  nine 
 i  wake  up  at  five  a.m  and  i  literally 
 just  work  up  until  around  nine  pm  i
[98:22] can't  stop  i  don't  want  to  stop  it's 
 like  my  brain  is  so  focused  on  this 
 because  i  honestly  feel  like  i'm
[98:27] changing  the  world  with  this  work  that  i 
 do  i  feel  like  i'm  saving  hundreds  of
[98:32] men  thousands  of  men  that  makes  me  feel 
 mentally  happy  it  makes  me  feel  so 
 important  and  we  need  that  kind  of
[98:38] feeling  and  you  shouldn't  belittle 
 yourself  right  now  and  think  oh  well 
 hamsa  can  do  it  because  he's  got  a 
 youtube  channel  but  i  don't  have  one  i
[98:43] started  with  nothing  as  well  so  ask 
 yourself  right  now  in  what  ways  can  you 
 be  kind  and  generous  to  others  it  can  be
[98:48] as  simple  as  buying  like  a  bottle  of 
 water  for  your  friend  it  can  be  as 
 simple  as  tipping  a  waitress  or  it  could
[98:53] be  bigger  you  could  ask  yourself  okay 
 what  purposeful  work  could  i  dedicate  my 
 life  to  that  would  help  other  people  if
[99:00] you  really  want  this  guide  to  help  you 
 perhaps  just  pause  the  video  and  really 
 ask  yourself  that  question  what 
 purposeful  work  could  i  dedicate  my  life
[99:06] to  which  would  help  other  people  pause 
 the  video  and  really  ask  yourself  that 
 question  journal  it  write  it  down  what
[99:12] are  ways  that  you  can  help  your 
 community  your  tribe  because  when  you 
 help  your  tribe  and  you  feel  important
[99:17] it's  like  you're  aligned  to  like  this 
 natural  animalistic  social  hierarchy
[99:22] aspect  of  ourselves 
 when  you  move  up  the  social  hierarchy  of 
 men
[99:27] you  know  your  status  increases  you  just 
 begin  to  feel  so  much  better  and  you  do 
 that  through  a  self-transcending  purpose
[99:33] and  being  kind  for  the  final  part  of 
 this  guide  i  want  to  discuss  trauma  and
[99:38] ptsd  so  i  said  before  that  the  majority 
 of  people  the  mental  health  problems
[99:44] that  they  have  usually  just  come  down  to 
 like  depression  and  anxiety  depressive 
 symptoms  and  anxious  symptoms  and  that
[99:50] usually  comes  way  more  from  literally 
 just  modern  day  habits  a  lot  of  people 
 don't  like  to  hear  this  a lot  of  people 
 like  to  think  that  they've  got  like  some
[99:55] biological  issue  or  anything  but  the 
 majority  of  people  who  are  depressed  or 
 anxious  are  like  that  simply  because  of
[100:00] their  habits  and  if  you  can  accept  that 
 and  think  to  yourself  yet  like  i 
 actually  don't  have  any  biological
[100:05] reason  to  be  depressed  or  anything  it's 
 just  simply  because  i've  been  indulging 
 in  instant  gratification  i've  been 
 watching  porn  for  for  six  hours  a  day  so
[100:11] of  course  i  feel  depressed  but  there  is 
 something  a  lot  more  severe  than  these 
 habitual  mental  illnesses  and  that  is
[100:18] trauma 
 trauma 
 is  a  very  significant
[100:23] dangerous  experience  which 
 changes  you  forever  so  this  is  not  just
[100:28] you  know  like  i  play  too  much  video 
 games  and  that's  why  i  feel  depressed  so 
 you  know  my  diet's  really  and
[100:33] that's  why  i  feel  really  anxious  because 
 you  know  me  and  fried  western  food  and 
 that's  up  my  gut  microbiome
[100:38] trauma  we  could  say 
 it  causes  ptsd  post-traumatic  stress 
 disorder  so  trauma  is  for  example
[100:45] you're  walking  through  the  street  one 
 night  alone 
 and  suddenly  out  of  nowhere  you  just  get
[100:50] punched 
 you  drop  to  the  floor  and  people  are 
 kicking  you  robbing  you  could  be  being
[100:55] in  a  car  crash 
 these  are  things  that  can  cause  trauma 
 in  people 
 and  the  research  on  trauma  and  the
[101:01] psychologists  who  have  written  books  on 
 them  the  wording  that  they  use  is  that 
 trauma  may  be
[101:07] maybe  curable  or  at  least  the  symptoms 
 of  trauma  can  be
[101:12] relieved  and  there's  good  treatment  now 
 for  trauma  things  like  emdr  it's  like  a 
 form  of  therapy  you  like  see  the
[101:18] therapist  and  they  do  stuff  like  this 
 and  it  just  helps  you  like  process  the 
 events
[101:23] and  uh  traditional  talking  therapy 
 sometimes  can  help  there's  more 
 complicated  versions  of  trauma  which  are
[101:29] no  longer  just  one  event  so  you  know 
 like  you  could  get  trauma  from  a  car 
 crash  that's  one  event  or  you  know
[101:35] you've  been  mugged  you've  been  attacked 
 that's  an  event 
 there's  such  a  thing  called  complex  ptsd
[101:41] complex  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
 and  complex  ptsd  cptsd  is  where  you  will
[101:47] go  through 
 lots  of  traumatic  incidents  and  it's 
 pretty  much  always
[101:53] down  to  childhood  abuse  so  when  you're  a 
 child  and  you're  totally  dependent  on 
 your  parents  but  your  parent  is  being
[101:58] abusive  your  parent  shouts  at  you 
 threatens  you  slaps  you  not  emotionally 
 neglects  you  sexually  abuses  you
[102:04] there's  no  escape  from  that 
 when  you're  a  child  generally  this  can 
 become  a  lot  more  severe  and  it's
[102:09] actually  estimated  that  i'm  not  sure  the 
 exact  figure  but  a  lot  of  people  have 
 experienced  childhood  abuse
[102:15] i  believe  it's  like 
 one  in  four  and  maybe  more  chances  are 
 if  you're  watching  this  video  and  you've
[102:20] gotten  a  bunch  of  the  symptoms  that  we 
 talk  about  you  very  clearly  know  your 
 mental  health  is  bad  if  you  think  back
[102:25] to  your  childhood  experience  with  your 
 parents 
 what  was  it  like  there's  very  clear
[102:30] signs  of  abuse  like  a  parent  screaming 
 at  you  slapping  you  threatening  you 
 hurting  you  and  there's  also  somewhat 
 invisible  signs  of  abuse  things  like
[102:37] emotional  neglect  essentially  believing 
 that  your  parents  just  didn't  really 
 love  you  and  a  lot  of  us  have
[102:42] experienced  that  and 
 the  reason  why  this  is  so  damaging 
 is  because  when  you're  a  child
[102:48] you  soak  up  everything  you  believe 
 everything  that  your  parents  says  and 
 does  so  what  goes  on  to  a  child's  mind
[102:54] when  the  child  is  being  beaten  or  hurt 
 or  screamed  or  threatened  or  ignored  by
[102:59] their  parents  it's  like  your  brain 
 convinces  you  that 
 you're  a  bad  person  you're  worthless
[103:04] you're  not  worthy  of  love  it's  very 
 tricky  for  me  to  give  you  real  good 
 advice  here  because  this  is  something
[103:09] that  i'm  on  my  own  journey  to 
 to 
 improve  on
[103:14] i  have  symptoms  and  like  the 
 understanding  that  i  have  cptsd  complex 
 ptsd  because  of  childhood  abuse
[103:21] and  um 
 the  more  i  look  into  it  the  more  i  work
[103:26] into  it  the  more  i  become  aware  of  just 
 how  many  symptoms 
 i  have  the  way  that  i  behave  in
[103:32] relationships 
 the 
 physical  symptoms  of  just  anxiety  and
[103:37] stress  and  hyper  vigilance  and 
 faster  heartbeats  and  you  know  i  track 
 my  heart  rate  on  this  my  heart  rate's
[103:43] way  higher  than  it  should  be  at  like 
 athlete's  performance  like  my  heart  rate
[103:48] should  be  about  45  it's  actually  about 
 60. 
 my  heart  rate  variability  hrv  is  very
[103:53] low  it  should  be  maybe  double  what  it  is 
 and 
 we  think  that  this  is  probably  caused
[103:58] from  things  like  trauma  so  if  you  feel 
 like  you  have  trauma  or  cptsd  here  i've
[104:04] done  a  fair  amount  of  research  on  this 
 and  it's  of  my  understanding  right  now 
 there's  kind  of  like  two  methods  that
[104:09] you  can  use  to  improve  symptoms  of 
 trauma  and  see  ptsd  and  these  are  called
[104:14] top  down  and  bottom  up  essentially  what 
 this  means  is  that  the  top  down  model  is
[104:19] that  we  start  and  we  focus  on  the  brain 
 and  if  we  do  things  that  improve  our 
 brain  it  will  help  the  rest  of  our  body
[104:26] and  then  likewise  the  other  approach  is 
 that  if  we  start  bottom  up  we  do  things
[104:31] that  improve  our  body  and  that  will  help 
 our  brain  so  this  is  where  trauma 
 treatments  like  self-help  treatments  can
[104:37] come  in  things  like  journaling  and 
 therapy  change  your  brain  especially 
 things  like  for  example  cbt  can  help  you
[104:43] with  these  like  cognitive  neurological 
 wiring  of  beliefs  and  you're  like  all 
 brain  sciency  stuff  when  you  change  your
[104:50] brain  your  body  can  respond  and  we've 
 discussed  a  lot  of  this  in  this  guide  so 
 for  example  in  the  physical  health
[104:55] section  of  this  guide  we've  essentially 
 explained  the  bottom  up  method  of
[105:00] relieving  cptsd  which  is  okay  we  focus 
 on  the  body  we  can  focus  on  things  like 
 sunlight  diet  exercise  and  these  are  all
[105:06] bodily  things  that  we  can  focus  on  which 
 then  improve  our  brain  and  then  likewise 
 we  can  switch  it  around  and  we  can  do
[105:12] things  that  improve  our  brain  things 
 like  journaling 
 things  like  being  in  love
[105:18] things  like 
 therapy 
 and  those  things  can  help  us
[105:23] ease  the  symptoms  that  we  get  in  our 
 body  to  be  honest  i'm  not  sure  if  i 
 really  have  good  advice  for  this  section
[105:28] of  the  guide  because  i'm  still  learning 
 as  i  go  along 
 and  this  is  a  very  very
[105:33] complicated  subject  you  know  mental 
 health  i  think  especially  mental  health 
 that's  come  from  poor  modern  habits
[105:39] is 
 something  that  i've 
 gained  a  good  level  of  experience  on  but 
 with
[105:44] complex  ptsd  and  trauma 
 it's  a  it's  a  whole  new  ball  game  what  i
[105:50] can't  say 
 is 
 if  you  do  relate  to  having
[105:55] cptsd  or  trauma
[106:00] be  grateful  for  it  i  wouldn't  be  here 
 where  i  am  today 
 if  it  wasn't  for  the  experiences  that  i
[106:05] had  in  childhood  because 
 i 
 have
[106:10] cpcsd  because  i  went  through  childhood 
 abuse  i  am  the  man  i  am  today  and  i  have
[106:15] such  a  focus  on  things  like  mental 
 health  and  self-improvements  but  then 
 i've  been  able  to  come  online  and  teach
[106:21] these  things  and  i'm  very  grateful  for 
 that  i'm  glad  how  my  life  has  turned  out 
 and  so  of  course  that  means  all  of  the
[106:26] bad  things  too  that's  the  one  thing  i 
 can  suggest  to  you  is  is  find  a  way  to 
 feel  grateful  and  to  almost  rewrite  the
[106:33] story  of  your  trauma  your  abuse  rewrite 
 it  and  take  control  of  it  instead  of 
 it's  you  know  something  unfortunate  that
[106:39] happened  to  you  rewrite  it  think  to 
 yourself  yeah  like  i'm  grateful  for  it 
 because  i  used  it  as  an  opportunity  to
[106:45] accelerate  and  slingshot  myself  into 
 make  more  progress  we're  just  gonna  go 
 through  some  questions  that  some  people
[106:51] have  asked  me  it  related  to  mental 
 health  we  have  a  question  from  night 
 king  hey  hamza  silly  question  but  how  do
[106:57] you  always  find  something  to  talk  about 
 with  people  you  meet  every  once  in  a 
 while  my  mind  goes  completely  blank  so  i
[107:03] struggle  with  starting  such  continuing 
 conversations 
 so  night  king  has  asked
[107:08] how  do  you  find  something  to  talk  about 
 with  everyone  that  you  see 
 and  i  would  actually  change  this
[107:13] question  because  a lot  of  young  men  ask 
 this  question  like  how  do  you  not  run 
 out  of  things  to  say  and  i  always  tell
[107:18] them  no  no  you're  asking  the  wrong 
 question  it's  not  that  you  should  be 
 asking  how  to  not  run  out  of  things  to
[107:23] say  it's  that  you  should  be  asking  how 
 to  be  comfortable  with  silence  in  a 
 conversation  whenever  i  speak  to  someone
[107:29] especially  a  young  guy  who's  feeling  a 
 little  bit  nervous  i  always  know  that  he 
 hasn't  really  leveled  up  with  social 
 skills  but  he  just  keeps  talking  and
[107:34] talking  talking  and  you  know  he's  just 
 talking  about  everything  he's  flipping 
 around  subject  it's  totally  fine  in  a
[107:39] conversation  to  just  stop  if  you  have 
 nothing  to  say  it's  authentic  for  you  to 
 say  nothing  ar  dorga
[107:46] what  would  you  say  to  someone  struggling 
 mentally  being  in  school  and  considering 
 dropping  out  and  what  are  your  views  on
[107:52] dropping  out  of  school  specifically  high 
 school 
 we'll  focus  on  his  question  about 
 someone  struggling  mentally  in  school
[107:59] school  is 
 i  have  a  very  negative  opinion  of  school 
 and  the  education  system  and  a  lot  of
[108:05] the  times  you  hear  like  youtubers  or 
 creators  talk  about  this  they  always 
 like  around  it  and  everything  i'm 
 very  very  serious  in  my  criticism  of  the
[108:12] education  system  especially  in  the  west 
 i  think  it's  it's  been 
 bastardized  and  i  don't  think  it's
[108:17] actually  helpful  for  students  i  don't 
 think  a  student  comes  out  at  age  18
[108:22] actually  educated  on  anything  worthwhile 
 they  don't  know  how  to  run  a  business 
 they  don't  know  how  to  do  their  taxes
[108:27] they  don't  know  how  to  get  into  a 
 relationship  they  don't  even  know  how  to 
 work  hard  or  be  productive  by  themselves 
 they  they  know  nothing  and  the  pressure
[108:33] that  goes  on  for  students  is  absolutely 
 abysmal  how  students 
 are  being  made  says  just  revise  for
[108:39] these  extremely  high  pressure  high 
 stress 
 exams  that  this  whole  will  determine  the
[108:44] rest  of  their  lives  bro  i  could  rant 
 about  this  stuff  for  a  while  i  really 
 think  the  education  system  needs  to  be 
 reformed  perhaps  i'll  be  the  one  to  do
[108:49] it  10  20  years  from  now  if  i  get  into 
 like  politics  or  something  what  would  i 
 say  to  someone  struggling  mentally  in
[108:54] school  you're  not  alone 
 that's  the  common  experience  of  all  the 
 students  around  you  another  thing  i
[109:00] would  say  is  that  you're  not  special 
 the  same  things  that  will  improve 
 everyone  else's  mental  health  will  do 
 yours  too
[109:05] a  lot  of  students  with  their  poor  mental 
 health  and  lack  of  judgment  incorrectly
[109:10] give  up  the  things  that  would  actually 
 keep  them  mentally  healthy  that  then
[109:15] would  improve  their  studies  and  their 
 results  so  for  example  if  you're  a 
 student  right  now  and  you've  been 
 struggling  you're  really  pressured  and
[109:20] your  mental  health  is  not  so  great  you 
 know  the  worst  thing  that  you  could  do 
 because  of  this  pressure  of  the  exams 
 coming  up  is  to  stop  the  mental  health
[109:25] practices  is  for  example  to  start 
 limiting  your  sleep  and  sleeping  five 
 hours  a  night  or  six  hours  or  seven
[109:30] hours  a  night  instead  of  getting  a  full 
 night  of  rest  maybe  you  stop  spending 
 time  with  your  friends  because  you 
 really  want  to  focus  it's  actually  the
[109:35] things  that  would  improve  your  mental 
 health  that  will  get  you  the  highest 
 grades  in  school  and  i  know  this  seems
[109:40] really  weird  but  i  recommend  all 
 students  to  not  study  for  more  than  like 
 six  hours  a  day  which  is  a  big  shock  to
[109:45] a lot  of  students  because  they're  like 
 wait  wait  the  culture  here  is  to  study 
 for  10  hours  no  no  no  the  culture  of  the
[109:50] average  to  slightly  higher  than  average 
 performers  is  to  study  12  hours  a  day 
 but  the  absolute  top  students  on  any
[109:56] country  are  always  studying  around  six 
 hours  and  then  they  spend  some  time  with 
 their  friends  and  their  family  and  they
[110:01] get  a  full  night  of  rest  they  eat  clean 
 nutritious  food  they  exercise  every  day 
 they  get  sunlight  adventure  keep  up  the
[110:07] things  that  improve  your  mental  health 
 fred's  plays  hey  hamsa  i've  recently 
 been  seeing  progress  in  the  gym  and  it
[110:13] feels  amazing  but  i  found  myself  more 
 and  more  comparing  my  progress  to  others 
 and  generally  feeling  less  satisfied
[110:18] with  my  progress  seeing  as  others  have 
 made  such  greater  any  advice  on  how  i 
 should  go  about  stopping  myself  from
[110:24] over  comparing  and  causing  myself  to 
 feel  self-conscious  a  lot  of  love  bro 
 this  is  a  very  interesting  question  and
[110:29] i  don't  think  a  lot  of  people  know  this 
 but  comparing  yourself  to  others  is  an
[110:34] absolutely  fundamentally  normal  part  of 
 the  human  existence  you've  probably  seen
[110:39] all  these  like  cliche  like  feel  good  you 
 know  these  influences  and  all  these 
 instagram  quotes  like  oh  don't  compare
[110:44] yourself  to  others  just  compare  yourself 
 to  who  you  were  yesterday  that's  that's 
 irrelevant  that's  not  how  humans  work  we
[110:49] will  always  compare  against  others  just 
 the  issue  is  that  now  we  have  too  many 
 people  to  compare  against  thousands  of
[110:55] years  ago  we  were  in  tribes  of  around 
 150  our  communities  was  150  people  and
[111:00] so  if  you  compared  yourself  to  the  men 
 in  that  tribe  there  was  probably  20  30 
 men  that  you  compared  yourself  to  and
[111:06] that  was  a  good  thing  that  helped  you 
 excel  but  now  we  have  too  many  people 
 that  we  can  compare  with  our  tribes  are
[111:11] still  technically  150  it  always  will  be 
 the  weird  number  for  human  connection  is
[111:16] about  150.  it  always  will  be  in  terms  of 
 our  physical  lives  but  then  online  we
[111:21] see  too  many  people  that  we  can  connect 
 with  so 
 friends  plays  into  anyone  else  watching 
 this  who  if  you  find  yourself  comparing
[111:27] against  others  it  isn't  that  you  know 
 this  concept  of  oh  i'm  comparing  myself 
 to  against  others  and  i've  got  to  stop
[111:32] no  no  comparing  yourself  against  others 
 is  very  normal  it's  just  that  you're 
 seeing  too  many  people  who  your  brain  is
[111:38] convincing  that  okay  they're  in  our 
 tribe  too  so  the  real  way  to  stop 
 comparing  yourself  to  others  is  actually
[111:43] to  stop  spending  so  much  time  on  the 
 internet  and  that  in  turn  especially  if 
 it  means  reduced  social  media  time  is
[111:49] going  to  be  one  of  the  greatest  things 
 that  you  do  for  your  mental  health  so 
 that  was  my  full  guide  to  improving  your 
 mental  health  and  if  you've  made  it  this
[111:54] far  of  the  video  if  you've  especially 
 done  the  practical  actionable  steps  that 
 i've  mentioned  then  good  on  you  you  have
[112:00] my  respect  for  getting  this  far 
 in  a  topic  that  is  so  deeply  important
[112:05] to  me  personally 
 improving  my  mental  health  has  changed 
 my  life  forever  and  it's  something  that
[112:10] i  will  always  always  maintain 
 the  life  that  i  get  to  live  now
[112:15] a  life  of  success  love  joy  i'll  never  go 
 back  i  hope  you'll  join  me  on  this
[112:20] lifelong  journey  of  maintaining  these 
 good  habits  that  will  keep  us  just 
 mentally  healthy  and  to  understand  that
[112:25] your  mental  health  is  the  greatest  asset 
 that  you  will  have  that's  not  something 
 to  overlook  any  time  that  you  spend
[112:32] learning  about  or  improving  your  mental 
 health 
 will  pay  off  tenfold  once  again  there
[112:37] was  a  bunch  of  things  that  i've  said 
 that  i've  linked  in  this  video  in  the 
 cards  and  stuff  so  you  can  have  a  look 
 at  all  that  if  you  haven't  taken  the
[112:43] mental  health  test  or  you  want  to  see 
 more  videos  from  me  i've  linked  them  all 
 below  if  you  feel  like  this  video  may
[112:48] have  changed  your  life  then  make  sure 
 you  save  it  somewhere  and  you  can 
 probably  recap  it  four  months  from  now
[112:53] six  months  from  now  you  might  have  like 
 forgotten  some  things  so  you  can  save  it 
 to  your  like  watch  later  i  think  it
[112:58] helps  the  youtube  algorithm  if  you 
 comment  and  if  you  leave  a  like  on  the 
 video  it's  always  cringe  saying  that  but
[113:03] if  you  do  want  to  like  help  this  video 
 perform  and  you  know  other  men  finding 
 it  then  you  can  do  like  you  can  spam  the
[113:08] comments  or  you  can  like  it  or  you  can 
 share  it  with  your  friends  you  can 
 subscribe  to  this  channel  if  you  want  to

[01:01] last  year  everyone  on  youtube  was  making 
 videos  on  how  to  reset  your  mind  in  24
[01:06] hours 
 i  took  it  one  step  further  than  that 
 when  i  tell  you  the  benefits  that  i've 
 experienced  on  this  one  year  dopamine
[01:12] detox 
 i  think  you'll  want  to  join  me  first  of 
 all  my  name  is  hamza  and  i  help  young 
 men  go  through  the  jeffrey  to  adonis
[01:17] transformation  through  self-improvement 
 you're  clearly  interested  in  that  so  if 
 you  scroll  down  right  now  click  on  the
[01:22] subscribe  button  then  it's  a  win-win  for 
 both  of  us  i'm  going  to  tell  you  about 
 my  story 
 in  may  2020  i  first  learned  about
[01:28] dopamine  detoxing  from  all  the  viral 
 videos  that  were  going  on 
 and  i  had  the  brilliant  idea  to  do  two
[01:34] weeks  of  going 
 all  out  on  the  bad  habits  before  i  first 
 would  try  the  dopamine  detox
[01:40] so  two  weeks  100  bad  habits 
 i  had  a  binge  eating  disorder  so  you  can
[01:45] see  that  that  that  mentality  came  into 
 all  other  parts  of  my  life  and  by  the 
 way  this  video  is  going  to  be  pretty
[01:50] unfiltered  so  you 
 might  not  want  to  watch  it  next  to  your 
 parents  for  two  weeks  i  would  wake  up 
 and  immediately  start  smoking  the  crack
[01:56] pipe 
 i'd  eat  some  dirty  ass  food 
 jack  off  probably  like  three  to
[02:03] four  to  five  times  and  spend  the  entire 
 day  on  the  internet 
 so  i'd  wake  up  first  go  on  to  reddit
[02:09] whilst  i  was  having  my  morning  poop  stop 
 smoking  weed 
 go  on  to  my  computer  play  some  video
[02:14] games  watch 
 boring  ass  netflix  shows  and  movies  just 
 bingey  and  constantly  literally  just
[02:20] eating  snacks  through  everything 
 i  was  doing  no  structure  to  my  diet 
 maybe  i  exercised
[02:25] three  times  in  the  two  weeks  eventually 
 i  started  drinking  alcohol  in  the 
 apartment  and
[02:30] i'll  be  honest  to  you  i  got  really  dirty 
 i  started  a  couple  of  days  taking 
 mdmhs  sat  there  literally  just
[02:38] sat  there  in  the  apartment  i  turned  into 
 a  crackhead  so  you  can  probably  see  that 
 i  was  the  perfect  candidate  for  a
[02:43] dopamine  detox 
 and  finally  by  evening  slash  night  time 
 i  would  wind  down  by  just  going  on  my
[02:48] computer  going  onto  4chan  looking  at 
 some  messed  up  posts 
 jacking  off  more  sometimes  i  stay  up  to
[02:53] like  3  4  a.m  just  smoking  weed  up  until 
 i  pass  out 
 and  probably  the  worst  time  of  my  life 
 to  be  honest  and  it  was  it  was  odd
[02:59] to  do  all  this  whilst 
 i  try  not  to  think  about  that  part  of  my
[03:06] life 
 these  days  because  it  just  makes  me  like 
 i'm  grateful  for  it  you  know  i'm 
 grateful  for  the  progress  that  i've  made 
 but  when  i  do  think  about  it
[03:12] it  makes  me  a  bit  fearful  to  think  that 
 i  could  sink  back  into  that  type  of 
 lifestyle  so  i  hated  my  life
[03:18] i  used  to  cry  a  lot  maybe  after  every 
 day  or  every  two  days 
 i'd  be  crying  i'd  burst  into  tears  i  was
[03:24] living  with  my  girlfriend  at  the  time 
 and  so  she'd  be  like  comforting  me  but 
 you  boys  know  how  that  goes  when
[03:29] if  you  break  down  emotionally  like  that 
 like  it's  done  for  you 
 and  although  i  somewhat  broke  up  with
[03:35] her  eventually  when  i  went  on  to  the 
 dopamine  detox  like  there  was  no 
 attraction  left  from  her  anyway  i  used
[03:40] to  journal  a  lot 
 at  this  point  i  had  relatively  found 
 self-improvement  and  i  was  trying  to  do
[03:45] the  stuff 
 i  just  wasn't  able  to  do  it  consistently 
 so  i  had  already  been  working  out  for
[03:50] years  before  this  in  terms  of  going  to 
 the  gym  building  the  body 
 god  damn  but  in  terms  like  meditation
[03:56] journaling  that's 
 all  the  good  habits  the  reading  and 
 stopping  internet  stuff  in  fact
[04:01] it  was  it  was  a  bit  of  a  struggle  for  me 
 especially  quitting  smoking  as  well  i 
 wanted  to  quit  smoking
[04:06] a  year  before  this  and  every  single  day 
 i'd  go  back  to  go  back  to  the  old  weed
[04:11] and 
 it  was  a  true  addiction  now  when  it's 
 kind  of  a  side  note  but  when  people  say 
 that  oh  you  know  weeds  not  a  problem
[04:16] weed's  actually  good  for  you  you  can't 
 get  addicted  to  weed 
 bro  i  want  us  i  want  to  what's  up
[04:22] downwards 
 elbow  that  i've  been  learning  in 
 kickboxing  i  want  to hit  him  with  one  of 
 these  but 
 it's  not  not  bad  for  you  shut  up  bro
[04:28] you're  clearly  not  smoking  like  i  was 
 so  all  around  before  i  got  into  the 
 dopamine  detox  i  had  this
[04:34] horrible  stuck  feeling  in  life  that 
 i  wanted  to  change  i  knew  what  actions
[04:39] would  help  me 
 i  just  wasn't  doing  them  because  they 
 were  just  too  hard  because  they  weren't
[04:44] giving  me 
 instant  gratification  and  instant 
 gratification
[04:49] delayed  gratification  those  are  two  very 
 very  important  phrases  that  are  going  to 
 change  your  life
[04:54] and  i'll  teach  you  all  about  them  in  the 
 later  parts  of  this  video  so  what  did  i 
 do 
 i  learned  about  dopamine  detoxing  i  knew
[04:59] that  this  was  the  thing  that  was  going 
 to  change  it  all  for  me  and  i  made  a 
 very  drastic  decision  to
[05:04] move  out  of  the  city  apartment  that  i 
 was  living  in  to  move  back  home 
 to  my  my  family's  house  i  live  with  my
[05:09] family  so  i  can't  smoke  weed  i  can't  do 
 any  like  drugs  or  anything  here  i'm  just 
 gonna  do  you  know  i  could  still
[05:14] be  spending  time  like  my  computer's 
 right  here  i've  got  my  own  room 
 obviously  and  so  i  could  still  be 
 spending  time  doing  the  bad  habits
[05:20] but  this  was  like  the  new  chapter  of  my 
 life 
 in  the  book  deep  work  by  cal  newport  he
[05:27] gives  this  phrase  of 
 the  grand  gesture  when  you  really  want 
 to  take  something  serious  you  do  a  grand 
 gesture
[05:32] and  this  was  mine  this  was  my  grand 
 gesture  i  said  i'm  tired  of  this  life 
 i'm  tired  of  smoking  weed  i'm  literally
[05:37] gonna  move  back  to  my  mummy 
 because  i  know  that  she's  not  gonna  let 
 me  smoke  weed  anymore  so  i'll  get  back
[05:42] here  and  i  instantly  get  onto  the 
 dopamine  detox  now  before  i  tell  you 
 about  the  rules  that  i  have  personally
[05:47] set  myself  which  have  helped  me  get  to 
 this  point  where  i'm  a  year  in  i'm  not 
 doing
[05:52] some  24  hour  challenge  or  a  week 
 challenge  to  you  know  do  the  youtube 
 video 
 this  was  for  a  life  change  like  i  am
[05:57] never  going  back  to  normal  life 
 if  you  adopt  the  same  rules  that  i'm 
 about  to  tell  you
[06:02] you  will  become  different  for  life  you 
 will  never  want  to  go  back  to  being  like
[06:07] a  normal  person  it 
 it  sickens  me  to  think  of  life  like  that 
 again  but  before  i  tell  you  the  rules
[06:13] the  why  is  more  important  the  why 
 is  always  far  far  more  important  than
[06:19] the  what  or  the  how  and  you  must 
 understand  the  why 
 why  did  i  want  to  do  this  why  should  you 
 consider  a  dopamine  detox
[06:25] my  why  was  because  i  wanted  to  like 
 myself  again 
 in  this  modern  world  literally  no  one
[06:31] has  self  love  anymore  and  i  certainly 
 didn't  have  it  i  didn't  like  myself  i 
 thought  i  was  a  piece  of 
 and  i  actually  i  spent  some  time  to  to
[06:38] think  okay 
 what  exactly  is  self-love  now  of  course 
 i  did  the  youtube  search  and  it  was  a 
 lot  of  these  like
[06:43] maybe  sexist  but  you  know  like  feminine 
 videos  of  just  the  girls  saying  like  i 
 do  some  online  shopping  go  have  a  bath
[06:48] with  a  bath  bomb  like 
 is  that  gonna  help  me  [ __ ]  so  i  spend  a
[06:53] large  amount  of  time  journaling  and 
 really  thinking  okay  what  is  self-love 
 how  what  is  a  practical
[06:58] somewhat  masculine  way  that  i  can 
 generate  self-love 
 no  no  [ __ ]  no  wishy-washy  stuff  what
[07:04] is  practical  what  are  the  steps 
 to  form  self-love  like  i  could  be 
 selling  this  right  now  i  could  get  this
[07:09] viral  and  this  this  would  make  me  famous 
 there  is  practical  steps  to  self-love 
 and  it  is  to  do  things
[07:15] for  your  future  self  that's  the  only 
 thing  you  have  control  over 
 do  good  things  for  your  future  self  the
[07:20] reason  why  no  one  likes  themselves 
 anymore  the  reason  why  you  don't  have 
 pure  self  love  for  yourself  is  because
[07:25] the  younger  version  of  yourself 
 set  you  up  to  fail  the  younger  version
[07:30] of  yourself  ate  that  junk  food  and  now 
 you  have  too  high  of  a  body  fat 
 percentage  than  you're  comfortable  with 
 the  younger  version  of yourself  didn't
[07:35] study  hard  enough  and  now  you've  got  a 
 degree  or  a  degree  or  career  so  you
[07:40] don't  have  much  self-love 
 now  flip  it  around  i  have  my  dream  body 
 right  now  right 
 six  almost  seven  years  of  training
[07:47] obviously  my  training  and  diet  went  to 
 during  these  bad  parts  but  especially 
 the  last  year  of  this  detox
[07:52] best  training  i've  ever  had  i  have  huge 
 self-love  for  myself 
 because  the  younger  version  of  myself
[07:58] delayed  gratification 
 and  put  me  as  the  priority  and  so  i  am 
 sat  here  today  chilling  with  my  dream
[08:04] body 
 that's  self-love  self-love  is  doing 
 things  for  your  future  self 
 and  that's  what  the  dopamine  detox  aims
[08:10] to  accomplish  that  was  my  why 
 and  i  suggest  if  you  are  considering 
 your  own  dopamine  detox  you  you
[08:16] set  a  declaration  of  why  you're  doing 
 this  not  just  what  you  aim  to 
 achieve  not  just  the  goals  that  you  want
[08:21] to  do  but  the  why 
 what  is  the  purpose  and  i  think 
 self-love  is  a  fantastic  purpose  to  do
[08:26] this  for 
 so  here  is  the  strategy  of  my  dopamine 
 detox 
 now  like  i  said  i  wanted  this  to  be  a
[08:32] long-term  improvement  hopefully  a 
 lifelong  improvement  i  did  not  want  to 
 do  any  kind  of  clickbait  challenge  i
[08:37] didn't  want  to  do  it  24 
 hours  to  reset  your  mind  her  one  week 
 dopamine  it's  not  for  a  challenge  this
[08:42] isn't  for  you 
 like  what  i'm  saying  this  for  me  this 
 isn't  for  you  i'm  doing  this  for  myself 
 i'm  not  doing  this  for  the  viewers  on
[08:48] youtube  i'm  not  doing  this  for 
 24  hours  to  click  you  know  like 
 clickbait  videos  which  get  a  million 
 views  and  it's 
 the  before  and  after  picture  in  the
[08:54] thumbnail  where's  the  guy  on  his  phone 
 and  it's  like  a  guy  reading  like 
 i'm  not  doing  that  it's  not  for  your
[08:59] entertainment  it's  for  my  benefit 
 and  so  that  means  that  the  way  that  i  do 
 my  dopamine  detox  the  way  that  it's  been
[09:05] successful  in  completely 
 changing  my  life  it  isn't  as  sexy  as 
 doing  a  24-hour  challenge  which  you
[09:10] can't  do  anything  and  you  can  only  sit 
 there  and  be  bored 
 i  knew  that  if  i  was  gonna  do  this  for
[09:15] life  the  rules  had  to  be  pretty  lenient 
 and  so  in  general  the  rules  come  from
[09:20] drastically  reducing 
 instant  gratification  and  drastically 
 increasing
[09:25] delayed  gratification  instant 
 gratification  the  bad  thing 
 are  the  activities  that  give  us  instant
[09:32] pleasure  but  they're  usually  not  good 
 for  us 
 that's  video  games  because  video  games 
 are  kind  of  fun  when  we  play  them  right
[09:37] now 
 but  they  just  make  you  into  like  a 
 [ __ ]  over  time 
 porn  junk  food  drugs  all  of  these  give
[09:45] you 
 instant  pleasures  quite  a  high  level  of 
 instant  pleasures 
 but  pretty  much  every  single  time  you  do
[09:50] any  of  these  every  single  time  you 
 indulge  in  one  of  these 
 your  life  gets  slightly  worse  not  a  huge 
 amount  you  can  take  some  drugs  every  now
[09:56] and  then  you  can 
 watch  porn  probably  not  but  like  the 
 issue  is  that  we've  built  up  a  habit  of
[10:01] doing  these  every  single  day 
 and  so  your  life  trajectories  like  this 
 that's  what  instant  gratification  does
[10:06] to  you  that's  why  you  don't  love  your 
 your  younger  self  that's  why  you  look 
 back  and  you  think
[10:11] about  a  [ __ ]  life  this  is  why  we  don't 
 have  self  love  is  because  we  keep  doing 
 this  to  our  lives
[10:16] how  could  you  love  yourself  when  you're 
 here  looking  back  at  yourself  and  you 
 were  up  here 
 delayed  gratification  is  the  other  way
[10:22] around  delayed  gratification 
 are  the  activities  that  are  hard  and 
 uncomfortable  and  challenging  right  now
[10:28] but  they  give  us  a  long  term  benefits 
 that's  exercise  because exercise 
 unless  you  know  you're  very  experienced
[10:33] and  you've  gotten  into  it  generally  for 
 most  people  exercise  is  actually 
 uncomfortable  it's  actually  pretty 
 difficult  they  don't  want  to  go  and  work
[10:39] out  but  in  the  long  term 
 it  gives  you  better  fitness  better 
 health  better  confidence  better
[10:44] self-esteem  better  body 
 more  attraction  from  girls  more  respect 
 from  men  it's  awesome  building  a 
 business  learning  some  skills
[10:50] meditating  journaling  reading  all  of 
 these  are  somewhat  uncomfortable 
 somewhat  boring  right  now  i  don't  know
[10:56] what  you're  probably  thinking  but 
 readings  are  boring  how  to  show  but  for 
 most  people  it  is
[11:01] and  it's  certainly  not  as  fun  as  over 
 stimulating  your  brain 
 on  any  kind  of  video  game  when  you  delay
[11:07] gratification  you 
 secure  your  future  self  to  have  a  better 
 life  that's  the  point  of  the  dopamine
[11:12] detox 
 at  least  my my  point  my  long-term  detox 
 so  now  let's  go  through  the  tactics  what 
 exactly  i  did  that  you  can  do  too
[11:19] i  made  a  timetable  now  usually  when  i 
 say  this  people  get  a  little  bit  bored
[11:24] because  they  wanted 
 you  know  they  wanted  me  to  say  something 
 exciting  do  you  remember  the  timetables 
 that  we  used  to  have  in  school
[11:29] 9  a.m  was  science  10  a.m  was  maths  11 
 a.m  was  english
[11:34] you  could  probably  still  remember  what 
 time  x  lesson  was  right 
 because  it  gets  ingrained  in  our  brain
[11:40] there's  a  reason  why  every  job 
 every  school  uses  timetables  because  it 
 works
[11:45] we  leave  the  education  system  and  then 
 we  just  think  oh 
 i  don't  need  to  do  anything  with  time
[11:50] management  and  then  you're  like  gee 
 i  wonder  why  i'm  not  being  productive  i 
 wonder  why  i'm  not  doing  anything  with
[11:55] my  time 
 it's  because  you  haven't  managed  your 
 time 
 so  the  time  table  out  of  every
[12:02] productivity  tactic  i've  ever  learned 
 about  and  i've  learned  about  fair 
 amounts  out  of  every  time  management  the 
 timetable's  better  than  all  of  them  put
[12:08] together 
 every  single  thing  i've  ever  learned 
 about  productivity  is  undermined  by  the 
 timetable  because  the  timetable  this  is
[12:14] the  the  op  the  overpowered  part  of  the 
 timetable 
 it  makes  your  entire  day  into  a  habit  if
[12:19] your  jaw  hasn't  dropped  you  don't  even 
 understand  what  i  just  said 
 the  timetable  makes  your  entire  day  into
[12:24] a  habit 
 remember  we're  trying  to  build  a  habit 
 or  two  we're  trying  to  build  a  habit  of 
 meditation  imagine  having
[12:29] your  high  productivity  your  high 
 performance  day 
 as  a  habit  the  whole  day  becomes  a  habit
[12:35] it's  like  i  can  do  my  high  performance 
 day  like  afk  now  like  i  can  just  do  it 
 chilling  because  it's  a  habit  i  know
[12:41] what  time  to  wake  up  i  know  what  task  is 
 next  already 
 i  can't  explain  how  overpowered  this  is
[12:46] i've  had  pictures  of  my  times  it  will 
 come  up  on  screen 
 the  guys  who  follow  it  change  their 
 lives  the  guys  who  think  oh  this  doesn't
[12:51] look  so 
 hamza  what  about  the  pomodoro  technical 
 remake  it  exactly  how  i  have
[12:56] don't  have  the  limiting  belief  but  but 
 hamza  sometimes  my  date  oh  yeah  of 
 course  it  does  sometimes  your  day  does 
 change  sometimes  life  gets  in  the  way  as
[13:02] we  know 
 but  this  is  your  ideal  day  we're  not 
 saying  okay  this 
 this  has  to  be  every  single  day  the
[13:07] whole  point  is  this  is  like  the  100  best 
 day  that  you  could  have  you  write  it 
 down 
 literally  i  haven't  even  purposely  done
[13:13] this  but  i'm  gonna  look  like  a  [ __ ] 
 if  this  isn't  but  i'm  pretty  sure  if  i 
 open  this  right  now  my  timetable  is 
 going  to  open
[13:19] and  it  did  i  didn't  even  plan  for  this 
 to  happen  but 
 you  can't  see  that  yeah  there  i  keep  it
[13:26] open  on  my  phone 
 all  the  time  like  if  there's  one  app 
 that's  open  on  my  phone  it's  this 
 i've  read  this  timetable  probably  about
[13:32] two  three  thousand 
 times  but  i  still  read  it  a  couple  times 
 every  single  day  just  because
[13:37] if  there's  a  moment  that  i  have  some 
 time  to  like  look  at  my  phone 
 i  would  rather  look  at  this  which  has
[13:42] truly  changed  my  life  than  going  to 
 any  of  the  bad  stuff  the  reason  why  i'm 
 going  on  about  this  instead  of  the
[13:47] specific  actions  like  quitting  social 
 media  quizzing  video  games 
 that  stuff's  sexy  that  stuff  is  so  cool
[13:52] and  you  want  to  hear  me  and  you  want  to 
 you  know  you  want  to  see  the  b-roll  of 
 me  like  deleting  the  apps  on  my  phone
[13:57] it's  bs  anyone  who  showed  you  a  video  of 
 that  saying  oh  i  deleted  i  delete  social 
 media  i  believe
[14:02] it's  bs  that's  not  how  it  works  you're 
 alcoholic 
 parents  you're  you've  got  an  alcoholic
[14:07] mother  or  uncle  he's  done  that  before 
 hasn't  he  he's  thrown  away  the  alcohol 
 what  happened  did  he  just
[14:12] suddenly  quit  because  he  threw  away  that 
 one  bottle  no  he  bought  more  you've  got 
 a  fat  family  member  or  a  fat  cow  worker 
 and  they've  said  the  same  thing  haven't
[14:17] they  oh  i  threw  away  the  junk  food  what 
 happened 
 they're  still  fat  why  because  they  went
[14:22] and  bought  more  junk  food 
 how  many  times  have  you  uninstalled 
 league  of  legends  too  many  and  yet
[14:27] it's  still  you're  literally  loading  up  a 
 gaming  league  as  i'm  speaking  right  now 
 because  deleting  and  hiding  the  the
[14:33] stuff  that  you're  addicted  to 
 doesn't  work  when  you  structure  your  day 
 with  things  that  you  would  rather  do
[14:38] you  make  progress  when  you  try  to  to  get 
 validation  from  people  by  saying  i i
[14:43] deleted  social  media  i 
 i  uninstalled  league  of  legends  you  make 
 no  progress  still  to  this  day  i  say
[14:49] i've  said  this  sentence  a  hundred  times 
 and  still  to  this  day  people  talk  to  me 
 they're  like  i  deleted  social  media 
 a  week  later  that  not  even  a  week  two
[14:55] days  later  they're  back  on  twitter 
 league  of  legends  i'm  gonna  uninstall 
 league  of  legends  right  now  but  i  see 
 you  playing  it  every  single  day
[15:00] deleting  this  stuff  in  like  a  big 
 righteous  moment  does  not  work  and  i 
 know  that  that's  what  you  want  and  i
[15:05] know  that  that's  the  videos  that  you've 
 watched  before  it  does  not  work  like 
 that 
 you  don't  cure  your  addiction  by  just
[15:10] throwing  it  away  because  you  are 
 addicted  and  you  still  get  it  you  need 
 to  become  addicted  to  something  else
[15:15] i'm  addicted  to  the  timetable  for  more 
 than  the  year  just  recently  i  have  i'll 
 explain  why  but  from
[15:20] almost  the  entire  year  i  left  my 
 addictions  on  my  computer  i  left  the 
 video  games  right  there  i  left  social
[15:25] media  on  my  phone  this  is 
 a  side  note  but  dopamine  detoxing  and 
 doing  the  right  things  delaying
[15:30] gratification  not  indulging  no  instant 
 gratification 
 it  comes  from  willpower  willpower  is  the
[15:35] skill  of  disobeying  your  lizard  brain 
 and  your  lizard  brain  is  the  dumbass 
 part  of  your  brain  that  convinces  you  to
[15:40] play  video  games  that  convinces  you  to 
 skip  the  workout 
 so  the  lizard  brain  you  could  probably 
 say  is  your  biggest  enemy  ever
[15:45] because  it's  around  24  7.  it's  that 
 internal  bully  in  your  mind  that  tells 
 you  to  do  the  bad  things  and  then
[15:50] straight  afterwards  it  leaves  you  and 
 you're  like 
 why  did  i  just  cheat  on  my  diet  again 
 what  i'm  on  a  nofap  streak  why  did  i
[15:56] just  jack  off 
 it  seemed  like  such  a  good  idea  a  second 
 ago  what  no  one  online  is  telling  you 
 because  i  don't  believe  that  they've
[16:01] actually  experienced  a  huge 
 self-improvement  journey  from  going  to 
 the  depths  of  [ __ ]
[16:06] instant  gratification  addiction  to  like 
 becoming  a  normal  person  or  better  than 
 normal 
 if  i'm  better  i  am  better  than  normal  to
[16:12] be  honest  but  no  one's  actually  telling 
 you  how  to  level  up  your  willpower 
 and  that's  what  automatically  gets
[16:17] leveled  up  through  dopamine  detoxing  but 
 only  if  you  do  it  the  right  way 
 and  most  people  are  doing  it  the  wrong 
 way  they  want  to  increase  their
[16:22] willpower  through  dopamine  detox 
 but  they  do  it  through  a  stupid  way  of 
 essentially  covering  up  their  eyes  and
[16:27] saying  but  i  can't  see  the  junk  food 
 anymore 
 i  i've  deleted  social  media  i  don't  have
[16:32] the  apps  on  my  phone  so  i'm  cured 
 i've  installed  a  youtube  website  blocker
[16:37] so  i  can't  see  youtube  anymore  i'm  cured 
 you  never  give  your  willpower  a  chance 
 to  level  up  the  reason  why  you  struggle
[16:43] with  these  the  reason  why  you  can't  do 
 the  hard  actions 
 is  because  you  have  low  levels  of
[16:48] willpower 
 and  the  few  attempts  that  you've  made  to 
 try  and  level  up  your  willpower  has  been
[16:53] undermined  by  the 
 youtube  channels  that  show  you  oh  i 
 deleted  the  apps 
 don't  delete  the  apps  keep  them  on  your
[17:00] phone  don't 
 install  the  website  blocker  don't  throw 
 away  the  junk  food  don't  do  anything 
 with  the  addictions
[17:05] keep  them  in  front  of  you  for  over  a 
 year  i  kept  chocolate  bars  on  my  desk 
 and  i  used  to  just  stare  at  them  just
[17:11] looking  at  them  and 
 feeling  how  i  would  feel  the  cravings
[17:16] how  many  people  do  you  know  have  done 
 that  now  chocolate  doesn't  have  an 
 effect  on  me  we  have  it  in  the  house 
 all  the  time  but  it  doesn't  have  an
[17:21] effect  on  me  if  your  way 
 of  trying  to  improve  yourself  is  to 
 simply  set  up  the  environment  and  close
[17:27] your  eyes 
 eventually  your  eyes  are  going  to  be 
 open  when  someone  offers  you  the 
 chocolate 
 eventually  you're  gonna  feel  like
[17:32] playing  league  and  you're  gonna  be  like 
 let  me 
 let  me  just  download  it  again  because 
 you've  never  actually  built
[17:38] the  willpower  to  have  league  of  legends 
 installed  just  have  icon  right  in  front 
 of  you 
 and  literally  just  choose  not  to  click
[17:44] on  it  that's  like  my  secret 
 to  staying  like  this  for  an  entire  year 
 and  it  annoys  me
[17:49] because  no  one  else  is  actually  telling 
 you  the  truth  everyone's  giving  you  the 
 click  bait  like  oh  i  deleted  social 
 media  here's  his  b-roll  of  me
[17:55] and  installing  the  app  on  social  media 
 like  and  then  they  downloaded  it  again 
 you  can  literally  search  their  profile
[18:01] whatever  youtuber  you  want  to  see 
 you  can  literally  search  them  on 
 instagram  after  they've  said  that  they 
 deleted  the  apps
[18:06] and  they're  back  on  posting  they're  back 
 on  commenting  to  everyone
[18:11] so  the  tactics  with  my  dopamine  detox 
 was  firstly  to  set  this 
 ideal  timetable  the  ideal  day  just  wrote
[18:16] out  just  like  that  and  that  was  my  guide 
 for  the  day  that  was  me  trying  to  just 
 follow  it  as  best  as  i  come
[18:21] in  this  timetable  at  first  i  allowed 
 myself  some  bad  time  some  instant 
 gratification  time
[18:27] and  so  i  did  the  80  20  rule  and  i  said 
 okay  what  are 
 the  20  of  bad  habits  the  instant
[18:32] gratification  habits  that  give  me  the 
 most 
 joy  because  you  need  to  keep  something
[18:37] in  remember  we're  not  doing  a  24  hour 
 challenge  that  you  can  you  know  you  can 
 for  24  hours  just  sit  in  a  room  and  do 
 nothing  but  you  know  we're  doing  this
[18:43] for  life 
 and  so  for  life  we've  got  to  think  about 
 adherence  long  term 
 the  ability  to  stick  to  the  plan  rather
[18:49] than  just  making  it  extreme 
 because  we've  got  our  entire  lives  to 
 make  it  more  extreme
[18:54] so  for  the  first  while  i  gave  myself 
 like  a  solid  couple  of  hours 
 to  like  two  hours  per  day  to  just  spend
[19:01] on  instant  gratification  so  i  did  the  80 
 20  pareto's  principle 
 and  i'll  just  i'm  not  gonna  lie  so  i'll
[19:07] tell  you  the  two  favorite  things 
 i  wanted  to  do  was  meet  girls  from 
 tinder  and  watching  some  youtube  videos
[19:12] so  i  completely  stopped 
 social  media  i  completely  stopped  drugs 
 i  completely  stopped  binge  eating
[19:18] especially  junk  food  i 
 literally  don't  even  eat  junk  food  at 
 all  i 
 stopped  watching  movies  and  netflix  and
[19:24] and  any  type  of  games  or  any  anything 
 else  i  literally  just  watched  about  an 
 hour  of  youtube
[19:29] a  day  and  probably  like  once  or  twice  a 
 week  i'd  meet 
 any  like  girls  that  i  was  matching  with
[19:34] on  tinder  that  wasn't  my  fun 
 and  that  was  more  than  enough  honestly 
 and  so  for  the  rest  of  my  time  i  was 
 following  the  time  table  as  best  as  i
[19:40] could 
 of  course  life  would  get  in  the  way  of 
 course  sometimes  i'd  have  extra 
 responsibilities  or  you  know  i'd  sleep  a
[19:45] bit  longer  someday  or  something 
 but  generally  i'd  be  looking  at  the 
 timetable  and  just  trying  to  follow  that
[19:50] as  best  as  possible 
 that  was  my  plan  now  i  know  this  video 
 is  about  dopamine  detoxing  and  you  want 
 to  need  to  talk  about  like
[19:55] overthrowing  the  internet  and  stuff  but 
 all  of  this 
 came  from  the  timetable  because  you  will
[20:01] fail  your  dopamine  detox  you  will  not 
 transform  your  life 
 until  you  have  a  new  structure  to  your
[20:06] day  because  what  is  the  dopamine  detox 
 other  than  just 
 doing  different  things  in  your  day  it's
[20:11] the  timetable  that  you  need  to  get  onto 
 so  that's  the  tactic 
 and  finally  what  are  the  benefits  then
[20:16] after  one  year  of  this  lifestyle  what 
 are  the  benefits  well  i'll  tell  you  what 
 the 
 the  difference  of  my  life  is  right  now
[20:22] compared  to  one  year  ago  and  you  can 
 tell  yourself  i'm  in  the  best  shape  i've 
 ever  been  in
[20:27] here  is  a  one-year  transformation 
 picture  i've  had  visible  abs  for  the 
 last  entire  year
[20:33] i've  never  done  that  before  i  would  only 
 for  for  the  years  that  i've  trained 
 before  this
[20:38] i  would  only  have  visible  abs  for 
 honestly 
 a  month  max  because  i  was  always  a  binge
[20:44] eater  i've  always  liked  i've  had  anxiety 
 and  so 
 with  if  you've  got  anxiety  you  just 
 binge  eat  usually  and  so  anytime  i  would
[20:50] get  lean  from  doing  lots  of  exercise  and 
 dieting 
 i'd  see  my  abs  add  veins  and  everything
[20:55] literally  within  a  month 
 i  just  each  i  used  to  go  to  the  shops 
 and  literally  do  an 
 entire  food  shop  of  just  snacks  and  just
[21:02] eat  all  this  like  whilst  i  was  just  sat 
 at  home  watching  netflix  and  so 
 for  the  last  year  i've  had  visible  abs
[21:07] i've  been  the  best  shape  of  my  life 
 i've  been  training  with  the  gymnastic 
 rings  which  is  like  a  completely  new
[21:13] skill  for  me  because  i  usually  just  lift 
 weights  but  i've  been  training  with  them 
 and  i've  been  making  some  pretty  damn
[21:18] good  progress  sometimes  it  hits  me  like 
 for  an  entire  year 
 two  three  four  times  a  week  i've  been
[21:23] going  out  and  training  with  these 
 gymnastic  rings  and  the  training  is 
 actually  difficult
[21:28] and  i've  just  been  going  out 
 consistently  doing  it  and  i  can  do  some 
 pretty  cool  movements  i  can  do  a
[21:33] handstand  press  on  the  rings  like  five 
 reps 
 on  the  rings  i  can  do  not  exactly  a 
 front  lever  but  i'm
[21:38] seeing  some  pretty  good  progress  can  hit 
 the  back  lever  and  in  including  with 
 fitness  my  cardios  went  straight  up
[21:44] so  before  the  dopamine  detox  i  used  to 
 do  pretty  much  no  cardio 
 a  little  bit  of  boxing  here  and  there 
 but  nothing  much  since  then
[21:50] i  can  now  run  what  feels  like  an 
 unlimited  amount  like  i  don't  really
[21:55] have  to  stop  running  unless 
 i  want  to  and  so  5k  is  like  normal  i  ran
[22:00] a  10k  one  time 
 i've  now  started  kickboxing  in  terms  of 
 fitness  honestly 
 i've  never  been  better  before  i've  never
[22:06] been  in  better  shape  i've  never  felt 
 physically  as  strong  or  as  agile  or  as
[22:11] as  much  stamina  as  i  have  now  in  terms 
 of  money  and  finances 
 i'm  making  the  most  money  i've  ever  made
[22:16] before  with  youtube  so  in 
 with  youtube  videos  i've  been  uploading 
 at  least  twice  a  week
[22:21] every  single  week  for  the  for  the  last 
 year  and 
 i've  made  this  my  business  i've  made  my
[22:27] purpose  in  life  helping  young  guys 
 to  get  out  of  that  dopamine  rut  and  to 
 achieve  the  same  transformation  that  i
[22:33] have 
 i've  helped  a  fair  amount  of  guys  i've 
 created  a  community  of  young  men  who  are 
 all  climbing  who  are  all  on
[22:39] improvements  we  do  use  discord  as  well 
 if  you  do  want  to  join  us  there's  a 
 discord  link  in  the  description  with
[22:44] like  500  guys  who  talk  about  fitness  and 
 nofap  and  red  pill  and  all  that  so  if 
 you're  interested  in  this
[22:49] just  scroll  down  right  now  click  on  the 
 discord  link  and  you'll  be  able  to  join 
 my  business  is  it's  not  making  it  like
[22:55] an 
 amazing  amount  but  like  i'll  tell  you 
 the  actual  figures  i'm  not  afraid  of 
 telling  you  so
[23:00] january  i  made  1  550  pounds 
 february  made  1  742  pounds  march  i  made
[23:08] 1463. 
 april  went  down  to  like  800  and 
 something  because  i  stopped  doing  a  part
[23:13] of  the 
 not  april  may  may  went  down  to  like  800 
 pounds  so  it  fluctuates  but 
 in  general  it  is  the  most  i've  made
[23:19] before  even  though  i've  worked  like  a 
 full-time  job  like  a  low-end  full-time 
 job  before  and
[23:24] it's  literally  my  dream  to  be  a  youtuber 
 so 
 in  one  year  i've  achieved  my  childhood
[23:30] my  teenage 
 dream  of  being  a  youtuber  of  making 
 online  income 
 and  i  expect  within  one  year  another  one
[23:37] year 
 that  i'll  be  able  to  achieve  my  recent 
 big  dream  which  is  to  be  a  digital  nomad 
 to  take  all  of  this  and  go  abroad  and
[23:42] just  live  in  different  countries  and  get 
 experience  like  whatever  the  world  has 
 to  offer 
 just  with  my  camera  and  my  laptop  and
[23:48] the  reason  why  i'm  able  to  achieve  this 
 is  because  my  productivity  just  went  up 
 i'm  finally  doing
[23:53] the  work  for  youtube  because  i  wanted  to 
 be  a  youtuber  for  a  long  time 
 i  just  never  got  around  to  it  because  of
[23:59] laziness  because  of  just  putting  it  off 
 because  it  was  too  hard  it  was  too  much 
 of 
 delaying  gratification  my  mental  health
[24:05] has  never  been  this  good  before 
 so  i've  mentioned  that  i  do  have  anxiety 
 and  i  still  do
[24:10] but  obviously  with  one  year  ago  with  the 
 experience  i  was  telling  you  when  i  was 
 smoking  from  the  crack  pipe  and
[24:15] everything  my  mental  health  was  in 
 all  time  bad  high  levels  of  stress
[24:20] interrupted  sleep  from  anxiety  and 
 stress  i'd  literally  just  wake  up  slowly 
 sweating  and  worrying  and
[24:26] thinking  that  someone  was  gonna  attack 
 me  like  a  hundred  times  a  day 
 like  that's  not  even  an  exaggeration
[24:31] every  single  time  i'd  step  out  of  my 
 apartment 
 i  used  to  think  that  someone  would  try 
 and  stab  me  like  more  than  once  like
[24:37] every  few  seconds  i  would  think  that 
 even  being  sat  inside  playing  like 
 playing  video  games  over  indulging  in  in 
 the  bad  habits  was  the  only  times  that
[24:43] my  anxiety  would  essentially  just 
 disappear  because  i  was  just 
 too  much  in  a  haze  and  in  a  rut  to  feel
[24:48] it  but  i  felt  like  i  was  very  depressed 
 i  felt  like  i  had  not  much  to  live  for
[24:53] at  that  point 
 and  that  was  the  complete  opposite  i 
 feel  like  i  have  everything  to  live  for
[24:58] there's  a  psychologist  maslow  who  who 
 made  this  pyramid  the  hierarchy  of  needs
[25:03] i'm  at  the  top  i've  reached 
 self-actualization  like 
 i  don't  maybe  that  sounds  like  a  big
[25:08] eagle  boost  or  something  but  i  think  it 
 is  true 
 i've  checked  off  every  single  one  of 
 these  little  characteristics  that  he
[25:14] said  you  need  to 
 you  check  off  to  reach 
 self-actualization  like  i'm  at 
 the  point  of  of  human  experience  that's
[25:21] why 
 like  i  have  motivation  just  on  tap  it's 
 like  24  7.  it  doesn't  turn  off  or 
 anything  my  discipline  is sky  high  i'm
[25:27] doing  all  this  stuff  i  feel 
 so  fulfilled
[25:32] with  the  the  stuff  i'm  doing  because  not 
 only  have  i  improved  myself  to  the  point 
 that  i  feel  awesome
[25:37] but  my  cup  is  full  and  now  i'm  just 
 using  my  cup  to 
 to  fill  up  the  cups  of  the  boys  who  i
[25:42] can  help  i've  never 
 felt  purposeful  or  fulfilled  in  my 
 entire  life  and
[25:48] now  people  are  seeing  me  as  like  the 
 leader  like 
 guys  are  sending  me  messages  that  have 
 literally  saved  their  lives  in  terms  of
[25:55] bad  habits  there  really  isn't  that  many 
 like  i  still  do  some  bad  stuff  in  terms
[26:01] of  you  remember  we're  doing  this  the 
 long  term  so  i'm  not 
 going  to  completely  cut  stuff  out  and
[26:06] say  no  no  it's  against  the  rules 
 for  example  i  went  to  a  party  um  four  or
[26:11] five  days  ago 
 took  some  mdma  there  and  then  i  drank 
 there  and  stuff  that  was  like 
 the  first  time  i've  done  something
[26:16] social  for  like  a  year  or  some  you  know 
 social  party  vibe  for  like  an  entire
[26:21] year 
 in  the  last  year  i've  smoked  weed  a 
 bunch  of  times  because  i  was 
 with  a  girl  like  you  know  if  you  meet  a
[26:26] girl  from  tinder  and  she  smokes  then 
 obviously  i'm  gonna  smoke  with  her  and 
 so 
 smoked  probably  like  20  times  over  the
[26:32] last  year  which  is 
 a  fair  amount  maybe  i'll  leave  it  a 
 little  bit  more  than  i  spare  them  out 
 but 
 it's  not  something  i  feel  negative  about
[26:39] because  it's 
 it's  not  in  a  disgusting  way  where  i'm 
 smoking  by  myself  whilst  doing
[26:44] it  by  myself  it  was  more  like  11  p.m 
 meeting  a  girl 
 to  bang  obviously  and  you  smoke  like
[26:49] what  like 
 half  the  joints  a  quarter  of  the  joint 
 each  and  then  like 
 you  know  that's  it  that  that  to  me  is
[26:55] like  a  very  good  way  to  enjoy  drugs 
 and  you  know  no  one's  supposed  to  i'm 
 not  supposed  to  ever  tell  you  like  oh
[27:00] make  sure  you  do  drugs  honestly 
 if  you  do  them  like  that  like  you  have 
 my  blessing  in  terms  of  video  games
[27:05] movies  netflix  zero 
 zero  seconds  i  can  promise  you  there's
[27:11] zero  seconds  on  video  games  movies 
 netflix 
 a  fair  amount  on  youtube  obviously 
 because  that's  what  i've  allowed  myself
[27:16] but  recently  i've 
 just  drooled  over  myself  recently  i've 
 got  even  more
[27:21] pretty  like  not  exactly  strict  but  i've 
 just  lost  even  more  interest  in  youtube 
 and  so  i  maybe  watch  about  let's  say
[27:27] less  than  two  hours  per 
 week  honestly  probably  closer  to  about 
 one  hour 
 which  is  the  lowest  i've  ever  had  in  my
[27:33] in  my  life  since  i  started  watching 
 youtube 
 social  media  for  the  entire  year  has
[27:38] been  like  very  very  low 
 and  i  use  it  in  like  a  tactical  way
[27:43] where  i 
 i  see  it  as  like  an  online  portfolio 
 where  you  can  gain  something  from  it  you 
 can
[27:48] get  goals  you  can  get  like  business 
 partners  i  i  use  it  to  invite  people  to 
 join  my  podcast
[27:53] so  i  go  on  to  it  to  upload  a  picture  i 
 have  my  notifications  disabled  and  then 
 i  go  off 
 i  don't  use  it  like  i  don't  scroll  or
[27:59] anything  i  don't  look  at  people's  posts 
 i  upload  my  picture  and  i  go  snapchat  i 
 don't  even  have  it  anymore  i  literally
[28:04] deleted  my  fully  deleted  my  snapchat 
 account 
 facebook  obviously  no  one  uses  that 
 nofap
[28:09] nutted  twice  by  myself  in  the  last  12 
 months 
 both  times  was  like  a  conscious  decision
[28:15] i  won't 
 get  into  like  too  much  of  the  gory 
 details  but  both  times  it  was  like  i 
 wanted  to  not  in  the  sense  of  lust  but
[28:20] in  the  sense  of  like 
 practicality  and  like  learning  and  stuff 
 but  maybe  one  day  i'll  explain  why  i  did
[28:25] that  [ __ ] 
 in  terms  of  the  good  habits  exercise 
 like  here's  a  screenshot  i've  hit
[28:30] 300  and  something  workouts  in  the  last 
 year  like  300  and  something  workouts  in 
 the  last  year  if  i'm
[28:35] meditated  let's  say  i've 
 almost  every  single  day  let's  say  i  miss
[28:40] like  50  days  of  meditation  an  entire 
 year 
 which  is  sick  some  days  i  went  up  to  one
[28:45] hour  per  day 
 gratitude  journaling  almost  every  single 
 day  cold  showers  recently  i've  been
[28:50] doing  them  twice  per  day  bro 
 my  entire  life  has  gotten  better  it's 
 only  going  up  like  this  has  now
[28:55] created  the  foundation  of  me  being  a 
 high  performance  high  productivity
[29:00] person  which  i've  never  been  before  this 
 is  the  story  that  every  guy  says  like 
 you  know  i've  always  been  a  bad  student
[29:05] and  i've  never  been  productive  and  girls 
 wouldn't  hold  eye  contact  with  me  well 
 yeah 
 that's  that's  exactly  what  it  was  and
[29:10] honestly  i  am  a  student  now 
 what  i  realized  is  that  my  education 
 began  a  year  ago
[29:16] like  i  have  i've  never  truly  learned 
 anything  my  entire  life 
 apart  from  about  a  year  ago  when  i  have
[29:21] started  this  openly  detox 
 and  i  actually  have  the  attention  span 
 to  learn  now  like  through  school  it  was
[29:26] such 
 so  unfortunate  that  through  school  i 
 always  had  a  huge  level  of  mindlessness
[29:31] like  i  couldn't 
 concentrate  my  mind  was  just  talking 
 over  the  teacher  why  would  i  care  what 
 the  teacher's  saying  bro  the  teachers
[29:37] don't  even  like  me  they  keep  shouting  at 
 me  i'm  not  gonna  listen  to  them  i've  got 
 anxiety  bro  like  i  read  like  i'm
[29:42] actually  a  reader  i'm  actually  a  learner 
 i  take  courses  and  everything 
 and  every  single  time  i  read  my  name  i
[29:49] feel  like  part  of  a  secret  club 
 because  i've  never  been  like  this  i 
 always  thought  genuinely  thought  like 
 reading  was
[29:54] just  weird  nerds  and  everything  i  feel 
 like  i'm  part  of  a  secret  club  and  i 
 read  and  i  think  like
[29:59] i  can't  believe  people  don't  actually 
 want  this  knowledge  i  can't  believe 
 people  don't 
 don't  just  read  because  every  time  i
[30:05] read  i  get  better 
 i  read  something  about  marketing  and  my 
 business  just  gets  better  i  read 
 something  about  mental  health  or
[30:11] positive  thinking  and  now  i  just  feel 
 better  here 
 it  makes  me  feel  crazy  that  people  don't 
 read  but  to  be  honest  it  makes  me  feel
[30:16] crazy  that  people  don't  do  exactly  what 
 i  do  it  makes  me  feel 
 like  i  get  a  weird  feeling  when  i
[30:21] realized  like  oh  yeah  people  don't 
 meditate  like 
 how  like  how  is  that  even  back  that
[30:27] it  can't  even  be  possible  that  you  don't 
 meditate  that's  that's 
 just  weird  that's  so  strange  to  me  that
[30:33] people  don't  meditate  because 
 if  you  meditate  you'll  know  what  i'm 
 saying  but  if  you  don't  meditate  you're 
 a  spur  and  you  won't  even  understand
[30:38] what  i'm  saying  because  you'll  be  like 
 oh  but 
 i  i  tried  to  meditate  but  it  didn't  even 
 shut  up  just  keep  meditating  [ __ ]
[30:44] the  first  time  it  works  it's  not 
 supposed  to  work  straight  away  by  the 
 way  but  the  first  time  it  works
[30:50] you're  going  to  be  like  me  you're  going 
 to  be  making  these  videos  telling  people 
 like  you  have  to  meditate  please 
 like  try  to  meditate  this  is  how  you
[30:55] meditate  it's  just  that  people  try  it 
 twice  and  they're  like  oh 
 gee  where's  like  i  couldn't  clear  my
[31:00] mind  of  thoughts 
 i  couldn't  negate  the  damage  of  30  years
[31:05] of 
 of  technology  use  and  bad  stuff  gee 
 i  guess  it  doesn't  work  that's  like  a
[31:10] fact  i  eat  a  salad  and  be  like  oh 
 i  didn't  lose  50  pounds  oh  i  guess 
 healthy  eating  doesn't  work
[31:16] if  you're  interested  in  doing  a  dopamine 
 detox  maybe  you've  attempted  one  before 
 but  you  want  to  do  it 
 with  my  advice  or  like  the  way  that  i
[31:22] would  do  it  i  made  like  a  little 
 three-page 
 checklist  that  you  can  just  go  through 
 so  i've  got  like  20  points  that  you  can
[31:27] just  make  sure  that  you're  doing  it 
 you're  doing  it  all  right 
 it's  linked  in  the  description  you  get 
 it  for  free  it's  not  like  a  selling
[31:33] thing  or  anything  you  just  get  it  for 
 free  and 
 you  can  just  make  sure  that  you  you're 
 doing  your  dopamine  detox  right  if
[31:38] you're  somewhat  wealthy  and  you  want  my 
 one-to-one  help  with  this 
 it's  like  a  premium  service  you 
 literally  are  going  to  get  me  speaking
[31:43] to  you  like  five  times  per  week  like 
 i'm  gonna  call  you  like  almost  every 
 single  day  making  sure  that  you're  doing
[31:48] it  right  and  we're  gonna  go  through  all 
 the  issues  you  get  you're  getting 
 i  will  also  leave  below  my  dopamine
[31:53] detox  coaching 
 so  it's  not  exactly  for  most  people 
 because  it  is  like  high  ticket
[31:58] but  if  you  are  struggling  with  those  bad 
 habits  that  i've  mentioned  before  and 
 you  want  to  just  shortcut  how
[32:03] how  fast  you  can  just  start  taking 
 progress  and  how  fast  you can  be 
 productive  again
[32:08] then  i'll  link  that  below  and  you'll  get 
 my  one-to-one  help  i'll  be  calling  you 
 every  single  day  and  we'll  be  messaging 
 every  day  and
[32:14] you  can  read  the  page  and  you  can  just 
 see  it  for  yourself  all  of  that's  linked 
 below  if  you  watch  this  entire  video
[32:19] then  i'm  grateful  for  that  you  can  leave 
 a  comment  and  let  me  know  and 
 i'll  reply  to  you  and  we'll  have  a 
 little  conversation  no  one  will  know
[32:24] that  we're  actually  best  friends  now 
 scroll  down  right  now 
 click  on  the  subscribe  and  the  post
[32:29] notification  button  if  you've  watched 
 every  second  then  you  clearly  like  the 
 way  that  i  talk  and  you're  probably 
 gonna  like  the  rest  of  the  videos  i'll
[32:34] make 
 it's  all  about  just  not  being  a  normal 
 person  not  being  a  jeffrey  anymore
[32:39] and  trying  to  make  progress  to  be  the 
 adults  do  the  hard  work 
 even  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
"
FJ63cY-zLFI,"[00:00] Jeffrey  does  not 
 do  a  front  double  bicep  when  hamza's
[00:05] video  comes  on 
 I've  not  uploaded  onto  this  channel  for
[00:11] four  or  five  days  and  trust  me  I've 
 tried  to  record  this  very  video
[00:16] six  times  now 
 yesterday  I  had  a  version  of  this  video 
 premiered  and  then  I  went  onto  the
[00:22] YouTube  Studio  editor  and  trimmed  out  a 
 little  bit  then  I  went  to  sleep  and  then 
 I  woke  up  in  the  middle  of  the  night  and
[00:27] thought  wait  let  me  change  it  and  then  I 
 delete  the  video  then  I  made  a  message 
 saying  okay  sorry  you  know  it  was 
 premiered  but  like  I'm  gonna  change  it
[00:33] and  I  record  it  three  times  today  and  I 
 don't  even  know  like  what  truly  to  say 
 this  is  gonna  be  the  last  version
[00:40] I  think  we've  been 
 quite  successful  at  what  our  purpose  and
[00:46] Mission  was  here  to  spread  the  message 
 of  self-improvements
[00:52] and  of  course  not  everyone  in  the  entire 
 world  is  on  self-improvement  of  course
[00:57] not 
 we've  gone  a  really  good  number  of  men 
 delaying  gratification  understanding
[01:02] things  like  prioritizing  their  mental 
 health  and  getting  into  fitness  and 
 building  an  aesthetic  body  and
[01:07] meditating  and  I  think  we've  done  really 
 good  work  here 
 you  know  I've  been  on  this  journey  for
[01:13] over  two  years  and  I've  dedicated  myself 
 fully  to  this 
 every  single  day  I've  woke  up  and
[01:19] thought  about  spreading  this  message  of 
 self-improvements  every  shower  that  I've 
 taken  as  I  clean  my  body  I  think  about
[01:25] spreading  the  message  of 
 self-improvement  every  meal  that  I've 
 ate  I've  thought  about  spreading  the
[01:30] message  of  self-improvement  this  has 
 been  my  purpose  for  over  two  years 
 and  a  little  while  ago
[01:38] it  had 
 dissolved 
 I  completed  this  layer  of  my  purpose  and
[01:45] I'm  on  to  the  next  layer  I  continued 
 things 
 running  the  channel  making  the  videos  I
[01:50] continued  things  for  a  while  because  you 
 know  there's  still  a  game  to  doing  this
[01:55] thing  you  know  we're  not  completely  done 
 yet  there's  more  Mensa  help  there's  a 
 bigger  channel  that  we  could  you  know
[02:00] create  so  we  could  get  to  5  million  subs 
 and  even  more  we  could  make  more  money 
 in  all  this  but  the  truth  is
[02:05] I  genuinely  feel  like  I've  completed 
 this  layer  of  my  purpose  which  was
[02:10] totally  fixated  on  growing  the  channel 
 and  spreading  the  message  of 
 self-improvement  to  the  men  out  there
[02:21] I've  made  the  hard  decision  now  after 
 weighing  this  up  so  many  times  after 
 speaking  to  my  close  friend  who  helps  me
[02:27] make  these  decisions  Sam 
 I've  made  the  hard  decision  now
[02:32] to  stop  this  content  production  machine 
 that  we  had  here  this  huge  team  that  we
[02:38] had  of  seven  video  editors  and  Tick  Tock 
 guys  and  sales  guys  and  Twitter  guys  and
[02:46] we  had  over  a  dozen  employees 
 who  I  was  personally  paying  for  and  I
[02:51] pay  my  staff  very  well 
 and 
 I  let  every  single  one  go
[02:58] including  some  carbonates  and  my  best 
 friend  who's  worked  for  me  for  over  two
[03:03] years 
 I've  kept  my  personal  assistant  but 
 that's  a  kind  of  different  I  guess  but  I
[03:09] have  an  assistant  and  that's  it  I  don't 
 have  any  video  editors  or  anything  else 
 now 
 I  will  not  be  posting
[03:15] daily  videos  to  the  YouTube  channel 
 hamster's  daily  you  know  vids  anything
[03:20] like  that 
 my  new  layer  of  my  purpose  to  for  me  to
[03:28] focus  on 
 is  my  own  development  as  a  man
[03:34] I  no  longer  care  about  being  a  YouTuber 
 or  an  influencer  or  a  celebrity  or  a  man
[03:41] with  fame  or  anything  like  this  you  know 
 a  guy  with  a  million  subscribers
[03:46] genuine  I'm  not  saying  this  to  be  humble 
 or  anything  genuinely  I  just  don't  care 
 about  it  it's  like  this  is  what  happens
[03:52] when  you  really  focus  in  on  your  purpose 
 everything  else  just  seems  silly  and
[03:57] pointless  and  for  so  long  this  was  the 
 purpose  right  you  know  the  YouTube 
 channel  grow  the  channel  get  get  one
[04:02] million  subscribers  five  million 
 subscribers  grow  the  channel  more  views 
 more  what  time  more  subscribers  amazing
[04:07] yes  keep  growing  the  channel 
 now  it's  like  I  just  don't  even  think 
 about  it  at  all 
 what  my  purpose  is  now  is  my  own
[04:13] development  to  become  even  more  of  a  man 
 and  the  angle  that  it's  currently
[04:19] fixated  on 
 my  mind 
 my  heart  and  my  soul
[04:27] is  fighting  competition  martial  arts 
 that's  what  I'm  throwing  myself  into
[04:32] fully 
 I'm  trying  to  align  what  100  of  my  life
[04:37] into  that  endeavor  of  of  martial  arts 
 and  I  know  this  seems  like  a  really  big
[04:43] change  it's  like  wait  you  were  just  a 
 YouTuber  and  I  say  in  martial  arts  but 
 this  is  kind  of  like  how  a  masculine
[04:49] purpose  works 
 soon  I  will  have  some  kind  of  guide 
 explaining  this  and  first  I  should  tell
[04:55] you  that  what's  going  to  happen  to  this 
 channel  what's  gonna  happen  to  like  the 
 YouTube  is  that  I  don't  really  care
[05:00] about  the  YouTube  channel  I  certainly 
 don't  care  about  metrics  vanity
[05:05] followers  I  don't  care  at  all  likes 
 views  anything
[05:11] what  I  do  still  have  some  positive 
 feeling  about  is
[05:17] the  beauty  of  passing  knowledge  to  each 
 other
[05:22] I  no  longer  want  to  see  this  as  a 
 YouTube  channel  that  I'm  trying  to  grow 
 I  want  to  see  this  as  me  genuinely  just
[05:28] sitting  down  turning  the  camera  on  when 
 I  have  some  actually  like  really 
 valuable  knowledge  to  give  to  you  some
[05:34] really  valuable  some  purposeful  advice 
 to  give  you 
 and  then  I  disappear  again
[05:41] I'm  no  longer  going  to  be  posting  on  a 
 schedule  you  know  like  we  posted  every 
 single  day  at  the  same  time  I'm  not
[05:46] going  to  do  that  anymore  they  might  be 
 some  times  where  I  post  like  you  know 
 four  times  in  four  days  but  then  I  will
[05:53] probably  disappear  for  some  while  if  you 
 look  at  my  second  Channel  that's  kind  of 
 like  how  I  expect  things  to  be  I'm  not
[05:58] going  to  stick  to  a  schedule  I'm  not 
 going  to  see  myself  as  like  a  YouTuber 
 who  you  know  all  this  stuff  like  I  don't
[06:04] bro  like 
 I'm  not  a  YouTuber
[06:10] I'm  just 
 a  man  with  a  camera 
 I'm  a  man  who  is  going  out  there  into
[06:16] the  real  world  to  develop  himself  in  the 
 areas  that  a  man  should  and  when  it
[06:21] comes  up  when  it  is  important  to  do  so 
 I  will  try  and  pass  on  hopefully  some
[06:26] really  really  valuable  advice  and 
 knowledge  to  you 
 I  care  absolutely
[06:34] not  not  at  all 
 about  gaining  more  subscribers  and
[06:39] growing  the  the  community  growing  the 
 channel  at  all  I  don't  care  about  new 
 Subs  new  subscribers  new  followers  I
[06:46] don't  care 
 what  I  care  about 
 is  the  current  men
[06:51] for  so  long  I  spent  every  single  day 
 thinking  about  how  to  grow  the  channel
[06:57] the  movement  how  to  get  more  subscribers 
 I  don't  care  all  I  care  about  now  is
[07:02] actually  helping  you  the  current  man 
 more 
 and  I  think  to  do  that  I  actually  have
[07:09] to  prioritize  my  own  Journey  because 
 otherwise  I'll  just  be  repeating  the 
 same  messages  over  and  over  and  you  know
[07:14] I'd  just  be  like  rinsing  out  the  same 
 learning  lessons  that  I  had  from  a  year 
 ago  I  need  to  go  out  there  into  the  real
[07:19] world  and  experience  some  true  hardship 
 true  love
[07:25] true  discipline 
 I  need  to  get  these  experiences  myself
[07:30] formulate  them  into  a  real  valuable 
 message  through  contemplation  and
[07:35] Solitude  and  journaling  and  then  come 
 when  I  have  prepared  more  like  a 
 presentation  more  like  a  classroom
[07:41] speech  to  you 
 I  will  no  longer  be  feeding  into  the  the
[07:48] daily  content  machine  yep  you  know  just 
 make  another  video  because  your  YouTube
[07:53] channel  will  grow  more  if  you  do  and 
 yeah  make  them  really  edited  because 
 your  YouTube  channel  will  grow  more  if 
 you  do  and  then  yeah  do  this  thing  do
[07:59] this  thing  get  into  this  drama  do  this 
 YouTube  drama  I'm  not  gonna  do  any  of 
 that 
 all  I'm  focused  on  is  my  own
[08:06] developments  and  mostly  that's  coming 
 from  Combat  Sports  right  now  it's  coming 
 from  martial  arts  and  the  lessons  that
[08:12] come  from  that  and  every  now  and  then 
 when  it  is 
 required  important  necessary  valuable
[08:18] purposeful 
 I  will  sit  down  with  a 
 planned  message
[08:24] a  formal  planned  video 
 to  try  and  help  you
[08:30] I  know  that  this  seems  crazy 
 and  I  know  that  for  younger  hamzo  was 
 watching  this  Hamza  from  one  year  ago
[08:36] two  years  ago  he  would  have 
 been  shocked  he  would  have  said  to  me
[08:41] right  now  if  if  24  year  old  Hamza  23 
 year  old  Hamza  was  watching  me  and  you 
 know  he  had  been  putting  in  some  work
[08:46] into  YouTube  saw  that  we  were  on  one  and 
 a  half million  subscribers  and  then  saw 
 that  I  essentially  was  saying  that  I  was
[08:51] going  to  stop  to  like  do  something  more 
 fulfilling  he'd  think  that  I  was  crazy 
 why  not  just  keep  pushing  why  not  just
[08:56] get  to  5  million  subscribers  and  then 
 stop  if  you  want  to  but  like  why  you 
 just  get  five  minutes  you  know  just  keep 
 things  running  but  what  I  have  realized
[09:02] recently  is  that  if  you  want  to  become  a 
 truly  purposeful  man  if  you  truly  want
[09:07] to  become  masculine 
 you  need  to  align  as  much  of  your  life
[09:12] as  possible  to  this  layer  of  purpose 
 that  needs  to  be  peeled  back 
 there  are  so  many  things  that  I  could
[09:18] say  right  now  about  purpose 
 you  know  you've  heard  the  term  purpose 
 so  much  it  makes  me  like  I  can't  explain
[09:25] to  you  enough  like  it  makes  me  shiver 
 and  like  my  the  hair  stand  up  on  my  arms 
 of  my  understanding  of  purpose  like  my
[09:31] entire  life 
 is  changing  forever  because  of  this 
 understanding  that  I've  had  over
[09:37] literally  just  the  last  week  of  how  I 
 will  live  my  life  from  now  on  and  when  I 
 do  have  the  time  and  the  the  formulated
[09:44] message  to  do  that  which  will  be  a  video 
 soon 
 maybe  you'll  you'll  actually  understand 
 why  I'm  making  this  this  change
[09:52] to  a  lot  of  people  this  may  seem  like  a 
 huge  sacrifice  and  it  may  seem  as  as
[09:57] really  strange  you  add  a  big  YouTube 
 channel  some  level  of  Fame  and  clout  and
[10:03] you  know  you're  like  an  influencer 
 you're  like  an  internet  celebrity  wow 
 but  these  things
[10:09] that  you  know  a  lot  of  young  men  desire 
 these  things  can  be  really  nice 
 but  becoming  a  man  and  fulfilling  your
[10:16] mission  is  infinitely  more  fulfilling 
 infinitely  more
[10:22] freeing 
 a  fulfilled  and  peered  back  peeled  back
[10:28] this  layer  of  my  purpose  of  spreading 
 this  message  and  trying  to  get  over  a 
 million  men  on  on  self-improvement  a
[10:34] million  men  to  meditate 
 and  of  course  there's  there's  more  men
[10:39] out  there  who  still  need  this  help  but 
 it  no  longer  feels  like  that's  my  duty 
 anymore  to  spread  the  message  more  and
[10:45] more  and  more  and  more  it  feels  like  my 
 duty  now 
 is  my  own  developments
[10:52] is  me  as  a  man 
 I  must  disappear  without  this  this
[10:57] feeling  and  the  stress  and  this  pressure 
 of  you  know  oh  what  we've  got  to  blow 
 daily  so  you  can't  go  and  do  this  thing
[11:02] and  so  bro  no 
 no  daily  videos  no  pressure  from  from 
 like  YouTube  anymore
[11:09] sometimes  I  might  disappear  for  weeks 
 and  months  and  I  know  it  sounds  silly 
 but  like  sometimes  I  might  go  to  the
[11:14] mountains  and  stay  in  the  mountains  and 
 sometimes  I  might  go  stay  in  a  place 
 that  has  no  internet  in  the  wild  because
[11:20] these  are  the  things  that  I  feel  like  I 
 must  do  as  a  man 
 in  less  than  two  weeks
[11:25] I  move  and  I  will  go  and  stay  in  a 
 training  camp  a  fight  camp  where  I  will
[11:31] literally  stay  in  a  single  bed  in  the 
 gym  in  the  not  not  like  a  weightlifting
[11:36] gym  but  in  a  martial  arts  gym  where  I 
 will  train  for  hours  upon  hours  every 
 single  day  where  I  will  try  to  push
[11:43] myself  to  my  extreme  limits  push  past  my 
 limit  so  that  I  know  what  my  actual 
 limits  are  because  these  experiences  are
[11:51] deeply  important  for  men 
 and  I  will  not  hold  that  back  for  the
[11:57] the  gain  of  Internet  fame  or  anything 
 like  this
[12:03] sure  I  was  a  YouTuber  but 
 past  that
[12:10] I  am  a  man 
 and  becoming  more  masculine  as  a  man  is
[12:15] the  single  greatest  thing  that  you  can 
 do 
 it's  something  that  we  should  naturally 
 do  and  yet  in  this  modern  world  we  don't
[12:21] really  do  that 
 but  every  step  that  I  take  towards  a
[12:27] more  masculine  version  of  my  still  self 
 even  saying  that  sentence  every  step
[12:33] that  I  take  towards  a  more  masculine 
 version  of  myself  it's  like  I  feel  it
[12:38] inside  that  this  is  right  I'm  taking  a 
 step  away  from  like  internet  like  I'm
[12:44] not  a  celebrity  I'm  not  like  famous  for 
 anything  but  you  know  like  1.5  million 
 subscribers  is  pretty  good  I'm  taking  a
[12:50] step  away  from  that  and  a  step  literally 
 Into  the  Wild 
 and  I  can't  tell  you  like  how  right  that
[12:57] this  is  even  though  it  may  seem  crazy 
 because  if  younger  Amazon  was  watching 
 this  he  would  be  annoyed  he'd  be
[13:02] thinking  wait  what  like  just  get  to  five 
 million  Subs  get  to  10  million  Subs  okay 
 then  you  can  quit  if  you  want  but  no
[13:10] I've  let  everyone  go 
 all  of  my  team  members  everything
[13:15] all  my  video  editors  Sam  hibernate  I've 
 let  every  single  employee  go  apart  from
[13:21] my  my  personal  assistant 
 to  pursue  this  new  purpose  layer
[13:27] which  I  know  is  absolutely  like  crazy  to 
 think  but  this  this  is  somewhat  coming
[13:32] to  an  end 
 but
[13:37] I  don't  see  it  as  the  end 
 I  see  it  as  a  new  beginning
[13:47] so  from  your  perspective  what  you  will 
 see 
 is  that  you  will  no  longer  see  these
[13:52] daily  uploads  at  the  same  time  every 
 single  day  you  won't  see  that  you  won't 
 see  videos  with  animations  and  edits  and
[13:59] artistic  thumbnails  or  anything  like 
 that  you  will  just  see  plain  basic 
 occasional  sporadic  videos
[14:06] infrequent  videos  from  me  with  no 
 editing  literally  just  me  sitting  down
[14:12] for 
 half  an  hour  to  two  hours  explaining 
 some  kind  of  concept  that  I  think  would
[14:18] genuinely  change  your  life
[14:23] only  when  I  have  the  time  away  from  the 
 thing  that  is  actually  my  priority  which
[14:29] is  developing  myself  and  mostly  that's 
 coming  through  fighting  right  now
[14:37] we  have  done  absolutely  amazing  to 
 spread  this  message
[14:42] to  think  that  over  a  million  men  have 
 discovered  self-improvement  because  of
[14:47] this 
 and  you  should  feel  so  proud  of  yourself 
 for  being  part  of  that
[14:53] this  is  not  the  end 
 this  is  the  beginning
[15:00] I  didn't  realize  it  would 
 go  like  this  you  know  in  my  perception 
 of  things  it  just  seemed  clear  yeah  just
[15:06] keep  growing  the  channel  keep  growing 
 the  channel  keep  growing  the  channel 
 yeah  if  you  want  to  like  do  some 
 discipline  martial  arts  stuff  do  that
[15:11] one  hour  a  day  if  you  want  or  whatever 
 I  think  in  some  time  if  you  are
[15:18] uncertain  about  this  and  you're  thinking 
 wait  this  is  still  crazy  like  why  have 
 you  done  this  I  think  in  just  some  time
[15:25] you  may  begin  to  realize  maybe  you  click 
 on  a  random  video  I  make  two  weeks  from 
 now  and  you're  like  wait  this  actually
[15:32] may  have  been  one  of  the  best  things  he 
 could  do  for  himself  and  even  me  as  the
[15:37] viewer 
 I  just  want  to  help  you  as  much  as
[15:44] possible 
 I  no  longer  want  to  think  about  the 
 YouTube  views  and  retention  and  and
[15:50] average  view  duration  and  click-through 
 rate  and  all  these  like  YouTube  like 
 internet  social  media  terms  I  don't  want
[15:55] to  be  a  part  of  like  the  social  media 
 machine  I  am  simply  just  a  man  with  a
[16:00] camera 
 and  I  think  some  of  the  things  that  I
[16:05] have  to  say 
 are  going  to  be  extremely  educational
[16:10] the  next  video  that  will  be  posted  to 
 this  channel 
 will  be  the  last  video  of  the  old  kind
[16:17] the  animated  edited  Jeffrey  nadonna's 
 intro  the  seven  ways  to  make  girls  like 
 you  kind  of  thing  that  will  be  the  last
[16:23] video  I  would  happily  start  fresh  right 
 now  and  not  release  that  video  but  it 
 was  already  done  it  was  already  paid  for
[16:28] editor  it  has  done  the  work  the 
 thumbnail  guys  already  made  it  so  it's
[16:33] like  we  may  as  well  release  it  as  like  a 
 sort  of  celebration  for  the  final  video 
 that  we  can  all  come  out  come  together
[16:38] with  maybe  I'll  Premiere  it  we  can  all 
 come  together  and  say  okay  this  is  like 
 the  last  video  of  its  kind  on  the
[16:43] channel 
 and  then  after  that 
 you  will  not  see  consistent  uploads  from
[16:49] me 
 you  will  see 
 a  video  from  me  when  I  genuinely  think
[16:55] it  will  change  your  life  I  will 
 handshake  you  with  that  right  now  you 
 will  see  a  video  from  me  when  I
[17:00] genuinely  think  that  video  will  change 
 your  life  forever 
 and  the  one  that  I  do  have  a  plan  for
[17:06] which  maybe  you'll  see  within  a  week  or 
 two  weeks  is  a  guide  to  purpose
[17:12] I've  made  videos  on  purpose  before  but 
 my  understanding  of  it  has  increased
[17:17] dramatically  just  very  recently  and  so 
 it  will  be  like  a  full  one-hour  guide  no
[17:22] edits  no  Cuts  nothing  like  that  of  me 
 just  telling  you  from  my  current
[17:28] understanding  what  purpose  is  how  to 
 become  more  purposeful  as  a  man 
 and  like  I  can't
[17:34] right  now  I  don't  have  the  words  for  it 
 I  can't  explain  to  you  how  important
[17:40] purpose  is  I've  owned  like  you  know  you 
 always  like  I'll  save  this  for  the  video
[17:45] that  I'm  gonna  release  but  this  is  the 
 kind  of  content  that  I  will  now  want  to 
 create  when  the  time  is  right  the  kind
[17:51] of  thing  where  I'm  sat  here  thinking 
 come  on  how  do  I  word  this  in  the  right 
 way  so  that  it's  going  to  change  his 
 life  like  this  is  what  I  want  to  do  I
[17:58] want  to  focus  on  my  own  life  have  my  own 
 experiences  that  that  drops  my  jaw  that
[18:04] hurts  my  muscles  that  challenges  my  soul 
 and  my  mind
[18:09] and  then  when  the  time  is  right  and  the 
 message  is  formulated  so  well  multiple
[18:15] times  multiple  iterations  and  journals 
 and  plans  and  questions  then  I  will  come
[18:20] and  sit  down  to  the  camera  and  try  and 
 send  out  the  best  most  valuable  message
[18:25] that  I  can 
 one  last  time  I  will  handshake  you  and 
 say  that  I  will  produce  the  kind  of
[18:30] videos  which  I  genuinely  think  will 
 change  your  life  anytime  you  see  after 
 the  next  like  normal  the  oh  yeah  the
[18:36] seven  ways  uh  last  you  know  the  last 
 video  of  its  kind  after  that  the  videos 
 you  will  see  from  me  know  that  anytime
[18:43] you  see  that  on  your  YouTube  homepage 
 Hamza  has  genuinely  thought  to  himself 
 that  this  video  would  change  my  life
[18:48] let's  see  let's  see  Hamza  let's  see  if 
 it  actually  is 
 and  if  it's  not  and  if  it's  consistently
[18:54] not  I'm  telling  you  right  now  if  you 
 consistently  keep  seeing  videos  from  me 
 that  are  like  ah  whatever  I  don't  care
[19:00] totally  stop  watching  your  time  and  your 
 attention  is  so  incredibly  valuable
[19:06] what  I  want  for  the  future  of  any  kind 
 of  like  things  the  content  that  I
[19:11] produce  is  that  it  is  actually  a  fair 
 exchange  a  mutually  beneficial
[19:16] exchange  of  value  for  your  time  and 
 attention  in  exchange  for  the  education
[19:23] knowledge  and  advice 
 that  it's  actually  genuinely  a  fair
[19:28] trade 
 because  most  YouTube  videos  are  not  most 
 YouTube  videos  are  like  just  these  silly
[19:33] like  time  wasting  ones  that  you  eat 
 whilst  you  eat  your  you  watch  whilst  you 
 eat  your  dinner  like  oh  yeah
[19:38] you  know  all  these  silly  like  brain  like 
 brain  dead  videos  oh  yeah  I  guess  people
[19:43] guess  who  the  short  person  is  or  P  or 
 watch  this  dating  show  and  all  this
[19:48] silly  stuff  bro  your  time  and  attention 
 is  worth 
 a  lot  your  time  and  attention  as  a  man
[19:54] is  all  that  you  have  and  I  hope  that  any 
 single  time  that  you  see  a  video  from  me
[20:00] on  your  channel  which  what  on  your 
 homepage  which  will  not  be  off  then  it 
 will  not  be  daily  at  all  anytime  you  see
[20:05] this  random  video  from  me  you  will  think 
 to  yourself  you  know  what  Hamza  has 
 consistently  proven  to  himself  since 
 he's  made  this  change  that  he  will
[20:12] actually  give  me  something  that  is  worth 
 my  time  and  attention  when  I  sit  down 
 and  watch  his  new  videos  fully  and  so  I
[20:18] will  click  once  more  because  he  has 
 actually  built  up  this  reputation  for 
 this  and  that  means  if  you  hold  me  to
[20:24] the  standard  that  means  that  before  I 
 sit  down  and  press  record  I  will 
 genuinely  think  to  myself  okay  how  do  I
[20:29] change  this  person's  life  because  of 
 this  knowledge  is  it  actually 
 life-changing  or  is  it  just  because  I 
 want  to  upload  a  video  and  you  know  get
[20:35] some  like  YouTube  likes  because  I  don't 
 care  about  that  anymore
[20:45] this  is  not  the  end 
 this  is  the  beginning
[20:52] one  final  thing  I  will  say 
 all  of  the  the  staff  my  team  members
[20:58] that  I've  let  go 
 there  was  not  a  single  person  who  I  let 
 go  because  of  poor  performance  or
[21:04] anything  like  that  I  let  everyone  go 
 because  this  is  like  it's  something  I 
 had  to  do  for  this  new  start  I  didn't
[21:09] need  anyone  anymore  for  what  I  plan  to 
 do  I  wanted  this  specifically  to  be  like 
 this  unfiltered  unedited  videos  I  don't
[21:15] need  video  editors  I  don't  need  a 
 thumbnail  guy  a  script  guy  anything  like 
 that  so  I've  let  everyone  go  but  there's
[21:20] one  final  thing  just  quickly  I  will  say 
 that  if  you  are  a  YouTuber  or  someone 
 who  may  be  interested  in  hiring  my
[21:26] ex-team  members  please  keep  an  eye  out 
 on  my  YouTube  Community  post  I'm  gonna
[21:31] do  my  best  to  put  in  some  effort  to  try 
 and  help  my  my  recent  staff  find  new
[21:37] clients  and  stuff  so  I  gave  everyone 
 like  Severance  packages  and  everything  I 
 gave  everyone  essentially  like  free
[21:42] money  just  out  of  like  the  history  that 
 they've  had  working  for  me 
 but  I  also  want  to  help  every  video
[21:47] editor  I  have  the  thumbnail  guy  mapper 
 and  stuff  I  want  to  help  every  one  of 
 them  find  like  new  work  as  soon  as
[21:53] possible  so  that  they  can  transition 
 into  like  new  places  as  well  that's 
 something  that  I  think  is  is  um just
[21:58] important  to  do  it's  nice  to  do  for  the 
 guys  who've  helped  this  movement  so  much 
 so  if  you  are  like  maybe  a  YouTuber  or
[22:03] maybe  if  you  will  have  some  kind  of  use 
 for  a  video  editor  you  want  to  employ 
 one  of  my  guys  who  no  longer  work  for  me
[22:08] please  keep  an  eye  out  on  this  main 
 Channel's  YouTube  Community  post  where  I
[22:13] will  put  details  about  each  and  every 
 staff  member  that  I  let  go  their  email
[22:18] Instagram  their  portfolio  things  like 
 that  if  you  are  interested  in 
 potentially  hiring  them  and  just  see
[22:24] what  that  happens  with  that  I  really 
 want  to  help  them  just  like  kind  of  hit 
 the  ground  running  with  a  new 
 opportunity  because  every  guy  that  I've
[22:30] had  on  my  team  has  been  there  for  a 
 little  while  now  and  they've  been  very 
 very  good
[22:35] that's  all  I  have  to  say  for  today 
 do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah
"
kgQtPKMa6cg,"[00:00] jeffrey  is  happy  exactly  how  he  is 
 i'm  fine  video  games  aren't  even  that 
 bad  for  you  he  doesn't  realize  just  how
[00:06] much  time  he's  wasting  on  the  modern 
 addictions  he  says  that  video  games 
 aren't  that  bad  for  you  that  he  only
[00:11] plays  for  one  hour  a  day  but  that's  not 
 true  every  video  gamer  who  says  that  he 
 only  plays  for  one  hour  a  day  is  a  big 
 fat  stinky  liar  oh  they  pissed  me  off
[00:18] but  after  a  full  day  of  work  hamza  i 
 worked  for  someone  shut  the  [ __ ]  up
[00:23] oh  you  crack  it  they  pissed  me  off  me 
 because  i  used  to  use  that  exact  same 
 excuse  as  well  it's  just  cringe  you're
[00:28] obviously  not  playing  for  an  hour  bro  by 
 the  time  you've  like  gotten  into  a 
 [ __ ]  like  league  of  legends  game  you
[00:33] literally  have  less  time  to  finish  the 
 game 
 you're  just  lying  to  yourself  and  you 
 know  what  the  reason  why  so  many  [ __ ]
[00:39] video  gamers  say  this  [ __ ]  like  oh 
 but  i  only  play  for  one  hour  a  day  after 
 i  do  all  of  my  good  chores  and  it's
[00:44] because  they  know  that  they  think  open 
 they  know  that  they're  talking  about  bad 
 habit  here  and  that's  why  they  have  to 
 tell  you  because  if  they  truly  thought
[00:50] it  wasn't  bad  for  you  they  wouldn't  have 
 to  like  [ __ ]  tell  you  like  i  only 
 played  for  one  hour 
 oh  yeah  jeffrey
[00:56] just  went  on  our  side  around  i  can 
 remember  the  exact  moment  that  my  life 
 changed  in  may  2020  i  gave  up  all  of  my
[01:03] addictions  i  used  to  smoke  weed  all  day 
 every  day  and  that  is  not  an 
 exaggeration  i  used  to  wake  up  grab  the
[01:09] [ __ ]  crack  pipe  put  weed  into  it 
 blaze  that  [ __ ]  up  and  continue  smoking 
 throughout  the  entire  [ __ ]  day  i
[01:15] would  get  high  before  work  and  get  high 
 after  work  i'd  get  high  before  going  to 
 sleep  and  get  high  after  waking  up  from
[01:20] sleep  i  was  playing  a  fair  amount  of 
 video  games  i  just  spent  a  lot  of  time 
 on  youtube  and  just  watching  random
[01:25] shows  on  netflix  on  tv  i'd  scroll  on 
 social  media  on  reddit  especially  i'd
[01:30] spend  like  three  hours  a  day  on  reddit 
 my  entire  day  revolved  around  consuming 
 and  it  felt  uncontrollable  in  my  mind  i
[01:37] would  get  the  thoughts  that  i  wanted  to 
 stop  but  i  didn't  want  to  do  this 
 [ __ ]  anymore  that  i  didn't  want  to 
 continue  smoking  weed  i  couldn't  even
[01:42] afford  it  i  was  done  with  spending  three 
 hours  a  day  on  reddit  i  felt  like  after 
 fapping  but  day  in  and  day  out  i  kept  on
[01:48] doing  the  same  things  if  you  can  relate 
 to  what  i'm  saying  i  hope  this  video  can 
 help  you  adorn
[01:53] adonis  lives  like  an  old-school  man  like 
 a  caveman  he  drastically  limits  his
[01:58] technology  use  instead  adonis  prefers  to 
 be  out  in  nature  amongst  animals  seeing
[02:03] the  sun  rise  and  the  sun  sets  spending 
 time  with  his  loved  ones  it  isn't 
 adonis's  preference  to  be  sat  hunkered
[02:09] down  with  poor  posture  looking  at  his 
 screen  all  day  he  knows  that  that  causes 
 sickness  and  so  adonis  looks  around  so
[02:15] confused  at  the  majority  of  people  who 
 spend  all  their  time  like  that  gather 
 around  boys  we've  got  a
[02:22] the  topic  of  this  video  is  simple  enough 
 to  say  okay  you  know  stop  spending  time 
 on  youtube  and  reddit  and  social  media
[02:27] but  i  think  it  goes  so  much  deeper  than 
 that  because  these  things  are  totally 
 ingrained  in  our  lives  and  we  don't  even
[02:33] realize  how  detrimental  it  is  we  are  in 
 the  most  safest  the  best  time  to  have
[02:38] ever  existed  and  yet  the  majority  of  us 
 are  unhappy  depressed  and  anxious  and  i
[02:43] think  it's  almost  totally  down  to  the 
 fact  that  our  lives  are  just  based  on 
 this  virtue  of  reality  that  we  spend  so
[02:48] many  hours  looking  at  screens  when  was 
 the  last  time  that  you  touched  grass  i 
 know  that  that  sounds  like  a  silly
[02:53] question  but  just  answer  it  truthfully 
 when  was  the  last  time  that  you  touched 
 grass  when  was  the last  time  that  you 
 went  on  a  walk  and  you  picked  like  some
[02:59] random  leaf  and  you  just  kind  of  instead 
 of  mindlessly  doing  it  you  actually 
 looked  at  the  leaf  and  you're  like  oh 
 this  is this  is  a  nice  leaf  when  was  the
[03:04] last  time  that  you  actually  stepped  on  a 
 crunchy  leaf  on  the  floor  i'm  telling 
 you  right  now  that  all  of  that  stuff  all
[03:09] that  natural  behavior  that  we  used  to  do 
 as  a  child  like  you  know  stepping  inside 
 of  a  puddle  that  exactly  correlates  to
[03:15] how  happy  you  are  and  apart  from 
 accidentally  and  getting  pissed  off  the 
 last  time  you  jumped  in  a  puddle  was
[03:20] probably  10  years  ago  i  know  that  this 
 sounds  like  bro  science  but  i'm  telling 
 you  that  this  is  the  truth  your 
 happiness  correlates  with  how  much  you
[03:25] jump  into  puddles 
 and  no  one  jumps  into  puddles  anymore 
 because  why  it would  be  it's  weird  just
[03:30] in  case  someone  records  us  and  so  we'll 
 spend  all  of  our  time  just  looking  at 
 the  screen  like  you  are  right  now  you 
 think  you're  relating  to  me  and  you
[03:36] think  that  oh  yeah  he's  onto  something 
 like  people  are  so  so  [ __ ]  up  but  i'm 
 talking  to  you  you're  still  watching  me 
 through  a  [ __ ]  screen  when  i  made
[03:41] this  youtube  channel  the  original 
 purpose  that  i  had  which  eventually  i 
 actually  went  on  to  like  somewhat  quit
[03:46] this  youtube  no  one  actually  knows  this 
 apart  from  one  person  actually  kind  of 
 quit  this  youtube  channel  after  it  like
[03:51] popped  off  and  everything  because  the 
 one  purpose  i  had  with  this  channel  was 
 to  spread  specifically  the  knowledge  of
[03:56] dopamine  detoxing  of  stopping  those  bad 
 habits  of  drastically  reducing  how  long 
 we  spent  on  our  screens  and  there  was  a
[04:02] moment  where  i  felt  like  i  kind  of 
 ticked  it  off  i  told  you  everything  i 
 knew  about  reducing  your  content 
 consumption  and  so  by  the  time  we  hit
[04:07] like  30  000  subscribers  and  you  know  it 
 was  all  popping  off  unless  you  called 
 the  video  editor  sam  and  told  them  like
[04:12] yeah  i'm  like  bro  i'm  done  not  even  in  a 
 sad  way  i  literally  feel  like  i've 
 fulfilled  the  purpose  like  that's  as 
 much  as  i  can  say  now  i  can  continue
[04:18] making  videos  like  you  know  it's  a 
 business  and  everyone's  going  to  be 
 proud  of  me  because  i'm  just  making  so 
 much  money  and  he's  so  famous  and  stuff
[04:23] and  he's  you  know  he's  helping  the 
 family  but  it's  like  i'm  contributing  to 
 the  problem  i  have  to  take  a  [ __ ]  hit 
 to  like  my  moral  system  my  like  soul  by
[04:30] sometimes  making  these  videos  and 
 thinking  like  i'm  literally  contributing 
 to  some  random  kids  internet  addiction
[04:35] hopefully  there's  like  a  net  gain  that 
 the  videos  i  make  are  hopefully  a 
 positive  influence  and  sometimes  you
[04:40] know  people  comment  and  they  say  like  oh 
 yeah  hamza  really  helped  me  and  stuff 
 and  so  that  kind  of  like  reminds  me  that 
 yeah  maybe  i  am  doing  good  work  here  but
[04:46] the  issue  still  stands  we  are  totally 
 surrounded  with  technology  and  it  isn't 
 really  that  good  for  us  the  issue  is
[04:52] that  you  are  just  one  person  one  young 
 man  and  quite  frankly  you're  not  that 
 great  you're  not  that  smart  you're  not
[04:57] that  disciplined  you  know  you're  working 
 on  it  fair  enough  fantastic  but  you're 
 not  at  the  ultimate  point  right  you're 
 not  at  the  you  know  the  10  out  of  10
[05:03] discipline  right  you  are  alone  against 
 an  army  against  hundreds  of  thousands  of
[05:08] scientists  and  data  analysts  and 
 software  developers  smart  [ __ ] 
 it's  you  versus  them  they  have  found  the
[05:14] exact  like  the  exact  every  single  minute 
 detail  to  keep  you  hooked  because  that's
[05:19] how  they  make  money  that's  just 
 technology  that's  the  social  media  but 
 even  with  the  food  that  we  consume
[05:24] you're  again  you're  against  hundreds  of 
 thousands  of  nutritionists  like  these 
 [ __ ]  evil  people  who  are  modifying
[05:30] food  for  it  to  be  so  addictive  that 
 you're  literally  killing  yourself  whilst 
 eating  it  you're  just  one  young  man
[05:35] against  maybe  a  million  scientists  the 
 fact  that  you're  making  any  progress 
 right  now  is  [ __ ]  remarkable  when  you
[05:41] really  think  of  it  like  this  i  want  you 
 to  like  sit  up  straight  put  your 
 shoulders  back  your  chest  out  high  and
[05:46] think  like  [ __ ]  those  scientists  broke 
 those  [ __ ]  nerds  destroy  them  bro 
 they  are  your  competition  like  they  are
[05:52] the  enemy  the  fact  that  you're  making 
 any  progress  right  now  is  insane  it's
[05:57] unimaginable  you  aren't  supposed  to  be 
 able  to  make  the  progress  that  we  are 
 making  to  take  a  step  back  from  the
[06:02] modern  addictions  to  improve  your  diet 
 it's  not  supposed  to  be  possible  it  is 
 literally  not  supposed  to  be  possible  to
[06:07] be  on  self-improvement  with  what  we  are 
 against  so  again  if  you've  made  any 
 progress  you  should  be  so  proud  and
[06:13] grateful  for  yourself  it  started  with  a 
 sense  of  anger  and  hatred  for  me  and  i
[06:18] think  that's  really  important  because 
 i've  seen  the  personality  differences  of 
 the  people  who  try  to  take  control  of
[06:23] their  lives  and  there's  usually  two 
 there's  like  the  depressed  quite  feeble 
 sad  guy  who's  like  oh  perhaps  i'm
[06:28] spending  too  long  on  youtube  then 
 there's  the  guy  who's  aggressive  about 
 it  [ __ ]  youtube  [ __ ]  the  drugs  that  i'm
[06:33] taking  and  the  junk  food  this  is  the  guy 
 who  makes  progress  you  need  like  a  bit 
 of  aggression  to  take  back  control  over
[06:39] your  life  you  can't  do  this  passively 
 you  can't  be  like  one  of  those  people 
 who  like  oh  like  my  goal  is  to  only
[06:44] watch  one  hour  of  youtuber  that  you  have 
 to  hate  that  for  me  personally  i 
 couldn't  do  the  wishy-washy  modern  day
[06:49] [ __ ]  of  like  you  know  trying  to 
 reduce  it  i  had  to  eliminate  this  i  tell 
 this  story  all  the  time  and  i  really
[06:54] hope  you  can  take  how  significant  it  is 
 for  me  i  had  to  literally  move  cities  i 
 had  to  break  up  with  my  girlfriend  to
[06:59] move  back  into  my  parents  house  so  that 
 i  didn't  do  these  bad  habits  because 
 that  was  literally  like  the  new  chapter
[07:04] of  my  life  i  had  literally  for  almost  an 
 entire  year  or  visualize  exactly  how  it 
 would  grow  that  i  would  move  back  and  i
[07:10] literally  saw  myself  like  running  around 
 my  town  here  and  like  use  like  doing 
 outdoor  workouts  meditating  journaling
[07:15] and  just  staying  away  from  the  screen 
 you  can  do  all  the  small  level  tactics 
 that  you  want  every  other  youtuber  is
[07:20] going to  tell  you  the  same  advice  get 
 one  of  the  youtube  blockers  and  you  can 
 install  the  google  chrome
[07:26] i'm  telling  you  right  now  that  every 
 person  who's  got  one  of  those  youtube 
 blockers  has  failed  their  goal  they 
 still  go  onto  youtube  that's  the  dumbass
[07:31] who  goes  to  the  party  and  says  oh  no 
 thanks  i'm  trying  to  quit  drinking 
 you're  a  coward  you're  a  [ __ ]  you're 
 not  gonna  make  progress  you're  not
[07:37] trying  to  quit  drinking  you  don't  drink 
 update  your  self-image  you  are  not 
 trying  to  reduce  youtube  you're  not
[07:42] trying  to  stop  smoking  or  anything  you 
 don't  smoke  you  don't  watch  youtube 
 anymore  whatever  your  goal  is  ingrain  it
[07:48] into  your  self-image  right  now  there  is 
 no  more  trying  there's  not  uh  you  know 
 this  year  my  new  years  like  we  make  fun
[07:54] of  people  who  make  new  year's 
 resolutions  yeah  most  of  us  on 
 self-improvement  are  the  exact  same  as 
 them  that  fat  42  year  old  karen  who
[08:00] wants  to  like  you  know  this  is  the  year 
 that  she's  gonna  get  into  shape  we  make 
 fun  of  her  we  always  like  heartlessly 
 make  fun  of  those  people  because  we  say
[08:05] oh  you  know  they're  gonna  go  to  the  gym 
 for  three  days  they're  gonna  quit  it's 
 the  exact  same  for  us  young  dumbasses 
 who  think  we're  so  great  because  you're
[08:10] going  about  it  in  the  coward  way  but 
 you're  not  trying  to  do  like  a  big 
 change  you're  not  trying  to  have  like  a
[08:15] level  of  accountability  to  tell  everyone 
 again  i  don't  drink  because  you  fear 
 that  you  will  fail  i  don't  play  video
[08:20] games  anymore  when  i  moved  back  home  i 
 made  videos  on  youtube  where  i  said  that 
 so  many  times  to  the  point  that  every
[08:25] single  time  i  got  like  a  bit  of  a 
 feeling  to  play  i  literally  got  like  a 
 sense  of  guilt  and  i  was  like  no  no
[08:30] because  like  my  50  subscribers  my  200 
 subscribers  will  find  out  and  i  wouldn't 
 be  able  to  like  truthfully  tell  them
[08:35] that  i  have  not  played  one  second  in 
 video  games  for  like  one  and  a  half 
 years  not  one  second  and  i'm  not  like 
 you  know  some  special  guy  who  like  was
[08:41] never  really  into  video  games  i  was  a 
 video  gamer  i  had  more  than  10  000  hours 
 in  like  the  big  games  that  i  used  to 
 play  runescape  minecraft  league  of
[08:47] legends  i  have  not  played  one  second  in 
 a  long  time  the  same  with  movies  i  have 
 not  watched  one  second  of  a  movie  with
[08:52] these  modern  addictions  you  can't  do 
 this  wishy-washy  [ __ ]  of  just  trying 
 to  like  you  know  just  trying  to  reduce
[08:57] it  it's  like  the  equivalent  of  that 
 dumbass  who  sounds  like  oh  i  don't  want 
 to  get  too  big  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  but  i 
 just  want  to  get  a little  bit  toned  you
[09:03] know  my  shoulders  still  shut  up  no  you 
 know  no  you  know  you're  literally  not 
 going  to  get  that  goal  then  because 
 you're  too  much  of  a  [ __ ]  coward  to
[09:08] set  a  good  goal  i  just  wanna  get  it  no 
 you  don't 
 go  if  you  set  your  goal  to  be  so  [ __ ] 
 just  trashed  just  so  unrewarding  i  just
[09:15] want  to  get  toned  shoulders  are  like  oh 
 i  just  want  to  reduce  my  my  we  didn't 
 take  us  shut  up  you  quit  weed  you  quit
[09:20] sugar  dumbass 
 how  do  you  take  back  control  of  your 
 life  i  remember  for  the  first  couple  of
[09:26] weeks  i  technically  would  have  failed  by 
 everyone  else's  standards  in  the  sense 
 that  i  would  spend  too  much  time  on
[09:31] youtube  so  i  said  you  know i  was  going 
 to  be  on  a  dopamine  detox  i  wasn't  going 
 to  do  the  bad  habits  but  i  still  spent 
 like  an  hour  a  night  on  youtube  and  i'm
[09:37] so  so  glad  that  i  had  this  positive 
 mindset  thinking  that  yeah  like  this  is 
 how  i'm  gonna  start  but  a  month  from  now
[09:43] it  would  be  less  than  an  hour  a  day  and 
 five  months  from  then  it  might  be  just  a 
 couple  hours  per  week  and  a  couple  of 
 months  more  from  then  it  might  be  like
[09:49] two  hours  a  week  you  have  to  have  like 
 that  level  of  positive  mindset  to  think 
 it's  kind  of  like  progressive  overload
[09:54] set  the  big  goal  the  big  intention 
 update  your  self-image  right  now  but 
 also  understand  that  you  won't  be  able 
 to  lift  that  heaviest  weight  you  won't
[10:00] be  able  to  completely  eliminate  all  your 
 addictions  your  intention  should  be  but 
 you  probably  won't  after  a  certain
[10:05] amount  of  time  you'll  find  yourself 
 lighting  up  the  [ __ ]  crack  pipe  again 
 you  find  yourself  browsing  the  hub  again 
 that's  okay  if  you  consider  that  as
[10:11] failure  and  you  said  oh  but  i  failed  my 
 goal  now  then  you're  a  little  that's 
 kind  of  like  going  to  the  gym  trying  to
[10:16] get  more  stronger  and  then  there's  one 
 time  when  you  fail  the  rep  you  fail  the 
 set  and  you  have  to  like  you  know  drag
[10:21] the  barbell  off  you  imagine  if  a  guy  did 
 that  he  failed  bench  press  and  he  was 
 like  oh  like  uh  i  failed  the  set  so  um
[10:26] guess  i  have  to  quit  weightlifting  now 
 that's  what  so  many  guys  do  on  nofap 
 that's  what  so  many  guys  do  when  they 
 set  some  kind  of  goal  is  to do  some
[10:31] bulky  little  nofap  challenge  90  day 
 challenge  or  something  that  doesn't  even 
 work  and  then  once  they  do  fail
[10:38] and  you  know  they  have  a  little  setback 
 they  just  quit  because  they  weren't  able 
 to  complete  the  original  goal  that  they
[10:43] set  them  this  is  not  a  [ __ ]  challenge 
 this  is  not  something  you  do  for  like  90 
 days  like  this  is  for  life  this  is  your
[10:48] new  identity  this  is  your  new  lifestyle
[10:53] do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it
"
qo8dnwsCN1A,"[00:00] Jeffrey  slowly  opens  his  crush  the  eyes 
 he  can  already  feel  the  throbbing  pain 
 in  his  head  from  all  the  junk  food  he
[00:06] ate  last  night  he  checks  his  phone  it's 
 three  in  the  afternoon  he's  got 
 assignments  to  hand  in  tomorrow  but  what
[00:12] do  you  think  Jeffrey  does  he  opens  up 
 Tick  Tock  and  starts  scrolling  I'll  just
[00:17] look  at  a  couple  of  videos  and  then  I'll 
 go  brush  my  teeth  thanks  Jeffrey  two 
 hours  later  and  he's  still  scrolling  and
[00:23] by  the  time  that  he  gets  up  there's  only 
 a  couple  hours  left  of  daylight  Adonis
[00:28] Adonis  is  awake  before  the  birds  have 
 even  began  to  sing  he  understands  that 
 for  men  life  is  a  race  and  if  you  want
[00:35] to  win  this  race  you  have  to  start 
 before  everyone  else  Adonis  doesn't 
 check  his  phone  he  doesn't  even  know 
 what  Tick  Tock  is  whilst  Jeffrey  is
[00:41] staggering  home  from  his  night  out 
 Adonis  is  on  his  morning  run  by  the  time 
 Jeffrey  wakes  up  Adonis  has  already  been
[00:46] to  the  gym  and  finished  his  work  for  the 
 day  this  is  how  all  young  men  should
[00:51] live  myself  and  a  lot  of  other  guys  my 
 age  some  25  years  old  are  so  grateful
[00:57] that  we've  never  actually  used  Tick  Tock 
 properly  but  this  video  was  for  those 
 younger  men  who  may  have  a  tick  tock
[01:02] addiction  and  you  know  this  seems  like  a 
 little  wishy-washy  video  just  talking  oh 
 you  know  tick  tock's  about  that  but  as
[01:07] we  get  further  and  further  into  our 
 understanding  of  what  Tick  Tock  actually 
 is  and  how  it  truly  ruins  your  life  you
[01:12] start  to  realize  that  this  is  a  lot  more 
 serious  than  we  think  it  is  because  on 
 the  surface  Tick  Tock  seems  like  a
[01:17] harmless  app  it's  just  you  know  social 
 media  it's  just  a  bit  of  fun  you  can  see 
 videos  of  people  like  dancing  or  doing
[01:22] some  goofy  pranks  yeah  it's  it's  okay 
 isn't  it  but  the  issue  is  that  Tick  Tock 
 has  been  meticulously  designed  to  addict
[01:28] you  deciphon  away  the  most  important 
 thing  that  they  can  take  away  from  you 
 which  is  your  attention  you  open  the  app
[01:34] harmlessly  you  know  just  a  quick  two 
 minutes  of  fun  you  start  scrolling  the 
 videos  are  only  15  seconds  long  so  you
[01:39] surely  can't  spend  too  much  time  on  here 
 right  and  then  hours  pass  by  and  did  you 
 know  that  the  average  Tick-Tock  user  is
[01:45] on  Tick  Tock  five  times  more  than  the 
 average  YouTube  user  uses  YouTube  five
[01:51] times  more  YouTube's  been  around  for 
 more  than  a  decade  and  it's  amassed 
 about  2  billion  users  tick  tock's  been
[01:57] around  for  about  two  years  and  it's  got 
 about  half  that  of 
 is  growing  much  faster  there's  a  key  to
[02:03] tick  tock's  ability  to  hook  your 
 attention  and  just  take  away  hours  per 
 day  and  it's  through  the  use  of
[02:09] unpredictable  rewards  now  you've 
 probably  heard  about  people  talking 
 about  dopamine  recently  haven't  you  like
[02:14] dopamine  detox  and  Andrew  huberman  is 
 like  a  scientist  who  talks  about 
 dopamine  a  lot  more  and  more  people  are
[02:19] talking  about  dopamine  and  I'm  not  like 
 some  scientist  so  I'll  just  give  you  a 
 very  simple  explanation  essentially 
 dopamine  is  kind  of  like  motivation  it's
[02:25] not  so  much  the  enjoyment  of  something 
 it's  more  so  a  pleasurable  feeling  when 
 you're  about  to  get  that  thing  when
[02:30] you're  on  pursuit  of  that  thing  does 
 that  make  sense  so  you  don't  actually 
 get  that  much  dopamine  when  you  eat  the
[02:35] junk  food  you  get  dopamine  when  you  know 
 you're  gonna  eat  the  junk  food  five 
 minutes  from  now  dopamine  is  all  about
[02:40] the  motivation  so  go  and  do  the  thing 
 and  this  is  how  Tech  talk  absolutely 
 hooks  addicts  manipulates  your  dopamine
[02:47] receptors  because  it's  not  about  you 
 just  seeing  the  best  kind  of  video  it's 
 about  the  search  for  the  best  video  it's
[02:53] about  the  search  for  the  next  video  that 
 makes  you  breathe  from  your  nose 
 just  scrolling  and  scrolling  and
[02:58] scrolling  and  your  dopamine's  just 
 hyperactive  because  you  never  know  the 
 next  scroll  might  be  really  really 
 interesting  if  you've  ever  studied
[03:03] psychology  you  might  know  that  there's  a 
 very  famous  experiment  that  found  this
[03:08] out  like  decades  ago  and  this  was  called 
 the  Skinner  rat  box  BF  Skinner  is  a  very 
 famous  psychologist  mostly  because  of
[03:14] this  experiment  BF  Skinner  ran  an 
 experiment  where  he  put  rats  inside  of  a 
 box  Skinner  observed  that  the  animals
[03:19] responded  most  to  random  rewards  the 
 mice  or  rats  or  pigeons  would  press  a
[03:24] lever  and  sometimes  they  get  a  small 
 treat  other  times  a  large  treat  and 
 other  times  nothing  at  all  unlike  the
[03:30] mice  that  received  the  same  treat  every 
 single  time  the  mice  that  receive 
 variable  rewards  seem  to  press  the  lever
[03:35] compulsively  this  is  the  key  to  tiktok's 
 addiction  strategy  you  couple  that
[03:40] strategy  with  the  fact  that  Tinder  has 
 an  endless  scroll  like  you  can't  get  to 
 the  bottom  you  just  keep  scrolling  and
[03:45] scrolling  and  scrolling  it's  almost  like 
 it's  psychological  warfare  because  you 
 see  that  the  creators  of  tiktok  know
[03:51] what  they  were  doing  when  they  created  a 
 platform  like  this  they  know  that  this 
 would  addict  you  severely  and  that
[03:56] there's  such  level  of  friction  to  stop 
 the  pursuit  of  the  next  dopamine-filled 
 Tick  Tock  to  close  the  app  is  actually
[04:02] kind  of  difficult  it's  not  uncommon  for 
 us  to  hear  of  some  young  guys  who  are 
 spending  more  than  one  to  two  to  three
[04:07] hours  per  day  on  Tick  Tock  and  there's 
 literally  some  guys  who  are  more  on  the 
 extreme  side  five  six  seven  eight  hours 
 a  day  I  can  already  sense  that  there
[04:13] might  be  some  people  watching  this  who 
 may  have  fallen  victim  to  like  the 
 Jeffrey  propaganda  that's  come  from
[04:18] these  companies  and  you  might  literally 
 have  like  this  conscious  thought  right 
 now  thinking  oh  but  like  you  know  it's 
 not  that  bad  like  I  only  do  it  a  little
[04:23] bit  I  only  do  it  like  one  hour  a  day  or 
 two  hours  so  you  know  like  everyone  else 
 in  my  school  uses  it  you've  got  to
[04:28] understand  having  a  thought  like  that 
 actually  shows  that  you  don't  have  much 
 respect  for  yourself  because  as  a  young
[04:33] man  you  must  know  this  your  time  your 
 attention  your  ability  to  do  work  is 
 worth  so  much  if  you  expect  to  become
[04:40] successful  in  the  future  which  I  just 
 want  you  to  ask  yourself  right  now  you 
 might  have  never  actually  asked  yourself 
 this  question  so  ask  yourself  totally
[04:45] with  honestly  do  I  expect  to  become 
 successful  in  the  future  more  than  just 
 average  more  than  just  making  thirty
[04:51] thousand  pounds  of  dollars  per  year 
 which  is  like  average  in  these  countries 
 do  I  expect  to  become  very  successful 
 make  70k  100K  200k  per  year  because  if
[04:58] the  answer  is  yes  the  way  that  you  will 
 achieve  that  goal  of  becoming  very 
 successful  is  by  valuing  your  time  and
[05:03] putting  your  time  into  the  things  that 
 would  actually  get  you  to  that  level  of 
 success  isn't  it  because  success  is 
 literally  all  just  have  you  put  in  your
[05:09] time  into  the  right  things  have  you  been 
 learning  have  you  been  implementing  have 
 you  been  trying  businesses  have  you  been 
 experiencing  failure  and  rejection  so
[05:14] that  you  can  grow  more  or  have  you  just 
 been  staying  in  a  state  of  comfort  lying 
 down  sideways  just  getting  more  and  more
[05:19] more more  dopamine  now  everything  we've 
 discussed  in  this  video  is  just  basic 
 it's  kind  of  like  common  sense  now  a
[05:24] bunch  of  people  have  understood  tick 
 tock's  you  know  algorithms  are  really 
 strong  and  you  know  there's  artificial
[05:29] intelligence  and  there's  some  Data 
 Tracking  and  you  know  there's  the 
 dopamine  and  stuff  most  people  know  this 
 don't  we  it  gets  kind  of  deeper  when  you
[05:34] really  research  Tick  Tock  even  more 
 that's  when  the  hairs  on  your  arm  start 
 to  stand  up  and  you  look  around  thinking
[05:40] that  this  could  literally  destroy  the 
 world 
 and  I'm  not  over  exaggerating  when  I  say
[05:45] that  you  see  Tick  Tock  is  created  by  a 
 Chinese  company  called  bite  dance  and
[05:50] bite  dance  is  actually  partnered  with 
 the  CCP  like  the  Chinese  governments  in 
 their  agreements  which  you  can  literally
[05:55] read  in  the  terms  of  service  they  are 
 legally  obligated  to  send  user  data  to
[06:00] the  CCP  which  essentially  means  that  the 
 Chinese  government  has  your  data  they 
 know  what  you're  addicted  to  and  that
[06:06] might  not  seem  too  bad  right  oh  yeah 
 what  do  they  want  with  data  look  it's 
 very  interesting  because  we're  quite 
 young  and  you've  probably  heard  more  and
[06:11] more  over  the  last  few  years  about  data 
 haven't  you  and  you  probably  thought 
 like  you  know  why  do  people  take  that  so
[06:16] seriously  our  data  like  you  know  we  go 
 into  a  new  website  and  it  says  oh  your 
 Data  Tracking  cookies  let  me  just  press 
 accept  like  it  doesn't  make  a  difference 
 right  when  you're  quite  young  and  almost
[06:22] oblivious  to  this  you  don't  really  think 
 anything  about  your  data  you  don't 
 really  think  your  data  is  worth  much  Up 
 Until  you  realize  that  that's  just
[06:28] because  we've  lived  a  very  like 
 comfortable  sheltered  life  here  in  the 
 west  or  you  know  in  some  more  developed
[06:33] countries  like  India  Pakistan  and 
 everything  because  you  see  in  some  parts 
 of  the  world  in  particularly  China  your
[06:38] data  is  used  to  totally  control  you  so 
 here  in  the  west  you  know  our  data  is 
 used  to  like  track  our  shopping  so  they
[06:43] can  sell  us  more  stuff  yeah  fair  enough 
 okay  who  cares  like  oh  yeah  we'll  be 
 showing  more  adverts  okay  fine  who  cares
[06:48] it's  not  that  important  right  but  in 
 China  and  this  is  really  true  like  they 
 already  have  what's  called  like  a  social 
 credit  system  like  they've  essentially
[06:54] got  like  a  score  if  you've  ever  watched 
 that  Black  Mirror  episode  I  think  it's 
 called  nosedive  where  it's  like  everyone
[06:59] has  like  a  five-star  rating  out  of  five 
 stars  of  like  what  you'd  rate  each  other 
 for  you  know  your  social  mannerisms  and
[07:04] everything  in  China  they  have  that  like 
 they  literally  give  you  like  a  social 
 credit  score  and  if  your  score  is  too 
 low  they  literally  restrict  your  freedom
[07:10] you  can't  travel  you  can't  take  buses 
 you  can't  take  trains  and  there's  an 
 article  I  read  which  showed  that  when 
 there  was  like  some  kind  of  protest  in
[07:16] China  they  literally  locked  it  down 
 using  people's  data  like  this  like  they 
 stopped  people  from  being  able  to  like
[07:21] leave  the  process  so  they  could  get 
 arrested  they  stop  people  from  being 
 able  to  enter  the  process  by  stopping 
 like  certain  like  QR  codes  or  something
[07:26] you  know  like  people's  like  data  from 
 being  able  to  buy  trains  and  everything 
 you  don't  realize  how  much  your  data  can
[07:32] control  you  just  because  Yoshi  yet  we 
 haven't  experienced  that  in  the  west  and 
 this  then  coupled  with  the  fact  and  you
[07:39] might  have  heard  this  that  in  China  The 
 Tick  Tock  algorithm  promotes  a  very 
 different  kind  of  content  than  it  does
[07:44] in  the  UK  the  algorithm  in  China  has 
 been  meticulously  designed  to  promote
[07:49] the  kind  of  content  that  will  inspire 
 their  young  people  to  become  hard  and 
 disciplined  what  does  the  algorithm  in
[07:54] the  west  promote  degeneracy  in  their 
 version  of  tick  tock  if  you're  under  14
[07:59] years  old  they  show  you  science 
 experiments  you  can  do  at  home  Museum 
 exhibits  patriotism  videos  and
[08:05] educational  videos  now  they  don't  ship 
 that  version  of  tick  tock  to  the  rest  of 
 the  world  it's  almost  like  they
[08:10] recognize  that  Technologies  influencing 
 kids  development  and  they  make  their 
 domestic  version  a  spinach  version  of
[08:16] tick  tock  while  they  ship  the  Opium 
 version  to  the  rest  of  the  world 
 how  is  this  linked  what  does  this  all
[08:22] mean  so  Tick  Tock  in  the  west  promotes 
 degeneracy  and  you've  known  this  right 
 you've  seen  these  little  Tick-Tock  girls
[08:27] shaking  ass  and  all  this  like  sometimes 
 you  see  like  real  [ __ ]  porn  like  you 
 see  some  like  actual  like  nudity  on  Tick
[08:32] Tock  in  the  west  and  everything  little 
 13  year  old  boys  have  seen  this  stuff 
 this  was  actually  an  interesting  article 
 of  a  13  year  old  boy  typed  only  fans  in
[08:38] Tech  talk  some  [ __ ]  like  that  like  if 
 he's  typed  it  or  searched  or  whatever  he 
 would  be  then  shown  like  a  bunch  of  only
[08:43] fans  like  of  course  I  mean  if  you  search 
 only  fans  or  if  you  like  showing 
 interesting  like  the  only  fans  in  the 
 data  picks  up  no  matter  if  it  even  knows
[08:49] that  your  account  is  owned  by  a  13  year 
 old  it  will  start  to  show  you  literal 
 only  fans  models  that  are  trying  to  tell
[08:54] you  to  like  you  know  subscribe  to  their 
 [ __ ]  only  fans  list  do  you  understand 
 the  severity  of  this  because  many  people
[08:59] won't  at  this  point  this  just  seems  oh 
 well  you  know  like  yeah  yeah  they're 
 just  making  people  here  degenerates  like
[09:04] addicted  to  sex  and  you  know  shaking  ass 
 or  whatever  in  China  making  them 
 productive  it  doesn't  seem  that  bad 
 right  this  will  only  really  make  sense
[09:10] like  the  severity  of  this  will  only  make 
 sense  if  you  know  the  consequences  of  a 
 sexualized  Nation  there's  a  quote  if  you
[09:16] want  to  destroy  Any  Nation  without  War 
 make  adultery  or  news  is  he  calm  woman
[09:21] in  the  Young  Generation  and  this  quote 
 is  becoming  more  and  more  realistic  it's 
 become  more  observable  a  country  Falls
[09:27] when  especially  the  young  people  become 
 too  sexually  free  [ __ ]  this  this  video 
 can  get  really  [ __ ]  deep  I  really
[09:33] hope  you  can  follow  along  with  me  so  far 
 okay  let  me  just  do  a  recap  so  far  we've 
 covered  the  issues  with  tech  talk  it's 
 extremely  addicting  we've  covered  that
[09:39] Tick  Tock  is  made  by  the  company  bite 
 dance  that  reports  literally  to  the  CCP 
 which  means  that  they  share  data  there
[09:44] and  that  tick  tock's  algorithms  promote 
 degeneracy  nudity  adultery  open  sexual
[09:49] revolution  in  the  west  but  then  very 
 restrained  disciplined  in  the  Eastland 
 in  China  first  of  all  we  need  to  answer
[09:55] this  question  why  does  adultery  why  does 
 like  sexual  Freedom  destroy  a  nation 
 because  that  doesn't  seem  like  too
[10:00] obvious  right  now  does  it  why  when  a 
 nation's  young  people  start  to  have  more 
 like  free  sex  outside  of  marriage  why
[10:06] does  that  destroy  the  nation  well  when 
 people  have  too  much  like  you  know 
 sexually  free  sex  like  oh  go  [ __ ] 
 whoever  you  want  the  family  starts  to
[10:12] break  down  when  religion  was  in  control 
 the  only  time  you'd  really  be  having  sex 
 if  you  followed  those  rules  was  at  age
[10:17] 18  you  know  a  man  and  woman  would  get 
 married  and  it  quickly  gonna  be  honest 
 Foxwood  dude  quickly  get  married  you
[10:22] have  sex  you  start  having  children  boom 
 you've  got  a  family  units  you've  got  the 
 nuclear  family  unit  which  was  like 
 literally  like  the  most  core  part  of  a
[10:28] strong  Nation  because  if  that  Nation 
 eventually  went  to  war  if  that  nation 
 was  going  through  some  Great  Depression 
 that  man  would  be  working  hard  because
[10:33] he  had  a  family  he  had  a  wife  and  kids 
 to  fight  for  when  the  family  is  made 
 redundance  and  the  father  is  killed  from
[10:39] the  family  unit  and  replaced  with  the 
 government  and  then  the  young  people  are 
 promoted  to  be  degenerate  and  you  see
[10:44] this  music  and  everything  bro  I  haven't 
 watched  a  music  video  in  a  while  and  my 
 friend  Sammy  and  him  were  on  a  Discord
[10:49] call  and  he  just  like  ended  up  sharing 
 his  screen  and  he  put  on  like  some  rap 
 video  by  um you  know  one  of  those  like
[10:54] black  American  rappers  like  you  know  you 
 always  see  them  wearing  chains  and  [ __ ] 
 I  hadn't  watched  any  music  videos  in  a
[10:59] while  I've  not  seen  any  porn  any  social 
 media  I  don't  have  any  of  that  [ __ ]  have 
 just  seen  this  random  one  where  it's 
 like  they're  all  in  like  the  hood  or
[11:04] something  and  they've  got  like  a  bunch 
 of  like  djen  girls  twerking  around  them 
 the  guys  like  you  know  imitating  sex 
 moves  and  everything  it's  very
[11:09] degenerate  obviously  these  aren't  their 
 [ __ ]  wives  or  anything  to  me  just 
 that  made  me  think  like  [ __ ]  like  that's
[11:15] actually  normal  in  the  west  to  see  this 
 type  of  degenerate  content  you  see  like 
 these  female  artists  getting  try  humped
[11:21] by  their  male  like  dancing  stars  when 
 they  go  on  to  like  stage  or  something 
 you  see  all  these  people  promoting  like
[11:26] this  degeneracy  a  lot  of  people  reply  to 
 this  and  say  oh  you  know  you're  a 
 misogynist  you  don't  want  people  to 
 women's  sexual  freedom  and  stuff  this
[11:32] isn't  about  hating  on  a  particular  sex 
 this  is  about  realizing  that  this  causes 
 weakness  because  the  thing  that  causes
[11:37] the  most  strength  in  a  man  and  therefore 
 the  most  strength  in  a  country  is  family
[11:42] and  so  when  we  destroy  the  family  by 
 showing  people  that  they  can  have  sex 
 and  promoting  them  to  have  sex  outside
[11:48] of  the  family  perhaps  this  can  get  even 
 more  red  pill  because  then  those  same 
 people  especially  the  women  this  gets
[11:54] very  [ __ ]  red  pilled  honestly  like 
 you  start  to  see  all  the  plots  like 
 linking  together  I'll  put  this  all 
 together  soon  but  the  next  thing  we  need
[11:59] to  discuss  is  what  happens  when  sexual 
 freedoms  are  opened  what  happens  when 
 people  young  people  are  allowed  to  like
[12:05] to  just  [ __ ]  it's  just  normal  to  be 
 on  Tinder  and  stuff  men  get  extremely 
 horny  and  so  men  really  want  to  [ __ ] 
 until  Men  start  crowding  and  start
[12:11] wanting  to  [ __ ]  the  same  girls  and  you 
 know  they're  sending  the  messages  and 
 everything  that  means  that  women's 
 self-esteem  and  like  you  know
[12:16] self-identity  starts  to  inflate  because 
 an  average  girl  is  now  getting  the 
 attention  of  like  a  [ __ ]  talking  10  100
[12:21] years  ago  an  average  girl  is  getting 
 hundreds  of  messages  literally  like 
 almost  like  a  rock  star  level  attraction
[12:26] that  she's  getting  and  she's  literally 
 just  like  a  five  or  something  and  I  will 
 say  this  like  disrespect  her  I'm  just 
 saying  like  the  brutal  truth  so  what
[12:31] happens  if  sexual  freedom  is  opened  up 
 men  are  now  allowed  to  like  hold  women 
 and  start  texting  them  all  the  time  and 
 you  know  of  course  like  when  you're
[12:36] allowed  to  just  [ __ ]  as  a  guy  it's  like 
 you  know  you  may  as  well  go  shotgun 
 strategy  and  message  as  many  girls  as 
 possible  women's  self-esteem  is  rising
[12:42] from  that  so  women  start  seeing 
 themselves  better  when  women  see 
 themselves  better  they  only  want  to  [ __ ] 
 guys  who  are  better  than  them  so  this
[12:47] five  now  thinks  that  she's  an  eight 
 because  of  the  hundreds  of  Tinder 
 matches  that  she's  getting  and  now 
 she'll  only  [ __ ]  guys  who  are  eight  nine
[12:52] and  tens  but  these  guys  won't  want  to 
 get  into  a  serious  relationship  with  her 
 which  means  that  she  will  like  this
[12:57] sounds  [ __ ]  gross  and  I  don't  mean  to 
 be  like  sexist  but  she  will  get  ran 
 through  by  the  Chads  that  don't  want  a 
 real  relationship  with  her  because  they
[13:02] still  see  her  as  a  five  even  though  she 
 sees  herself  as  an  eight  you  know  this 
 is  like  the  sort  of  conventional  girl
[13:07] that  you  see  who's  like  oh  you  know  all 
 guys  are  the  same  guys  keep  like  guys 
 only  want  one  thing  and  stuff  like  guess 
 why  she's  saying  that  because  she's
[13:12] ahead  he's  like  instant  sexual 
 experiences  with  guys  who  then  don't 
 want  to  get  into  a  real  relationship
[13:17] with  her  because  her  you  know  her  sort 
 of  image  of  herself  has  been  inflated  by 
 all  the  little  Chomps  messaging  her  then
[13:22] she's  had  so  much  sex  with  so  many 
 different  guys  that  then  that  reduces 
 her  ability  to  even  pair  bond  and  stay
[13:29] true  with  one  guy  in  the  future  this  is 
 where  we  get  controversial  and  like 
 right  now  I'll  be  totally  honest  I  have
[13:34] a  fear  that  I  don't  even  want  to  record 
 the  rest  of  this  video  because  it  might 
 not  be  worth  me  literally  losing  my 
 entire  channel  for  this  video  I  would
[13:40] love  to  get  canceled  for  what  I'm  about 
 to  say  and  I  was  trying  to  say  in  the 
 most  like  uninsalting  way  possible  but 
 this  same  moment  then  who  thinks  of
[13:46] herself  here  even  though  she  is  here  and 
 she's  been  then  sleeping  with  well  she 
 you  know  she  wants  these  guys  and  she'll
[13:51] happen  against  her  relationship  with 
 them  so  you  know  they  end  up  meeting  up 
 going  on  a  date  and  then  they  [ __ ]  her 
 and  then  they  don't  like  reply  because
[13:56] these  guys  want  a  girl  up  there  this 
 girl  has  now  slept  with  10  guys  20  guys
[14:01] and  there's  quite  gut-wrenching  research 
 that  shows  that  when  a  woman  has  slept 
 around  her  ability  to  stay  faithful
[14:07] drastically  decreases  in  fact  it  is 
 research  this  is  not  like  my  sexist 
 opinion  there  is  real  core  research  for
[14:13] this  that  the  number  one  indicator  of  a 
 woman  initiating  a  divorce  and  also
[14:18] getting  into  an  affair  is  her 
 pre-marital  sex  history  the  number  one 
 indicator  that  she  will  divorce  you  or
[14:24] cheat  on  you  is  simply  just  how  many 
 guys  she  has  slept  with  before  you 
 what's  interesting  is  that  it  is  not
[14:29] about  the  number  of  times  that  she  has 
 had  sex  or  woman  could  have  sex  with  her 
 boyfriend  ten  thousand  times  and  that
[14:34] would  actually  like  affect  her  less  than 
 if  she  had  10  hookups  just  one  time  each 
 so  with  the  promotion  of  degeneracy
[14:40] women  essentially  become  corrupted  and 
 that  largely  destroys  their  ability  to 
 be  able  to  like  stay  faithful  with  the
[14:46] guide  they  eventually  want  to  really  get 
 with  and  this  is  the  dynamic  you  see  of 
 like  a  bunch  of  like  you  know  younger
[14:51] girls  who  have  been  really  pushed  to  be 
 like  so  sexually  free  when  they're  16 
 and  17  18  having  sex  since  they  were
[14:56] like  13  years  old  going  to  parties  in 
 the  18  19  20  you  know  just  enjoying 
 themselves  Girls  Just  Want  to  Have  Fun 
 and  Stuff  double  digit  body  counts  and
[15:02] you  know  guys  aren't  like  free  from  the 
 responsibilities  of  this  as  well  I'll 
 discuss  guys  but  I  just  want  to  talk 
 about  what  happens  to  girls  she  gets  the
[15:07] 22  23  24  she  wants  to  start  taking 
 things  a  bit  more  seriously  she  slept 
 with  15  guys  one  of  these  guys  she's  you
[15:12] know  had  a  couple  of  relationships  here 
 and  there  and  eventually  when  she's  29 
 years  old  30  years  old  31  you  know  she's
[15:18] had  like  10  years  working  and  everything 
 and  now  she  really  wants  to  get  marriage 
 got  pressure  from  her  parents  to  get  to 
 have  kids  and  everything  then  she  meets
[15:24] a  chump  like  you  and  you're  a  real  man 
 who'll  take  care  of  her  who  doesn't  just 
 want  her  for  sex  like  all  those  [ __ ]
[15:29] boys  did  yeah  all  those  [ __ ]  that 
 they  just  used  then  she  meets  a  real  man 
 like  you  a  real  man  a  man  who  doesn't
[15:35] really  care  about  her  sexual  history 
 because  he's  so  secure  in  himself  so  she 
 eventually  meets  the  guy  who's  like  the
[15:40] sweetheart  that  she's  always  wanted  and 
 you  know  she  falls  in  love  yeah  he's 
 amazing  and  you  know  he's  so  happy  yeah
[15:45] I've  met  my  princess  and  you  know  her 
 pastel  it's  okay  and  then  her  ability  to 
 actually  stay  faithful  with  this  guy  is
[15:50] just  [ __ ]  like  you  know  the  data 
 shows  that  it's  lowered  but  if  we  think 
 about  it  in  like  an  individual  case  what
[15:55] a  realistic  scenario  might  be  is  that 
 you  know  six  months  they've  been 
 together  one  year  they've  got  a  child
[16:00] two  years  three  years  they've  got  two 
 children  and  you  know  years  of  my  Bible 
 years  she's  had  children  and  everything
[16:05] now  she's  focused  on  the  children  she's 
 maybe  in  work  and  stuff  and  she 
 reminisces  of  like  the  Chad  from  10 
 years  ago  who  like  you  know  used  to
[16:10] pound  the  [ __ ]  out  of  her  and  she  ends 
 up  like  you  know  just  like  being  a 
 little  bit  free  on  a  voice  call  with  one
[16:15] of  her  girlfriends  and  they're  just 
 talking  and  you  know  they  just  like 
 subtly  keep  their  voice  down  like  oh 
 yeah  do  you  remember  Chad  like  he  just
[16:20] came  back  into  this  city  today  and  she's 
 like  oh  my  God  you  know  his  dick  was  so 
 big  and  everything  and  he  slept  with  me 
 so  like  it  was  so  [ __ ]  cool  to
[16:26] completely  like  that  one  time  him  and 
 his  friends  did  you  know  and  then 
 imagine  her  husband's  like  listening  in 
 from  the  door  I  know  this  seems  like
[16:32] weird  as  [ __ ]  like  massaging  it  but  like 
 bro  this  is  real  real  stuff  that  happens 
 for  guys  it's  a  very  interesting  case
[16:37] about  Tick  Tock  well  not  just  Tick  Tock 
 but  you  know  just  the  degeneracy  leads 
 to  this  because  guys  then  you  know  we've
[16:43] already  had  this  natural  impulse  inside 
 of  us  to  like  [ __ ]  a  lot  a  lot  and  so 
 when  we're  then  heavily  promoted  to  do
[16:49] so  and  it's  kind  of  open  to  you're  being 
 sold  sex  more  than  you  realize  like 
 you're  being  castrated  like  all  these
[16:54] porn  websites  Tick  Tock  social  media  you 
 know  like  they  know  that  you're  so 
 addicted  to  sex  so  that  they've  just
[16:59] like  allowed  women  since  you  know 
 presented  themselves  in  this  way  because 
 then  they're  just  hooking  your  attention
[17:04] and  they  make  more  money  from  you  and  so 
 the  majority  of  guys  go  through  life 
 just  totally  just  addicted  and  just
[17:09] distracted  by  like  the  sexual  [ __ ]  they 
 see  on  screens  by  you  know  movies  and 
 music  videos  and  porn  and  everything  and
[17:15] the  top  10  of  the  Chads  you  know  the  top 
 10  percent  of  guys  they're  eligible  to 
 have  sex  and  so  it's  a  really  weird  good
[17:20] Dynamic  where  like  the  literally  the 
 majority  of  guys  have  a  porn  addiction 
 they're  totally  lonely  and  yet  just  a
[17:25] small  percentage  of  men  have  got 
 literally  an  astronomical  body  count 
 like  I've  slept  with  so  many  women  that
[17:30] you  wouldn't  even  believe  you  know 
 there's  men  out  there  who  have  quite 
 literally  slept  with  thousands  of  women 
 and  there's  a  fair  amount  of  guys  who
[17:35] were  slept  with  hundreds  of  women  and 
 yet  there's  millions  billions  of  guys 
 who've  never  even  kissed  the  girl  before
[17:40] so  all  of  these  problems  you  know  stem 
 from  degeneracy  degeneracy  is  promoted 
 by  Tick  Tock  and  all  these  problems  lead
[17:45] to  a  weak  country  it  leads  to  a  country 
 that  doesn't  have  a  strong  family  unit
[17:50] it  leads  to  a  country  that  has  men  who 
 don't  have  children  who  don't  have  wives 
 to  work  hard  for  and  so  those  men  just
[17:56] kind  of  you  know  sleep  away  into  the 
 darkness  and  just  go  to  work  grudgingly 
 come  back  and  just  like  jack  off  and  10
[18:02] years  from  now  that'll  be  the  exact  same 
 routine  but  they'll  come  back  and 
 exchange  0.1  ethereum  for  a  cuddle  in
[18:07] virtual  reality  [ __ ]  metaverse  Tick 
 Tock  isn't  entirely  to  blame  for  this
[18:12] because  degeneracy  has  started  in  these 
 Western  countries  for  a  while  but  how
[18:17] Tick  Tock  comes  into  this  equation  is 
 very  very  interesting  there  is  a  term 
 called  subversion  subversion  is  a  term
[18:24] for  destroying  your  enemy's  culture  from 
 the  inside  it's  like  a  war  tactic  there
[18:30] is  literally  a  war  tactic  that  discusses 
 how  to  destroy  a  nation  without  actually
[18:35] going  to  war  and  it's  by  degrading  their 
 culture  and  the  strength  of  their  men
[18:40] and  there  is  a  war  strategist  a  very 
 famous  Chinese  War  strategist  from  like 
 ages  ago  hundreds  or  maybe  thousands  of
[18:45] years  ago  called  Sun  Tau  and  there's  a 
 book  called  The  Art  of  War  and  in  this
[18:50] Chinese  book  of  like  war  strategy  it 
 says  that  one  of  the  greatest  war 
 strategies  out  there  is  to  destroy  the
[18:56] enemy  country  without  even  fighting  a 
 war  that  they  realize  that  their 
 fightings  essentially  to  like  have  an
[19:01] invisible  war  that  the  enemy  country 
 doesn't  even  realize  that  they're  at  war 
 that  strategy  has  been  used  to  create
[19:07] Tick-Tock  it  is  literally  destroying 
 like  the  culture  the  values  of  other 
 countries  promoting  degeneracy  at  like  a
[19:13] compounding  scale  weakening  the  men 
 there  I  heard  this  I  don't  know  if  this 
 is  true  but  school  kids  in  China  are
[19:18] being  given  the  art  of  water  study  in 
 school  like  that's  like  a  compulsory 
 reading  in  the  UK  we  have  [ __ ]  Biff
[19:24] and  Chip  like  we  have  like  these  books 
 that  we've  been  reading  since  like  you 
 know  like  oh  Biff  kicked  over  the  ball 
 into  his  neighbor's  backyard  and  he's
[19:30] got  to  go  get  it  we've  been  reading  this 
 [ __ ]  so  China's  been  preparing  for  war 
 openly  like  openly  stating  that  they  are
[19:36] going  to  war  and  everyone  here  is  too 
 busy  just  twerking  the  degeneracy  of  the
[19:41] West  is  unfounded  you  know  you've  heard 
 Tate  talk  about  London  being  like  a 
 failed  State  and  I  think  a  lot  of  people
[19:47] agree  without  like  looking  at  London  is 
 like  very  dangerous  and  everything  I'm 
 in  London  right  now  by  the  way  I'm  not 
 from  here  like  I'm  from  like  up  north  in
[19:52] Warrington  Manchester  but  like  this  is 
 my  first  time  really  coming  here  I  was 
 about  to  move  here  get  an  apartment  here
[19:57] and  when  I  heard  this  stuff  like  oh  you 
 know  London's  a  fail  State  it's  really 
 dangerous  there's  a  bunch  of  like 
 stabbings  and  stuff  here  I  was  like  oh
[20:02] you  know  it's  probably  overblown  it's 
 probably  in  like  the  broke  areas 
 London's  like  really  big  so  it's  like 
 it's  in  some  like  broke  ass  little  town
[20:07] close  to  London  or  something  I've  been 
 here  for  a  month  and  there's  been  like 
 four  quite  dangerous  like  instances  that
[20:12] we've  experienced  and  like  me  and  my 
 girl  we're  not  like  that  social  like 
 obviously  with  like  you  know  nice  people 
 and  stuff  like  we've  not  been  out
[20:18] partying  we've  not  been  out  every  single 
 day  I  literally  wake  up  and  just  work 
 all  day  and  we  go  to  the  gym  that's  like 
 the  only  time  that  we're  outside  of  the
[20:23] house  literally  just  yesterday  we  just 
 witnessed  that  guy  getting  robbed  like 
 we  were  here  we're  in  the  bedroom  right
[20:28] now  of  this  apartment  we're  staying  in 
 we're  here  like  screaming  outside  we 
 look  out  this  window  this  window  right
[20:33] [ __ ]  here  we  look  out  and  quite 
 literally  bro  50  meters  away  there's  a 
 delivery  driver  getting  robbed  by  two
[20:38] guys  they're  literally  punching  him 
 they're  looking  through  like  the  Box  you 
 know  like  the  mopeds  like  the  scooter
[20:43] guys  will  come  and  deliver  your  food  and 
 stuff  they've  got  like  a  little  box 
 where  the  food  is  kept  they're  like 
 going  through  that  whilst  I've  beaten
[20:48] the  [ __ ]  out  of  the  delivery  driver  I've 
 called  the  police  and  everything  and  I'm 
 just  watching  it  thinking  like  bro  those 
 guys  are  literally  robbing  this  guy  for
[20:54] like  20  pounds  worth  of  [ __ ]  food  it 
 shook  me  up  I  call  Sam  and  everything  we 
 just  kind  of  like  laugh  yeah  London's
[20:59] failed  and  everything  maybe  this  wasn't 
 a  good  idea  but  after  doing  that  bro  I 
 went  on  to  like  Google  and  everything 
 and  just  started  I  was  like  you  know
[21:04] what  I  actually  need  to  be  a  little  bit 
 more  anxious  because  this  shit's  real 
 and  I've  been  like  too  sheltered  so  I
[21:09] actually  did  what  Tate  recommended  I 
 went  on  to  Google  I  don't  recommend  it  I 
 don't  think  you  should  do  this  but  like 
 if  you're  interested  and  you're  morbidly
[21:14] interested  and  maybe  if  you're  over  18. 
 I  went  on  to  Google  and  I  just  searched 
 London  stabbing  and  I  actually  read  like
[21:19] in  detail  some  of  the  Articles  and  then 
 I'm  not  going  to  tell  you  where  just  in 
 cases  but  like  I  searched  for  the
[21:25] specific  area  that  I'm  in  and  search 
 stabbing  and  started  to  like  you  know 
 see  the  articles  of  people  being  stabbed
[21:30] near  here  and  where  it  would  say  which 
 street  they  were  stabbed  in  you  know 
 when  news  article  was  said  oh  he  was 
 killed  in  the  streets  I'd  copy  and  paste
[21:36] our  street  into  Google  Maps  bro  and  it 
 [ __ ]  shook  me  up  because  they  were 
 literally  literally  less  than  five
[21:42] minutes  walk  from  here  how  is  this 
 related  to  what  we're  talking  about  well 
 when  degeneracy  causes  a  nation  to  start
[21:47] like  you  know  declining  and  the  men 
 become  more  weak  and  the  men  don't  have 
 much  to  work  hard  for  then  the  country
[21:52] starts  like  performing  worse  the  hard 
 financial  time  starts  hitting  then 
 people  are  really  [ __ ]  broke  and  then 
 you  know  there's  no  [ __ ]  father  do
[21:57] you  think  the  people  who  are  stabbing 
 around  here  you  think  those  guys  have 
 got  like  good  quality  father  figures  in 
 the  home  of  course  not  they're
[22:02] generously  leading  to  the  father  being 
 killed  off  away  from  the  home  and  you 
 know  the  single  mother  who's  gonna  raise 
 the  child  and  so  these  guys  who  are  out
[22:07] here  stabbing  these  guys  who  are  out 
 here  [ __ ]  robbing  people  and 
 attacking  people  for  20  pounds  worth  of 
 food  I  can  guarantee  they're  not  gonna
[22:13] go  home  to  like  some  positive  loving 
 father  of  course  they're  not  right  the 
 two  guys  out  here  just  robbing  this  guy 
 for  20  pounds  worth  of  food  they're  not
[22:18] going  home  to  Some  Like  Loving  family 
 are  they  they're  not  going  home  to  some 
 loving  parents  masculine  father  feminine
[22:23] mother  are  they  the  father's  being 
 killed  away  from  the  home  and  when  the 
 father  gets  killed  the  boy  isn't  going
[22:28] to  be  raised  to  be  successful  the  thing 
 is  the  West  does  not  want  to  listen  to 
 these  statistics  I  think  this  video
[22:33] might  get  me  [ __ ]  fully  like  this 
 video  might  get  age  restricted  or 
 something  fine  this  video  might  get 
 demonetized  fine  I  fear  that  this  video
[22:39] would  literally  like  cause  me  to  get 
 silenced  and  I  really  like  I  don't  even 
 know  if  we're  gonna  release  this  video
[22:44] honestly  like  I've  already  had  a  madokas 
 and  it's  my  editor  I'll  get  him  to  do 
 the  first  draft  and  me  and  my  team  all 
 come  together  and  literally  just  see
[22:49] like  is  it  worth  the  risk  the  worst 
 doesn't  want  to  talk  about  this  there 
 are  severe  consequences  to  a  child  being
[22:55] raised  without  a  father  and  that 
 specifically  means  like  I  have  to  say 
 this  that  specifically  means  that  there
[23:00] are  problems  to  a  child  being  raised  by 
 a  single  mother  and  that  stems  from  the 
 degeneracy  that's  happening  it  stems
[23:05] from  this  you  go  girl  attitude  like  you 
 know  this  woman  who's  you  know  slept 
 around  more  and  then  she's  got  a  higher 
 body  count  then  now  she's  got  less  of  a
[23:11] chance  to  pair  bond  with  her  husband  and 
 then  she  eventually  goes  and  cheats  or 
 she  files  a  divorce  and  she  can  raise 
 the  kids  all  by  herself  because  this
[23:17] woman  who  is  a  victim  in  her  own  right 
 has  been  conditioned  and  brainwashed 
 since  five  years  old  to  say  that  yep  you
[23:22] can  do  everything  that  a  mankind  you 
 don't  need  a  man  you're  you  go  girl  yes 
 you  go  girl  you  can  have  a  career 
 children  and  raise  the  children  by
[23:27] yourself  you  don't  need  a  man  the 
 government  will  pay  for  you  men  are 
 being  act  like  exported  out  with  their
[23:32] families  and  this  is  what  the  result  is 
 what  do  you  hear  about  in  London  these 
 loved  and  standings  of  like  these
[23:38] [ __ ]  [ __ ]  up  young  men  who  are 
 going  around  with  knives  with  machetes 
 with  [ __ ]  swords  and  literally
[23:43] killing  innocent  people  that's  happening 
 because  of  only  two  things  it's 
 happening  because  the  father  has  been
[23:48] taken  away  from  the  home  and  the 
 father's  been  taken  away  because  of 
 degeneracy  because  of  tick  tock  and  also 
 what's  happening  because  of  poor  mental
[23:54] health  which  again  has  been  caused  by 
 Tick  Tock  and  Tick  Tock  again  is  not 
 just  the  entire  problem  in  porn  websites
[23:59] other  social  medias  I  told  you  that  this 
 would  get  a  lot  deeper  than  just  oh  it's
[24:04] you  know  it's  a  social  media  website  and 
 that's  not  good  for  us  maybe  you're 
 watching  this  right  now  and  you  think 
 I'm  absolutely  crazy  or  maybe  you're
[24:09] watching  this  with  so  much  [ __ ] 
 interest  because  it's  clicking  in  your 
 brain  you're  thinking  like  [ __ ]  now  the
[24:15] pieces  have  been  put  together 
 I  don't  know  as  like  a  macro  level 
 solution  to  this  I  really  don't  know  but
[24:21] I  know  for  certain  what  will  work  for 
 you 
 is  your  own  self-improvements
[24:26] it's  your  own  journey  of  delaying 
 ratification  of  improving  your  mental 
 health  of  going  to  the  gym  and  becoming
[24:32] a  strong  man  because  you  will  be  needed 
 soon  now  is  this  the  best  time  of  your 
 entire  life  to  become  a  strong  man  and
[24:38] to  start  making  money  and  just  in  cases 
 you  need  to  like  leave  your  country  if 
 you're  in  the  west  if  you're  in  UK  or  us
[24:43] just  in  cases  you  need  to  fly  out  and 
 like  take  your  families  as  like  some 
 other  country  or  something  like  bro  I 
 don't  know  what's  gonna  happen  but  when
[24:49] I  researched  tiktok  as  I  did  for  this 
 video 
 I'm  scared  I'm  literally  not  saying  this
[24:55] to  like  you  know  invoke  your  emotion  and 
 hopefully  get  more  engagement  in  this 
 video  bro  this  is  something  that's  like 
 literally  kept  me  paranoid  for  like  the
[25:01] last  two  weeks  and  I  also  I  know  for  a 
 fact  some  people  are  going  to  reply  to 
 this  video  like  oh  yeah  he's  just 
 paranoid  oh  he's  so  anxious  and  stuff
[25:07] bro  like 
 if  you're  not  paranoid  I  think  that's 
 weird  I  don't  think  I'm  the  weird  one
[25:12] for  being  paranoid  when  we've  been 
 presented  with  this  data  I  think  the 
 people  who  aren't  paranoid  who  are  just
[25:17] still  with  the  same  mindset  oh  you  know 
 it'll  be  okay  like  just  because  we've 
 never  experienced  like  a  first-hand  war
[25:22] in  our  lives  you  know  if  you've  lived  in 
 the  UK  or  something  it  doesn't  mean  that 
 it  one  can't  happen  this  country  is
[25:28] right  now  who  have  literally  like  been 
 invaded  they  weren't  expecting  a  war 
 like  like  one  year  ago  everything  just
[25:33] seemed  kind  of  normal 
 things  can  change  and  if  it  helps  my 
 argument  at  all  every  rich  guy  that  I
[25:39] have  in  my  contact  list  is  preparing  for 
 war  like  they're  preparing  stacking  up 
 more  money  we're  all  literally  speaking
[25:44] about  like  okay  what's  the  plan  of 
 action  right  now  every  rich  guy  bro 
 every  single  guy  that  I  know  who's  in  my
[25:49] contact  list  who's  worth  more  than  one 
 million  every  single  one  of  them  is 
 slightly  paranoid  every  single  one  and
[25:54] in  fact  you  can  even  go  see  like  that 
 social  media  Pages  their  YouTube 
 channels  and  everything  and  they've 
 literally  been  like  subtly  mentioning
[25:59] [ __ ]  like  this  for  like  the  last  two 
 years  and  I  only  just  picked  up  now 
 what's  so  interesting  is  that  all  of
[26:04] like  the  broker  guys  all  like  you  know 
 the  broke  random  guys  out  there  who  you 
 know  just  so  ignorant  to  all  this  stuff
[26:09] they're  the  kind  of  guys  who  are  saying 
 like  oh  well  just  chill  bro  come  on  come 
 to  the  pub  come  come  play  some  video
[26:14] games  bro  distracting  themselves  that's 
 a  lot  to  take  in  so  I  don't  know  what 
 else  to  say  to  you  bro  watch  this  video 
 right  now
[26:19] do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it  mwah

 inside  of  him  he's  more  like  a  coward  he 
 can't  seem  to  sit  down  and  focus  on  his
[00:28] work  for  all  the  porn  that  jeffrey 
 watches  he  still  has  a  low  sex  drive  his 
 body  accumulates  fat  more  in  the  places
[00:35] that  women  would  like  his  hips  and 
 breasts  but  worst  of  all  jeffrey  does 
 nothing  to  even  try  to  improve
[00:41] adonis 
 adonis  is  a  masculine  man  full  of 
 testosterone  his  muscle  mass  is  high  his
[00:48] body  fat  percentage  is  low  his  libido  is 
 through  the  roof  this  is  a  way  that  a 
 man  should  feel  the  testosterone  courses
[00:54] through  his  veins  and  because  of  that 
 adonis  can  sit  down  and  focus  on  his 
 work 
 exactly  how  a  man  should  live
[01:04] this  may  be  the  first  time  in  history 
 that  a  lot  of  young  men  teenagers  men  in
[01:10] their  twenties  have  got  low  testosterone 
 now  fair  enough  you  know  what  i'm  just 
 going  to  be  brutally  [ __ ]  insulting
[01:16] here  the  majority  of  men  deserve  this 
 the  majority  of  men  deserve  to  have  low
[01:21] testosterone  because  they  live  like 
 idiots  they  live  like  jefferies  they  go 
 to  sleep  at  like  3  a.m  they  eat  like
[01:26] lots  of  sugar  they  just  drink  like  they 
 literally  just  sat  there  inside  of  their 
 homes  and  they  just  [ __ ]  drink 
 alcohol  if  these  guys  are  doing  that
[01:32] they  deserve  to  have  [ __ ]  up  health 
 they  deserve  to  have  [ __ ]  up  hormones 
 that's  not  me  being  like  insulting  or
[01:37] disrespectful  or  horrible  everything  is 
 cause  and  effect  and  if  you  are  doing 
 particular  actions  you  deserve  the
[01:42] particular  consequences  of  that  so 
 there's  certain  guys  like  a  big  majority 
 of  guys  who  are  living  like  idiots  who
[01:47] deserve  to  have  ill  health  symptoms  but 
 the  sad  reality  is  that  there's  a  lot  of
[01:53] guys  who  are  actually  doing  the  right 
 things  you're  on  self-improvements 
 you've  been  trying  to  improve  your  sleep
[01:58] you're  exercising  you're  lifting  heavy 
 weights  you're  not  eating  as  much  sugar 
 or  processed  foods  you  barely  even  drink
[02:03] so  why  are  your  testosterone  levels 
 lower  than  every  other  man  in  your 
 entire  bloodline  what  should  you  do
[02:09] about  it  chances  are  you're  watching 
 this  video  on  testosterone  you've 
 probably  watched  a  bunch  of  other  videos
[02:14] on  testosterone  2  and  i  remember  when  i 
 was  like  doing  some  research  you  know 
 you  get  into  those  moods  where  you're 
 somewhat  like  really  obsessed  over  a
[02:19] certain  thing  so  at  one  point  it's  sleep 
 another  point  is  like  you  know  the 
 perfect  workout  routine  and  right  now
[02:24] it's  testosterone  when  i  was  currently 
 like  obsessed  over  testosterone  i  would 
 watching  when  you  search  for  it  on 
 youtube  you  watch  all  these  videos  which
[02:30] say  like  are  the  benefits  of 
 testosterone  how  to  raise  your 
 testosterone  naturally  and  they  all  say 
 the  same  things  and  it  was  so
[02:35] anti-climatic  when  i'd  watched  this 
 video  hoping  to  get  some  new  information 
 and  it  would  literally  just  say  like  the
[02:40] ways  to  improve  your  testosterone  are  to 
 sleep  and  to  lift  heavy  weights  and  to
[02:45] have  a  clean  diet  and  not  drink  and  yeah 
 that's  about  it  and  then  they'd  give  you 
 every  now  and  then  it's  like  oh  you  can
[02:50] buy  my  ashwagandha  supplements 
 like  a  link  in  the  description  [ __ ]  go 
 [ __ ]  yourself  go  [ __ ]  yourself  like  all
[02:55] these  [ __ ]  bro  such  a  sensitive 
 topic  and  all  these  like  youtubers  were 
 trying  to  sell  me  [ __ ]  when  i  was  like  i
[03:00] was  sat  there  with  [ __ ]  titty  masks 
 bro  i'm  making  this  video  right  now  it's 
 like  gonna  teach  you  how  to  get  higher
[03:05] testosterone  my  levels  with  like  i 
 didn't  ever  get  tested  when  i  was  a 
 teenager  i  got  tested  recently  we'll 
 talk  about  that  but  when  i  was  a
[03:11] teenager  i  was  way  way  way  more  feminine 
 and  you  know  this  could  potentially  be
[03:17] incorrect  but  chances  are  that  my 
 estrogen  when  i  was  going  through 
 puberty  was  way  higher  than  it  should
[03:23] have  been  and  my  testosterone  was  way 
 lower  so  i  was  one  of  the  the  unlucky 
 few  about  40  to  50  of  men  who  developed
[03:30] literal  [ __ ]  breast  mass  through 
 puberty  so  through  puberty  essentially 
 if  you've  got  like  you  know  great
[03:35] genetics  and  everything's  going  right 
 you  should  be  pumped  full  of 
 testosterone  you  should  start  to  look 
 like  a  young  man  at  age  16  you  should
[03:40] start  getting  like  facial  hair  muscle 
 mass  deeper  voice  at  age  16  i  still  look 
 like  a  little  boy  and  suddenly  i  started
[03:46] getting  like  man  boobs  even  though  i 
 wasn't  like  fat  fat  and  the  majority  of 
 young  men  like  50  of  young  men  can
[03:52] relate  to  this  visualize  that  in  your 
 mind  right  now  visualize  boys  like 
 teenage  boys  all  around  the  world  and
[03:58] like  50  of  them 
 are  developing 
 breast  mass  like  literally  what's
[04:04] supposed  to  happen  to  women  why  are  our 
 hormone  levels  so  [ __ ]  up  i  remember
[04:09] feeling  so  [ __ ]  self-conscious  i 
 didn't  wear  normal  clothes  for  a  while 
 because  my  man  boobs  were  [ __ ]
[04:15] showing  that  was  tight  like  i  remember 
 this  one  time  i  wore  an  orange  t-shirt  i 
 was  age  17  and  one  of  my  friends  pointed
[04:20] it  out  in  front  of  everyone  oh  you  can 
 see  hums  his  nipples  through  his  shirt 
 and  it's  like  they  were  poking  out  and 
 they  were  like  sensitive  and  [ __ ]  like
[04:25] when  you're  growing  like  t  [ __ ]  hell 
 bro  how  [ __ ]  is  that  when  you  really
[04:30] think  about  it  the  time  that  we  should 
 have  been  growing  muscle  and  becoming 
 more  masculine  we  should  have  been 
 pumped  for  testosterone
[04:37] something  is  very  very  very  wrong  in 
 modern  society  and  there's  you  know
[04:42] there's  10  different  reasons  why  we 
 could  go  with  you  know  there's  oestrogen 
 in  the  plastics  of  like  the  water 
 bottles  and  this  [ __ ]  in  the  air  or
[04:48] there's  too  many  things  and  it's  very 
 stressful  to  talk  about  this  especially 
 with  those  sort  of  like  big  societal
[04:54] things  like  oh  well  there's  estrogen  in 
 the  tap  water  and  in  plastics  and  if 
 that  feels  somewhat  unavoidable  and  in
[05:00] soaps  and  you  know  shampoos  and  even  in 
 toothpaste  and  all  this  like  random  [ __ ] 
 that's  negatively  affecting  our  hormones
[05:06] it's  a  very  very  sad  reality  for  modern 
 young  men  i  remember  even  age  17  18
[05:11] being  on  youtube  like  trying  to  search 
 for  answers  and  you  know  this  is  the 
 first  time  i  was  like  really  getting 
 into  lifting  and  you  hear  that  when
[05:16] you're  lifting  weights  you  need 
 testosterone  to  build  muscle  so  you  want 
 more  testosterone  and  you're  trying  to 
 you  know  research  how  i  literally
[05:21] remember  going  through  those  videos 
 which  said  the  benefits  of  testosterone 
 or  you  know  the  symptoms  of  low
[05:26] testosterone  and  you  might  be  able  to 
 relate  to  this  when  they  would  talk 
 about  the  symptoms  of  low  testosterone  i 
 had  this  like  feeling  of  insecurity
[05:33] humiliation  embarrassment  as  you  know 
 they  list  negatives  of  low  testosterone 
 so  it  was  like  you'll  develop  breast
[05:39] mass  you'll  be  less  manly  you'll  develop 
 like  higher  body  fat  percentage  and 
 you'll  struggle  gaining  muscle  and
[05:44] you'll  have  lower  drive  and  libido  and 
 all  you  know  all  this  like  and  brain  fog 
 and  all  these  like  negative  symptoms  i 
 would  be  sat  there  whilst  they're
[05:49] listening  that  feeling  so  [ __ ] 
 humiliated  because  that  symbolized  my 
 experience  maybe  it  was  a  testosterone
[05:55] issue  maybe  not  but  like  i  can  tell  you 
 something  very  personal  when  i  started 
 having  sex  when  i  was  age  19  20  and  i
[06:00] was  like  you  know  being  a  party  [ __ ]  boy 
 and  i  was  going  out  to  like  parties  and 
 clubs  and  i  was  hooking  up  with  girls 
 for  more  than  10  girls  more  than  imagine
[06:07] that  imagine  bringing  10  different  you 
 know  over  the  course  of  months  like 
 bringing  you  know  kissing  a  girl 
 everything  bringing  her  back  to  your
[06:12] place  you've  done  like  the  hard  work 
 you're  ready  to  have  sex  with  her  and 
 you  literally  can't  even  get  [ __ ] 
 hard  you've  got  like  a  girlfriend  and
[06:17] you  literally  struggle  to  stay  hard  with 
 a  if  there's  one  thing  like  you're 
 supposed  to  do  is  obviously  like  you 
 know  there's  other  things  and  everything
[06:22] but  like  the  one  thing  that  symbolizes 
 us  come  on  truthfully  is  like  our  dick 
 it  means  a  lot  to  us  being  able  to  like
[06:29] get  hard  and  have  like  a  healthy  penis 
 and  we're  not  supposed  you  know  i'm 
 weird  as  [ __ ]  for  talking  about  this
[06:34] we're  not  supposed  to  talk  about  this  as 
 guys  are  we  we were  supposed  to  keep  it 
 quiet  and  just  [ __ ]  kill  ourselves 
 instead  there's  a  lot  of  people  watching
[06:39] this  a  lot  of  [ __ ]  jeffreys  like 
 judgmental  [ __ ]  watching  this 
 who  are  like  making  fun  of  me  and 
 laughing  at  me  right  now  oh  he  he
[06:44] couldn't  get  hard  he  had  mental  health 
 problems  yeah  and  then  when  it's  like 
 men's  mental  health  month  these
[06:49] [ __ ]  will  post  it  on  instagram 
 like  oh  make  sure  you  just  shut  the  [ __ ] 
 up  you  care  about  men's  mental  health
[06:54] we've  got  to  talk  about  these  sensitive 
 topics  because  it's  these  topics  talks 
 of  testosterone  talks  of  like  sex  which
[07:00] is  the  reason  why  men  have  mental  health 
 problems  because  we're  not  allowed  to 
 talk  about  these  things  because  we'll 
 get  judged  by  dumbasses  by  jefferies  by
[07:06] hostile  aggressive  bullies  there  are 
 certainly  psychological  problems  at  the
[07:12] time  when  you  know  i  was  having  sex  and 
 my  dick  wasn't  getting  hard  with  a  bunch 
 of  girls  certainly  you  know  i  had  levels 
 of  like  performance  anxiety  but  100
[07:19] there  was  also  testosterone  issues  at 
 the  time  and  like  elevations  of  estrogen 
 and  you  know  there's  going  to  be  some
[07:24] nerd  critiquing  me  right  now  and  saying 
 oh  well  actually  it's  it's  estradiol 
 [ __ ]  up  okay  we're  going  to  talk  in  like
[07:29] simple  understandable  ways  because  we 
 aren't  scientists  here  so  i've  went 
 about  a  journey  for  the  last  six  to  nine
[07:35] months  which  i  think  you  might  be 
 interested  in  i  got  my  testosterone 
 checked  in  2021  near  the  end  of  the  year
[07:40] in  october  and  then  also  in  november  so 
 about  a  30-day  gap  in  between  and  both
[07:46] of  the  results  were  actually  pretty  much 
 exactly  the  same  you  know  the  big  like 
 data  and  i  had  to  explain  it  and
[07:51] everything  it's  kind  of  complicated 
 because  testosterone  is  way  more 
 complicated  than  just  like  what  your 
 testosterone  number  was  so  mine  was  like
[07:56] 444  nanograms  per  deciliter  but  you  need 
 to  understand  like  a  bunch  of  other 
 nerdy  [ __ ]  but  we'll  just  go  with  the
[08:01] assumption  that  generally  whatever  your 
 total  testosterone  is  generally  will 
 show  you  like  a  good  understanding  of
[08:07] everything  else  and  of  course  like 
 you've  got  to  look  into  like  free  tests 
 and  get  all  these  complicated  [ __ ]  we're 
 just  gonna  go  with  the  total  number
[08:12] because  we  aren't  scientists  and  we  just 
 kind  of  kind  of  assume  that  it  relates 
 to  the  symptoms  that  we're  talking  about
[08:17] so  my  total  testosterone  in  october  and 
 also  in  november  was  around  440
[08:22] nanograms  per  deciliter  which  i  was  told 
 was  in  the  healthy  range  when  i  talked 
 about  that  online  people  criticized  me  i
[08:28] literally  made  a  video  saying  i  want 
 more  testosterone  people  who  were  like 
 like  more  plates  more  dates  that  big 
 youtuber  he  criticized  me  a  bunch  of  his
[08:34] fans  criticized  me  a bunch  of  people 
 called  me  crazy  for  saying  that  i  wanted 
 more  testosterone  because  i  was  in  the 
 normal  range  the  normal  range  in  the  uk
[08:40] or  in  most  countries  in  western 
 countries  is  between  250  nanograms  to 
 around  950.  if  you  are  in  the  middle  of
[08:46] this  you're  deemed  healthy  shut  the  [ __ ] 
 up  go  live  your  life  kill  yourself  you 
 don't  give  a  [ __ ]  mine  was  440.  i  was  in
[08:52] the  normal  range  but  they  don't  tell  you 
 that  the  range  is  based  up  of  like  men 
 of  all  ages  and  health  so  the  number
[08:58] that  i  got  the  testosterone  that  was 
 inside  of  my  blood  was  normal  and 
 healthy  for  probably  a  50  to  60  year  old
[09:04] but  because  of  these  like  [ __ ]  kind 
 of  sexist  like  standards  i  was  deemed 
 healthy  and  normal  and  i'm  crazy  for
[09:10] wanting  to  improve  my  testosterone 
 levels  think  about  how  [ __ ]  that  is  and 
 think  about  the  worst  part  of  this  is
[09:15] that  there's  no  solidarity  with  this 
 that  like  we  should  rise  up  together  as 
 brothers  and  say  like  yeah  that  is 
 unacceptable  that  there's  all  these  like
[09:21] soft  [ __ ]  who  are  like  nerds 
 talking  about  like  oh  no  but  but  it's  in 
 the  healthy  range  you  know  you  need  to
[09:26] like  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  i  always  consult 
 your  dog  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  my  doctor's 
 fat  okay  i  know  i  sound  like  a  crazy  guy
[09:31] right  now  because  you're  not  supposed  to 
 ever  criticize  doctors  because  they're 
 really  special  bro 
 your  doctor's  fat  and  he's  got  man  boobs
[09:37] and  he  doesn't  exercise  how  are  we 
 taking  [ __ ]  testosterone  like  advice 
 from  a  guy  who  literally  has  low  tests
[09:43] himself  i  got  this  test  440  broth  i  knew 
 that  that  was  the  number  i  really  tried 
 for  it  to  not  negatively  affect  me
[09:49] because  the  power  of  belief  in  my 
 opinion  is  very  very  important  and  you 
 don't  want  to  like 
 ingrain  something  inside  of  your
[09:55] subconscious  i  know  this  sounds  like 
 very  pseudo  science  but  i  personally  do 
 believe  it's  very  very  important  of  like
[10:00] how  you  see  yourself  is  generally  what 
 will  happen  to  even  real  things  like 
 testosterone  so  if  i  have  the  belief
[10:05] okay  i've  got  low  testosterone  you'll 
 pick  up  on  more  of  the  low  testosterone 
 symptoms  does  that  make  sense  i  know
[10:10] this  is  kind  of  a  side  tangent  but  the 
 worst  thing  that  i  could  have  done  at 
 the  time  was  like  really  say  to  myself 
 like  oh  gee  whiz  i've  got  no
[10:15] testosterone  i'm  gonna  get  all  these 
 negative  symptoms  i  fought  against  that 
 i  used  like  male  aggression  like  this
[10:20] sense  of  like  anger  against  it  to  say 
 like  no  [ __ ]  this  you  know  what  i've  got 
 high  testosterone  and  it's  cringe  as
[10:25] [ __ ]  bro  i'm  gonna  tell  you  the  truth 
 right  i'm  gonna  tell  you  something 
 that's  so  [ __ ]  cringy  so  you  know 
 that  i'm  not  lying  about  this  [ __ ]
[10:30] because  everyone's  gonna  think  i'm 
 [ __ ]  cringe  i  literally  started 
 saying  them  into  my  mind  i'm  an  alpha 
 male  i'm  a  leader  i've  got  a high  test
[10:36] i've  got  high  test  i've  got  a high  test 
 everyone's  gonna  [ __ ]  cringe  oh  he's 
 so  cringy  bro
[10:41] it  worked  i  just  got  re-tested  now  i've 
 made  changes  some  changes  but  like 
 really  what  have  i  even  changed  because
[10:47] when  i  got  the  the  original  test  i  was 
 already  living  like  a  healthy  life  that
[10:52] standard  advice  everyone  said  oh  well 
 where  are you  sleeping  eight  hours  where 
 you  lifting  yes  [ __ ]  what  the  [ __ ]  yes
[10:57] i  was  bro  i  was  on  [ __ ] 
 self-improvement  for  a  year  and  a  half  i 
 tracked  my  sleep  relentlessly  i  had  like
[11:02] a  [ __ ]  ring  on  24  7  that  would  track 
 my  sleep  and  i  fully  dedicated  myself  to 
 i  would  go  to  bed  at  9  00  pm  every
[11:07] single  night  full  on  like  military 
 routine  were  you  lifting  yes  i  was  [ __ ]
[11:12] were  you  getting  involved  i  tried 
 getting  sunlight  bro  i'm  in  the  uk  but  i 
 was  taking  vitamin  supplements  that  it's 
 one  of  the  best  things  i  mean  if  you're
[11:17] in  the  [ __ ]  uk  you  know  you  go 
 outside  in  the  sun  if  you  can  but  it's 
 not  going  to  be  enough  so  it's  taking 
 vitamin  d  supplements  things  up  you  know
[11:23] i  did  a  good  amount  of  research  for  this 
 and  my  numbers  were  low  now  i'm  supposed 
 to  be  fine  with  where  i'm  at  this  is
[11:29] where  most  people  even  people  who  were 
 just  agreeing  with  me  for  all  this  video 
 i'm  gonna  start  disagreeing  with  me  so
[11:34] my  number  now  i  got  tested  just  about  a 
 week  ago  my  number  has  increased 
 drastically  my  total  testosterone  is  up
[11:39] to  734  i  was  visualizing  724  so  that  was 
 like  what  i  was  saying  to  myself  for  the
[11:44] last  few  months  or  the  last  like  60  days 
 or  something  i  was  saying  okay  it  was 
 just  the  random  number  i  made  up  in  my 
 mind  i was  saying  i've  got  724  nanograms
[11:50] per  deciliter  of  testosterone  i  got  734. 
 that's  a  bit  weird  isn't  it  i  literally 
 like  i  don't  know  if  you  understand
[11:56] visualizations  but  i  literally  was  like 
 just  kind  of  like  saying  like  you  know 
 like  falsely  believing  to  myself  yeah 
 i've  got  724  nano  liters  per  whatever
[12:03] the  [ __ ]  the  metric  is  and  i  scored  734. 
 and  you  can  say  oh  well  yeah  coincidence
[12:09] or  oh  pseudoscience  or  something  you  can 
 say  and  yeah  okay  it  is  it  is  a 
 coincidence  it  is  pseudoscience  but
[12:15] it's  my  benefit 
 so  i  visualized  that  for  a  while  i 
 scored  734  my  free  testosterone  is  very
[12:21] high  it  was  on  the  upper  end  of  the 
 limit  it  was  it  was  above  the  upper  end 
 i  also  got  my  vitamin  d  tested  as  well
[12:27] that  was  on  like  the  healthy  range  but  a 
 bit  on  the  lower  end  it  was  like  30 
 whatever  the  the  numerical  like  a  unit
[12:33] was  it's  probably  better  if  it  was  maybe 
 double  that  734  so  that's  a  big  increase 
 that's  why  an  increase  of  about  70
[12:39] there's  a lot  of  things  that  go  into 
 testosterone  so  100  maybe  the  reason  i'm 
 in  thailand  right  now  and  the  extra  i
[12:44] mean  the  sun  is  the  vitamin  d  which  i 
 got  tested  and  that  was  on  the  lower  end 
 but  you  know  it  can  just  be  random  just
[12:49] fluctuations  but  that's  a  big  increase 
 from  444  and  i  got  tested  twice  by  the
[12:54] way  i  got  tested  twice  and  both  times  in 
 october  and  november  i  got  around  400 
 and  something  so  i  got  tested  twice  400
[12:59] was  probably  about  the  real  number  that 
 i  was  on  and  this  time  i  got  734  big
[13:04] increase  the  number  one  thing  that  i 
 changed  which  i  wanted  like  really 
 really  like  drill  into  you  because  you
[13:10] watched  the  other  videos  right  so  i 
 could  make  another  [ __ ]  normal 
 testosterone  video  like  make  sure  you're 
 lifting  heavy  weights  i  can  say  the  same
[13:16] [ __ ]  as  everyone  else  and  i'll  get  more 
 views  if  i  did  that  and  i'll  get  like 
 less  criticism  because  everyone's  like
[13:21] yep 
 it  checks  out  on  the  research  the 
 research  says  sleepy  so  yeah  100  do
[13:26] those  things  100 
 sleep  well  dedicate  more  than  eight 
 hours  to  bed  this  is  something  i  learned 
 from  the  book  why  we  sleep  by  matthew
[13:32] walker  you  have  to  allocate  more  hours 
 to  bed  than  you  actually  want  to  sleep 
 there's  a  quick  side  note  but  like
[13:37] you'll  really  benefit  this  could 
 literally  change  your  life  everyone  says 
 okay  get  seven  to  eight  hours  of  sleep 
 but  sleep  is  not  the  same  as  hours  in
[13:43] bed  everyone  allocates  like  eight  hours 
 to  bed  seven  hours  to  bed  if  you 
 actually  like  tracked  your  sleep
[13:48] meticulously  you'll  realize  that  i  was 
 in  bed  is  not  the  same  as  i  was  actually 
 asleep  because  you  actually  wake  up  for 
 like  a  large  portion  of  the  night  like
[13:54] 30  minutes  16  minutes  90  minutes 
 sometimes  so  in  general  you  need  to 
 allocate  like  literally  more  like  nine 
 to  maybe  10  hours  to  bedtime  to  actually
[14:00] get  around  eight  hours  of  actual  sleep 
 this  is  a  quick  side  note  that's 
 something  i've  learned  which  has  been
[14:05] very  helpful  so  i  don't  want  to  go  over 
 the  basic  advice  that  you've  heard  you 
 can  go  click  on  any  other  testosterone
[14:10] video  and  they'll  tell  you  you  know 
 healthy  diets  and  stuff  and  again  100 
 you  should  do  those  things  i'm  gonna  do 
 those  things  for  the  rest  of  my  life
[14:15] what  i  want  to  do  is  speak  to  you  about 
 the  power  of  belief  which  seems  really
[14:20] wishy-washy  i'm  not  like  some  [ __ ] 
 hippie  weirdo  i  don't  have  anything  to 
 sell  you  like  i  know  my  buy  my  [ __ ]
[14:25] course  or  any  i  don't  have  anything  to 
 tell  you  i'm  just  telling  you  what's 
 worked  for  me  i'm  telling  you  right  now 
 i  am  quite  like  a  logical  no  bs  kind  of
[14:31] guy  and  so  wishy-washy  advice  i've 
 always  hated  it  and  i  know  this  is  gonna 
 sound  like  very  spiritual  and
[14:36] wishy-washy  there  is  something  weirdly 
 effective  about  the  power  of  like  belief 
 like  what  you  believe
[14:43] it's  look 
 the  placebo  effect  you've  heard  that 
 before  the  placebo  effect  is  the  power
[14:49] of  belief  scientists  you  know  when 
 they're  trying  to  make  like  a  treatment 
 or  a  medication  what  they  do  is  they
[14:54] have  to  make  sure  that  their  treatment 
 that  they're  trying  to  work  on  is  more 
 effective  than  the  placebo  effect  this
[14:59] is  actually  hard  for  them  to  do  it's 
 actually  like  a  big  thing  if  a  scientist 
 comes  out  with  something  which  is  more
[15:05] effective  than  the  placebo  effect  the 
 placebo  effect  is  kind  of  like  if  you're 
 given  a  pill  that  says  okay  it  has  this
[15:10] effect  that  you  know  it'll  stop  this 
 headache  or  it'll  make  you  lose  weight 
 you  know  you're  fully  told  by  a 
 scientist  okay  this  this  pill  will  do
[15:16] this  you  believe  it  you  take  the  pill 
 and  it  has  the  effect  but  the  pill  was 
 nothing  it  was  like  literally  just  like
[15:21] an  empty  pill  it  didn't  have  medication 
 inside  of  it  what  you  believe  is 
 extremely  powerful  if  you  believe  that
[15:27] you  have  low  testosterone  and  even  if 
 that's  true  by  the  way  if  you  believe 
 that  you've  got  low  testosterone  you'll 
 pick  up  on  more  of  the  symptoms  because
[15:33] you  know  it'll  be  in  your  mind  right  so 
 i've  got  losses  and  i've  got  low 
 testosterone  every  time  i  go  to  the 
 mirror  i'll  see  like  i'll  see  like  i'm
[15:39] getting  more  fat  around  my  chest  i'll 
 see  like  i'm  gaining  fat  around  my 
 stomach  and  stuff  and  like  my  voice  is
[15:44] going  higher  pitch  you  pick  up  on  those 
 things  because  you  believe  it  but  if  you 
 just  suddenly  almost  like  a  dumbass  like
[15:49] an  idiot  convince  yourself  like  i'm 
 saying  this  in  a  good  way  like  an  idiot 
 convince  yourself  that  you've  got  high
[15:54] testosterone  and  you  research  some  of 
 the  symptoms  so  the  symptoms  is  like 
 okay  well  you  put  on  muscle  mass  easy 
 and  you're  like  yep  i've  got  high
[15:59] testosterone  i've  got  high  testosterone 
 i've  got  high  tension  you're  going 
 through  the  mirror  and  you're  like  yeah 
 see  see  i'm  putting  on  so  much  muscle
[16:04] mass  wow  like  you  you're  like  making 
 yourself  believe  it  in  a  really  silly 
 like  almost  like  normies  and  jeffries
[16:10] will  consider  this  cringe  but  you're 
 doing  this  obviously  for  your  own 
 [ __ ]  benefit  and  you'll  pick  up  more 
 on  those  like  positive  you  know  high
[16:16] testosterone  things  inside  of  you  like 
 oh  yeah  see  my  voice  is  deep  i  know  it 
 sounds  cringe  but  when  you  can  you  keep 
 this  belief  in  your  mind  i've  got  high
[16:22] testosterone  my  testosterone  is 
 increasing  it's  getting  higher  and 
 higher  because  i'm  doing  the  right 
 things  it's  like  you'll  pick  up  on  the
[16:27] symptoms  of  higher  testosterone  because 
 you  know  you're  looking  out  for  them  so 
 you  further  solidify  the  belief  and  when 
 you  further  solidify  the  belief  it  seems
[16:34] like  your  body  literally  reacts  to  it 
 i'm  gonna  really  bro  i  never  do  this  if 
 you  watched  a  bunch  of  my  videos  i  never
[16:40] ever  link  anything  else  in  the 
 description  in  terms  of  like  resources 
 and  science  and  [ __ ]  i  hate  doing  that  i
[16:45] hate  this  culture  of  like  we're  supposed 
 to  find  like  sources  for  the  [ __ ]  that 
 we  talk  about  i've  always  hated  that  i 
 just  find  it  cringe  that  all  these  nerds
[16:51] are  like  they'll  say  oh  well  you  know  at 
 15  minutes  you  said  this  sentence  can 
 you  give  me  a  source  for  that  shut  the 
 [ __ ]  up  bro  do  i  look  like  a  nerd  for
[16:56] you  but  this  one  time  i'm  gonna  link 
 something  in  the  description  i'm  gonna
[17:01] go  and  find  the  podcast  by  this  dr 
 andrew  huberman  he's  popped  off  he's  a 
 very  very  good  guy  he's  like  a  very  very
[17:07] very  high  quality  podcast  he's  like  a 
 big  like  proper  scientist  doctor  kind  of 
 guy  and  he  talks  over  like  a  bunch  of
[17:12] like  scientific  research  there  is  one 
 particular  study  that  i'm  gonna  explain 
 to  you  in  my  words  and  i'll  link  the 
 exact  part  where  he  talks  about  it  so  if
[17:18] you  want  to  listen  to  his  sort  of  like 
 proper  scientist  way  listen  to  him  if 
 you  want  to  listen  to  my  soul  bro 
 science  just  dumbed  down  explanation
[17:24] listen  to  me  the  power  of  belief  even 
 scientists  are  [ __ ]  brain  like
[17:29] there  was  a  study  that  this  scientist 
 talks  about  and  he  links  like  you  know 
 the  full  study  okay  a  person  is  given
[17:35] two  milkshakes  one  of  the  milkshakes  is 
 a  healthy  one  it's  high  protein  low  low
[17:41] carbs  low  fat  whatever  i  said  really 
 healthy  and  the  other  milkshake  is  wait 
 you  know  one  of  those  like  unhealthy
[17:46] ones  like  like  high  fat  high  sugar  you 
 know  really  really  high  calories  and 
 everything  right  they  drink  each
[17:51] milkshake  so  they  drink  one  milkshake 
 and  then  their  body  is  analyzed  you  know 
 like  those  in  your  body  like  things 
 change  depending  on  the  macros  that
[17:57] you've  ate  so  for  example  if  you  drink 
 something  with  a  lot  of  sugar  your 
 insulin  spikes  and  all  the  hormones  in 
 your  body  start  like  going  up  or  down
[18:03] and  if  you  drink  something  like  protein 
 then  like  other  things  inside  of  your 
 body  your  muscle  protein  like  all  this 
 like  [ __ ]  inside  of  your  body  changes 
 depending  on  what  you  consume  right  the
[18:09] participant  drinks  the  first  milkshake 
 the  protein  one  and  inside  of  the  body 
 the  protein  like  whatever  was  inside  of
[18:15] the  milkshake  has  the  effect  on  their 
 body  as  assumed  they  wait  a  little  bit 
 the  participant  then  drinks  the  second
[18:20] milkshake  the  high  sugar  high  fat  one 
 whatever  like  you  know  whatever  whatever 
 was  in  this  milkshake  they  do  the
[18:25] analysis  of  what's  inside  their  body  the 
 hormones  and  all  this  stuff  and  as 
 expected  their  insulin  skyrockets
[18:30] essentially  their  body  processed  more 
 calories  because  the  milkshake  was  more 
 calories  so  far  it's  common  sense  they
[18:36] had  a  healthy  shake  and  their  body 
 responded  to  it  in  a  healthy  way  the 
 body  got  essentially  healthier  they  had
[18:41] an  unhealthy  shake  their  body  got  one 
 healthier 
 it  was  the  same  milkshake
[18:46] they  were  given  the  same  milkshake  twice 
 but  their  body  literally  responded  to  it 
 in  a  different  way  they  put  on  more
[18:52] calories  and  more  fat  just  because  they 
 were  told  the  second  milkshake  was  more
[18:57] unhealthy  that  should  blow  your  [ __ ] 
 mind  because  we've  been  told  in  this 
 modern  day  we've  been  told  you  know 
 trust  the  practical  real  world  scientist
[19:04] don't  listen  to  like  you  know  this 
 wishy-washy  kind  of  pseudo  science  and 
 like  imagination  and  visualizations  that
[19:09] seems  very  silly  and  i've  always  anytime 
 someone  used  to  talk  about 
 visualizations  and  affirmations  broke  i 
 thought  they  were  [ __ ]  dumbasses  i
[19:14] thought  that's  weird  as  [ __ ]  get  away 
 from  me  with  your  [ __ ]  i  am  a  strong 
 confident  but  i  always  thought  that  was
[19:19] [ __ ]  cringe  bro  and  now  i  wake  up 
 every  single  day  i  am  a  strong  confident 
 bro  i  wake  up  every  single  day  literally
[19:24] saying  to  myself  yep  i'm  i'm  strong  and 
 i'm  confident  and  i've  got  high 
 testosterone  please  and  it  [ __ ]  works
[19:29] and  there's  another  story  that  the  same 
 the  same  scientist  andrew  huberman  i 
 think  it's  in  the  same  podcast  he
[19:34] mentions  hotel  staff  you  know  the  the 
 ladies  who  work  in  hotels  where  they'll 
 go  and  like  clean  each  room  when  you
[19:40] really  think  about  it  they  do  like  an 
 incredible  amount  of  exercise  imagine 
 like  an  eight  hour  sometimes  ten  hour 
 shift  of  going  through  hotels  changing
[19:46] the  bed  sheets  and  literally  going  from 
 room  to  room  with  like  a  massive  like 
 you  know  they've  got  those  big  trolleys 
 that  you're  like  you  can  steal  from
[19:52] every  now  and  then  they  post  these  big 
 trolleys  go  into  the  room  clean  the  room 
 mop  the  floors  or  whatever  change  the
[19:57] bed  sheet  then  they  go  to  the  next  room 
 the  next  room  the  next  room  they're 
 literally  active  like  they're  on  their 
 feet  for  literally  eight  hours  right
[20:02] every  single  day  they  split  up  into  two 
 groups  so  these  hotel  staff  these  hotel 
 like  cleaners  they  split  up  into  two
[20:08] groups  one  group  nothing  is  changed 
 they're  our  control  group  the  other 
 group  are  told  just  how  much  exercise
[20:13] they're  actually  getting  so  they're  you 
 know  they  sat  down  and  they're 
 instructed  look  you  do  15  000  steps  a
[20:18] day  and  you're  pushing  like  this  much  of 
 this  trolley  and  you  you  know  you  change 
 the  bed  like  this  we've  estimated  that
[20:23] your  total  calorie  burns  for  the  day  is 
 700.  it's  way  more  more  than  you  thought
[20:28] it  was  they're  really  told  okay  you're 
 burning  way  more  calories  than  you  think 
 you  are  and  then  very  importantly  both
[20:33] groups  were  very  controlled  for  their 
 diet  and  their  exercise  outside  of  this 
 study  what  do you  think  happened  so
[20:38] nothing  changed  literally  nothing 
 changed  out  of  these  two  groups  of  women 
 these  cleaners  apart  from  one  was  just
[20:43] told  yeah  you  burn  a lot  of  calories 
 nothing  else  was  changed  they  fully 
 fully  you  know  like  they  control 
 everything  else  and  of  course  you  know
[20:48] you  can't  control  that  one  woman  has 
 like  sex  five  times  in  one  random  day 
 and  she's  [ __ ]  burning  way  more
[20:53] calories  or  one  woman  just  ended  up  like 
 eating  less  on  a  random  day  of  course 
 you  can't  change  everything  but 
 generally  they're  told  this  this  group
[20:59] of  women  burned  way  more  fat  they  lost 
 way  more  weight  simply  by  just  being 
 told  you're  burning  a  lot  of  calories
[21:04] they  burnt  more  calories  they  lost  more 
 weight  the  other  group  of  women  the 
 other  group  of  cleaners  didn't  lose  any
[21:10] extra  weight  even  though  they  were  doing 
 the  exact  same  amount  they  didn't  lose 
 anything  extra  simply  the  power  of 
 belief  the  power  of  like  new  information
[21:16] of  being  told  yep  what  you're  doing  is 
 going  to  have  this  effect  on  you  made 
 that  effect  a  reality  scientists  are
[21:22] pretty  much  just  now  really  discovering 
 the  real  power  of  belief  i  hope  now
[21:27] after  i've  spoke  about  these  two  like 
 studies  and  i'm  sure  like  the  podcast 
 that  i'm  gonna  link  he'll  have  it  all
[21:32] like  all  the  nerdy  [ __ ]  if  you  wanna  go 
 like  yeah  check  the  sources  if  you're  a 
 [ __ ]  geek  but  hopefully  that  adds 
 some  validity  to  what  i'm  saying  here
[21:38] the  power  of  belief  is  extremely 
 important  and  once  again  in  terms  of
[21:43] improving  your  testosterone 
 do  the  right  things  don't  drink  alcohol 
 don't  eat  much  sugar  get  some  sunlight
[21:48] have  some  competition  have  sex  speak  to 
 attractive  women  lift  heavy  weights  get
[21:53] good  amount  of  sleep  okay  we  know  those 
 things  we've  always  known  those  things 
 and  no  one  goes  any  further  than  that 
 but  i  think  the  one  missing  key  for  the
[21:59] majority  of  young  men  if  you've  been 
 watching  those  videos  and  you've  always 
 felt  like  a  level  of  like 
 dissatisfaction  because  you're  like  okay
[22:04] i  do  all  them  and  but  i  still  feel  like 
 i've  got  low  testosterone  the  one  final 
 thing  is  to  start  utilizing  the  power  of 
 belief  to  literally  like  brainwash
[22:10] yourself  to  say  yup  i'm  doing  the  right 
 thing  so  i  have  high  testosterone  i  am 
 experiencing  the  symptoms  of  high
[22:15] testosterone  look  at  that  some  extra 
 muscle  that's  come  to  me  because  i've 
 got  higher  testosterone  when  you  go  to
[22:20] the  gym  this  is  kind  of  separate  but 
 when  i  go  to  the gym  me  and  my  friend 
 chris  back  home  in  warrington  we  really 
 started  doing  this  with  each  other  when
[22:25] we  were  literally  because  we  spoke  about 
 these  studies  and  the  power  of  belief 
 after  we  would  do  our  workout  we  would 
 literally  say  to  each  other  bro  you
[22:30] smash  that  bench  press  today  your  chest 
 is  going  to  get  bigger  and  he's  like 
 yeah  yeah  100  my  chest  is  going to  get 
 bigger  because  of  this  i  really  saw  you
[22:36] push  hard  on  those  tricep  extensions  you 
 went  to  failure  so  your  tricep  going 
 gonna  get  bigger  look  they're  already 
 bigger  right  now  we're  almost  like
[22:41] brainwashing  each  other  because  we 
 understand  that  this  is  how  this  [ __ ] 
 actually  works  best  case  scenario  this 
 is  gonna  get  [ __ ]  deep  inside  best
[22:47] case  scenario  we  got  hyped  like  this  by 
 our  parents  when  we  were  like  little
[22:52] babies  and  children  when  you're  a  little 
 child  it  would  have  been  so  [ __ ] 
 awesome  if  your  your  parents  when  you
[22:57] did  something  like  okay  you  just  stood 
 up  they're  like  oh  my  god  yes  you're  so 
 strong  look  how  well  you're  you're
[23:02] standing  up  and  you  like  catch  a  ball  or 
 you  know  you  like  throw  a  ball  and  it's 
 a  [ __ ]  it's  a  like  [ __ ]  throw  as  you
[23:08] know  little  child  would  but  they're  like 
 oh  my  god  yes  you're  so  good  at  throwing 
 you  would  have  become  better  why  because
[23:13] think  about  it  that's  your  caregiver 
 that's  like  okay  the  person  your  brain 
 and  your  body  is  attached  to  you're  a
[23:18] little  kid  that's  your  caregiver  that's 
 very  important  right  well  if  they're 
 like  hyping  up  after  you've  done 
 something  and  saying  like  you're  so  good
[23:23] at  this  then  you're  gonna  be  more 
 positively  encouraged  to  be  good  at  it 
 to  try  it  again  because  you  know  you've
[23:28] just  seen  your  caregivers  smiling  that 
 does  something  like  a  little  baby  like 
 evolutionarily  it  makes  them  feel  really
[23:33] safe  and  loved  but  if  you  had  more 
 critical  parents  the  kind  of  parents 
 were  when  you  threw  the  ball  we're  like 
 no  no  throw  it  further  come  on  you  can
[23:39] do  better  than  that  no  that  was  a  bad 
 throw  that's  not  how  you  spelled  that 
 word  well 
 what's  that  gonna  do  to  your  beliefs
[23:45] about  yourself  we  can  sit  here 
 and  get  very  sad  about  the  beliefs  that 
 we  have  ingrained  from  childhood  and
[23:51] from  our  experiences  in  school  i  think 
 those  things  are  very  important  but  but 
 all  we  can  do  like  the  best  thing  we  can
[23:57] do  is  think  productively  think 
 positively  and  ask  ourselves  okay  what 
 are  the  best  most  beneficial  thoughts
[24:03] beliefs  and  attitudes  for  me  to  hold 
 right  now  this  is  very  weird  specific
[24:08] practical  advice  these  are  things  like 
 these  general  beliefs  the  word  for  me 
 which  really  means  a  lot  is  force  these
[24:14] beliefs  you  have  to  force  inside  of 
 yourself  because  generally  the  automatic
[24:19] thoughts  that  our  brain  processes  about 
 ourselves  aren't  so  positive  generally 
 our  brains  are  more  critical  because  of
[24:25] things  like  you  know  bad  mental  health 
 and  social  media  and  like  you  know  if 
 you've  been  going  to  the  gym  for  a  while 
 but  there's  a  billion  guys  who  are  on
[24:30] instagram  who've  got  six  packs  and 
 they're  always  posting  like  towel 
 pictures  with  his  eyebrow  like  this

[24:35] dumbass  hamza  in  a  stinky  bathrobe  you 
 know  there's  all  these  other  guys  and  so 
 when  you  see  yourself  in  the  mirror  like
[24:40] and  you've  been  going  to  the  gym  for  a 
 while  you  look  like  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  and 
 you  know  compared  to  other  people  now  of 
 course  you've  made  fantastic  progress
[24:45] you  look  [ __ ]  phenomenal  compared  to 
 what  you  look  like  but  compared  to  some 
 big  bodybuilder  you  look  like  [ __ ]  and
[24:50] that's  the  nature  of  social  media  and  so 
 your  brain  processes  and  says  yep  i'm 
 not  muscular  at  all  in  fact  my  physique
[24:55] is  actually  trash  compared  to  all  these 
 other  guys  that  i'm  seeing  your  brains 
 automatically  visualizing  against  you
[25:01] your  brain  is  automatically  believing 
 things  that  are  bad  for  you  you  have  to
[25:06] consciously  and  almost  forcefully 
 manually 
 say  these  things  you  have  to  like 
 manually  as  if  it  sounds  like  [ __ ]
[25:12] cringe  but  go  look  at  yourself  in  the 
 mirror  and  literally  just  like  force  the 
 words  out  of  your  mouth  and  literally
[25:17] say  yes  i  have  high  testosterone  i  have 
 the  symptoms  of  high  testosterone  muscle 
 look  at  this  muscle  yeah  look  at  this 
 like  lower  body  fat  look  at  like  my
[25:23] jawline  i've  got  the  symptoms  of  high 
 testosterone  because  i  slept  really  well 
 yesterday  so  i'm  gonna  have  higher 
 testosterone  today  i  hit  like  that
[25:29] really  really  good  leg  workout  today  so 
 look  at  my  legs  my  legs  are  gonna  grow 
 today  i'm  eating  this  high  protein  meal
[25:34] right  now  chicken  and  rice  this  is  gonna 
 go  straight  to  my  [ __ ]  quads  and  i'm 
 gonna  get  bigger  and  stronger  because  of 
 this  you  process  these  thoughts  manually
[25:40] forcefully  into  your  mind  and  just  see 
 what  happens  do  this  for  the  next  couple 
 of  months  i  know  that  this  sounds  like
[25:45] wishy-washy  [ __ ]  stupid  advice  but  it 
 truly  truly  transformed  my  life  and  i 
 will  never  go  back  to  not  purposely
[25:51] forcefully  like  visualizing  for  myself  i 
 really  really  hope  it  works  for  you  to
[25:56] do  the  hard  work  especially  when  you 
 don't  feel  like  it
"
uvQyy8ycac4,"[00:00] we  often  insult  jeffrey  at  the  start  of 
 these  videos  but  jeffrey  is  a  young  man 
 who  has  fallen  victim  to  the  modern
[00:06] addictions  modern  technology  social 
 media  hyper-stimulating  porn  and  video 
 games  is  it  jeffrey's  fault  that  he's
[00:13] down  bad  it's  so  easy  for  us  to  make  fun 
 of  him  but  he's  fighting  an  uphill 
 battle  jeffrey  checks  his  phone  and  this
[00:18] notifications  in  a  certain  shade  of  red 
 that  are  so  enticing  that  he  just  can't 
 help  but  to  click  on  them  then  he
[00:23] scrolls  and  scrolls  and  scrolls  falling 
 victim  to  the  social  media  platforms 
 that  use  this  endless  scroll  like  this
[00:29] death  scroll  technology  hours  and  hours 
 and  hours  every  single  day  every  week
[00:34] every  month  every  year  up  until 
 jeffrey's  left  so  depressed  empty
[00:39] nihilistic  unaccomplished  and  then 
 jeffrey  kills  himself  this  isn't  a  meme 
 jeffrey's  a  guy  from  your  high  school
[00:45] picture  your  high  school  class  right  now 
 you  had  maybe  a  main  class  then  you  had 
 a  class  like  maths  and  science  and  stuff
[00:50] and  picture  the  guys  in  your  class 
 see  their  faces  within  a  few  years  at 
 least  one  of  those  faces  that  you've
[00:56] just  seen  in  your  mind  will  kill 
 themselves  you  hear  this  statements  and 
 it  doesn't  you  know  it's  scary
[01:02] it's  dark  to  hear  this  and  you  maybe 
 you'll  see  it  one  day  where  people  are 
 posting  about  on  social  media  but  you
[01:08] never  really  take  the  time  to  visualize 
 the  last  moments  of  a  man  who  literally
[01:13] kills  himself  because  of  the  modern 
 technology  has  made  him  so  depressed 
 he's  crying  he's  fighting  negative
[01:18] thoughts  he's  already  been  thinking 
 about  it  for  a  while  and  then  he  decides 
 to  take  action  constant  overwhelming
[01:25] relentless  negative  thoughts  bad  mental 
 health
[01:30] because  of  these  platforms  he  doesn't 
 want  to  be  this  way  he  doesn't  want  to 
 be  weak  but  the  modern  world  this
[01:35] technology  it's 
 it's 
 extremely  extremely
[01:40] strong  it  is  incredibly  hard  to  overcome 
 the  addictions  that  are  caused  by  things
[01:46] like  modern  social  media  the  smallest 
 things  like  that  shade  of  red 
 notification  they've  optimized  that
[01:52] those  nerds  in  like  silicon  valley  have 
 optimized  that  because  they  know  that 
 that  spikes  something  inside  of  your
[01:57] brain  to  make  you  click  on  it  they 
 understand  like  it's  almost  like  a 
 gambling  machine  where  they  understand 
 that  if  they  show  you  a  good  post  a  post
[02:03] that  they  know  that  you'll  like  followed 
 by  six  posts  that  are  going gonna  be 
 kind  of  boring  and  you  know  just  mild
[02:08] and  then  another  post  that  you  like  that 
 gives  you  dopamine  followed  by  three 
 posts  it's  different  every  time  you
[02:13] don't  know  when  the  next  hit  of  dopamine 
 is  gonna  come  and  it's  so  exciting  it's 
 so  addictive  that's  how  gambling  works 
 imagine  those  people  who  like  just  spent
[02:19] all  day  like  cranking  the  the  gambling 
 machines  they  don't  know  when  the  next 
 big  hit  the  reward  is  gonna  hit  that
[02:24] makes  it  so  much  more  addictive  and 
 these  nerds  know  this  they  specifically
[02:30] create  technology  like  this  knowing  that 
 it  [ __ ]  up  your  mental  health  knowing
[02:35] that  it  leads  to  people  killing 
 themselves  and  they  do  it  with  a  smile 
 on  their  face  because  these  nerds  who 
 work  at  like  facebook  get  paid  500k  a
[02:42] year  for  being  the  death  of  society  when 
 you  think  about  the  most  powerful  person 
 the  most  powerful  people  of  society  you
[02:48] might  think  of  like  donald  trump  like 
 the  president  wouldn't  you  maybe  you 
 think  of  like  some  big  strong  looking
[02:53] guy  but  it's  not  it's  a  nerd  with  like  a 
 tucked  in  shirt  forward  neck  posture 
 hunched  over  shoulders  i'm  telling  you
[02:58] right  now  this  is  going  to  sound  weird 
 nerds  silicon  valley  nerds  are  more 
 powerful  than  any  president  of  any
[03:04] country  they  control  who  is  the 
 president  how  do  people  get  picked  for
[03:09] like  presidency  how  do  people  like  vote 
 through  the  information  that  they  get 
 and  information  is  controlled  again  by
[03:14] these  like  silicon  valley  nerds  the 
 people  in  silicon  valley  these  tech  like 
 nerds
[03:19] control  who  gets  to  be  president  by  the 
 control  of  information  they  control  what
[03:24] [ __ ]  up  your  mental  health  what  news 
 goes  viral  and  what  news  doesn't  and  the 
 biggest  thing  that  they  want  why  these
[03:29] like  guys  these  little  nerds  are 
 employed  into  these  big  companies  like 
 facebook  retention  there's  one  main
[03:34] reason  why  these  people  are  employed 
 it's  for  retention  to  retain  you  to  keep 
 you  on  the  platform  for  longer  and
[03:39] longer  and  longer  imagine  these  guys  are 
 very  very  smart  these  are  like  extremely
[03:45] smart  like  geeks  they're  being  employed 
 paid  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars 
 per  year  and  their  sole  mission  is  to
[03:51] make  the  platform  more  addictive  then 
 imagine  if  this  company  has  hundreds  of
[03:56] these  employees  the  best  smartest  minds 
 and  these  like  these  nerds  bro  they're 
 optimizing  [ __ ]  they're  literally  taking
[04:01] like  nootropics  you  know  like  brain 
 altering  like  pills  and  not  like  they 
 they  do  some  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  up  [ __ ]  to  like
[04:07] improve  their  performance  their 
 cognitive  ability  to  write  better  code 
 to  come  up  with  more  ideas  all  of  these 
 guys  like  micro  dosing  and  everything
[04:13] that  is  what  we're  up  against  you  know 
 you  wanted  to  like  take  a  step  back  from 
 porn  or  video  games  or  social  media  you
[04:19] are  just  one  young  man  going  against 
 hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  these
[04:24] software  developers  these  data  analysis 
 they  know  everything  i  just  made  a  video
[04:29] which  is  gonna  go  live  like  today  it's 
 monday  the  18th  you  can  go  find  on  my 
 channel  it's  just  literally  titled 
 delete  instagram  now  and  i  was  telling
[04:35] you  the  story  of  like  what's  made  me 
 delete  my  instagram  which  i  got  [ __ ] 
 pissed  right  i  spent  an  hour  on  the
[04:40] platform  when  i  didn't  mean  to  i 
 literally  meant  to  just  go  on  to  it  to 
 send  a  single  message  and  i  ended  up 
 scrolling  for  over  an  hour  and  a  half
[04:46] seeing  like  50  different  girl  profiles 
 and  like  oh  my  god  this  girl's  got  big 
 titties  and  she's  not  that  far  away  so 
 like  my  evolutionary  brain  is  getting
[04:52] excited  but  then  the  next  profile  that  i 
 click  on  it's  like  a  big  muscular  guy  so 
 it's  like  oh  [ __ ]  that's  really  scary
[04:58] think  about  what's  that  what  that  is 
 doing  to  your  psychological  like  space
[05:03] and  then  i  said  in  this  video  that  the 
 way  i  expressed  my  frustration  for  when
[05:08] that  happened  you  know  i  spent  too  long 
 on  instagram  was  by  grabbing  my  phone 
 going  on  to  my  instagram  stories  and
[05:13] recording  myself  like  being  frustrated  i 
 was  frustrated  at  instagram  and  i  went 
 on  instagram  to  vent  my  frustration  i
[05:20] said  that  i  sat  there  for  a  second  and  i 
 literally  looked  at  the  camera  and  said 
 oh  [ __ ]  they  have  us  by  the  balls  you
[05:26] don't  realize  how  addicted  you  are  and 
 the  people  are  around  you  hopefully 
 you're  one  of  the  very  few  people  who've
[05:31] made  some  good  progress  here  and  if  you 
 have  if  right  now  you're  watching  this 
 and  you've  made  some  pretty  good
[05:36] progress  reducing  your  social  media  time 
 reducing  how  much  you  watch  porn  or  play 
 video  games  right  now  you  know  yeah  it's
[05:42] nice  you  you  know  you're  acknowledging 
 it  fair  enough  you  don't  realize  what 
 you've  just  done  you  have  just  done
[05:48] something  that  should  be  impossible  if 
 you  have  made  progress  to  reduce  your 
 social  media  use  that  literally  means
[05:54] you  are  winning  against  these  thousands 
 of  nerds  their  total  pay  is  in  the
[05:59] hundreds  of  millions  per  company  if  not 
 more  you  versus  thousands  of  nerds  who
[06:04] are  microdosing  who  are  on  nootropics 
 who  are  like  literally  employed  just  to
[06:09] make  sure  you  stay  addicted  to  the 
 platform  if  you've  made  any  progress  at 
 all  bro  holy  [ __ ]  you're  a  [ __ ]
[06:15] legend  and  if  you  haven't  if  right  now 
 you  still  feel  like  you  are  in  the 
 depths  of  like  social  media  addiction
[06:20] porn  addiction  video  game  addiction  it's 
 all  the  same  when  i  talk  about  these 
 like  silicon  valley  nerds  for  like 
 facebook  it's  also  the  same  nerds  who
[06:26] are  designing  like  porn  up  it's  also  the 
 same  nerds  who  are  designing  like  video 
 games  it's  all  the  same  kind  of 
 technology  all  of  these  nerds  have  been
[06:33] hired  literally  for  the  one  cause  of 
 retention  make  people  stay  here  for 
 longer  if  you  haven't  made  great
[06:38] progress  just  yet  and  you  find  yourself 
 okay  you  are  still  in  the  depths  of  this 
 addiction  it's  not  your  fault  it  is
[06:44] perhaps  one  of  the  hardest  like  modern 
 day  rites  of  passage  that  you  could  ever 
 come  across  is  taking  a  step  back  i  just
[06:50] want  you 
 to  see  the  life  that  is  waiting  for  you 
 on  a  practical  sense  if  you  cut  out  this
[06:56] cancer  from  your  life  the  three  big 
 things  social  media  video  games  and  porn
[07:01] on  a  practical  sense  you  will  save 
 probably  more  than  10  hours  per  week 
 that's  realistic  isn't  it  it's  probably
[07:07] more  than  that  that  10  hours  is 
 literally  how  you  as  a  young  ambitious 
 man  are  able  to  build  your  kingdom  the
[07:13] progress  that  you  wanted  you  know  you've 
 always  wanted  to  like  be  financially 
 free  and  have  freedom  and  success  and
[07:18] confidence  it  comes  from  being  in 
 control  of  your  time  when  you  have  time
[07:23] you  can  then  go  invest  that  into  things 
 like  learning  getting  therapy  spending 
 time  in  nature  sleeping  more  all  of
[07:28] these  things  which  are  so  good  for  you 
 and  then 
 when  you  start  putting  that  time  when 
 you're  like  a  healthy  person  and  you  put
[07:34] that  time  then  into  a  business  a  career 
 your  studies  you  get  that  success  that
[07:39] you've  always  wanted  you  feel  more 
 confident  and  you're  making  money  and 
 you  can  give  money  to  your  family  i  was 
 only  ever  able  to  make  any  progress  in
[07:46] life  and  feel  productive  in  life  at  age 
 22.  guess  what  i  did  i  cut  it  all  off  at 
 the  same  time  social  media  video  games
[07:52] and  porn  at  the  same  time  may  2020  i  cut 
 it  all  off  and  that  was  literally  the 
 start  of  like  the  new  chapter  of  my  life
[07:58] and  i  became  very  successful  after  that 
 because  i  saved  all  this  time  now  my 
 mental  power  like  my  mental  focus  isn't
[08:04] going  to  like  these  girls  just  showing 
 ass  on  instagram  finally  i'm  harnessing 
 it  for  myself  and  i'm  thinking  okay
[08:10] let's  put  in  some  [ __ ]  work  for 
 myself  for  once  let's  gather  my 
 attention  my  focus  into  my  own  things
[08:16] that  will  actually  develop  my  life 
 rather  than  consuming  this  mindless 
 content  that  is  a  modern  day  rite  of
[08:21] passage  for  men  i  want  you  to  just  see 
 the  vision  that  i  see  first  the  negative
[08:26] vision  if  you  don't  make  progress  in 
 this  if  you  continue  to  be  somewhat  of  a
[08:31] normal  person  who  makes  excuses  even 
 though  even  though  your  excuses  seem 
 valid  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  oh  i  can't  delete
[08:37] instagram  and  snapchat  because  there's 
 someone  to  message  shut  the  [ __ ]  up 
 don't  you  [ __ ]  say  that  to  yourself
[08:42] don't  you  sell  yourself  short  don't  you 
 like  advertise  for  these  nerds  oh  but
[08:47] there's  messages  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  if 
 there  was  important  messages  for  you  to 
 reply  to  on  facebook  instagram  whatever
[08:53] bro  you'd  have  each  other's  phone 
 numbers  if  they  don't  have  your  phone 
 number  if  you  don't  have  theirs  if  you 
 don't  text  each  other  it  wasn't  ever
[08:58] that  important  it's  not  you  talking  this 
 is  so  so  [ __ ]  interesting  when  you
[09:03] argue  for  something  that  you  know  is  so 
 totally  bad  for  you  social  media  video
[09:08] games  and  porn  when  you  argue  for  it 
 that  isn't  even  you  thinking  that's  the 
 addiction  it's  the  same  way  the  heroin
[09:14] addicts  say  like  oh  no  but  it's  good  for 
 me  i  can't  stop  [ __ ]  weed  smokers 
 every  day  like  oh  nobody  it  makes  me  a
[09:19] lot  it  makes  me  crave  it  it's  not  even 
 that  bad  video  game  as  well  but  it's  a 
 video  game  ideas  and  i  might  be  in
[09:24] esports  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  yeah  i  might  be 
 an  esports  player  it's  the  same  way  fat 
 people  talk  about  like  unhealthy  food
[09:29] that  is  the  addiction  talking  become 
 aware  of  it  become  aware  when  you  have  a
[09:34] thought  that  is  not  in  your  best 
 interest  and  realize  that  is  like  the 
 jeffrey  part  of  your  brain  that's  trying 
 to  keep  you  weak  this  may  be  some  of  the
[09:40] weirdest  most  specific  like 
 weirdest  [ __ ]  advice  you've  ever
[09:45] heard  before 
 a  lot  of  the  times  you  can't  trust  your 
 own  brain  a  lot  of  the  times  your  brain
[09:50] will  push  you  like  your  entire  body  will 
 crave  things  that  aren't  good  for  you 
 you  know  this  you  will  get  cravings  for
[09:55] things  that  aren't  good  for  you  porn 
 video  games  junk  food  drugs  you'll  get 
 cravings  for  them  you  will  have  every
[10:01] reason  to  believe  that  you  want  those 
 things  you  don't  you  rationally  know  you 
 objectively  know  that  these  things  are
[10:06] bad  for  you  but  you  have  this  feeling 
 inside  of  you  and  the  majority  of  young 
 men  are  so  weak  so  uncertain  so  unaware
[10:13] that  this  like  this  is  a  concept  that 
 you  have  like  a  jeffrey  brain  that  they 
 listen  to  it
[10:18] they  feel  like  watching  porn  so  they 
 watch  porn  they  feel  like  there's  a  good 
 reason  to  be  on  social  media  so  they  go
[10:23] on  social  media  they  don't  realize  that 
 a  lot  of  the  things  like  the  feelings 
 that  you  have  and  the  thoughts  that  you
[10:28] have  don't  actually  serve  you  they  are 
 manipulated  your  thoughts  and  your 
 feelings  and  your  desires  and  your
[10:33] cravings  are  manipulated  by  the  modern 
 addictions  these  nerds  are  being  paid  a 
 very  good  price  to  manipulate  your  brain
[10:40] and  to  make  you  feel  like  you  need  to 
 stay  on  to  the  platform  because 
 otherwise  you're  going  to  miss  out  and 
 you're  going to  be  lonely  but  i  need  to 
 be  on  there  to  message  people  that  is  in
[10:46] your  brain  talking  it's  the  message 
 that's  been  implanted  by  these  [ __ ] 
 nerds  who  want  to  make  you  feel  like
[10:51] you're  going  to  miss  out  for  more  fear 
 of  missing  out  that's  literally  what 
 they've  implanted  into  your  brain  if
[10:57] there  was  an  important  conversation  if 
 there  was  an  important  person  that  you 
 valued  you  would  have  each  other's  phone
[11:02] number  and  you  would  text  each  other  you 
 would  call  or  you  would  send  messages  on 
 like  whatsapp  if  they  don't  have  your
[11:07] phone  number  if  you  don't  have  theirs 
 that  conversation  was  never  important  77

 you  and  you  exchange  instagrams  and  she

 last  six  months  i  kind  of  just  like
[11:42] forgotten  i  just  thought  oh  yeah  you

 around  to  live  that  life  with  improved 
 mental  health  a  cult  of  young  men  who
[14:32] are  literally  gratitude  journaling  and 
 not  jacking  off  watching  porn  anymore 
 and  meditating  going  out  to  the  gym
[14:38] building  a  body  that  we're  like  proud  of 
 and  we  that  gives  us  confidence  and 
 happiness  bringing  our  brothers  up  this

 decisions  you  ever  make  in  your  life  it

 your  mind  right  now  see  yourself  in
[15:00] third  person  right  now  like  this  is  i

 really  see  yourself  in  third  person  and 
 just  see  yourself  finally  doing  those
[15:07] right  habits  almost  like  flashes  of  you 
 just  being  [ __ ]  productive  running 
 around  like  lifting  weights  looking
[15:13] [ __ ]  sick  looking  like  stylish  as 
 [ __ ]  you've  been  improving  yourself 
 you're  doing  like  weird  habits  like
[15:18] meditating  and  journaling  all  that  [ __ ] 
 that  you  knew  like  you've  been  told  so 
 many  times  that  you  should  do  that  stuff
[15:23] that  you  should  prioritize  your  sleep 
 that  you  shouldn't  be  watching  porn  or 
 video  games  like  you've  taken  a  step 
 back  from  that  you've  raised  your
[15:28] slunken  head  away  from  your  computer 
 screen  and  you're  out  there  like 
 navigating  like  penetrating  through  the
[15:33] world  a  confident  smile  on  your  face 
 finally  the  life  that  you've  wanted  to 
 live  and  that's  just  that's  literally
[15:38] the  short  term  that's  the  life  you  will 
 live 
 weeks  from  now  weeks  from  now  you  can
[15:43] have  that  life  close  your  eyes  once  more 
 and  now  see  this  in  the  long  term  see 
 years  fly  by  years  of  you  living  a  life
[15:49] like  this  and  you  see  the  people  around 
 you  just  live  in  like  that  unideal  bad 
 habit  and  it's  so  different  to  the  way
[15:54] that  you've  been  living  and  the  law  of 
 the  compound  effect  starts  really 
 hitting  and  your  life  is  so  so  different
[15:59] after  implementing  and  staying 
 consistent  in  all  of  these  good  habits 
 you're  a  lot  older  and  more  mature  and
[16:04] like  you  look  built  and  successful  and 
 productive  your  mental  health  is  so 
 [ __ ]  good  whilst  other  people  that
[16:09] you  know  have  literally  killed 
 themselves  and  then 
 close  your  eyes  once  more
[16:15] years  from  now  you  meet  her  and  she  has 
 been  on  the  same  journey  as  you  and  you 
 have  children  and  you're  the  kind  of
[16:21] father  who  has  been  meditating  for  years 
 who's  physically  mentally  healthy  who's 
 grateful  and  present
[16:27] warm  loving  you've  got  brothers  around 
 you  men  that  you  really  respect  who  have 
 been  on  the  same  pathway  you  teach  your
[16:33] son  these  things  and  he  lives  a  life 
 just  like  you  through  your  son's  eyes
[16:38] imagine  what  he  sees  when  it's  time  for 
 him  to  go  to  school  he's  let's  say  he's 
 a  teenager  he's  in  high  school  imagine
[16:43] how 
 dark  and  deep  the  addictions  of  his 
 generation  will  be  how  different  your
[16:49] son  will  be  because  of  you  and  the 
 actions  that  you  take  today  if  there's 
 one  message  i  could  ever  give  you  one
[16:55] piece  of  advice  you  could  ever  take  from

 at  my  computer  desk  doing  deep  work  now 
 Focus  work  like  this  has  built  my  entire
[00:06] business  I've  almost  retired  my  entire 
 family 
 my  phone  rings
[00:12] Focus  lost 
 thanks  baby  I  hope  this  is  important
[00:17] but  it  never  is  now  I'm  in  the  kitchen 
 making  tea  and  it's  all  splashing 
 everywhere  it's  a  health  hazard  but  then
[00:22] I  feel  hands  start  caressing  me  and  she 
 looks  up  at  me  so  lovingly
[00:28] God  she's  so  [ __ ]  annoying  I'm 
 walking  through  the  bathroom  door  and 
 then  I  hear  footsteps  behind  me  I  got
[00:34] lonely  can  I  come  with  you  what  it's 
 been  three  seconds
[00:40] and  then  I'm  at  the  front  door  of  our 
 house  and  I  hear  shuffling  behind  me
[00:45] it's  her 
 and  her  bags  are  packed  I  kiss  my 
 girlfriend  goodbye  not  knowing  when  I'm 
 gonna  see  her  again  we  both  wave  to  each
[00:52] other  she  gets  into  the  car  pulls  out  of 
 the  driveway  and  a  car  disappears  into
[00:57] the  distance  she  does  this  commute  every 
 single  weekend
[01:02] 460  miles  it  takes  her  around  eight 
 hours  to  come  and  see  me
[01:08] and  spend  about  six  hours  with  me  she 
 would  be  a  terrible  entrepreneur  with
[01:13] that  kind  of  return  on  investments 
 but  she  is  actually  an  awesome 
 girlfriend  even  though  I  call  her
[01:18] annoying  I'm  glad  it's  her  who's 
 annoying  me  so  I'll  take  every

[01:42] Rogan  has  problems  Elon  Musk  Jeff  Bezos 
 Mark  Zuckerberg  they  all  have  problems

 choose  which  problems  you  want  to  solve
[01:52] and  trying  to  make  money  is  all  about 
 solving  problems  so  are  you  going  to 
 choose  the  problems  that  feel  brain
[01:58] numbing  and  boring 
 and  pointless 
 or  might  it  be  better  to  choose  the
[02:06] problems  that  get  you  up  out  of  bed 
 first  thing  in  the  morning  where  you 
 feel  super  motivated  disciplined  and
[02:12] excited  to  work  on  them  choosing  the 
 right  problem  to  solve  for  money  is 
 going  to  be  the  difference  between
[02:18] feeling  purposeful  or  feeling  lost  it's 
 going  to  be  the  difference  between 
 building  a  business  that  thrives  or  one

 benefit  with  money  you  can  provide  you
[03:07] can  support  your  parents  who  are  edging 
 closer  to  a  retirement  that  they  have 
 not  even  saved  up  enough  money  for  think
[03:12] about  it  your  parents  may  not  have 
 enough  money  to  stop  working  even  when
[03:19] they're  old  even  when  your  mother  has 
 arthritis  in  her  fingers  and  your  dad  is
[03:24] suffering  from  prostate  cancer  they 
 won't  be  able  to  stop  working  because 
 they'll  need  money  with  money  you  can
[03:30] save  your  future  wife  from  needing  to 
 get  on  public  transport  every  single  day 
 where  there's  men  who  will  literally
[03:36] brush  up  past  her 
 literally  pressing  their  crotch  like
[03:41] into  her  slightly  as  they  walk  past  just 
 so  they  can  feel  like  a  little  tingle  in 
 their  dick
[03:49] you  want  that  to  happen  to  your  future 
 wife 
 and  with  money

[04:13] what  we're  gonna  walk  through  in  this 
 full  Guide  to  Money  this  deserves  your
[04:18] full  attention  so  I  recommend  that  you 
 put  this  full  screen  you  take  your 
 scrubby  little  fingers  off  the  mouse  and
[04:23] off  your  phone  and  you  just  stare  at 
 this  with  the  best  Focus  that  you  can 
 come  up  with  I've  been  waking  up  at  5am
[04:29] every  single  morning  to  make  this  guide 
 and  not  only  that  for  the  last  three 
 years  I  have  worked  ruthlessly  hard  on
[04:35] my  business  to  create  the  level  of 
 success  that  I  have  I'm  gonna  be  sharing 
 those  lessons  from  my  own  business  and
[04:40] also  the  hundreds  of  hours  that  I've  put 
 into  learning  about  money  from  books  and
[04:45] courses  and  seminars  and  programs  and 
 teachers  if  you're  broke  this  is  going 
 to  be  perfect  for  you  if  right  now
[04:50] you're  jumping  around  from  business 
 model  to  business  model  Tate  said  that 
 this  business  model  is  good  Iman  said
[04:55] this  one  happens  I  said  be  a  YouTuber 
 and  you  don't  even  know  which  path  to 
 stick  to  this  is  really  going  to  help
[05:01] you  if  you  already  have  started  to  make 
 some  progress  in  your  business  and  you 
 want  to  start  to  scale  and  see  more
[05:06] results  this  is  going  to  help  you  and  if 
 you're  actually  quite  Advanced  and  quite 
 rich  and  you've  got  money  to  spend  then
[05:12] this  guide  will  also  help  you  step  one  a 
 more  powerful  money  mindset
[05:18] think  about  how  sad  this  is 
 that  making  money  is  the  overlapping
[05:24] directing  force  in  the  majority  of 
 people's  lives  by  the  time  they're  15  16
[05:30] 17  years  old  the  concept  of  making  money 
 is  like  very  very  important  is  just
[05:35] implanted  in  and  that  is  like  their 
 priority  for  the  rest  of  their  lives  how 
 their  entire  life  is  set  up  who  they
[05:41] spend  time  with  who  they  are  as  a  person 
 how  they  dress  it's  all  just  related  to 
 their  career  now  Imagine  This
[05:48] the  majority  of  people  don't  even 
 fulfill  this  goal 
 they  dedicate  their  entire  lives  to  a
[05:55] goal  and  they  don't  even  accomplish  it
[06:02] that  should  really  make  you  sad  like 
 imagine  those  goals  that  you  have  in 
 your  mind  and  imagine  if  you  try  to
[06:07] accomplish  one  of  those  goals  for  the 
 rest  of  your  life  and  you  dedicated  as
[06:12] much  of  your  life  as  like  the  average 
 person  did  and  you  still  weren't  even 
 close  to  accomplishing  it  the  average
[06:18] person  works  so  hard 
 they  actually  do  genuinely  dedicate
[06:23] their  lives  to  making  money  and  then  at 
 60  years  old  they've  still  got  nothing 
 to  show  for  it  because  they're  going
[06:29] about  it  the  wrong  way 
 they  think  that  they  can  just  get  a 
 career  and  that  hopefully  they'll  be
[06:35] fine  that  hopefully  Daddy  the  boss  will 
 take  care  of  them  many  young  men  know 
 that  that's  not  the  case  we  know  that  we
[06:41] have  to  grip  Life  by  the  horns  and 
 direct  it  to  where  we  want  to  go
[06:47] so  I  want  you  to  do  something  very 
 important 
 think  about  what  you  want  the  money  for
[06:54] think  about  what  you'll  buy  think  about 
 the  lifestyle  that  you  want  maybe  you'll
[06:59] see  flashes  of  how  Andrew  Tate  is  living 
 the  watches  the  cars  maybe  there's
[07:04] parties  that  you  want  to  go  to  maybe 
 there's  women  who  you  want  to  look  at 
 you  whilst  you're  wearing  the  nice  suits
[07:11] forget  all  of  it 
 destroy
[07:16] all  of  those  desires
[07:21] if  you  really  want  this  full  guide  to 
 help  you 
 you  must  understand
[07:26] 99  of  people  make  no  progress  in  making 
 money  do  they
[07:31] so  why  are  you  still  trying  to  go 
 through  the  same  route  as  the  99
[07:37] the  99  dream  of  the  same  things  as  you 
 they  want  the  flashy  cars  they  want  the
[07:43] fame 
 so  you  know  the  better  way  to  start 
 making  money
[07:49] is  the  start  with  a  way  more  powerful 
 mindset  which  is  so  interesting  because
[07:54] the  most  powerful  mindset  that  you  can 
 have  to  start  making  money
[07:59] is  to  not  give  a  [ __ ]  about  it  it's  to 
 not  care  about  it  at  all  it's  the  almost
[08:05] devalue  money  and  think  to  yourself  that 
 I  don't  even  want  to  buy  anything
[08:10] now  this  isn't  to  say  that  we're  not 
 going  to  make  money  this  isn't  to  say 
 that  we're  not  going  to  be  able  to 
 eventually  buy  things  but  when  you're
[08:15] first  starting  off  your  greatest 
 priority  should  be  to  have  a  clear  mind 
 so  that  you  can  focus  on  your  business
[08:21] or  maybe  high  level  career 
 too  many  people  are  so  pulled  by  these
[08:27] materialistic  desires  that  then  they 
 have  no  hope  of  ever  amassing  like  real 
 wealth  because  if  they  do  make  any
[08:33] progress  in  business  they  wipe  it  down 
 by  just  buying  the  thing  that  they 
 thought  they  were  supposed  to  buy  when
[08:38] they  don't  realize  that  the  person  who's 
 showing  you  that  lifestyle  with  the 
 watch  and  the  cars
[08:43] one  they've  got  a  lot  more  money  so  they 
 can  spend  it  on  those  things  but  two  the 
 thing  is  even  for  them  it  wasn't  that
[08:49] much  of  a  smart  purchase  either 
 to  stay  hooked  at  this  level  right  now
[08:55] where  you  look  up  to  the  big  boys  and 
 you  think  oh  I  want  the  the  private  jets 
 I'm  on  the  car  I  want  to  be  able  to  move
[09:00] out 
 these  things  you  can  eventually  get  but 
 only  if  you  stop  caring  about  them  right
[09:05] now  because  you  know  what  happens  when 
 you  care  about  these  things 
 you're  gonna  go  watch  another  five  hour
[09:10] tape  podcast  and  cope  and  say  that  it 
 was  productive
[09:15] right  you're  gonna  go  keep  watching  more 
 teach  shorts  but  you're  still  broke  it's
[09:20] not  actually  helping  you  that  much 
 if  that's  all  it  takes  someone  with  a
[09:25] fancy  watch  to  literally  steal  an  hour 
 or  two  of  your  time  if  that's  all  it 
 takes  then  how  are  you  gonna  become
[09:30] successful  do  you  think  those  successful 
 people  who  show  you  that  lifestyle  are
[09:35] sat  there  right  now  looking  at  people 
 showing  their  lifestyle 
 they're  working
[09:41] so  you  need  to  stop  this  fascination 
 with  spending  with  materialism  to  with
[09:48] needing  more  and  at  this  level  let's 
 assume  you  are  totally  broke  you  want  to 
 know  the  best  advice  I  could  give  to  you
[09:54] act  and  think  like  a  stoic 
 like  these  things  are  beneath  you  like
[10:00] you  have  no  it  you  don't  even  care  about 
 these  worldly  things  hey  you  are  a  man
[10:06] of  character  a  man  of  of  mental  strength 
 think  like  a  stoic  that  you  don't  need
[10:11] more  than  any  desire  you  get  for  wanting 
 more  wanting  this  object  wanting  that 
 car  wanting  those  clothes  you  just
[10:17] destroy  it  you  just  see  it  for  what  it 
 actually  is  a  mirage  of  the  thing  that 
 you  really  wanted  you  never  wanted  the
[10:23] clothing  or  or  the  the  car
[10:28] you  want  to  love 
 you  wanted  Health  you  wanted  Community 
 you  wanted  sunlight  and  sleep
[10:35] you  wanted  some  kind  of  way  to 
 contribute  to  your  people
[10:41] when  you  start  with  this  mindset  you'll 
 actually  go  on  to  make  a  lot  more  money
[10:46] because  you  come  from  a  place  of 
 abundance 
 of  like  yeah  if  I  make  money  that's
[10:52] awesome  it's  not  that  I  hate  money 
 yeah  if  I  make  some  awesome  sweet
[10:57] but  I  am  who  I  am  with  or  without  the 
 money 
 and  imagine  this  compared  to  the  people
[11:03] you  know  your  age  who  was  the  exact 
 opposite  who  are  crazy  like  skimping
[11:09] trying  to  get  as  many  pennies  as 
 possible 
 you  probably  know  someone  in  your  family 
 who  will  happily  waste  an  hour  of  their
[11:15] life  to  save  one  dollar  don't  you 
 think  about  how  mad  that  is  they  could 
 work  minimum  wage  make  ten  dollars  but
[11:21] they'll  spend  an  hour  of  their  life  to 
 save  one  dollar  this  is  what  happens 
 when  you  get  in  this  ultimate  scarcity
[11:27] mode  and  you  see  all  these  pictures  you 
 know  women  see  like  Kim  Kardashian  in 
 the  fancy  dress  and  they're  like  oh  wow
[11:32] okay  if  I  get  that  that's  what  success 
 looks  like  then  everyone  will  kind  of 
 validate  me  and  I'll  get  the  you  know
[11:37] the  unconditional  love  that  I  wanted  as 
 a  child  and  for  the  young  men  seeing  the 
 gentleman  up  there  who  have  got  the  nice
[11:42] suits  the  watches  the  cars  the  lifestyle 
 the  women  hey  you  are  like  a  little  dog
[11:47] looking  up  in  master  and  ask  you  know 
 like  he  he's  got  a  new  two  hour  five 
 hour  video  but  there's  no  actual  real
[11:53] value 
 but  here  you  are  just  watching  like  a 
 fan
[11:58] not  really  gaining  anything  but  just 
 watching 
 listening  to  their  every  word
[12:07] not  only  do  you  need  a  strong  mindset  at 
 this  stage 
 you  need  to  bring  this  into  real  life
[12:14] and  start  to  live  in  a  like  a  very  cheap 
 low  expense  life
[12:20] to  take  the  pressure  off  you  can  you  see 
 the  advantage  of  this  because  if  right 
 here  right  now  you  are  totally  broke  but
[12:26] you  desire  these  these  expensive  things 
 you  will  act  in  such  like  a  short  term
[12:31] like  money  grabbing  kind  of  way  and 
 usually  those  kinds  of  people  don't  do
[12:36] so  well  in  business 
 instead  if  at  this  level  you're  able  to
[12:42] create  a  life  and  also  a  mind  which 
 doesn't  actually  need  much  it  doesn't
[12:47] need  much  material  success  that  brings 
 you  strength  in  business  that  will  make
[12:52] you  a  stronger  entrepreneur  because  any 
 money  you  make  will  feel  nice  but  you'll 
 think  to  yourself  like  I  don't  even  care
[12:58] about  spending  it  right  now 
 so  I  I'll  just  reinvest  it  back  into  my
[13:04] business  which  will  make  more  money  and 
 more  money  and  more  money  so  if  you're
[13:09] living  at  home  with  your  parents  right 
 now  and  you  want  to  move  out  you  know 
 it's  not  perfect  you  don't  have  enough
[13:14] space  or  freedom  and  if  you're  being 
 honest  you'd  like  to  live  by  yourself  so 
 that  you  could  [ __ ]  let's  just  be  honest
[13:20] don't  [ __ ]  lie 
 you'd  like  to  be  able  to  invite  some 
 friends  over  and  get  some  kind  of 
 validation  that  you've  got  your  own
[13:25] place  you'd  like  to  be  able  to  hop  on 
 Tinder  and  Instagram  maybe  get  some 
 girls  you  know  bring  like  a  date  back
[13:30] it'd  be  nice  right 
 what  if  just  for  now 
 you  just  click  your  fingers  and  just
[13:35] destroy  that  desire  from  your  mind  and 
 suddenly 
 that  monthly  expense  of  like  a  thousand
[13:41] dollars  has  just  disappeared 
 it's  taken  some  level  of  of  pressure  off
[13:48] that  you  needed  to  make  money  right  now 
 that  is  a  gift  to  your  future  self
[13:53] because  now  your  future  self  can  think 
 for  the  long  term  how  to  make  not  just
[13:58] like  an  okay  amount  of  money  1000  a 
 month  but  how  to  make  a  way  more
[14:04] for  me  in  2020  this  is  exactly  what  I 
 did 
 I  already  was  renting  an  apartment  I  was
[14:10] living  with  my  girlfriend  who  I  was  with 
 at  the  time  people  both  like  Gamers  I
[14:15] had  a  full-on  gaming  PC  she  did  I  had  a 
 gamer  girlfriend  who  I  got  to  have  sex 
 with  every  day  you  know  how  awesome  is
[14:20] that  there  I  am  living  in  the  city 
 thinking  that  I'm  an  adult  and 
 everything  I've  got  a  full-time  job  like
[14:25] somewhat  comfortable  life  and  I  smoke 
 weed  so  it's  like  you  know  it's  kind  of 
 fun  we  eat  junk  food  and  stuff  we've  got 
 a  nice  physique  I  had  a  couple  of
[14:30] friends 
 and  that  made  me  a  garbage  entrepreneur
[14:35] every  little  business  model  that  you 
 know  someone  would  be  talking  about  on 
 YouTube  I'd  try  it  but  I'd  need  to  make
[14:41] money  fast  and  I  couldn't  because  I 
 needed  to  work  full  time  I  needed  to  say 
 like  you  know  try  and  save  money  but 
 make  money  and  imagine  how  much  there  is
[14:47] in  your  mind  when  you've  got  all  of 
 these  random  things  that  are  that  are 
 taking  from  your  bank  account  that  are
[14:52] taking  from  your  energy  account  from 
 your  time
[14:57] so  what  did  I  do 
 I  downscaled  my  life  I  took  a  hit  to  my
[15:02] ego  to  this  this  materialism  that 
 everyone  values 
 and  I  moved  out  of  the  apartments
[15:08] and  where  did  I  move  to  I  moved  back 
 home  with  my  family
[15:13] no  [ __ ]  no  weed  no  friends  coming 
 over 
 just  work  and  when  I  moved  back  I  didn't
[15:20] go  with  this  idea  of  like  okay  as  soon 
 as  I  make  money  I'm  gonna  move  back  out 
 because  I  I  knew  I  could  just  feel  that
[15:26] if  I  am  obsessed  and  needy  with  money 
 that  it's  gonna  be  elusive  away  from  me
[15:32] but  if  I  act  like  I  don't  even  need  it 
 then  it  will  come  towards  me  exactly 
 like  a  woman
[15:38] and  so  with  absolute  minimum  expenses 
 I  started  my  business  here  in  this  very
[15:45] house 
 and  there  was  actually  a  point  where  I 
 considered  getting  a  job  you  know
[15:51] just  today  we  drove  past  the  warehouse 
 that  I  went  for  an  induction  at  Royal
[15:56] Mail  if  Royal  Mail  is  like  the  postage 
 service  a  big  Warehouse  close  to  my 
 house
[16:01] we  drove  past  that  today  and  I  couldn't 
 help  but  think  back  to  like  the 
 induction  day  that  I  had  there  that  I
[16:06] literally  went  when  I  was  trying  to 
 become  a  YouTuber  100  subscribers  200 
 subscribers  and  I  thought  you  well  you
[16:11] know  maybe  I  should  just  get  a  job 
 because  that's  what  everyone  thinks  is 
 normal  to  do 
 and  I  went  and  I  just  it  just  felt  so
[16:18] depressing  being  in  this  warehouse  and  I 
 remember  sitting  at  home  and  really  just 
 thinking  okay  like  I  could  get  this  job
[16:26] and  it  would  take  a  lot  of  my  time 
 it  would  give  me  like  a  fair  amount  of 
 money  you  know  I'd  be  working  full-time
[16:32] making  a  thousand  one  thousand  five 
 hundred  a  month  and  I've  got  like  no 
 expenses  so  I'll  be  able  to  like  get 
 this  money  right  now  that's  kind  of  nice
[16:37] right 
 but  I  realized 
 that  it  wasn't  money  that  was  gonna
[16:43] change  my  life  like  not  this  amount  of 
 money  1K  a  month  working  full-time 
 that's  not  going  to  change  my  life
[16:48] because  I'm  still  working  full-time  in  a 
 job  I  hate  what  was  going  to  change  my
[16:53] life  was  the  ability  to  put  all  of  my 
 focus  into  my  business  that  would  make  a 
 lot  more  money  in  the  future  and  I
[17:00] couldn't  do  that  if  I  was  working 
 full-time  so  do  you  see  how  I  sacrificed 
 money  and  material  success  at  this  level
[17:07] and  that  actually  led  to  way  more  money 
 and  material  success  in  the  future
[17:12] too  many  young  men  are  trying  to  make  as 
 much  money  as  possible  right  now  because 
 they're  so  brainwashed  like  zombies  when
[17:19] they  see  Tate  with  the  fancy  car  and 
 they  think  to  themselves  yes  okay  this 
 is  what  success  looks  like  this  is  what 
 success  looks  like  oh  okay  private  jet
[17:25] you  know  first  class  lights  are  or  Nice 
 Clothing  this  is  what  success  looks  like 
 for  you  that's  not  what  success  is
[17:32] for  you  success  would  be  that  you  don't 
 even  need  to  work  a  job  that  you  can 
 spend  all  your  time  developing  something
[17:37] like  your  craft  your  skill  your  business 
 so  that  you  can  take  that  off
[17:42] it's  not  about  cashing  out  right  now  and 
 getting  the  car  and  getting  the  watch 
 and  the  clothes  to  like  look  good  in
[17:48] front  of  the  people  who  know  you  right 
 now  we  don't  care  about  them  in  five  to 
 ten  years  time  it's  about  setting  up
[17:54] something  for  the  long  run  that  means 
 you're  gonna  have  to  put  in  the  years  it 
 I'm  not  gonna  [ __ ]  lie  to  you  if  this
[18:00] was  gonna  be  like  a  [ __ ]  video  and 
 if  I  was  gonna  try  and  sell  you  some 
 course  I'd  tell  you  that  Yep  this  is
[18:05] gonna  just  take  a  you  know  a  few  weeks 
 haha  this  is  going  to  take  years  of  your 
 life
[18:11] if  you  don't  like  that  get  out  of  this 
 video  and  go  watch  another  tape 
 motivational  podcast  go  watch  some  more
[18:18] shorts 
 It's  Gonna  Take  Years  of  your  life  but 
 guess  what
[18:23] this  is  what  I'm  offering  you  here 
 years
[18:28] this  is  what  the  rest  of  the  world  is 
 offering  you  decades
[18:33] I  want 
 two  hours  however  long  this  video  is 
 going  to  be  two  hours  of  your  life  to
[18:40] get  you  to  the  point  where  money  is 
 checked  off 
 the  materialistic  World  wants  your  soul
[18:49] chances  are  if  you're  watching  this 
 video  you've  also  watched  like  many  bits 
 of  content  from  all  these  male
[18:54] influencers  who  are  in  my  space  and  it 
 makes  me  very  sad  that  you  actually 
 genuinely  don't  have  almost  any  good
[19:01] male  role  model  the  thing  the  ones  that 
 you  think  are  good  once  you  take  a 
 deeper  look  into  them  you'll  realize
[19:06] that  they're  trapping  you  in  the  exact 
 same  way  that  they're  pretending  to  free 
 you  from  it's  not  that  making  a  lot  of
[19:12] money  and  being  able  to  spend  it  makes 
 you  powerful 
 it's  not  needing  money  that  makes  you
[19:19] more  powerful 
 now  imagine  not  needing  money
[19:24] but  you  end  up  making  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  it 
 anyway  now  imagine  that  level  of  power
[19:29] and  certainty  and  confidence 
 reassurance  conviction  that  you  would
[19:35] have  in  yourself  when  you  didn't  need 
 much  money  but  you're  making  so  much  of 
 it
[19:42] this  is  where  your  feeling  of  power  and 
 freedom  comes  from  one  little  extra  trip
[19:48] I'll  just  give  about  the  male 
 influencers  because  no  one  talks  about 
 this  you  know  how  they  all  live  in  Dubai 
 and  you  know  how  they  all  talk  about
[19:53] like  yeah  freedom  is  really  important 
 bro  you  know  they're  not  actually  free 
 you  know  that  they  have  to  live  in  Dubai
[19:58] for  three  to  six  months  of  the  year 
 they're  not  actually  allowed  to  leave 
 they  don't  actually  say  this  to  you
[20:03] because  it  doesn't  sound  as  you  know  the 
 device  seems  really  cool  it's  like  yeah 
 like  bro  I  moved  there  just  like  oh  yeah
[20:09] you  know  I'm  a  high  value  man  I've  got 
 the  watch  and  I  move  there  right  this  is 
 what  none  of  them  will  actually  tell  you 
 it's  like  they've  traded  their  freedom
[20:15] for  money  when  you  move  over  to  Dubai 
 yeah  you  get  zero  percent  taxes  you're
[20:20] not  allowed  to  leave 
 you're  not  allowed  to  go  back  to  your 
 home  country  for  more  than  like  90  days
[20:25] a  year  they've  traded  their  freedom  and 
 also  happiness  and  also  health  for  more
[20:31] money  oh  yes  they  won't  tell  you  this 
 because  it  doesn't  sound  as  cool  they 
 won't  tell  you  the  fact  that  like  you've
[20:37] struggle  to  breathe  when  you're  in  Dubai 
 the  air  pollution's  all  crazy  there 
 you  can't  even  drink  the  water  there
[20:43] that  you're  drinking  from  plastic  water 
 bottles  that  are  estrogenic  you're 
 genuinely  trading  your  health
[20:49] your  happiness  your  Soul's  fulfillment 
 your  purpose  as  a  man  for  more  numbers
[20:54] in  your  bank  account  and  and  some  stinky 
 hole  when  a  girl  opens  her  leg  this  is 
 what  these  men  are  wow  amazing  role
[21:01] models
[21:07] I'm  gonna  help  you  to  get  to  a  more 
 powerful  position  in  them  here's  your 
 first  actionable  step  and  it's  a
[21:12] visualization 
 visualize  more  of  the  secret  millionaire
[21:18] lifestyle 
 visualize  more  of 
 the  stoic  way  of  making  money
[21:27] what  do  you  see  if  you  close  your  eyes 
 and  you  thought  of  this  simple  life 
 imagine  you  think  of  a  life  where  you
[21:33] get  to  do  exactly  what  you  want  to  do 
 with  your  day 
 obviously  that  doesn't  mean  to  be  a
[21:39] complete  degenerate  yeah  yeah  I  want  to 
 do  crack  but  like  in  terms  of  you  know 
 good  things  for  yourself  for  your  family
[21:46] for  Humanity  is  your  contribution  to  the 
 world  what  would  your  ideal  life  look
[21:51] like 
 because  when  you  ask  a  young  man  who's 
 went  deep  into  you  know  watching  these
[21:56] influencers  his  answers  to  this  it  can 
 be  quite  materialistic  it's  like  yeah
[22:01] you  know  it's  the  car  that  yeah  that's 
 always  been  my  dream  car  but  when  you 
 take  a  step  back  and  you  ask  a  young
[22:06] person  okay  why  is  your  ideal  life  got 
 this  object 
 you'll  always  see  them  stutter  and  cope
[22:13] because  they're  unable  to  say  well 
 because  it  would  increase  my  status  in
[22:18] the  social  hierarchy  so  hopefully 
 unintelligent  people  would  like  me  more 
 and  there  might  be  some  women  who  let  me
[22:24] penetrate  them  because  I  enjoy 
 ejaculation 
 that's  the  answer
[22:30] don't  [ __ ]  yourself  is  that  not  the 
 answer  if  you've  got  some  like 
 materialistic  thing  that  you  want  that
[22:35] was  the  answer  wasn't  it  and  I  I'll  be 
 honest  yeah  100  it  is  for  me  I  bro  I've
[22:40] spent  years  of  my  life  doing  that  years 
 of  my  life  but  I'm  able  with  awareness 
 to  be  able  to  say  yep  it  was  like  I  was
[22:46] a  little  monkey  little  degenerate  just 
 chasing  ejaculation  like  a  lot  a  lot  of 
 these  like  high-level  men  are  literally
[22:52] still  little  monkeys  chasing  for 
 ejaculation  literally  like  once  you  look 
 at  look  at  the  the  men  that  you  look  up
[22:57] to  in  this  lens  of  just  thinking  like  he 
 actually  has  structured  his  life  and
[23:02] he's  disciplined  his  life  in  a  very 
 interesting  way  just  like  a  very  like 
 intelligent  monkey  would  have  to  just
[23:08] achieve  ejaculation  more 
 when  you  really  think  about  it  it's  like 
 that's  actually  [ __ ]  sad
[23:16] so  I'm  asking  you  what  is  your  ideal 
 life  genuinely  gonna  look  like  imagine 
 if  you  didn't  need  money  at  all
[23:24] would  you 
 really  want  the  life 
 where  you're  there  living  in  Dubai
[23:33] with  the  air  pollution 
 and  the  the  bus  of  the  Indian  slaves
[23:38] Pakistani  slaves  being  driven  across  and 
 they're  all  working  in  the  little 
 building  there  is  that  the  kind  of
[23:44] environment  that  you  want  to  live  in 
 where  everyone  flies  in  and  out  no  one's
[23:49] staying  there  long  term  so  you  don't 
 have  any  like  genuine  real  friends  and 
 the  friends  you  may  have  in  that  kind  of 
 environment  are  all  like  on  some  kind  of
[23:55] substances  and  yeah  of  course  there's 
 substances  in  Dubai  and  in  these  Islamic
[24:00] countries  they  don't  tell  you  this  on 
 the  internet  they're  as  degenerate  as  as 
 all  of  them
[24:07] would  you  like  to  wake  up  and  have  that 
 as  your  life  experience  really  think  to
[24:12] yourself  imagine  if  money  didn't  exist 
 imagine  if  this  this  craving  for  this 
 you  know  this  like  validation  from
[24:17] unintelligent  people  didn't  exist 
 what  would  your  dream  life  look  like  the
[24:23] thing  is  for  most  people  I  genuinely 
 believe  if  we  slap  some  [ __ ]  sense 
 into  you  and  we  told  you  like  stop
[24:30] caring  about  them  they're  not  even 
 thinking  about  you  it's  okay 
 if  we  like  shock  you
[24:36] and  try  to  [ __ ]  help  you  and  save 
 years  of  your  life  eventually  you'd  be
[24:42] honest  and  say  you  know  what 
 I  want  to  have  children  I  wanna  have
[24:48] like  a  Wi-Fi  it  doesn't  sound  cool 
 anymore  because  everyone  online  is 
 telling  me  like  not  to  get  married  and 
 stuff  but  like  I  want  to  have  one  wife  I
[24:55] want  to  go  live  in  like  a  nice  house 
 where  it's  safe 
 and  I  want  there  to  be  a  lot  of  nature 
 around  me  and  I  want  to  have  some  kind
[25:01] of  work  that  feels  meaningful  and  fun 
 for  me  to  do  and  it's  like  you  know 
 because  it's  fun  it  doesn't  even  feel
[25:07] like  work  so  I  can  go  and  do  that  for  a 
 few  hours  a  day  then  I  can  play  with  my 
 children  I  can  play  with  my  dog
[25:12] I've  got  my  wife  who  I  love  dearly  we 
 actually  really  have  like  an  awesome 
 healthy  relationship  I  can't  believe
[25:18] I've  ever  actually  genuinely  been  this 
 level  of  like  open  and  loving  towards 
 another  person  and  they  have  to  me
[25:24] I  have  my  faith 
 I  have  like  a  few  like  interesting 
 hobbies  that  I  like  I  like  like  team
[25:30] sports  like  I've  been  playing  Cricket 
 with  the  local  team  and  like  we've  been 
 actually  doing  really  well  and  people
[25:35] actually  seem  to  like  like  me  there
[25:42] this  is  like  coming  back 
 to  power  where  you  don't  need  much  else
[25:48] you  don't  you're  not  there  thinking  oh 
 man  you  know  I  hope  my  video  pops  off  on 
 YouTube  oh  yeah  you  know  you  know  that
[25:55] Instagram  picture  that  they  posted  was 
 so  good  I  really  want  a  lifestyle  like 
 them
[26:01] four  wives  you  know  because  it  is  just 
 shut  up  [ __ ]  red  pill  podcast  this  is
[26:08] who  you're  taking  your  life  Direction 
 from 
 degenerates  glorified  little  monkeys  who
[26:14] who  are  addicted  to  ejaculation
[26:19] what  is  your  ideal  life
[26:24] you  don't  realize  how  important  this 
 actionable  step  is
[26:29] if  you  can  take 
 I  was  going  to  say  an  hour  but  honestly 
 if  you  can  take  days
[26:35] to  think  about  this  deeply  you  might 
 save  Decades  of  your  life 
 think  about  your  real  ideal  life  and
[26:43] keep  asking  yourself  why  when  a  young 
 man  hears  this  question  and  he  does 
 write  down  something  like  oh  yeah  he
[26:48] wants  the  car  he  wants  the  Tate 
 lifestyle  a  few  years  ago  I  would  have 
 told  you  the  Dan  Bilzerian  lifestyle
[26:53] where  I  get  to  throw  parties  with  like 
 with  Coke  and  hookers  and  and  weed  and 
 [ __ ]  I  can't  believe  I  would  I  spent
[26:59] years  of  my  life  with  that  kind  of 
 Desire  just  because  it  like  it  looked 
 kind  of  cool  on  social  media  you  just
[27:05] wasted  years  of  of  peeling  back  the 
 layers  of  your  purpose
[27:10] you  just  wasted  like  years  of  the  time 
 that  you  could  have  spent  deepening  the 
 love  with  the  people  who  actually  matter
[27:16] and  here  you  are  just  so  so  like 
 perturbs  this  is  like  the  opposite  of
[27:21] masculinity  what  these  masculine 
 creators  are  putting  it  on  to  you
[27:28] what  would  actually  be  your  real  ideal 
 life
[27:35] when  you  strip  away  the  [ __ ]  and  you 
 keep  asking  why  and  you  realize  how  sad 
 it  is  to  like  put  your  life  down  the
[27:41] line  where  you're  literally  just  doing 
 it  for  this  like  validation  for  other 
 people  you're  doing  this  because  there's
[27:46] like  unintelligent  people  it's  always  on 
 intelligent  people  that  they  might  look 
 at  you  and  smile  at  you  and  like  be  nice
[27:52] to  you 
 you  realize  how  sad  it  is  to  spend  your 
 life  like  that
[27:58] so  this  doesn't  mean  that  you  need  to  be 
 broke  and  to  be  hungry  this  doesn't  mean
[28:03] that  you're  not  going  to  be  making  money 
 it  isn't  my  belief
[28:08] you'll  actually  make 
 so  much  more  money  this  way
[28:14] when  you  almost  pursue  the  more  simple 
 life  of  not  really  being  materialistic
[28:23] there's  two  men  who  I  know  one  of  them 
 you  probably  know 
 who  portray  this  really  well
[28:29] Alex  hamozi  and  Alex  Becker  these  are
[28:34] two  entrepreneurs  but  there's  actually 
 many  of  them  that  Sam  Walton  the  creator 
 of  Walmart  Jeff  Bezos  like  um  Mark
[28:41] Zuckerberg  these  men  they  live  very 
 simple  lives  and  they've  become 
 millionaires  or  even  billionaires
[28:48] you  see  outside  of  this  social  media 
 lens  like  you  spend  all  your  time  on 
 social  media  let's  be  honest  it's
[28:53] actually  kind  of  sad  when  you  think 
 about  it  because  YouTube  still  is  a 
 social  media  podcast  [ __ ]  tape 
 podcast  still  a  social  media  right  so
[28:59] you've  got  to  be  honest  like  we're 
 actually  still  [ __ ]  losers  like  we 
 still  go  on  social  media  for  hours  a  day
[29:04] yeah  we  yeah  it's  YouTube  oh  yeah 
 hamza's  got  a  new  video  it's  still 
 [ __ ]  social  media  so  you're  still  a 
 bit  of  a  loser  like  so  am  I  right  so
[29:10] it's  like  we're  probably  not  that 
 advanced  but  when  you  think  of  like  some 
 genuine  billionaires 
 when  you  think  of  those  guys  who  have
[29:16] built  like  literal  companies  which  have 
 taken  over  the  entire  world  like  Walmart 
 like  Amazon
[29:22] they  live  simple  lives  they're  not 
 they're  flashing  their  picture  of  the 
 fancy  car  because  they  don't  need  to
[29:28] show  you  because  they  weren't  doing  it 
 for  the  ego  they  did  it  just  because 
 they  genuinely  just  wanted  to  build  a
[29:34] good  company  that  like  would  help  a 
 certain  kind  of  person  and  then  here  you
[29:39] are  this  person  who's  looking  over  at 
 these  like  social  media  Stars  thinking 
 that  that's  the  right  way  to  go  about
[29:44] business 
 and  you've  tried  it  that  way
[29:49] you're  not  making  much  progress  right  so 
 you've  tried  it  this  way  of  looking  at 
 these  little  influences  you've  tried
[29:54] buying  their  courses  and  everything 
 you've  tried  watching  the  five  hour  tape 
 podcast  and  it  hasn't  actually  served
[29:59] you  that  well  because  you're  still  broke 
 so  if  you're  still  like  I  know  that 
 sounds  horrible  but  the  truth  is  come  on
[30:04] let's  be  smart  if  you've  tried  something 
 for  a  little  while  and  you  still  feel 
 clueless  you're  still  thinking  Which 
 business  model  you  know  you've  switched
[30:09] over  business  muscle  models  how  many 
 times  be  honest  how  many  times  over  the 
 last  six  months  have  you  switched
[30:14] business  model  to  business  model  four 
 five  six  oh  maybe  it  should  be  YouTube 
 maybe  I  should  sell  course  uh
[30:19] copyrighted  on  this  one  ages  ago  you 
 keep  switching  around  you're  not  making 
 any  real  progress
[30:24] so  whatever  you're  doing  right  now  isn't 
 working  is  it  it's  a  different  mindset 
 that  you  need
[30:30] if  right  now  you're  not  feeling  totally 
 convinced  or  certain  you  might  be 
 valuable  for  you  to  re-watch  this  like
[30:37] this  mindset  part  of  this  full  guide 
 and  just  let  it  convince  you  and  to
[30:42] destroy  those  beliefs  in  your  brain 
 because  I'm  not  gonna  lie  to  you 
 if  I  was  in  your  position  again  as  I  was
[30:49] I  would  feel  quite  a  lot  of  fear  right 
 now  I  don't  know  if  you're  feeling  it  if 
 you  if  you  have  the  sort  of  body
[30:54] awareness  to  feel  fear  inside  of  your 
 body  I  often  feel  it  in  my  stomach  if  I 
 was  in  your  position  right  now  I  would
[31:00] feel  some  level  of  fear  considering  okay 
 not  going  down  the  materialistic  path
[31:05] that  you've  been  probably  making  some 
 kind  of  progress  to  with  your  desires 
 because  that  would  mean  that  you're  not
[31:10] going  to  seem  as  cool  in  front  of  other 
 people  it  would  mean  that  you  don't  get 
 to  like  sort  of  you  know  go  all  in  on
[31:15] the  sort  of  Tate  mindset  or  the  you  know 
 whatever  influencer  whoever's  famous 
 these  days  it's  like  you've  built  up
[31:20] that  life  of  thinking  yeah  I  can  be  that 
 guy  who's  really  high  status  and  girls 
 will  really  like  me  and  then  you  know
[31:25] I'll  be  able  to  ejaculate 
 and  when  you  start  to  rip  that  away  like 
 I'm  doing  from  you  I'm  ripping  away  this
[31:31] desire  that  you've  had  now  it  feels  like 
 now  you're  roaring  naked  and  now  you 
 have  to  face  the  world  to  realize  that
[31:36] you've  just  wasted  the  last  six  months 
 of  your  life  maybe  12  months  maybe  three 
 years  of  your  life  going  down  a  path
[31:41] that  you  knew  that  was  never  gonna  serve 
 you  anyway  because  the  thing  that  would 
 be  right  for  you  is  nowhere  near  as  cool
[31:47] socially  validated  as  everything  else 
 admit  it  to  yourself  take  some  time  to
[31:52] say  it  you  know  what 
 my  real  desire  it's  not  as  cool  I  want
[31:57] to  have  that  house  in  the  countryside  I 
 want  to  like  just  live  with  my  family  I 
 wanna  just  have  like  the  car  that's
[32:03] actually  really  nice  to  drive  but  not 
 the  Supercar  that  would  turn  people's 
 heads  because  I  don't  care  about  those
[32:08] people  on  the  street 
 I  don't  care  about  the  unintelligent 
 women  who  will  like  my  Instagram
[32:13] pictures 
 I  want  something  deeper  than  that
[32:19] I  would  be  so  scared  if  I  was  in  your 
 position  if  I  was  like  aware  of  it  I 
 don't  know  if  you  are  I  don't  know  if  I
[32:24] seem  really  crazy  maybe  it'll  take  you  a 
 few  more  years  to  get  to  the  point  where 
 you're  able  to  understand  what  I'm
[32:29] saying  maybe  you'll  want  to  check  back 
 to  this  video  in  2025  2026  2027  and
[32:34] maybe  then  you'll  realize  that  this  was 
 making  a  lot  more  sense  than  you  you 
 were  able  to  comprehend
[32:39] I'm  trying  to  save  Decades  of  your  life 
 and  I  wish  someone  did  this  for  me
[32:45] I'm  very  lucky  that  I  was  able  to  pull 
 myself  out  of  this  like  this  money 
 greedy  I  need  as  many  pennies  as
[32:50] possible 
 and  again  the  best  part  about  what  I'm
[32:55] telling  you  is  that  you'll  make  more 
 money  this  way  but  you  have  to  take  a 
 leap  of  faith  the  way  you'll  make  more
[33:00] money  is  because  it's  just  like  how 
 you'll  get  girls  when  you're  not  being 
 needy  for  them  when  you  don't  need  the
[33:06] girl  that's  when  you're  actually  more 
 attractive  it's  the  exact  same  with 
 money  when  you're  not  there  trying  to 
 like  you  know  like  thinking  oh  you  know
[33:12] how  can  I  spend  one  more  money  how  can  I 
 get  more  money  how  can  I  get  more  money 
 then  you'll  make  more  money  because 
 you'll  make  better  long-term  decisions  I
[33:18] am  not  against  money  I'm  not  against  you 
 working  hard  and  contributing  and  giving
[33:23] value  and  making  money  I'm  not  against 
 spending  money  I'm  not  even  against  some 
 like  materialistic  objects  not  at  all
[33:29] but  I'm  against  the  false  messaging  the 
 brainwashing  that  is  inside  of  your  mind 
 that  has  convinced  you  that  this  is  like
[33:35] the  only  path  to  consider 
 that's  pulling  you  away  from  friends  and
[33:40] family  that's  pulling  you  away  from  your 
 own  health  because  to  an  extreme  level 
 is  this  not  what  your  parents  went
[33:46] through  why  they've  been  sleep  deprived 
 for  20  years  is  this  is  this  not  the
[33:51] same  thing 
 it's  just  that  you  seem  enlightened 
 because  you  know  about  business  and  yeah 
 there's  faster  ways  to  make  money  then
[33:57] you  know  that  your  parents  know  fine 
 but  the  way  that  you  look  at  your 
 parents  is  if  they're  following  like
[34:02] some  kind  of  outdated  script  and  they 
 don't  know  about  them  the  better  way  of 
 life
[34:07] is  the  way  that  more  intelligent  people 
 are  just  looking  at  you  thinking  yep  he 
 doesn't  know  now  trust  me  when  I  say
[34:12] that  those  people  on  social  media  the 
 the  men's  influences  they're  very 
 intelligent  they  know  that  they're 
 selling  you  like  a  false  god  they  know
[34:18] that  they're  selling  you  this  lifestyle 
 that  will  get  them  what  they  want  but 
 not  get  what  what  you  want
[34:28] and  you'll  keep  following  them 
 because  they  soothe  that  sort  of  Primal
[34:33] stupid  unintelligent  part  inside  of  you 
 that  just  wants  to  be  accepted  by  others
[34:39] they'll  twist  the  knife  of  your  Primal 
 pain  of  a  lack  of  like  consistent  love
[34:44] and  Community  as  you  see  in  these  days 
 where  you  know  everyone's  so  separated 
 everyone's  so  lonely  they'll  twist  the
[34:50] knife  tell  you  that  men  are  so  lonely 
 and  then  they'll  tell  you  well  yeah  you 
 know  the  Cure  of  that's  making  money
[34:55] haha 
 hmm 
 is  that  what  it  is
[35:02] so  why  are  people  lonelier  in  wealthier 
 countries
[35:07] it  doesn't  sound  anywhere  near  as  cool 
 but  I  you  know  what  I  almost  want  to
[35:12] start  like  a  new  movement  of  us 
 confidently  making  like  the  real  natural
[35:17] human  part  of  us  cool  again  of  wanting 
 more  of  the  simple  life  of  of  wanting
[35:22] mud  and  grass  between  our  feet  of 
 thinking  how  cool  it  would  be  to  have 
 like  I  don't  know  like  a  cabin  in  the
[35:28] woods  with  people  that  you  love  of  like 
 one  of  the  greatest  Joys  being  like 
 getting  a  dog  and  playing  with  it
[35:34] of  not  needing  to  go  fly  around  the 
 country  podcast  the  podcast  yeah  you 
 know  so  a  high  value  man  is  like  just
[35:41] shut  up  bro  shut  up  however  it's 
 actually  what  do  you  want  about  high 
 volume  one  and  this  and  this  and  this  go
[35:47] sell  your  [ __ ]  program
[35:54] a  high  value  man  is  not  the  guy  who's 
 making  the  most  amount  of  money  bro 
 because  the  thing  is
[36:00] I'm  making  a  lot  more  money  than  I  was 
 six  months  ago
[36:05] but  if  I  was  doing  this  while  selling  my 
 soul 
 it  would  be  worthless  you've  heard  about
[36:12] how  important  purpose  is  for  men  purpose 
 you've  heard  that  so  much  but  none  of
[36:17] these  guys  online  will  actually  explain 
 it  to  you
[36:22] there  is  like  a  great  mission  for  you 
 here  on  Earth  there  absolutely  is  I
[36:28] thought  that  this  was  like  woo-woo  BS 
 but  I'm  so  much  seeing  this  as  the  truth 
 now  there  is  like  a  real  reason  a
[36:35] mission  for  you  to  be  here  and  it  is  not 
 to  follow  these  random  influences 
 including  myself  it  is  not  to  like  make
[36:41] them  the  hero  like  odd  guys  you've  seen 
 you  take  podcasts  but  rather  to  see 
 yourself  and  it  sounds  cringe  like  to
[36:46] see  yourself  as  the  main  character  and 
 to  to  peel  back  the  [ __ ]  that's  been
[36:51] put  across  this  core  part  of  you  that 
 knows  what  you  should  do  with  your  life 
 because  it  was  there  at  the  beginning
[36:57] like  this  clear  message  what  you  should 
 have  done  with  your  life 
 and  other  people  the  education  system
[37:03] your  parents  family  social  media 
 influencers  everything  has  just  put 
 their  own  message  on  top  so  now  you
[37:09] don't  even  know  who  you  are 
 so  you're  living  this  weird  inauthentic
[37:15] like  shallow  breathing  lifestyle 
 so  is  there  any  wonder  why  sometimes
[37:21] your  dick  doesn't  work  is  any  wonder  why 
 like  you  can't  even  feel  like  much  in 
 your  body  like  you  almost  feel  AFK  in
[37:27] your  own  body  these  days  because  we 
 don't  do  natural  things
[37:32] you're  here  with  like  like  the  sweaty 
 stinky  computer  chair
[37:37] that  smells  like  ass  another  tape 
 podcast  oh  yes  yes  let's  push  my  purpose
[37:43] off  for  another  few  hours 
 yeah  I  gotta  make  money  guys  yeah  making 
 money  is  really  important  guys
[37:51] there's  a  better  way  to  go  about  this 
 I  apologize  if  it  seems  like  I've  just 
 wasted  a  bunch  of  times  with  the  rants
[37:57] but  I've  wanted  to  say  that  for  a  good 
 while  now 
 when  I've  taken  a  step  back  from  the
[38:02] internet  and  from  technology 
 I've  realized  just  how  much  [ __ ]  is
[38:07] going  on  here 
 now  I  will  teach  you  this  the  real  truth
[38:14] about  making  money  and  there  is  no 
 upsell  in  this  there's  no  course  that 
 you  need  to  buy
[38:19] but 
 I  am  warning  you  that  by  the  time  you 
 get  to  the  end  of  this  video  you'll
[38:24] realize  that  if  this  was  a  weird  wrong 
 almost  path  to  go  down
[38:31] but  I  had  to  go  down  this  path  myself 
 and  so  I  don't  blame  you  for  needing  to
[38:36] experience  it  and  to  see  the  light 
 yourself  either 
 so  my  hope  is  that  I  can  get  you  to
[38:43] maybe  this  realization  faster 
 why
[38:51] honestly  I  just  want  more  guys  in  the 
 world 
 who  see  the  truth
[38:57] not  the  truth  that's  trying  to  be  sold 
 to  you  whether  it's  the  education  system 
 or  or  these  same  guys  who  are  pretending
[39:04] to  free  you  from  the  Matrix  like  all  of 
 them  I'm  not  even  just  blaming  Tate 
 obviously  I'm  just  using  his  name 
 because  he's  the  most  famous  but  I
[39:10] haven't  seen  a  good  male  influence  I've 
 not  even  seen  one  single  one  it's  so 
 upsetting  I've  not  seen  one  single  one
[39:16] because  they're  all  just  here  like 
 inside  of  this  box  pretending  like  the 
 box  is  like  all  there  isn't  that  this  is
[39:21] maybe  the  line  maybe  they  actually  know 
 the  truth  or  maybe  they're  not  actually 
 that  advanced  but  like  here  they  are  in
[39:26] this  box  selling  you  more  secrets  inside 
 of  this  box
[39:31] but  you  can  take  a  step  out  of  the  box 
 and  realize  how  foolish  it  is  to  stay  in 
 there
[39:36] and  it  actually  hurts  my  heart  to  see 
 how  many  managers  riddle  inside  of  this
[39:41] this  box  of  of  wasted  potential  of  just
[39:46] random  desire  of  materialism  of  status 
 yeah  I  gotta  you  know  my  shoulder  needs
[39:51] to  be  a  little  bit  more  muscular  this 
 way  and  then  I'll  feel  worthy  of  love 
 you  can  shortcut  the  thing  that  you  want
[39:57] because  when  you  really  boiled  it  down 
 it  wasn't  actually  money  that  you  wanted 
 it  was
[40:02] what  was  it  was  Freedom  love  happiness 
 health  Joys  purpose  contribution
[40:08] Community  those  were  the  things  you 
 actually  wanted  in  in  this  modern  world 
 including  in  the  people  who  act  like
[40:14] they're  against  modernity  they're  just 
 putting  materialism  as  the  the  fix  of
[40:20] all  your  problems  and  yet  when  you 
 achieve  those  materialistic  desires  if 
 you're  actually  honest  you'll  realize
[40:25] that  it  didn't  fix  anything 
 so  it  becomes  a  massive  waste  of  time 
 and  I'm  sudden  that  I  spent  years  of  my
[40:31] life  like  three  or  four  three  years  like 
 full-time  sort  of  mastering  the  game  of
[40:36] money  and  getting  it  to  the  point  where 
 like  I  make  more  than  enough  money  I 
 could  ever  spend  now
[40:41] I  did  that  about  30  times  faster  than 
 most  people  would  or  I  don't  know  10
[40:46] times  20  times  faster  right  in  three 
 years  I  became  financially  free  I  don't 
 need  to  make  money  but  like  it  just  it
[40:51] just  comes  to  me  now  I  just  make  money 
 like  automatically  with  the  things  that 
 I  like  to  do  a  lot  of  it
[40:58] and  I  don't  need  it  remember  before  like 
 I  don't  need  the  money  like  what  what  am
[41:03] I  going  to  spend  every  now  and  then  I 
 like  to  go  stay  in  like  an  Airbnb  every 
 now  and  then  I'll  go  yeah  let  restaurant 
 and  stuff  fine  but  I  could  sit  in  the
[41:09] mud  and  smile  anyway 
 do  you  see  the  power  that  this  gives  me
[41:14] the  money  has  like  no  effect  I  can 
 imagine  speaking  to  my  younger  self 
 right  now  he  would  have  like  a  sadness
[41:19] in  his  heart  because  he'd  been  going 
 down  this  pursuit  of  thinking  that  this 
 was  going  to  cure  his  problems  and  so
[41:24] it's  almost  like  a  sad  feeling  so  if  you 
 want  you  can  click  away  and  go  get  like 
 a  nice  happy  little  bubbly  Feeling  by
[41:29] going  to  watch  some  like  motivational 
 video  yeah  you  know  go  get  some  money 
 yeah  you  know  what  like  yeah  do  it  you
[41:34] know  make  some  make  the  money  yeah  it's 
 not  gonna  get  you  what  you  actually  want 
 what  you  think  money  is  going  to  get  you
[41:42] it  won't 
 it  really  won't
[41:47] it  will  get  you  some  some  very  good 
 things  as  we'll  explain  in  the  spending 
 money  section  of  of  this  video  it  will
[41:53] actually  like  be  a  benefit  to  your  life 
 absolutely
[41:58] but  it's  important  to  realize  that  you 
 have  real  genuine  desires  inside  of  you 
 that  must
[42:04] be  appreciated 
 and  when  you  go  down  this  path
[42:09] especially  when  you're  following  the 
 wrong  people
[42:14] well  then 
 you're  selling  your  soul  for  a  few  bucks
[42:19] step  two 
 what  you  can  do  for  money
[42:26] imagine  a  fisherman 
 in  the  18  or  1700s  he  wakes  up  next  to
[42:33] his  beautiful  gorgeous  wife  amongst  his 
 children 
 at  sunrise  in  the  most  beautiful  sunrise
[42:39] and  he  goes  out  into  the  dark  and  he 
 starts  fishing 
 he  fuels  the  the  fishing  string  pull
[42:47] and  he  gets  one  and  two  and  three  and  he 
 actually  feels  really  good  about  himself 
 he  you  know  he's  good  at  this  skill  he's
[42:52] been  fishing  for  many  many  years 
 he  comes  home  passes  the  fish  over  to
[42:59] his  wife  she  cooks  it  they  have  a  lovely 
 meal  together  Daddy  brought  us  this  this
[43:04] food  we  eat  because  of  him 
 the  joy  and  the  love  that  he  would
[43:09] experience  and  also  the  purpose  of  him 
 providing 
 I  believe  this  kind  of  simple  life  is
[43:15] the  one  that  is  right  for  us
[43:20] but  others  don't 
 what  happened  to  this  fisherman  when  the
[43:25] Industrial  Revolution  starts  and  the 
 factories  overtaken  the  the  sea  is 
 polluted  he  goes  out  day  after  day  but
[43:31] zero  fish  they've  all  gone  they've  all 
 died  the  water's  contaminated  so  what  is
[43:36] he  gonna  do  he  can't  use  his  skill 
 anymore  the  thing  that  he  actually 
 enjoyed  doing  to  provide  to  his  family
[43:42] so  he  needs  to  go  work  inside  of  the 
 factory 
 he  gets  work  inside  of  the  factory  there
[43:47] he  is  all  day  it's  no  longer  like  we 
 wake  up  at  sunrise  nice  beautiful  time 
 silent  it's  like  this  loud  grinding
[43:53] machine  which  is  like  chattering  in  his 
 ear  working  next  to  all  the  weird  men 
 who  are  actually  being  horrible  towards
[43:59] him  boss  doesn't  even  like  him  before 
 Health  regulations  dust  clouds  and  black 
 smoke
[44:05] and  here  you  are  chump  some  gold  coins 
 and  what  does  he  do  with  these  coins
[44:13] well  he  goes  and  buys  a  fish  and  he 
 takes  that  home  and  gives  it  to  his 
 family  and  they  cook  it
[44:20] so  don't  you  see  that  you're  gonna  spend 
 a  few  hours  or  many  hours  of  your  day
[44:25] working  contributing  doing  some  kind  of 
 task
[44:31] you  could  do  the  wholesome  task  that 
 would  actually  be  like  amazing  for  your
[44:36] life  quality 
 or  you  could  go  and  like  do  the  thing
[44:42] that  might  make  you  more  money  so  that 
 you  can  just  get  what  you  wanted  from 
 the  life  quality  to  begin  with
[44:50] too  many  people  are  choosing  the  wrong 
 option  this  part  of  this  guide  will  help
[44:55] you  to  finally  figure  out  what  to  do  to 
 make  money
[45:00] what  business  model  to  get  into  maybe 
 what  career  to  get  into
[45:05] because  for  so  long  I  can  imagine  I've 
 spoke  to  many  young  guys  hundreds  of 
 guys  have  actually  told  me  this  exact
[45:10] same  problem 
 they  keep  flipping  around  from  business 
 model  to  business  model  maybe  you've
[45:16] wanted  to  try  becoming  a  YouTuber  maybe 
 you've  wanted  to  try  the  agency 
 marketing  or  the  copywriting  or  the  paid
[45:21] ads  and  all  these  different  kind  of  ways 
 to  make  money  you've  considered  a  couple 
 of  careers  but  you  know  you  like  there's
[45:26] too  many  people  saying  bad  things  about 
 careers  these  days  you  wouldn't  do  that 
 and  you've  got  no  idea  you're  making
[45:31] shallow  progress  you're  not  sure  what  it 
 is  that  you  should  do  with  your  life  you 
 just  know  one  thing  for  certain  you  want
[45:36] to  make  money 
 that's  the  problem
[45:41] that's  why  you're  stuck 
 if  you  can  go  into  step  one  like  we  said
[45:46] before  destroy  that  need  for  money  and 
 now  let's  start  from  a  Baseline  and 
 let's  figure  out  actually  the  right
[45:52] thing  for  you  to  do 
 this  is  the  thing  you  could  actually 
 commit  yourself  to  for  decades  imagine
[45:59] how  good  that  would  be  by  the  end  of 
 just  this  step  here  you  will  have  the 
 thing  that  you  could  genuinely  do  for
[46:04] decades  that  means  that  you'll  be  able 
 to  master  this  craft  this  skill  that 
 we're  about  to  find  out  for  you  which
[46:10] means  over  the  long  run  you're  going  to 
 make  a  lot  more  money  than  the  guys 
 flipping  around  from  business  model  to
[46:15] business  model  what  did  we  learn  from 
 the  story  of  the  fishermen 
 it's  that  your  life  quality  just  comes
[46:22] down  to  like  what  you  do  with  the  hours 
 of  your  day  and  working  is  going  to  be  a
[46:27] big  part  of  that  the  truth  is  that 
 making  money  is  nice  but  if  you  make
[46:32] money  while  sacrificing  the  hours  of 
 your  day  to  do  something  that  wasn't
[46:38] like  nice  for  you 
 then  the  benefit  of  the  money  actually 
 like  goes  away  like  okay  the  the
[46:45] fisherman  is  there  in  the  factory  let's 
 say  he's  going  to  get  the  equivalent  of 
 like  more  money  more  value  more
[46:50] resources  at  the  end  of  that  day  but  now 
 he's  literally  there  working  this  task 
 that  he  doesn't  like  that  isn't  healthy
[46:56] that  pulls  him  away  from  his  family  that 
 he's  kind  of  okay  up  and  not  really 
 amazing  at  like  he  is  with  fishing  but
[47:02] he  makes  more  money  that  he  can  use  to 
 exchange  for  a  fish 
 which  lifestyle  would  you  rather  have  in
[47:08] this  there's  no  real  answer  to  this  some 
 men  would  say  yep  I  just  want  to  make 
 the  money  I  just  want  to  make  the  money 
 those  men  even  though  it  sounds  horrible
[47:14] and  this  is  speaking  to  younger  me 
 because  he  was  one  of  those 
 it  sounds  horrible  they've  they've  got
[47:20] severe  problems  it  takes  years  to 
 counteract  that 
 and  I  know  that  I  sound  like  some  uh
[47:26] yeah  I'm  just  being  horrible  it's 
 actually  like  the  person  who  would 
 sacrifice  his  own
[47:32] health  and  experience  of  life  to  just  be 
 able  to  afford  something  that  will
[47:39] heighten  him  in  society  and  to  gain  some 
 status
[47:44] it's  actually  worrying 
 now  of  course  if  making  a  certain  amount
[47:50] of  money  would  genuinely  save  your  life 
 because  you're  in  a  war-torn  country 
 that's  different  because  think  about  how 
 like  gut  wrenching  it  is  for  this
[47:56] fisherman  where  he  had  like  those  hours 
 of  the  day  where  he  was  doing  something 
 which  was  still  productive  it  was  still
[48:01] getting  him  the  resources  he  needed  but 
 it  was  something  he  genuinely  enjoyed 
 and  because  of  that  he  was  able  to  get
[48:06] really  good  at  it  as  well  so  at  this 
 point 
 what  you  need  to  do  is  to  figure  out
[48:11] what  your  Flow  State  task  is  this  is  in 
 my  belief  that  single  greatest  way  to  go
[48:18] about  your  money  making  journey  is  to 
 narrow  in  on  what's  called  your  Flow
[48:24] State  task  this  is  a  task  that  you  do 
 that  you  naturally  get  like  zero
[48:29] thoughts  during  it's  a  task  that  you  do 
 which  could  be  like  work  for  someone  but
[48:34] it  feels  fun  and  enjoyable  almost  like  a 
 game  for  you  you'll  know  it's  your  Flow
[48:40] State  task  because  you  usually  will  have 
 zero  thoughts  whilst  you  do  it  for  me 
 it's  always  been  speaking  when  I  speak
[48:46] and  I  give  advice  and  explain  Concepts  I 
 always  have  zero  thoughts  in  my  brain 
 it's  still  hard  it's  like  this  demanding
[48:52] difficult  strenuous  task  but  at  the  same 
 time
[48:57] I  feel  like  I'm  in  some  kind  of  weird 
 like  Haze  right  now  like  I  I've  had  zero
[49:02] thoughts  in  my  mind  for  the  last  one  and 
 a  half  hours  and  that's  like  the  peak 
 human  experience  with  your  monkey  mind
[49:07] quietens  down  and  you  can  actually  just 
 be  here  presence  I  won't  go  into  more 
 detail  for  this  Flow  State  guide  I  made
[49:12] a  whole  like  two  hour  guide  on  my 
 channel  the  Flow  State  Focus  guy  just  go 
 watch  that  when  you  have  the  time  and
[49:17] until  then  just  think  about  whatever 
 your  Flow  State  task  could  be  the  kind 
 of  task  that  feels  Pleasant  for  you  but
[49:23] it  actually  still  is  pretty  productive 
 it's  speaking  for  me  maybe  it's  writing 
 for  you  maybe  it's  coaching  for  another
[49:28] person  maybe  it's  teaching  maybe  it's 
 like  lifting  weights  and  exercising 
 maybe  it's  it's  um  reading  like  whatever
[49:35] it  is  there's  got  to  be  something  which 
 really  just  aligns  to  you  that
[49:41] thing  that  you're  gonna  use  for  money 
 that  is  your  gift  to  humanity
[49:47] that  is  something  that  you  were  born 
 with  which  is  different  from  everyone 
 else
[49:52] I  believe  that  that  was  what  you  were 
 supposed  to  get  really  good  at  as  a  gift
[49:57] to  other  people 
 and  when  we  use  entrepreneurship  in  a 
 capitalist  society  when  we  give  that
[50:03] gift  to  other  people  they'll  give  us 
 money  in  return 
 do  you  see  how  my  gift  that  I  was  born
[50:08] with  because  I  was  four  years  old  when  I 
 knew  that  I  liked  explaining  Concepts  to 
 people  this  gift  of  speaking  I'm  using
[50:15] to  help  you 
 and  this  has  made  me  a  lot  of  money
[50:21] imagine  if  I  didn't  do  this  and  I  just 
 tried  to  chase  the  money  and  I  went  and 
 worked  at  the  warehouse
[50:27] I  would  have  made  more  money  back  then 
 right  I  would  have  made  more  money  back 
 then
[50:34] but  when  you  find  this  Flow  State  task 
 when  you  find  this  this  task  that  just
[50:40] feels  right  for  you  that  feels  enjoyable 
 for  you  even  though  it  might  not  be  the 
 thing  that's  going  to  make  a  lot  of
[50:45] money 
 naturally  you  get  really  good  at  it 
 because  you  just  want  to  do  it  all  the
[50:50] time  so  even  when  I'm  not  working  I'm 
 speaking  to  people  I'll  be  in  the  gym 
 and  I'll  end  up  like  meeting  a  new
[50:55] person  and  I  can't  help  but  to  like 
 speak  motivational  Concepts  and 
 everything  at  them  I  can't  help  it
[51:00] because  it's  just  enjoyable  for  me  to 
 like  say  things  out  of  my  mouth  and 
 explain  things  in  the  way  that  I
[51:06] understand  them  myself 
 that  means  that  you're  going  to  get 
 really  good  at  it  it  means  that  you're 
 going  to  practice  24  7  just  naturally  it
[51:13] means  that  you're  going  to  put  in  more 
 hours  than  everyone  else  and  actually 
 enjoy  it  and  this  is  the  best  part  if 
 you're  a  new  entrepreneur  if  you're
[51:18] trying  to  figure  out  like  you  know  which 
 business  to  make 
 when  you  know  your  Flow  State  task  you
[51:24] don't  jump  around  from  business  to 
 business  because  you  just  know  the  thing 
 that  you  can  go  all  in  on  for  me  it's
[51:29] speaking  so  there  might  be  you  know 
 YouTube  there  might  be  twitch  or  some 
 other  ways  being  a  motivational  speaker
[51:34] in  person  there's  different  things  I 
 could  do  but  as  long  as  the  skill  the 
 task  is  consistent  as  it  is  for  me  which
[51:39] is  speaking  it  Narrows  down  like  the 
 things  that  I'll  consider  right  now  you
[51:44] might  be  thinking  wait  wait  I  don't 
 really  know  my  flow  State  task  I  don't 
 even  understand  what  it  means  so  I'll 
 just  ask  you
[51:49] what  is  something  that  is  kind  of  like 
 work 
 but  you  do  it  and  it's  actually  kind  of
[51:55] fun  and  you  often  have  zero  thoughts  in 
 your  mind  whilst  you  do  it  if  you're  not 
 sure  of  the  answer  it  would  be  valuable
[52:01] for  you  to  just  keep  this  question  in 
 mind  and  maybe  go  through  your  life 
 because  there  probably  is  something  that
[52:06] you're  doing  right  now  or  maybe 
 something  that  you'll  eventually  find 
 where  this  will  become  more  apparent
[52:11] this  advice  is  going  to  sound  lame  but 
 if  you're  just  going  like  try  new  things 
 sometimes  you'll  be  able  to  go  and  find
[52:16] like  the  thing  that  puts  you  into  more 
 of  a  flow  State  there's  zero  thoughts  in 
 your  mind  it  feels  super  enjoyable  you
[52:21] integrate  with  the  task  you  almost  lose 
 your  sense  of  self  and  why  is  this  so 
 hard  to  find  why  is  no  one  ever  taught
[52:26] you  this  before 
 well  because  it's  not  as  cool
[52:32] you  see  when  you're  trying  to  figure  out 
 what  your  Flow  State  task  is  it  might 
 not  be  the  thing  that's  going  to  make 
 like  potentially  the  most  amount  of
[52:38] money  right  now  it  might  not  be  the  most 
 trending  thing  and  so  why  isn't  this 
 spoken  about  more  if  this  is  such  great
[52:43] advice  why  is  no  one  else  speaking  about 
 this 
 I  think  it's  because
[52:48] this  isn't  a  way  to  guarantee  that 
 you'll  make  the  most  amounts  of  money 
 but  it  is  the  way  to  guarantee  that  you
[52:54] will  have  the  most  amount  of  fulfillment 
 and  purpose  in  your  life  so  you  need  to 
 choose  right  now  if  there's  one  that  you
[52:59] would  sacrifice  would  you  sacrifice  your 
 purpose  as  a  man  or  would  you  sacrifice 
 more  money  let's  say  you're  not  going  to
[53:05] be  totally  broke  which  one  would  you 
 sacrifice  the  reason  why  you  exist 
 or  material  success
[53:12] most  people  would  literally  sacrifice 
 their  purpose  that's  why  they  stay
[53:17] average  that's  why  they  stay  as  the  99 
 but  there  are  some  strong
[53:22] stoic-minded  men  Superior  men  who  would 
 always  choose  purpose  over  the  material
[53:28] success  school  did  not  prepare  you  for 
 this  in  fact  it  did  the  exact  opposite 
 School  brainwashed  you  to  think  that  you
[53:34] should  do  whatever  it  takes  to  just  get 
 into  the  career  that  will  just  be  the
[53:40] highest  salary  possible 
 School  brainwashed  you  like  that  but 
 then  unfortunately  all  these  internet
[53:46] entrepreneurs  brainwashed  you  to  think 
 that  you  should  just  do  whatever 
 business  makes  the  most  money  as 
 possible
[53:51] again  this  is  a  weak  place  to  come  from 
 why  optimize  your  life  for  material
[53:56] success  when  you  can  optimize  it  for 
 like  a  real  masculine  purpose
[54:01] it's  just  worrying  because  mask  like 
 seemingly  masculine  men 
 say  this  and  so  it  seems  weird  now  that
[54:08] I'm  like  calling  it  out  because  you're 
 realizing  yeah  it  is  [ __ ]  weird  how 
 like  wow  they're  telling  you  to  like  not
[54:13] follow  your  purpose  and  instead  of  just 
 trying  to  make  as  much  money  as  possible 
 but  that  might  not  be  your  purpose
[54:19] what  if  you  were  going  to  feel 
 absolutely  spiritually  enlightened  happy 
 loved
[54:25] purposeful  as  a  man 
 but  you  are  going  to  be  more  of  this 
 like  starving  artist  kind  of  person
[54:30] where  you  were  going  to  contribute  to 
 humanity  greatly  but  you  weren't  gonna 
 make  much  material  success  and  maybe  at
[54:36] times  you  might  be  slightly  like  you 
 might  be  like  homeless  that  sounds  awful 
 in  some  ways  but  like  what  if  that  was
[54:42] the  life  that  actually  would  have  led 
 you  to  the  greatest  actual  genuine  life
[54:48] our  fear  of  our  lack  of  material  success 
 and  status  is  gonna  make  us  sacrifice
[54:55] our  purpose  as  men  and  that  is  the 
 priority  of  Our  Lives  that  is  the  reason 
 why  we  exist  and  every  step  that  you
[55:00] take  away  from  your  purpose  will  always 
 pain  you  every  step  that  you  take 
 towards  your  purpose  will  always  serve
[55:05] you 
 foreign 
 this  is  a  big  step  towards  your  purpose
[55:10] and  again 
 I  know  that  this  doesn't  sound  very  like 
 YouTuber  mode  of  me  but  I  understand  if
[55:17] you  want  to  take  a  break  from  this  video 
 and  you  want  to  come  back  in  in 
 two  or  three  years  I  actually  understand
[55:22] and  I  know  that  seems  like  weird  to  say 
 but  if  16  year  old  me  or  17  18  19  20  21
[55:28] 22  23  year  old  me  had  watched  this  video 
 it  would  just  be  too  overwhelming  and
[55:33] I'd  be  too  scared  to  continue  watching 
 it  past  a  certain  points  if  you  are 
 gonna  think  to  yourself  yeah  you  know
[55:38] this  is  kind  of  weird  yeah  I'll  think 
 about  this  later  just  know  that  you  are 
 wasting  your  life  in  the  meantime  when
[55:43] you  go  away  for  like  a  year  or  two 
 you're  not  going  to  follow  this  advice 
 for  now  you've  wasted  those  two  years 
 you  won't  believe  it  but  eventually  you
[55:48] will  look  back  and  realize  that  it  was 
 just  pointless  to  go  and  pursue 
 something  that  wasn't  even  your  purpose
[55:53] and  there's  a  brilliant  question  that 
 can  come  up  right  now  and  you  might 
 think  okay  I  know  my  flow  State  task  I
[55:58] well  I  kind  of  know  okay  it's  probably 
 this  this  thing  right  it's  probably 
 writing  let's  say  but  what  if  it  doesn't
[56:03] make  much  money  what  if  it  can't  make 
 much  money  and  that's  a  brilliant 
 question  to  ask  but  I  would  say  don't  be
[56:08] so  sure  that  your  Flow  State  task  might 
 not  make  much  money  because  mastering  a
[56:13] skill  over  decades  inevitably  makes  you 
 like  a  high  income  earner  comparing  to
[56:19] the  person  who's  just  flipping  around 
 own  business  model  so  you're  definitely 
 got  to  be  better  off  going  all  in  on
[56:24] something  that's  not  very  profitable 
 than  like  flipping  around  and  not  making 
 any  progress  in  profitable  businesses
[56:30] that  you're  not  even  actually  making 
 progress  in  the  beauty  of  going  all  in 
 on  your  Flow  State  task  like  your  gift
[56:35] to  humanity  for  me  it's  speaking  is  that 
 this  is  the  thing  that  you  can  do  for
[56:40] decades  and  over  that  amount  of  time 
 what  is  trending  what  makes  a  lot  of
[56:45] money  right  now  inevitably  that  changes 
 and  if  it  crosses  and  overlaps  onto  your
[56:51] gift  you  will  make  a  lot  of  money 
 so  for  example  when  I  first  started  like
[56:56] these  YouTube  videos  and  it  felt  really 
 good  to  do  it  I  didn't  know  about  this 
 concept  of  flow  States  it  just  felt  kind
[57:02] of  like  right  for  me  to  give  advice  to 
 people  to  speak 
 eventually  I  started  making  a  lot  of
[57:08] money  from  this  and  I  had  to  learn  all 
 the  skills  and  you  know  go  through  the 
 trials  and  tribulations  and  everything 
 but  I  didn't  start  thinking  that  I  would
[57:14] make  this  much  money  I  just  wanted  to 
 make  like  one  or  two  thousand  dollars  a 
 month  that  was  I  literally  just  wanted
[57:19] to  make  enough  so  I  didn't  need  to  work 
 like  a  full-time  job  that  I  hated  it 
 just  so  happened  that  the  sort  of
[57:24] markets  of  where  the  money  is  going 
 moved  onto  social  media  attention
[57:31] influences  and  I  happen  to  just  grow 
 like  crazy 
 I  don't  believe  I  got  lucky  in  the
[57:37] growth  of  my  channel  I  think  I  really 
 put  in  the  work  for  that  and  I  leveled 
 up  the  skill  but  I  certainly  got  lucky
[57:43] with  the  fact  that  at  this  time  when  I 
 had  been  leveling  up  my  skill  was  when
[57:48] like  the  new  meta  of  making  money  is  now 
 currently  on  like  social  media
[57:53] influences  like  that's  like  the  the  best 
 job  or  business  that  you  can  begin  right 
 now  for  like  young  sort  of  not  that
[58:00] extremely  experienced  people  now 
 straight  away  you  might  be  thinking  okay 
 sweet  so  I'll  just  do  that  but  again
[58:05] don't  just  follow  the  money  because  this 
 will  change  this  will  have  inevitably 
 changed  in  the  next  few  years  it's  like
[58:10] you  know  people  might  find  like 
 influences  and  YouTubers  cringe  in  five 
 or  ten  years  from  now  in  this  Ai  and
[58:15] there's  so  many  new  things  coming  out 
 that  like  the  market  will  eventually 
 change  if  you're  following  the  market 
 like  a  little  dog  seeing  okay  what's
[58:21] trending  right  now  then  you're  just 
 constantly  going  to  be  like  too  far 
 behind  the  only  way  in  my  opinion  to  get
[58:26] really  really  rich 
 is  you  go  all  the  way  into  your  Flow
[58:31] State  task  for  me  it's  speaking  and  if 
 the  market  just  ends  up  actually 
 overlapping  and  then  you  get  super  super
[58:37] rewarded  it's  like  you  got  lucky  in  some 
 ways  and  also  you  forced  it  in  others  I
[58:42] think  that's  the  way  that  you  get  rich 
 these  days 
 people  just  end  up  rewarding  your  Flow
[58:48] State  task  just  because  that's  like  the 
 nature  of  like  business  has  just  moved 
 around  you  know  our  interests  have  just
[58:54] moved  around  imagine  the  guy  who  is 
 studying  AI  artificial  intelligence  10
[58:59] years  ago 
 it  was  kind  of  like  you  know  like  who 
 who  the  [ __ ]  was  talking  about  this  I'm
[59:04] sure  like  though  that  space  knew  that  it 
 was  still  going  to  be  massive  but  it's 
 like  normal  people  we  weren't  thinking
[59:09] about  AI  10  years  ago  when  you  were  like 
 12  years  old  or  however  old  you  are 
 minus  10  years  we  weren't  thinking  about
[59:15] it  right  so  there  was  a  guy  studying  it 
 not  even  thinking  that  he  had  ever 
 become  rich  from  it
[59:20] and  then  the  market  moved  over  and 
 overlapped  his  interest  his  flow  States
[59:25] then  he  became  a  millionaire  because  or 
 billionaire  because  he's  made  some  like 
 AI  product  now
[59:32] but  I  think  that's  the  better  way  to  go 
 about  it  and  then  a  fantastic  question 
 you  could  ask  is  okay  but  what  if  the
[59:38] market  never  really  overlaps  my  flow 
 State  task 
 if  that  happens  honestly  this  sounds
[59:43] kind  of  lame  but  I'll  just  tell  you  use 
 the  same  mindset  from  the  step  one  which 
 is  like  yep  I  don't  even  care  about
[59:48] money  I'm  doing  the  thing  which  really  I 
 enjoy  you  know  here  I  am  the  fisherman 
 like  I'm  having  an  awesome  life  because
[59:53] of  that  as  long  as  you're  never  hungry 
 as  long  as  you're  meeting  the  Baseline 
 you  know  you're  making  a  few  k  a  month 
 which  you  absolutely  will  if  you  go  all
[59:59] in  on  one  skill  for  decades  you're  gonna 
 get  to  the  point  where  you're  making  at
[60:04] least  five  to  10K  a  month  even  way  way 
 more  than  that  imagine  that  it  doesn't 
 even  matter  if  it's  not  even  like  a
[60:09] great  like  fancy  skill  to  get  into  but 
 if  you  literally  did  it  for  decades  good
[60:15] get  to  the  point  where  naturally  you'll 
 see  the  opportunities  inside  of  that 
 business  model  and  everything  it'd  be
[60:20] absolutely  fine 
 and  if  the  market  does  overlap  then  okay 
 sweet  then  you  know  rinse  it  out  enjoy
[60:26] the  extra  money  but  it's  like  with  this 
 powerful  mindset  like  you  don't  even 
 care  so  the  market  overlapped  my  flow
[60:32] State  task 
 I  became  quite  successful 
 here  I  am  in  the  same  house  because  the
[60:39] success  and  the  money  doesn't  actually 
 Define  me 
 it  doesn't  change  me  if  it  changes  you
[60:44] then  it  shows  that  you're  quite  like  a 
 weak  person  so  you  can  either  follow 
 what's  hot  and  trending  right  now
[60:50] or  you  can  just  stay  on  your  Flow  State 
 task  the  gift  that  you  have  to  humanity
[60:56] and  just  keep  giving  that  at  a  greater 
 level  the  impact  that  I'm  hoping  for 
 with  this  video  is  that  more  young  men
[61:02] actually  are  taking  up  a  intelligent 
 path  to  wealth  a  more  secure  and  actual
[61:08] actually  strong  path  again  even  though 
 they  like  there's  male  influencers  who
[61:14] seem  strong  their  advice  is  actually 
 awfully  weak  and  I  want  to  raise  the
[61:19] strength  of  men  I  want  men  to  be  more 
 masculine  that  comes  from  you  following 
 your  purpose  your  flow  stick  task  is
[61:24] likely  your  purpose 
 so  my  advice  isn't  as  cool  it's  not
[61:30] gonna  probably  not  gonna  get  you  like  as 
 much 
 like  Club  [ __ ]  like  you  know  random
[61:36] girls  messaging  you  and  stuff  it's 
 probably  not  going  to  get  you  that 
 you're  not  going  to  get  as  many  likes  on 
 Instagram  and  stuff  but
[61:43] it  will  get  you 
 enlightenment
[61:48] it  will  get  you  love  it  will  get  you 
 faith 
 instead  of  like  the  random  girls  like
[61:54] you  know  sending  you  messages  you'll  get 
 more  of 
 the  higher  quality  spiritual  open  loving
[62:01] women  who  trust  you 
 and  you'll  have  better  sex  with  them  as 
 well  by  the  way
[62:07] then  like  the  little  degenerates  I  just 
 want  more  young  men  to  be  like  happy  and 
 productive  and  to  have  like  something  to
[62:13] work  hard  for  and  it  really  saddens  me 
 to  see  so  many  young  men  just  jumping 
 around  business  models  just  chasing  the
[62:19] money  in  such  a  weak  mindset  and  you 
 know  feeling  so  bad  about  themselves 
 when  there's  such  a  stronger  way  to  go
[62:24] about  this  pursuit  of  wealth
[62:30] if  you'd  like  to  help  that  mission 
 just  do  something  very  quick  if  you  just
[62:35] scroll  down  right  now  and  click  on  the 
 like  button  or  maybe  you  can  write  a 
 comment  the  YouTube  algorithm  will  like
[62:41] share  this  video  around  more  young  guys 
 can  see  it  so  here's  your  actionable 
 step  for  this  part  of  the  guide  we  want
[62:46] you  to  figure  out  your  Flow  State  task 
 I'll  have  a  card  come  up  on  screen  where 
 you  can  go  on  my  channel  and  it's  the
[62:51] Flow  State  Focus  full  guide  it's  really 
 worth  watching  figure  out  what  your  Flow
[62:56] State  task  is  it's  really  worth  your 
 time  to  know  what  work  what  task  what 
 like  hour  of  your  day  do  you  have  zero
[63:02] thoughts  which  just  puts  you  into  this 
 beautifully  present  mode  as  I  am  here
[63:07] with  zero  thoughts  in  my  mind  you  know 
 why  this  actionable  step  is  worth  doing 
 because  when  you  figure  out  your  Flow
[63:12] State  task  you  finally  know  what  to  go 
 all  in  on  no  more  jumping  around
[63:17] business  model  to  business  model  you've 
 got  something  which  doesn't  change  and 
 you  can  literally  just  stick  to  it  now
[63:22] okay  this  is  the  thing  I'm  gonna  like 
 use  to  make  money  step  three  who  you're
[63:27] going  to  sell  to  what's  the  purpose  of  a 
 car 
 just  answer  that  question  in  your  mind
[63:33] what's  the  purpose  of  a  car 
 to  get  to  a  destination  right
[63:39] imagine  if  there  was  an  unintelligent 
 person  who  answered  that  question  and 
 said  like  oh  well  to  go  to  the  gas
[63:45] station  to  buy  gas 
 the  purpose  of  a  car  is  to  buy  gas
[63:50] yeah 
 no  it's  nice  to  get  to  the  destination 
 right
[63:56] but  then  why  are  you  that  unintelligent 
 guy  when  it  comes  to  business  because  a
[64:01] business  and  a  car  are  actually  quite 
 similar 
 their  purpose  is  to  get  to  some  kind  of
[64:07] destination  to  achieve  something  and 
 they  use  fuel  to  get  there  the  fuel  for
[64:13] a  business  is  money  the  purpose  of  a 
 business  is  not  to  make  money  the  money 
 is  the  fuel  to  get  to  some  kind  of
[64:20] destination  or  impact  but  so  many  young 
 men  have  the  wrong  mindset  when  it  comes 
 to  business  and  they've  believed  that
[64:25] you  get  into  business  to  make  money 
 but  if  that's  your  mindset  you  stay
[64:30] broke 
 because  you're  needy 
 how  do  you  attract  a  girl
[64:37] do  you  act  needy  desperate  do  you  focus 
 on  her  or  do  you  focus  on  your  own
[64:43] destination  where  you  want  your  life  to 
 go  and  the  woman  is  such  a  beautiful
[64:48] addition  but  not  the  entire  part  of  your 
 life 
 being  needy  repels  the  girl  being  needy
[64:55] repels  the  money  think  of  business  as 
 money  is  the  same  topic  your  business  is
[65:00] to  achieve  some  kind  of  mission  some 
 cause  to  help  some  kind  of  people  and
[65:05] you  use  money  to  do  that  so  who  do  you 
 want  to  help 
 because  we've  got  to  the  point  now  where
[65:10] you  kind  of  are  understanding  your  Flow 
 State  task  what  you  might  do  for  money 
 who  do  you  want  to  use  that  flow  State
[65:16] task  that  gift  for  who  do  you  want  to 
 work  hard  for  not  just  who  will  give  you
[65:21] money  imagine  if  you  were  a  billionaire 
 imagine  if  you  had  tens  of  billions  and 
 unlimited  credit  card
[65:27] who  would  you  want  to  help 
 who  are  your  people
[65:32] for  me  it's  young  men  who  are  struggling 
 young  men  who  remind  me  of  my  younger 
 self  who  were  so  clueless  and  who  didn't
[65:38] really  have  like  a  single  good  Mentor 
 out  there  I  had  my  brother  but  then  life 
 kind  of  splits  us  apart  my  father  was
[65:45] overworking  80  hours  a  week  the 
 education  system  let  me  down  the  the  fat 
 obese  obese  female  teachers  who
[65:52] throttled  the  masculinity  inside  of  me 
 who  made  me  sit  straight  with  my  legs 
 cross  squishing  my  balls  that  pissed  me
[65:59] off 
 and  so  finally  when  I  was  21  years  old 
 22  years  old  and  I  was  trying  to  make 
 something  of  myself  it  was  so  difficult
[66:05] to  sit  down  and  work  because  all  of  my 
 life  these  beliefs  had  been  implanted 
 into  my  mind  that  I  couldn't  like  sit
[66:11] down  and  do  work  by  myself  because  I 
 needed  a  teacher  an  authority  figure  to 
 tell  me  what  to  do  first  I  need  a  daddy
[66:18] to  come  and  give  me  homework  that  I 
 didn't  feel  like  a  man  let  alone  even 
 understanding  what  being  a  man  was  and
[66:24] so  what  did  I  do 
 I  made  progress  on  myself
[66:30] I  dedicated  myself  to  the  kind  of  vision 
 mission  and  goals  for  myself
[66:36] and  then  when  I  looked  around  and  I  saw 
 so  many  men  struggling  with  the  exact 
 same  thing  and  I  knew  that  I  had  like
[66:41] the  answers  in  my  mind  the  system  the 
 framework  to  help  other  guys
[66:47] and  my  flow  State  task  for  me  like  you 
 know  the  the  thing  the  work  task  that
[66:52] doesn't  really  feel  like  work  is 
 speaking 
 it  became  obvious  I  want  to  help  you  I
[66:57] want  to  help  young  men  who  are 
 struggling  in  in  this  modern  world  young 
 men  who  don't  know  their  place  young  men
[67:03] who  haven't  developed  the  skills  the 
 mindset  the  beliefs  the  values  that  they 
 need  to  achieve  some  kind  of  good  life  I
[67:09] want  to  develop  more  men  honestly  for  my 
 own  selfish  reason  I  just  want  more  men 
 who  are  like  me  so  that  I  can  have  more
[67:16] friends  because  it's  a  lonely  Journey 
 when  you  start  to  embark  on  this  path  I 
 want  to  go  into  the  gym  and  see  more
[67:21] guys  in  there 
 I  want  to  walk  past  the  guy  and  know 
 that  he's  been  meditating  for  the  last
[67:27] two  years  that's  why  I  do  what  I  do  so 
 relentlessly  and  so  you  can  think  about 
 this  who  would  be  your  people  what  would
[67:35] be  your  cause  your  mission  your 
 movements  this  is  the  beauty  of  a
[67:40] business  and  I  really  want  to  give  you 
 this  mindset  because  it  will  really  help 
 you  this  belief  that  we  can  put  into 
 your  mind  the  point  of  a  business  is  for
[67:47] you  to  create  some  kind  of  impact  in  the 
 world  so  what  impact  do  you  want  to 
 create  you  use  money  to  help  create  that
[67:53] impact  so  for  example  the  money  that  my 
 business  makes  I'm  able  to  hire  teachers 
 and  experts  to  teach  inside  of  my  online
[67:59] school  so  you  can  see  that  my  movements 
 my  impact  is  to  try  and  help  young  men 
 to  educate  them  and  the  money  that  I
[68:05] make  for  my  business  I  reinvest  it  for 
 the  mission  and  of  course  it  gets  the
[68:10] point  when  you're  profiting  so  much  and 
 you  can't  even  like  spend  more  money  in 
 the  business  and  so  you  get  to  like 
 upgrade  your  lifestyle  and  you  make  more
[68:16] money  personally  but  as  we  discussed 
 like  you  making  more  money  is  it's  Not 
 Gonna  Change  Your  Life  as  much  as  you
[68:21] think  but  you  creating  a  positive  impact 
 for  the  people  you  genuinely  care  about 
 will  so  this  is  the  point  that  so  many
[68:27] people  struggle  and  they  literally  waste 
 like  six  to  12  months  of  their  lives 
 because  when  they  chase  the  money  when
[68:33] someone's  mindset  is  just  thinking  okay 
 business  I  want  to  make  money  fast  they 
 go  wherever  they've  just  heard  about 
 monies  okay  so  this  one  this  one  this
[68:39] business  model  this  this  customer  and 
 you've  probably  heard  of  these  business 
 models  that  I'm  talking  about  where
[68:44] you've  seen  the  advice  on  YouTube  where 
 it's  like  oh  yeah  how  to  like  start  an 
 agency  to  to  market  for  chiropractors  or
[68:51] something 
 my  advice  is  to  not  go  down  the  route 
 where  you're  just  trying  to  chase  money
[68:57] and  you're  trying  to  like  get  into  this 
 profitable  Market 
 because  if  you  don't  care  about  them  if
[69:03] you  don't  care  about  helping  Cairo 
 practice  scale 
 why  would  you  want  to  spend  your  life
[69:08] doing  that  just  to  make  money 
 what  if  you  did  it  the  other  way  around 
 what  if  you  still  made  a  lot  of  money
[69:14] but  your  business  was  about  helping  the 
 people  that  you  cared  about  the  kind  of
[69:19] people  that  you  cared  about  the 
 movements  maybe  it's  not  even  people 
 maybe  it's  animals  maybe  it's  the 
 environment  maybe  it's  it's  wanting  to
[69:25] get  into  space  travel  maybe  it's  wanting 
 to  help  video  Gamers  quit  playing  games 
 maybe  it's  wanting  to  help  guys  who  keep
[69:31] watching  porn  and  they  hate  themselves 
 for  it  maybe  it's  guys  who've  got  bad
[69:36] mental  health  and  you've  experienced 
 that  so  that's  your  big  movement  is  like 
 I  want  to  help  guys  who  are  suffering 
 from  depression  and  anxiety  I  want  to
[69:42] help  men  who  are  overworked  I  want  to 
 you  know  it  could  be  so  specific  I  want 
 to  help  men  who  have  literally  just  lost
[69:47] a  child 
 because  what  if  you  went  through  that 
 yourself  and  it  was  so  brutally  hard  and
[69:53] so  this  could  become  your  business 
 that's  what  you  work  hard  on
[69:58] naturally  when  you  work  hard  in  these 
 like  capitalistic  societies  people  will 
 end  up  paying  you  money  for  it  you  use
[70:04] that  money  to  further  your  cause 
 so  this  is  a  mini  actionable  step  for
[70:09] you 
 just  try  and  think  of  the  kind  of  people
[70:14] or  cause  or  Mission  that  would  actually 
 mean  a  lot  for  you 
 what  would  get  you  genuinely  out  of  bed
[70:21] in  the  morning  would  it  be  to  help 
 chiropractors  scale  to  six  figures 
 agency  marketing  for  these  people  would
[70:27] it  really  be  that 
 or  would  it  be  maybe  like  helping 
 your  younger  self
[70:33] a  guy  who  experienced  like  one  problem 
 that  you  had  business  is  all  about  just 
 helping  people  with  their  problems
[70:40] and  so  whose  problems  what  people  do  you 
 want  for  help  I  believe  that  this  is  the
[70:45] right  way  the  powerful  way  to  go  about 
 your  business  we're  actually  focused
[70:50] more  on  other  people  and  your  business 
 becomes  like  a  gift  to  the  world  any 
 money  that  you  make  when  you're  living
[70:56] so  purposefully 
 feels  like  a  brilliant  bonus
[71:01] but  it's  just  that  it's  it's  a  bonus  on 
 top  of  an  already  good  life
[71:07] and  again  what  does  that  sound  like 
 like  women
[71:12] don't  you  see  making  money  and 
 attracting  a  woman  is  very  very  similar 
 when  you're  needy  when  you  chase  the
[71:18] money  when  you  chase  the  girl  that 
 eludes  you  it  runs  away  from  you  it's 
 disgusted  by  you
[71:25] but  when  you're  not  needy  when  you  have 
 this  abundant  mindset  when  you're 
 focused  on  something  else  when  you're
[71:30] focused  on  your  purpose  that's  when  it 
 naturally  comes  to  you  and  it's  like  you
[71:35] care  you  value  it  or  since  I  have 
 but  you're  fine  either  way  that's  such  a
[71:41] powerful  mindset 
 and  how  are  you  fine  either  way 
 because  the  actions  and  the  life  that
[71:48] you've  set  up  the  business  that  you've 
 set  up 
 is  there  for  the  right  reason  it's  not
[71:53] just  for  the  money  your  life  isn't  set 
 up  just  for  the  woman
[71:58] it's  there  for  purpose  for  impact  for 
 community  and  contribution
[72:03] who  do  you  want  to  contribute  to 
 what  kind  of  people  would  you  like  to 
 help  what  kind  of  people  would  you  like
[72:09] to  have  around  you  your  people 
 and  then  don't  you  see  we're  going  to
[72:14] use  our  Flow  State  task  kind  of  like  a 
 gift  to  these  people  you  are  like  my
[72:19] people  you're  a  young  man  who  wants  to 
 improve  his  life  and  my  gift  to  you  is 
 my  skill  of  speaking
[72:25] if  this  makes  no  money  at  all 
 I'm  fine
[72:32] because  I  have  no  thoughts  in  my  brain 
 my  monkey  mind  is  quiet  and  there's 
 there's  impact  and  purpose  and
[72:38] contribution  to  humanity  that  makes  me 
 feel  awesome  24  7.  I  don't  need  the 
 extra  dopamine  or  validation  because  I'm
[72:44] helping  you 
 and  when  this  does  make  money
[72:49] well  then  it's  like  such  an  awesome 
 bonus 
 and  it  makes  more  money  than  you  realize
[72:54] probably  more  than  just  chasing  the 
 money  because  I've  got  the  Abundant 
 mindset  I  work  super  hard  because  it
[73:01] just  feels  like  fun  for  me  so  how  could 
 many  people  compete  with  me  when  I'm 
 doing  this  for  fun  for  as  many  hours  of
[73:07] the  day  as  possible  and  someone  else  is 
 doing  this  for  money
[73:12] when  he  makes  enough  money  he's  gonna 
 stop 
 I  don't  stop
[73:17] because  I'm  just  playing  a  game  I'm  just 
 literally  just  helping  my  Bros  out
[73:22] do  you  see  how  this  actually  makes  you  a 
 lethal  competitive  capable  entrepreneur 
 so  we  want  to  choose  your  markets  the
[73:28] kind  of  people  you  want  to  help  your 
 dream  Avatar  the  ideal  customer
[73:34] how  do  you  find  that  out 
 well  it's  just  through  asking  yourself 
 about  your  interests  and  and  what  you
[73:40] value  what  you  care  about  who  do  you 
 like 
 who  do  you  want  to  help  who  do  you
[73:45] understand  whose  problems  could  you 
 genuinely  help  with
[73:50] for  a  lot  of  us  watching  the  easiest 
 answer  and  perhaps  the  best  answer  is
[73:55] your  younger  self  just  like  if  you  think 
 back  six  months  or  12  months  or  maybe 
 even  years  and  you  think  about  a
[74:00] specific  problem  that  your  younger  self 
 was  going  through  maybe  you  just  decide 
 to  help  them  once  you  have  an  idea  of
[74:07] what  it  could  be  you  know  the  kind  of 
 person  you  want  to  help  but  you  don't 
 feel  too  certain  I'll  give  you  the  best 
 advice  I  could  give  so  I  hope  you  take
[74:12] this  seriously  just  choose  one  and 
 commit  to  it  what  kind  of  person  could
[74:17] you  help  the  first  thing  that  comes  to 
 your  mind  is  like  my  younger  selfie  was 
 addicted  to  video  games  boom  just  go 
 with  that  just  go  with  that  because
[74:23] naturally  over  the  next  few  months 
 you're  kind  of  fine-shun  and  correct 
 course  and  know  what  you  like  know  what
[74:28] you  don't  like  but  trying  to  overthink 
 this  right  now  and  thinking  of  the 
 perfect  market  and  everything  like  this
[74:33] like  this  overthinking  of  so  many  young 
 guys  get  into  you  make  no  progress  so 
 just  choose  one  right  now  and  let's  dive
[74:38] deep  into  it  there's  a  fantastic 
 question  that  comes  up  especially  when 
 we  start  to  think  about  our  younger
[74:43] selves  as  like  the  market  that  we  want 
 to  help  the  people  we  want  to  help  and 
 that  is  what  if
[74:49] my  ideal  person  or  or  customer  doesn't
[74:54] have  so  much  money 
 so  what  if  for  example  your  people  that 
 you  want  to  help  is  young  men  who  are
[75:00] addicted  to  video  games 
 but  of  course  you  know  we  want  to  make  a 
 business  we  do  want  to  make  money  but
[75:06] those  guys  don't  really  have  that  much 
 money  to  give  you  right  compared  to  like 
 what  you've  heard  on  online  on  YouTube
[75:11] where  if  you  make  like  an  agency  for 
 chiropractors  or  for  for 
 um  orthodontists  or  something  they've
[75:16] got  a  lot  of  money  so  you  know  it  might 
 be  better  to  go  with  them 
 here's  where  I  would  disagree
[75:21] because 
 let's  imagine  like  a  stereotypical  16 
 year  old  young  guy  he's  broke  right  he
[75:28] can't  afford  any  product  that  we  want  to 
 sell  him  right 
 is  that  so
[75:35] what  shoes  is  he  wearing 
 Nike  trainers  hundred  and  fifty  dollars
[75:42] how  much  new  shoes  these  days  a  lot  of 
 [ __ ]  even  16  year  old  broke 
 kids  they  don't  buy  pre-owned  shoes  from
[75:48] eBay  or  anything  right  they  go  into  the 
 store  and  buy  them  just  like  new  as  you 
 would  expect  right  from  Nike  or  JD  or
[75:54] Adidas  whatever  how  much  are  shoes  100 
 150  and  they're  spending  that  every
[75:59] couple  of  months  on  new  shoes 
 and  what  has  he  got  inside  of  his  ears
[76:04] airpods  how  much  are  airpods  200  dollars 
 his  shirt  35  40  dollars
[76:13] so  they've  got  money  right  so  don't 
 [ __ ]  yourself  because  I  used  to  do 
 this  and  I  this  is  something  I  see  all
[76:18] the  time  with  young  guys  who  are  getting 
 into  business  and  they'll  always  say 
 this  like  oh  but  you  know  my  I'm  really
[76:23] young  people  in  my  country  don't  make  as 
 much  money  this  is  this  I'm  strong 
 they've  got  airpods  they've  got  trainers
[76:29] what  do  you  want  about  that  they  don't 
 have  money  to  buy  your  services  yes  they 
 do  that's  a  limiting  belief  destroy  it 
 right  now
[76:34] think  to  yourself  with  this  like  like  a 
 bit  of  a  stronger  mindset  they're
[76:39] spending  money  on  stuff  why  not  your 
 stuff 
 if  this  is  the  kind  of  person  you  want
[76:44] to  help 
 and  you  want  to  go  all  in  on  this  market 
 like  your  people  and  you  want  to  help
[76:49] them  and  also  make  money 
 then  don't  be  scared  think  at  all  but 
 usually  you  know  most  young  people  don't
[76:54] have  as  much  money  yeah  it's  a  fact  that 
 young  people  have  less  money  than  all 
 people  okay  fine  that's  a  fact  but
[76:59] they've  got  more  than  enough  to  make  a 
 lot  of  money  for  you  if  you've  got  a 
 good  product  and  a  way  to  Market  which
[77:04] will  cover  in  this  guide 
 so  I  think  it's  way  better  to  choose  the 
 market  the  people  that  you  genuinely
[77:10] care  about  even  if  it  seems  like  they 
 don't  have  as  much  money  as  like  a 
 different  Market  which  you  would  only
[77:15] try  to  help  for  the  money  like  if  you 
 have  a  passion  to  help  Cairo  practice
[77:20] and  physiotherapists  and  dentists  scale 
 up  their  businesses  then  sure  do  that 
 but  if  you  like  if  you're  thinking  like
[77:26] why  the  who  what  the  [ __ ]  is  a 
 chiropractic  like  then  don't  pursue
[77:32] trying  to  help  people  that  you  don't 
 even  know  or  care  about 
 rather  just  go  with  the  kind  of  people
[77:37] that  you  want  to  help  now  look  at  Andrew 
 says  he's  made  a  lot  of  money  in  the
[77:42] last  few  years  right  but  like  if  you  do 
 the  math  probably  hundreds  of  Millions 
 whose  is  his  Market
[77:49] specifically  broke  young  men 
 he  appeals  to  the  broke  young  man  and
[77:56] yet  he's  made  Millions  from  them 
 because  they  still  have  enough  money  to 
 add  up  to  get  you  to  a  crazy  amount
[78:05] destroy  that  limiting  belief  and  this  is 
 going  to  get  interesting  this  is  where 
 you're  going  to  learn  a  marketing  term
[78:10] it's  called  customer  Avatar  the  dream 
 Avatar
[78:15] the  idea  is  that  we  want  to  construct 
 this  understanding  of  like  the  dream
[78:20] perfect  person  that  you're  trying  to 
 help  you  see  you  don't  want  to  keep  it
[78:25] in  Mind  of  a  group  of  people  that  you 
 want  to  help  you  don't  want  to  keep  in
[78:30] mind  lots  of  people  you're  rather  very 
 much  personalize  your  message  your
[78:35] marketing  or  your  product  everything  for 
 maybe  a  specific  person  so  this  is  a
[78:41] great  marketing  tactic  that  you  can  do 
 what  we  want  to  do  is  create  our  Dream 
 Avatar  so  this  is  your  actionable  step
[78:46] load  up  a  documents  on  your  computer 
 maybe  your  phone  or  a  piece  of  paper  and
[78:52] just  title  it  like  dream  Avatar  customer 
 Avatar  what  we  want  is  pure
[78:59] autistic  detail  about  the  kind  of  person 
 that  we  want  to  help  with  our  business
[79:04] I'm  talking  detail  like  we  want  to  know 
 the  first  few  thoughts  that  pop  into
[79:09] their  mind  the  moment  that  their  eyes 
 open  when  they  wake  up  we  want  to  know 
 not  just  what  they  say  out  loud  publicly
[79:17] that  they  want  but  what  they  really  want 
 what  they  might  not  talk  about  outside 
 of  like  their  own  mind  we  want  to  know
[79:23] their  fears  their  hopes  their  dreams 
 their  goals  we  want  to  know  what  content
[79:28] they're  consuming  what  websites  they're 
 on  we  want  to  know  the  bad  habits  and 
 the  good  habits  that  they  get  into  we
[79:33] want  to  have  like  a  document  which 
 outlines  one  specific  like  imaginary 
 person  maybe  it's  not  even  imaginary
[79:39] maybe  it's  you  maybe  it's  your  younger 
 self  maybe  it's  someone  that  you  know 
 give  it  a  name  maybe  even  a  picture
[79:44] construct  like  a  character  and  the  idea 
 is  once  we  have  this  document  this 
 understanding  that  this  is  who  we're
[79:50] trying  to  sell  to 
 we  constantly  just  think  about  this  one 
 person  this  imaginary  character  that
[79:56] we've  made  up  anything  that  we  do  from 
 now  on  we're  gonna  do  to  help  this  one
[80:01] person  because  can  you  see  how  powerful 
 this  is  here  we  are  we're  going  to 
 obsess  over  this  one  person  and  there's
[80:07] millions  of  people  like  that 
 but  every  time  we  speak  now  let's  say
[80:13] when  I  speak  to  you  on  camera 
 does  it  feel  like  I'm  speaking  to 
 millions  of  people  right  now  you  know
[80:20] through  this  video  has  it  felt  like  I'm 
 speaking  to  two  million  guys  has  it  been 
 like  have  I  started  the  video  saying  Hey
[80:26] guys  and  so  I  wanted  to  help  you  all 
 with  this  imagine  how  much  less  you 
 might  like  me  and  invest  in  the  videos
[80:32] that  I  make  if  I  spoke  in  that  way  where 
 I  was  recording  this  right  now  for  my
[80:37] audience  instead  of  you 
 truthfully  I  record  these  videos  not
[80:44] really  even  for  you  or  for  my  audience 
 before  younger  Hamza  younger  Hamza  is
[80:50] like  a  character  that  I've  created  in  my 
 mind  that's  my  like  dream  customer 
 Avatar  and  I've  even  got  documents  on  my
[80:56] PC  which  are  like  very  detailed  where 
 I've  literally  spoke  about  like  his  real 
 desires  that  he  wouldn't  have  said  out
[81:01] loud  and  some  of  them  I've  wrote  is  like 
 he'll  act  like  a  normal  person  but  he's 
 really  obsessed  with  wanting  to  [ __ ]  as
[81:07] many  girls  as  possible  it's  like  a  real 
 Primal  desire  inside  of  him  he  won't 
 talk  about  it  much  but  like  it's  the
[81:12] truth  so  if  you  can  appeal  to  that  he's 
 more  likely  to  follow  you
[81:17] he  wants  the  bill  of  muscle 
 specifically  so  that  he  can  get  more 
 likes  on  Tinder  now  this  was  like  the
[81:23] sort  of  Avatar  I  was  attracting  you  know 
 last  year  on  YouTube  right  and  I
[81:28] followed  that  to  a  t  in  my  channel  blew 
 up  because  younger  Hamza  is  not  so
[81:33] unique  there's  millions  of  him  around 
 the  world 
 but  when  you  focus  specifically  on  like
[81:40] one  person  that  you're  imagining  like 
 right  now  I  always  speak  on  camera  as  if 
 I'm  speaking  to  my  younger  self
[81:46] it  makes  each  person  in  the  audience  or 
 each  customer  feel  like  more  committed
[81:52] to  your  message  to  your  business 
 you  get  a  greater  understanding  of  who
[81:59] you're  trying  to  help  and  what  product 
 to  make  and  the  way  to  speak  and  the  way 
 to  Market  and  sell 
 so  this  is  very  powerful  this  might  take
[82:05] you  about  half  an  hour  to  an  hour  either 
 do  it  right  now  pause  the  video  or  do  it
[82:10] like  as  soon  as  you've  got  like  a  deep 
 work  block  like  some  high  level  thinking 
 maybe  you  wake  up  tomorrow  morning  and 
 you  do  this  you  create  your  dream  Avatar
[82:16] documents  and  what  I'll  do  for  you  for 
 free  I  wasn't  planning  to  do  this  I'll 
 make  a  template  for  like  the  customer
[82:22] Avatar  and  I'll  just  link  it  in  the 
 description  there's  no  email  sign  up 
 nothing  to  buy  or  anything  it's 
 literally  just  like  a  notion  documents
[82:27] I'll  make  it  right  now  and  then  I'll 
 link  it  there  so  you  can  just  use  that 
 as  like  a  template  so  all  the  questions
[82:32] are  there  just  to  make  it  easier  for  you 
 I'm  a  nice  guy  man  if  you're  going  to 
 use  the  template  please  help  me  please

 difference  man  but  if  you  can  share  this
[82:48] video  if  you  can  ever  mention  it  to 
 someone  else  if  you've  got  some  friends 
 who  are  interested  in  this  topic  if  you
[82:53] end  up  getting  into  a  conversation 
 somewhere  in  real  life  or  on  the 
 Internet  a  month  from  now  if  you  ever
[82:58] just  say  out  loud  or  write  it  down  in  in 
 the  comments  on  the  Internet  or  you
[83:03] should  go  watch  how  money  full  guide 
 that  would  mean  a  lot  to  me  as  many
[83:08] comments  like  that  that  you  could  leave 
 around  the  internet  oh  yeah  hamza's  full 
 guide  hamza's  money  guide 
 spreading  Word  of  Mouth  for  this  work  is
[83:15] very  very  powerful  and  it  would  mean  a 
 lot  to  me  if  like  these  guides  ended  up
[83:20] helping  more  people  and  of  course  that 
 would  also  grow  my  business  so  it's  a 
 win-win  for  everyone  really  if  you
[83:26] wanted  to  do  that  please  do  that  once 
 you've  got  that  document  and  you've 
 started  to  think  okay  this  is  you  know

[83:32] trying  to  attract  and  you  might  not  feel 
 perfect  on  it  of  course  like  as  the 
 months  go  by  your  correct  course  you'll
[83:37] change  a  few  things  in  there  that's 
 absolutely  fine  what  you  want  to  do  now 
 to  stand  out  from  your  potential
[83:43] competition 
 to  be  able  to  sell  the  product  which 
 we're  about  to  make  in  the  rest  of  this 
 guide
[83:48] you  want  to  know  this  type  of  person  as
[83:53] well  as  possible 
 to  really  make  a  lot  of  money  in  the 
 future
[83:58] I  want  you  right  now  to  go  above  and 
 beyond  to  get  to  know  this  this  Avatar
[84:03] this  person  so  there  might  be  some 
 people  that  you  know  who  are  already 
 like  that
[84:08] speak  to  them 
 ask  them  questions
[84:14] ask  them  what  are  your  goals  what's  you 
 know  what  are  you  doing  what  which  video 
 are  you  more  likely  to  click  on  get
[84:19] constant  feedback  if  you  wear  your  own 
 avatar  for  example  mine's  my  younger
[84:24] self  I've  done  something  which  I  call 
 Avatar  journaling  which  is  where  I'll 
 kind  of  put  myself  into  the  state  of
[84:30] feeling  like  I  am  my  younger  self  the 
 person  I'm  trying  to  attract  for  these 
 videos  for  my  business  and  I'll  write  as
[84:35] if  I  am  him  and  the  thoughts  that  I  can 
 kind  of  imagine  he  was  getting  and  the 
 desires  and  the  problems  and  the  fears
[84:40] and  the  hopes  and  dreams  and  everything 
 and  I'll  write  as  if  I'm  him  just  to 
 gain  a  better  understanding  of  what  he's
[84:46] going  through  what  kind  of  videos  he 
 might  end  up  watching  what  product  he 
 might  end  up  buying  you  can  think  about
[84:51] that  level  of  extra  detail  and 
 understanding  that  I  was  getting  to  be 
 able  to  attract
[84:56] someone  like  you  and  then  I  went  even 
 further  I  started  to  do  a  one-to-one
[85:01] video  call  every  single  morning  for 
 months  months  and  months  and  months
[85:08] just  to  kind  of  understand  the  kind  of 
 people  that  I  was  trying  to  help  to
[85:13] further  just  create  the  kind  of  like 
 mind  that  I  needed  to  be  able  to  help 
 someone  like  you
[85:18] so  I  just  started  to  hop  on  calls  with 
 people  all  the  time  there  was  a  point 
 when  I  literally  was  doing  hours  of  free
[85:25] calls  a  day  just  for  a  few  weeks  just  to 
 really  like  sort  of  put  my  trajectory  of
[85:30] understanding  this  avatar  on  The  Fast 
 Track  and  it  was  super  super  powerful  to 
 do  that  by  doing  this  actionable  step
[85:35] now  which  you  could  probably  Breeze 
 through  in  about  15  minutes  you  will 
 significantly  improve  how  much  money
[85:41] you're  about  to  make  because  you'll  just 
 be  better  at  marketing  and  knowing  who 
 you're  speaking  to  but  of  course  doing
[85:47] this  actionable  step  knowing  who  you're 
 speaking  to  is  almost  pointless  if  you
[85:52] don't  have  a  product  to  sell  them  so 
 let's  get  to  that  step  four  creating 
 your  product  in  this  part  of  this  guide
[85:58] you're  going  to  know  exactly  what  you're 
 going  to  sell  you're  going  to  create  a 
 product  that's  genuinely  literally
[86:05] 10  times  better  than  your  competitors 
 I'm  not  exaggerating  when  I  say  that  you 
 are  going  to  create  a  product  that  is  10
[86:11] times  better  than  what  your  competitors 
 are  selling  and  for  a  nice  wholesome 
 benefit  of  this  guide  this  is  going  to
[86:17] give  you  something  interesting  and  fun 
 to  work  hard  for  often  when  I  ask  young
[86:24] guys  inside  of  my  own  like  Pro  I  have 
 like  a  private  online  school  and  when  I
[86:29] ask  them  this  question  I  always  see  like 
 the  chat  flood  up  I  always  ask 
 who  here  is  willing  to  work  super  hard
[86:36] to  make  a  lot  of  money  type  one  in  the 
 chat  right  now  and  it  floods  with  ones
[86:42] so  it  tells  me  and  you'll  probably 
 relate  to  what  I'm  about  to  say  that 
 young  men  are  willing  to  work  really
[86:48] hard  to  improve  their  lives  and  to  make 
 money  to  create  success  the  problem  is
[86:53] just  that  you're  not  really  sure  on  what 
 to  actually  work  hard  for  and  so  this
[86:59] part  of  the  guide  is  going  to  walk  you 
 through  literally  step  by  step  exactly 
 what  to  do  to  make  your  product  and  your
[87:04] product  is  going  to  be  a  lot  better  than 
 you've  ever  imagined  I  wouldn't  usually 
 hype  up  like  a  section  of  the  guide  that
[87:10] I'm  making  like  this  but  I'm  really 
 being  honest  this  part  of  the  guide 
 really  deserves  your  full  attention  and
[87:16] it's  really  worth  just  like  being  super 
 focused  black  coffee  Focus  full  screen
[87:21] pay  attention  this  is  some  super  high 
 leverage  work  that  we're  about  to  do 
 together  now  so  we  have  an  understanding
[87:27] of  our  Dream  Avatar  the  kind  of  person 
 that  we  want  to  help  if  you  don't  know
[87:32] what  that  is  just  re-watch  like  the 
 previous  section  because  we've  just 
 covered  it  there  then  the  actionable 
 step  was  to  make  the  documents  make  sure
[87:38] you've  done  that  before  you  get  here  we 
 know  who  our  Dream  Avatar  is  now  there's 
 one  question  that  we  want  to  keep  in
[87:43] mind  what  is  their  dream  outcome  what  is 
 the  result  that  they  really  really  want
[87:48] so  for  example  for  me  for  my  business 
 the  dream  Avatar  is  like  my  younger  self 
 younger  Hamza  and  his  dream  outcome  his
[87:56] results  let  me  know  if  this  is  similar 
 to  like  you  personally 
 is
[88:01] to  make  progress  in  life  so  he  doesn't 
 feel  like  much  of  a  loser  anymore  so
[88:06] that  he  gets  to  the  point  where  he 
 actually  likes  himself  and  he  gets  some 
 like  pretty  good  materialistic  success
[88:11] along  the  way  he's  increases  his  ability 
 to  attract  girls  he  makes  some  money  he
[88:16] makes  some  good  friends  he's  got  some 
 status  and  some  respect  from  others  and 
 he  also  feels  mentally  happy  and  healthy
[88:22] with  himself  would  you  say  that  that 
 like  defines  you  chances  are  if  you've 
 got  this  far  of  this  guide  you're  very
[88:27] similar  to  younger  Hamza  my  ideal  dream 
 customer  we  know  that  dream  result  the
[88:32] thing  that  they  really  really  want 
 now  what  we  need  to  do 
 is  to  figure  out
[88:38] every  single  problem  on  the  way  to  that 
 dream  result  so  to  make  this  easy  let's
[88:44] say  I  was  going  to  make  a  Fitness 
 business  a  business  on  how  to  lose  some
[88:51] fat  and  increase  your  muscles  so  that 
 you  look  good  so  imagine  I  was  appealing 
 to  like  18  year  old  guys  who  wanted  to
[88:56] get  into  the  gym  and  build  like  a 
 physique  that  looks  good  so  that  they 
 could  probably  get  likes  on  Instagram  or 
 something  I  imagine  that  was  my  business
[89:01] right  their  dream  result  what  do  you 
 think  it  would  be  to  build  a  nice 
 physique
[89:07] grow  their  Instagram  following  hopefully 
 get  girls  to  message  them  something  like 
 that  right  what  are  the  problems  on  the
[89:14] way  there  well  Okay  so  we've  got  to 
 build  the  physique 
 building  the  physique  inside  of  that
[89:19] there's  probably  going  to  be 
 how  many  problems 
 hundreds
[89:27] they've  got  to  eat  clean  but  to  eat 
 clean  they've  got  to  go  out  and 
 shop  for  groceries  but  they  need  to  know
[89:33] what  things  to  buy  which  are  healthy 
 they  need  to  cook  the  food  they  need  to
[89:38] learn  how  to  cook  but  they  don't  enjoy 
 cooking  think  about  all  the  micro 
 problems  that  would  go  into  just
[89:43] building  the  physique  they've  got  a 
 train  in  the  gym  but  sometimes  they're 
 too  sore  and  they  don't  wake  up  in  time
[89:48] and  there's  not  enough  time  because  they 
 also  go  to  school  the  gym  is  too  far 
 away  sometimes  the  Gym's  packed  because
[89:53] they  have  to  go  at  peak  times  can  you 
 think  do  you  see  all  of  these  little 
 problems 
 you  know  what's  very  interesting  about
[89:58] these  problems 
 one  of  these  problems  will  be  the  reason
[90:04] why  your  dream  customer  doesn't  buy  your 
 product  so  we're  going  to  make  your
[90:09] products  soon  but  this  is  something  that 
 we  need  to  cover  first  one  of  these 
 problems  will  be  the  reason  why  you
[90:15] don't  get  a  sale 
 just  one  of  them  so  imagine  if  we  were 
 going  to  sell  this  Fitness  product  like
[90:20] a  fitness  course  or  a  workout  routine  or 
 something  and  imagine  we  didn't  address
[90:25] one  of  these  problems  in  like  our  sales 
 page  our  pitch  and  there's  our  Dream
[90:30] customer  he's  like  reading  the  sales 
 website  but  he  keeps  thinking  to  himself 
 no  about  the  Gym's  too  far  away  now  but
[90:35] I  can't  you  know  I  can't  go  to  the  gym 
 because  it's  too  far  away  it's  too  far 
 away  ah  whatever  and  he  leaves  it  and 
 imagine  that  all  we  needed  to  do  was
[90:41] address  that  one  problem  that  was  inside 
 of  his  mind  and  he  would  have  actually 
 bought  our  product
[90:49] powerful  right  so  what  we  need  to  do  is 
 like  a  mini  actionable  step  it's  to 
 create  an  absolutely  massive  problem
[90:58] list  you  start  with  the  dream  results 
 that  they  want  then  you  think  of  each 
 micro  problem  that  they  would  go  through
[91:04] on  the  way  to  getting  that  result  what 
 is  like  the  hard  part  the  issues  the
[91:09] obstacles  on  the  way  to  the  thing  that 
 they  want 
 and  not  just  a  few  things  you  know  like
[91:15] oh  yeah  like  they  have  to  go  to  the  gym 
 they  have  to  eat  clean  just  inside  of 
 eating  clean  there's  probably  like  20
[91:22] problems  right  because  they've  got  to 
 know  what  clean  eating  even  is  then 
 they've  got  to  go  out  and  buy  the
[91:27] groceries  but  they  can't  afford  the 
 fancy  groceries  and  then  you  know  they 
 can't  like  they're  spending  time  to  go
[91:32] and  buy  the  groceries  but  their  parents 
 buy  the  groceries  and  then  they  have  to 
 cook  but  they  don't  like  cooking  but
[91:37] their  parents  always  cook  for  them  they 
 can't  afford  that  like  you  can  see 
 there's  so  many  many  problems  inside  of
[91:43] just  the  one  main  problem  of  clean 
 eating 
 you  could  probably  get  a  list  of  about  a
[91:48] hundred  right  now  right  200. 
 now  your  brain  is  probably  starting  to 
 tick  and  you're  probably  getting  some
[91:53] but  it  almost  feels  a  little  bit  hard 
 now  doesn't  it  it  you're  beginning  to
[91:58] realize  like  now  we're  gonna  have  to  put 
 in  some  [ __ ]  work  are  you  ready 
 so  what  I'll  do  again  I'll  make  a
[92:05] document  a  notion  template  that  you  can 
 have  for  free  no  email  signups  no 
 nothing  like  that  you  don't  have  to  give 
 me  anything  but  I'll  make  that  a  layout
[92:10] for  you 
 and  I  want  you  to  go  in  and  make  an
[92:15] absolutely  massive  list  of  problems  that 
 your  dream  Avatar  would  experience  on
[92:21] the  way  to  his  dream  results 
 it  could  be  over  a  hundred  problems  we
[92:27] just  want  pure  quantity  volume  so  the 
 more  you  write  down  the  better  micro 
 problems
[92:32] he  wakes  up  too  late  the  Gym's  too  far 
 away  his  mum  needs  to  take  him  to  the 
 gym  but  sometimes  she  doesn't  want  to
[92:37] drive  that  far  sometimes  he  has  to  stay 
 in  school  too  late  so  he  can't  go  he 
 can't  eat  high  protein  because  his
[92:43] parents  think  that  it'll  be  bad  for  him 
 his  parents  won't  let  him  go  to  the  gym 
 because  they  think  that  it'll  stunt  his
[92:49] growth  imagine  that  level  of  autistic 
 detail  that  you  could  do  to  carry  a  list 
 of  100  200  300  problems  let  me  give  you
[92:55] some  ideas  that  I've  wrote  down  this  is 
 actually  an  example  from  the  Fitness 
 course  that  I  used  to  sell  over  a  year
[93:01] ago  this  is  the  level  of  detail  that  I 
 went  in  for  the  problems  this  is  just
[93:06] for  the  exercising  section  I  don't  have 
 a  gym  membership  the  gym  is  too  far  away 
 I'm  too  busy  with  work  I'm  not  motivated
[93:12] to  go  to  the  gym  when  I'm  in  the  gym  I 
 don't  know  what  to  do  it's  intimidating 
 being  in  the  gym  I  don't  know  how  to
[93:17] train  safely  I  feel  insecure  with  what  I 
 look  like  in  the  gym  working  out  hurts 
 too  much  I  get  too  sore  I  get  bored  in
[93:23] the  gym  and  I  just  want  to  go  home  I  get 
 tired  easily  I  find  it  hard  to  push 
 myself  I  lose  my  focus  I'm  not  making
[93:28] any  progress  in  the  gym  look  at  that 
 level  of  thinking 
 that  is  just  a  few  problems  for  one  area
[93:35] of  like  the  results  that  we're  trying  to 
 like  get  our  customers  to  so  it's  time 
 for  you  to  make  your  massive  list  of
[93:41] problems  and  I've  got  some  ideas  that 
 could  help  you  there's  three  areas  that 
 you  could  base  your  problem  list  around
[93:47] one  is  the  perceived  likelihood  of 
 achievements  their  belief  in  whether  or
[93:53] not  it  will  work  for  them  so  what  is 
 their  belief  about  the  the  results  that
[93:58] you're  trying  to  get  them  to  for  example 
 the  fitness  course  that  we're  going  to 
 sell  just  as  an  example  right  what
[94:04] belief  might  our  16  year  old  that  we're 
 trying  to  help  get  into  the  gym  and 
 build  a  good  body  have  you  might  believe
[94:10] that  he's  got  bad  genetics  he  might 
 believe  that  he's  not  even  going  to  be 
 able  to  make  any  progress  he  might
[94:15] believe  that  going  to  the  gym  is  going 
 to  be  bad  for  him  maybe  he  doesn't  trust 
 Fitness  YouTubers  that  I  don't  blame  him
[94:21] then  another  section  of  your  problems 
 list  can  also  be  about  time  like  how 
 long  it's  gonna  take  because  when  you
[94:26] think  about  how  much  like  people  want 
 fast  progress  these  days  they  all  want 
 instant  gratification  when  we  think
[94:32] about  trying  to  help  a  young  guy  get 
 into  the  gym  and  we  have  to  tell  him  the 
 truth  that  yeah  sure  you'll  make  some 
 progress  but  like  the  body  that  you  want
[94:38] from  those  pictures  that  you  see  on 
 Instagram  that's  going  to  take  a  few 
 years  of  dedication
[94:44] so  what  problems  is  he  going  to 
 experience  well  it's  gonna  take  too  long 
 I'm  not  seeing  any  results  yet  you  know
[94:49] I  step  on  the  scale  every  day  but  it's  I 
 don't  see  the  progress  It's  not  the 
 skills  not  going  down  I'm  not  gaining
[94:54] muscle  it's  going  to  take  too  long  to  to 
 get  up  to  the  bench  press  wait  or  to  get 
 the  pecks  and  then  another  theme  of  the
[94:59] problems  list  that  you're  writing  down 
 can  be  about  effort  and  sacrifice  the 
 hard  things  they  have  to  do  that  they
[95:05] don't  really  feel  like  doing  and  also 
 the  nice  things  that  they  like  which 
 they  might  have  to  stop  doing
[95:12] it's  going  to  be  too  hard  to  go  to  the 
 gym  it's  going  to  take  too  much  effort 
 it's  going  to  take  too  much  time  I  don't
[95:17] you  know  I  don't  have  the  schedule  for 
 it  it's  too  it  makes  me  too  sore  but 
 also  I'll  have  to  stop  eating  the  food
[95:24] that  I  like  I'll  have  to  like  replace 
 the  two  hours  that  I  usually  spend  on
[95:29] video  games  with  going  to  the  gym  every 
 day 
 so  you're  getting  some  ideas  now  just
[95:35] create  a  massive  list  of  problems  now 
 with  this  massive  list  of  problems
[95:40] whether  you've  made  it  already  or  it's 
 like  a  task  you're  gonna  do  like 
 tomorrow  morning  or  something  what  we're 
 going  to  do  now
[95:45] we're  going  to  create  a  massive  list  of 
 solutions  we're  going  to  look  at  each  of
[95:51] the  problems  that  we've  wrote  down  these 
 are  reasons  why  someone  wouldn't  buy 
 from  you  your  dream  customer  wouldn't
[95:56] buy  like  the  potential  product  that 
 you're  going  to  help  them  with  what 
 we're  going  to  do  is  write  down  like  a 
 pretty  much  equal  number  of  solutions  to
[96:03] each  problem  does  that  make  sense  so  we 
 know  who  we're  trying  to  sell  to  the 
 dream  Avatar  we  know  his  dream  results
[96:09] like  what  he  wants  out  of  life  we  know 
 the  problems  on  the  way  to  that  result 
 and  now  we're  going  to  think  okay  well
[96:14] how  do  we  give  him  a  solution  to  this 
 this  is  entrepreneurship
[96:19] write  this  down  entrepreneurship  is  just 
 Solutions  entrepreneurship  equals 
 Solutions
[96:24] so  we  want  to  solve  the  problems  that 
 our  Dream  customer  has  well  how  do  we  do
[96:29] that  we  look  at  every  single  point  in 
 that  problem  list  and  we  think  of  a  way
[96:35] that  we  can  just  like  ease  their  pain 
 and  get  them  to  overcome  it
[96:40] every  single  problem 
 this  is  going  to  set  you  apart  from  that
[96:45] lesser  version  of  yourself  this  is  going 
 to set  you  apart  from  the  competition  of 
 like  beginner  entrepreneurs  because
[96:50] everyone  else  this  is  how  pathetic  most 
 like  young  men  are  no  offense  to  them
[96:55] but  like  when  they  get  into  business 
 they  will  literally  try  to  solve  about 
 five  to  ten  percent  of  the  potential
[97:01] problems  their  customers  have  and  that's 
 it  and  then  complain  that  they  don't  get 
 sales  you're  gonna  aim  for  100
[97:08] every  problem  on  the  list  we  want  to 
 have  a  solution  for  so  this  is  exactly 
 how  you  create  the  solutions  list  you
[97:15] want  to  keep  the  flow  State  task  that 
 you  know  about  in  mind  so  remember  at 
 the  start  of  this  video  we  discussed
[97:21] flow  States  and  we  said  that  that  will 
 be  kind  of  like  your  gift  to  humanity  to 
 your  people  for  me  it's  speaking  you
[97:27] want  to  keep  that  in  mind  and  maybe  for 
 you  it's  learning  maybe  for  you  it's 
 writing  maybe  it's  speaking  whatever  it
[97:32] is  and  we  want  to  try  and  use  that  for 
 as  many  of  these  problems  as  possible  so 
 we  want  to  come  up  with  anything  that  we
[97:37] could  do  to  help  our  customers  with 
 these  problems  and  there's  a  few  formats 
 that  we  could  do  this  in  and  this  will
[97:43] help  help  you  because  right  now  it  feels 
 a  bit  vague  okay  what  do  you mean 
 Solutions  think  to  yourself  we  could 
 solve  these  problems  with  information
[97:49] with  education  with  maybe  some  kind  of 
 physical  product  with  maybe  a  service
[97:54] where  we  actually  do  something  for  them 
 with  maybe  some  kind  of  plan 
 accountability  the  best  way  to  solve  the
[98:00] problem  in  my  opinion  is  information 
 like  education  so  this  literally  means 
 to  make  this  like  super  clear  for  you
[98:06] that's  to  solve  the  problem  that  they've 
 got  about  like  oh  but  I  don't  enjoy 
 cooking  or  I  don't  know  like  what
[98:12] healthy  food  to  buy 
 to  solve  that  problem 
 we  could  record  a  video
[98:18] that  tells  them  the  best  healthy  foods 
 to  buy 
 and  a  problem  would  be  solved  we  could
[98:23] go  on  a  live  call  with  them  and  walk 
 them  through  which  healthy  foods  to  buy
[98:28] like  one  to  one  maybe  a  group  call  we 
 could  text  but  there's  different  formats 
 that  solve  the  same  problem  if  we  could
[98:33] make  a  video  and  like  the  video  is  just 
 there  so  we  can  always  send  it  to  every 
 new  customer  we  could  write  a  PDF  if  we
[98:39] prefer  writing  instead  of  of  speaking 
 and  recording  we  could  even  create  like
[98:44] templates  like  you  know  I've  mentioned 
 those  notion  templates  that  you  can 
 completely  have  for  free  and  everything 
 we  could  make  those  like  a  checklist  we
[98:50] could  make  documents  we  could  even  make 
 workout  routines  like  when  I  sold  a 
 course  on  Fitness  I  just  downloaded  like
[98:55] a  fitness  app  like  a  weightlifting  app 
 went  in  made  the  workout  routines  and 
 then  shared  it  inside  of  the  program
[99:01] which  meant  that  they  just  clicked  on  a 
 link  and  then  boom  the  workout  routine 
 just  opened  on  their  phone  once  they
[99:06] downloaded  the  app  imagine  like  that's 
 valuable  they  had  the  problem  of  like  oh 
 but  I  don't  know  which  workout  to  do  and
[99:11] instead  of  just  writing  it  down  and 
 telling  them  okay  do  this  exercise  for 
 this  many  reps  I  just  made  it  on  an  app
[99:16] and  they  just  got  got  it  on  their  phone 
 like  that  problem  solved  so  to  test  your 
 thinking  how  about  this  if  our  customers
[99:22] problem  was  but  I  don't  even  have  a  gym 
 membership  and  I  don't  know  how  to  sign
[99:27] up  to  a  gym  I've  never  done  it  before 
 and  it  kind  of  scares  me  how  could  we 
 solve  that  problem 
 think  about  it  what  are  the  ways  that  we
[99:33] could  solve  the  problem  of  like  some 
 anxious  kind  of  scared  guy  who  doesn't 
 really  leave  his  bedroom  too  much  and  he
[99:38] doesn't  even  know  how  to  sign  up  to  a 
 gym  and  he's  never  been  to  a  gym  before 
 how  could  we  solve  that  problem  think
[99:43] about  all  the  ways  we  could  record  a  gym 
 guide  we  could  even  write  down  like  a 
 gym  guide  or  PDF  we  could  hop  on  a  video
[99:49] call  with  him  and  get  him  to  share  his 
 screen  and  we'll  find  like  the  gym  that 
 he  should  go  to  he  shows  you  like  the
[99:54] website  there  maybe  he  tells  you  like 
 his  location  you  find  a  good  gym  for  him
[100:00] but  he  still  feels  anxious  what  are 
 other  things  we  could  do 
 you  could  literally  hop  on  a  video  call 
 on  our  phones  and  he  goes  to  the  gym  for
[100:07] the  first  time  and  where  they're  on  a 
 live  call  with  him  whilst  he  walks  into 
 the  gym  and  he  tries  the  machines  and
[100:12] you  tell  him  okay  just  show  me  right 
 yeah  go  on  that  machine  over  there  so 
 yeah  go  on  this  one  here  so  this  is 
 called  the  bench  press  so  what  you  want
[100:17] to  do  is  grab  that  Bob  okay  put  it  there 
 put  it  onto  the  second  a  little  bit 
 there  okay  so  grab  that  1.5  plate  boom
[100:24] problem  solved  to  a  very  powerful  level 
 now  the  more  time  and  effort  and
[100:29] intimate  Your  solution  the  more  you're 
 going  to  be  able  to  charge  for  it  so  for
[100:34] example  if  your  solution  is  just  going 
 to  be  one  to  many  like  I  record  a  video
[100:39] that's  just  kind  of  there  you  know  I 
 record  the  video  today  and  five  months 
 down  the  line  the  same  videos  being  sent
[100:44] out  which  tells  people  like  how  to  sign 
 up  to  the  gym  that's  kind  of  nice  that's 
 valuable  sweet  but  if  you're  willing  to
[100:49] put  in  the  extra  work  you  will  make  more 
 money  if  you  make  it  more  intensive  now 
 if  you've  got  the  time  and  effort  to  go
[100:55] above  and  beyond  and  work  harder  then 
 why  don't  you  why  don't  you  hop  on  the 
 call  with  them  the  live  call  to  pick  out
[101:01] the  gym  with  them  why  don't  you  offer 
 that  as  part  of  your  solution  list  my 
 advice  of  like  how  much  effort  and  how
[101:07] intensive  you  should  make  your  Solutions 
 is  that  if  you  are  a  younger  man  and
[101:12] you've  got  time  and  the  efforts  that 
 you're  willing  to  put  into  your  business 
 to  make  a  lot  of  money
[101:18] then  do  it 
 think  of  the  solutions  you  could  have 
 and  just  make  them  bigger  instead  of  it
[101:24] just  being  like  the  pre-recorded  video 
 where  you  show  them  like  whatever  you 
 know  how  to  overcome  the  problem  with
[101:29] education 
 go  on  the  live  call  with  them  because  if 
 you've  got  the  time  to  do  it  and  if
[101:34] right  now  you  know  making  money  is  like 
 your  priority  you  will  make  more  money 
 if  you  simply  just  work  harder  and  you
[101:40] put  more  of  your  time  into  your  business 
 you  make  more  active  income  if  you'd  be 
 willing  to  work  eight  hours  a  day  10
[101:46] hours  a  day  then  why  don't  you  for 
 example  just  go  on  the  the  10  minute 
 phone  call  with  your  potential  clients
[101:52] twice  a  day  to  help  them  imagine  how 
 much  more  like  expensive  you  could  make 
 your  product  when  you  said  two  calls  a
[101:59] day  10  minutes  each  time  now  you  won't 
 be  able  to  scale  this  up  Master  you  know 
 because  there'll  be  a  point  when  you're
[102:04] just  working  too  much  but  if  to  get  your 
 first  few  sales  so  that  you  make  some 
 money  from  your  business  I  think  that's
[102:10] a  really  good  idea  and  then  obviously  in 
 the  future  a  month  or  two  months  from 
 now  you  can  kind  of  scale  it  down 
 slightly  change  the  product  and  stuff
[102:16] and  think  you  know  too  much  of  my  time 
 is  going  so  I'm  not  going  to  do  those 
 calls  anymore  the  price  has  decreased  by 
 like  whatever  amounts  you  can  do  that
[102:22] Alex  amosi  has  this  saying  where  he  says 
 start  with  flow  so  start  by  having  like
[102:27] a  product  that  you're  just  over 
 delivering  your  solutions  to  their 
 problems  is  like  very  intensive  hey  you
[102:33] are  literally  doing  one-to-one  or  group 
 calls  or  everything  like  that  you  know 
 like  super  putting  your  time  into  it  and
[102:39] then  once  you're  making  like  a  good 
 amount  of  money  and  you  know  that  you're 
 getting  some  sales  and  you  feel  good 
 about  your  business  that's  where  you
[102:44] scale  it  down  and  you  add  friction  to 
 the  sale  that's  where  you  reduce  like
[102:49] how  much  of  your  own  time  and  effort  is 
 going  into  those  Solutions  and  then  if 
 you  really  want  more  times  you  can  focus
[102:55] on  like  scaling  up  or  something  then  you 
 can  take  away  parts  of  like  this  offer 
 and  reduce  the  price  in  the  future  this
[103:01] way  you'll  get  lots  of  early  customers 
 and  you  won't  be  like  that  guy  who 
 started  his  business  but  then  gets  like
[103:07] no  sales  so  you'll  avoid  that  you'll  get 
 those  early  customers  you'll  be  super
[103:12] intensive  with  those  early  customers  and 
 so  you'll  be  helping  them  get  really 
 good  results  they'll  give  you  good 
 testimonials  it'll  increase  your  own
[103:18] self-image  because  you  see  that  this 
 stuff  is  actually  working  for  them  so 
 it's  a  very  positive  feedback  loop  to
[103:23] just  think  to  work  as  hard  as  possible 
 to  over  deliver  like  crazy  to  really 
 think  to  yourself  you  know  what  I  don't
[103:29] want  passive  income  I  want  active  income 
 I'm  going  to  work  super  hard  for  this 
 I'll  call  them  twice  a  day  it's  not  like
[103:35] it's  going  to  take  me  five  minutes  when 
 I'm  in  the  gym  on  a  rest  break  or  if  I'm 
 in  the  cardio  machine  or  something  I 
 could  just  call  them  for  10  minutes  and
[103:41] check  them  up  and  it's  like  they  would 
 think  that  was  valuable  they  would 
 eventually  tell  the  people  about  how 
 much  I  helped  them  and  how  much  like
[103:47] progress  and  results  they  got  that's 
 awesome  I'm  gonna  make  more  money  the 
 more  I  work  and  the  more  effort  I  put  in
[103:52] right  now  what  you  want  to  do  is  go 
 through  the  problem  list  and  write 
 potential  Solutions  no  matter  even  if
[103:58] they're  crazy  just  next  to  them  and  I'd 
 even  ask  you  to  just  spike  your  thinking
[104:03] to  go  bigger 
 to  even  think  okay  if  your  customers
[104:08] paid  you  a  hundred  thousand  dollars  what 
 would  you  do  then  like  imagine  for  some 
 reason  a  billionaire  bought  your  fitness
[104:14] program  and  his  problem  was  that  he 
 didn't  know  how  to  like  go  to  the  gym  he
[104:20] didn't  know  what  to  do  and  he  paid  you  a 
 hundred  thousand  dollars  what  would  you 
 do  for  that  money  what  would  you  do 
 would  you  just  you  know  message  him  haha
[104:26] just  you  know  has  the  workout  routine 
 seven  times  eight  bicep  curls  but  if  he 
 paid  you  that  much  what  would  you  do  you
[104:31] might  even  fly  out  to  his  location 
 literally  drive  him  to  the  gym  and  walk 
 him  to  the  bench  press  and  load  up  the
[104:37] rack  for  him  right 
 so  why  don't  you  do  that  because  soon
[104:42] we'll  be  talking  about  the  pricing  for 
 our  product 
 the  more  intimate  the  more  intensive
[104:48] that  you  make  your  Solutions  the  higher 
 you  can  charge  so  what  I'd  ask  you  right 
 now  though  is  to  think  of  specifically
[104:55] the  sort  of  Life  quality  life  experience 
 work  task  that  you  would  want  do  you
[105:02] want  to  for  example 
 have  a  low  amount  of  work  hours  so  that 
 it  can  feel  a  bit  more  passive  you  can
[105:08] record  like  a  huge  selection  of  guides 
 and  videos  and  everything  and  then  just 
 sell  that  as  like  a  package  of  like  like
[105:13] a  course  or  do  you  want  to  maybe  make  a 
 bit  more  of  like  an  intensive  service 
 where  you  do  it  with  the  clients  and  you
[105:20] charge  them  way  more  you  see  there's 
 three  ways  that  you  can  help  someone  and 
 this  is  going  to  help  you  with  your
[105:25] solution  list  there's  DIY  do  it  yourself 
 this  is  like  the  lowest  level  this  is
[105:30] where  you  kind  of  give  them  the  the 
 knowledge  that  they  need  and  they  need 
 to  go  and  do  it  themselves  so  for
[105:35] example  DIY  do  it  yourself  is  what  I  do 
 with  these  YouTube  videos  I'm  making
[105:40] this  right  now  but  you  have  to  do  it 
 yourself  after  I've  made  this  video  it's 
 like  you're  just  left  to  yourself  right
[105:45] so  with  this  it's  very  scalable  it's 
 that  you  can  make  it  and  then  they  can 
 do  it  without  your  time  the  issue  is
[105:52] because  there's  less  involvement  from 
 you  naturally  you  can't  charge  as  much
[105:57] for  this  so  if  I  was  going  to  make  like 
 a  video  course  if  that  video  course 
 would  be  at  a  cheaper  price  and  it  would
[106:02] make  me  less  money  if  it  was  just  a 
 video  modules  where  the  customer  had  to 
 like  just  watch  them  and  Implement  them
[106:07] the  next  level  is  done  with  you  dwy  done
[106:12] with  you  this  is  where  you  make  like  the 
 the  sort  of  product  Again  the  video 
 course  or  whatever  but  there's  some  kind
[106:17] of  interactive  component  with  it  where 
 like  me  and  you  will  do  something 
 together  so  for  example  let's  say  the
[106:22] fitness  course  you've  got  the  videos  and 
 everything  but  there  might  be  weekly 
 check-ins  with  me  you  get  to  message  me
[106:28] and  tell  me  about  your  progress  I  see 
 that  okay  this  exercise  isn't  good  for 
 you  so  maybe  I  change  that  a  little  bit
[106:33] and  there's  a  bit  more  like  interaction 
 and  and  intimacy  there  in  our  business 
 relationship  because  of  that  it's  going
[106:39] to  take  more  work  more  time  from  us  so 
 we're  going  to  charge  more  for  it  and 
 you  can  see  how  the  sort  of  work  task
[106:45] changes  the  work  task  for  DIY  was  just 
 like  record  the  course  write  down  the
[106:50] PDFs  whatever  the  work  task  for  the 
 second  level  done  with  you  now  changes 
 to  being  like  you're  supporting  this
[106:56] person  maybe  online  with  some  check-ins 
 calls  and  everything  the  final  level
[107:01] which  goes  very  very  expensive 
 is  done  for  you  that's  where  you  take
[107:07] control  of  the  situation  and  you  don't 
 give  them  like  the  course  or  anything 
 like  that  you  try  and  do  as  much  as
[107:13] possible  for  them  so  they  don't  even 
 need  to  do  anything  yourself  so  you 
 can't  do  this  with  certain  things  so  for
[107:18] example  you  can't  do  like  done  for  you 
 as  like  a  personal  trainer  you  know  like 
 a  fitness  thing  because  you  can't  do  the
[107:24] exercise  for  them  you  can  do  some  parts 
 you  can  drive  them  to  the  gym  you  can 
 load  the  weights  and  that  kind  of  night 
 but  you  can't  actually  do  the  most  of  it
[107:30] you  can't  eat  the  food  for  them  you 
 can't  lift  the  weight  for  them  but  when 
 you  imagine  a  different  kind  of  business
[107:35] like  for  example  if  you  make  websites 
 let's  say  your  business  is  like  making
[107:40] websites  that  could  be  done  for  you 
 right  most  of  the  people  who  actually 
 make  websites  will  do  a  dfy  done  for  you
[107:46] where  for  example  I  could  pay  someone  to 
 make  my  website  and  they  don't  teach  me 
 anything  they  don't  need  me  to  do
[107:52] anything  they'll  just  make  me  the 
 website  and  so  they  can  charge  like  a 
 fair  amount  for  their  time  because  I
[107:57] don't  need  to  do  anything  and  they  do 
 all  the  work  so  it'd  be  interesting 
 right  now  for  you  to  just  kind  of  you
[108:02] know  visualize  and  sort  of  dream  about 
 your  ideal  life  and  your  ideal  work  task
[108:07] what  would  it  be  because  it  depends  what 
 experience  of  life  you  want  any  of  these
[108:12] can  scale  up  and  make  a  lot  of  money  for 
 example  with  my  business  model  I  have 
 Adonis  school  which  is  the  only  product
[108:17] that  I  sell  that's  done  with  you  that's 
 where  we  have  like  a  bunch  of  courses 
 for  the  students  who  join  the  online
[108:23] community  but  they're  done  with  you 
 aspect  is  that  there's  myself  and  many 
 of  the  teachers  that  will  like  literally
[108:29] be  there  on  live  calls  and  support  and 
 um  the  community  posts  and  everything  so
[108:34] there's  like  that  interactive  element 
 where  you  get  extra  support  compared  to 
 just  a  course  it's  not  done  for  you
[108:40] because  for  the  students  of  Adonis 
 school  I  can't  get  them  results  in  real 
 life  I  can't  meditate  for  them  I  can't
[108:45] like  you  know  get  them  in  I  can't  force 
 them  to  be  in  the  gym  with  this  kind  of 
 business  model  but  you  could  do  so  which
[108:53] one  would  you  rather  do  for  example 
 would  you  rather  make  content  DIY  would 
 you  rather  make  content  and  also  go  onto
[109:00] calls  with  people  or  would  you  rather  go 
 as  absolutely  intensive  as  possible  and
[109:06] literally  try  to  like  force  the  person 
 to  get  results  or  even  literally  just 
 get  the  results  for  them  yourself
[109:13] which  one  you  can  charge  more  but 
 obviously  you'll  you'll  take  on  less 
 clients  like  less  number  less  scale  for
[109:20] these  higher  end  packages  which  might  be 
 a  good  thing  because  you  sell  to  better 
 people  let  me  give  you  an  example  for
[109:25] like  the  fitness  and  and  health  business 
 level  one  DIY  is  you  make  a  fitness
[109:31] course  it's  just  literally  like  10 
 videos  where  you  explain  how  to  like 
 increase  your  bench  press  or  something
[109:36] okay  it's  kind  of  nice  you  might  sell  it 
 for  like  ten  dollars  twenty  dollars  or 
 something 
 level  two  done  with  you  you  go  on  to
[109:44] video  calls  weekly  check-ins  you  message 
 the  clients  and  he  tells  you  about  the
[109:49] weight  he's  used  and  then  you  tell  them 
 okay  do  this  next  week  try  this  wait 
 next  week  that's  pretty  nice  you  can 
 charge  a  lot  more  maybe  hundreds  of
[109:55] dollars  a  month  for  that 
 done  for  you  you  can't  lift  the  weight
[110:00] for  them  but  you  could  probably  move  to 
 the  house  cook  them  the  meals  make  sure
[110:05] they're  in  bed  on  time 
 and  literally  go  to  the  gym  with  them 
 drive  them  to  the  gym  load  up  the  bench
[110:11] press  literally  observe  their  form  you 
 you  spot  them  yourself  you  could  charge 
 thousands  of  dollars  for  that
[110:19] now  imagine  which  kind  of  person  would 
 buy  the  high  ticket  program 
 richer  wealthier  higher  status  higher
[110:26] level  you'd  be  able  to  network  with 
 those  people 
 so  it's  not  a  bad  idea  to  pursue  one  of
[110:32] those  I  don't  have  that  business  model 
 all  I've  got  is  just  done  with  you  and 
 I'm  quite  happy  with  that  but  it  is
[110:37] something  to  to  consider  honestly  like  I 
 I  almost  fantasize  about  it  sometimes 
 when  I  think  back  about  business
[110:43] a  few  years  ago  you  create  a  product 
 like  that  where  like  you'll  go  move  in 
 with  someone  to  help  them  perfect  their
[110:48] sleep  for  two  weeks 
 you  could  charge  twenty  five  thousand
[110:53] dollars  for  that 
 and  that's  your  life  is  like  flying  out 
 to  this  random  country  we're  like  this
[110:58] you  know  entrepreneur  lives  like  let's 
 say  Cape  Town  Dubai  or  something  and  you 
 just  go  stay  in  their  apartment  for  two
[111:03] weeks  you  track  their  like  Health  stats 
 and  here  you  are  like  there's 
 professional  working  amongst
[111:08] professionals  and  like  you're  networking 
 with  them 
 it's  very  powerful  and  the  more  help  you
[111:14] give  them  the  more  results  they're  going 
 to  get  the  more  results  they  get  the 
 more  testimonials  and  everything  so  it's
[111:20] very  powerful  just  to  think  which  level 
 you  would  want  to  work  at  also  when 
 you're  thinking  about  the  solutions  that
[111:26] you  could  have  to  these  problems  think 
 about  how  many  people  you  want  to  help 
 at  once  would  you  like  it  to  be  a
[111:33] one-to-one  interaction  so  you've  got  a 
 live  call  texting  with  this  one  person 
 maybe  even  like  in  person  helping  your
[111:39] customer  with  the  problem  would  you  want 
 it  to  be  in  a  group  setting  where  maybe 
 there's  multiple  people  you're  helping
[111:44] at  once  in  the  live  call  texting 
 community  community  or  anything  would 
 you  want  it  to  be  lots  of  people  so  for
[111:50] example  Adonis  school  is  with  lots  of 
 people  there's  a  high  amount  of  scale 
 now  the  more  people  there  are  the  less
[111:55] you  can  charge  because  your  attention  is 
 kind  of  spread  out  the  less  people  there 
 are  if  you're  doing  a  one-to-one  it's
[112:01] far  more  expensive  and  in  some  ways  it's 
 usually  better  for  happiness  like  when
[112:06] you  really  think  about  the  human 
 happiness  it  would  be  better  for  your 
 happiness  and  fulfillment  for  you  to  put
[112:11] so  much  more  more  effort  into  just  one 
 person  and  see  them  grow  than  it  would 
 for  you  to  disperse  your  attention  over
[112:18] like  many  others  so  it  just  depends  what 
 kind  of  person  you  are  what  interest  you
[112:23] are  do  you  want  to  help  multiple  people 
 at  once  do  you  want  it  to  be  a 
 one-to-one  just  think  of  the  problems
[112:28] list  that  you  have  and  just  think  to 
 yourself  would  you  want  to  help  as  many 
 people  as  possible  like  you  know  you
[112:33] make  a  video  and  50  500  a  thousand 
 people  can  watch  the  video  to  solve  the 
 problem  that  you've  got  on  your  list  or
[112:38] would  you  rather  it  be  like  okay  one  to 
 one  you're  gonna  really  really  deeply 
 help  this  one  person  overcome  this
[112:44] problem  so  this  is  another  actionable 
 step  create  an  absolutely  massive
[112:50] Solutions  list  to  every  single  problem 
 that  you've  thought  of  that  your  dream
[112:55] customer  is  going  to  have  getting  to 
 their  results  now  think  about  how  you 
 would  solve  every  one  of  those  problems
[113:00] in  a  way  that  you  would  kind  of  enjoy 
 that  actually  would  get  them  to  the 
 dream  results  maybe  it's  with  education
[113:05] you  record  the  videos  maybe  you  hop  on 
 the  live  calls  maybe  you  text  them  maybe 
 you  make  the  the  templates  the  workout
[113:10] routines  think  of  solutions  that  every 
 single  one  of  their  problems  this  is 
 some  high  leverage  work  it  will  fry  your
[113:16] brain  it  is  going  to  be  a  little  bit 
 like  you  know  time  consuming  and 
 difficult  but  this  is  really  going  to
[113:21] help  you  make  a  lot  more  money  in  the 
 future  so  this  is  worth  your  attention 
 go  and  do  that  actionable  step  one  final
[113:26] thing  that  you  can  add  to  your  Solutions 
 list  is  a  question  that  you  should  just 
 answer  to  yourself
[113:32] if  my  customers 
 barely  paid  me  anything  at  all  let's  say
[113:37] one  tenth  like  10  of  what  I  was  probably 
 gonna  charge  for  the  product  that  you 
 know  we're  gonna  create  this  into  or  if
[113:43] they  paid  me  like  five  dollars  nothing 
 right 
 and  I  still  had  to  make  these  Solutions
[113:48] valuable  how  would  I  do  it  what  would  I 
 add  into  it
[113:54] because  there's  a  lot  of  things  you 
 could  add  to  a  package  like  these 
 Solutions  which  would  be  kind  of  free
[114:00] for  you  to  give  to  someone  just  you  had 
 to  make  them  first  once  so  courses
[114:06] ebooks  templates  workout  routines
[114:11] um recorded  lectures  and  recorded  q  and 
 A's  maybe  something  that  doesn't  require 
 much  maintenance  like  a  community
[114:17] Discord  server  School  your  Facebook 
 group  go  and  create  your  full  massive 
 list  of  solutions  by  this  point  we  want
[114:23] you  to  have  a  massive  list  of  solutions 
 to  all  of  their  problems  so  this  could 
 be  a  hundred  random  Solutions  you've  got
[114:30] there's  this  video  you're  going  to  make 
 this  course  this  PDF  file  this  workout 
 routine  you'll  do  this  call  you'll  do
[114:36] this  you'll  send  these  messages  a 
 massive  list  of  solutions  to  all  their 
 problems  now  what  we're  going  to  do  is
[114:41] look  at  the  solutions  and  actually  be  a 
 little  bit  more  realistic  and  think  to 
 ourselves  do  I  really  want  to  do  that
[114:46] would  our  customer  actually  find  this 
 particular  solution  valuable  we  want  to
[114:52] go  through  and  trim  and  stack  this  list 
 of  solutions  so  that  all  that's  left  is
[114:57] the  things  that  would  actually  do  and 
 also  that  we  assume  our  Dream  customer 
 would  value  so  do  that  right  now  we  want
[115:03] this  clean  list  of  solutions  and  one  of 
 the  tip  that  I  can  give  you  is  that  we 
 want  it  to  be  as  many  how  high  value  one
[115:12] to  many  things  in  them  so  high  value 
 means  that  our  customer  would  actually
[115:17] like  this  solution  they'll  think  that 
 this  is  awesome  that  you've  like  made 
 this  thing  or  that  you're  offering  this
[115:22] thing  and  one  to  many  means  that  you  can 
 give  it  to  many  people  at  once  meaning
[115:27] that  you  could  make  it  once  and  maybe 
 just  keep  giving  it  to  more  people 
 essentially  what  this  means  is  like  you
[115:32] want  to  always  have  as  part  of  your 
 offer  as  part  of  your  product  a  bunch  of
[115:37] things  that  can  always  be  replicated 
 like  for  example  videos  you  could  record 
 a  video  and  have  like  the  little  video
[115:43] file  there  and  you  can  keep  giving  that 
 to  people  as  like  a  training  video
[115:49] for  years  and  you  don't  have  to  do  more 
 work 
 so  if  for  example  the  main  solution  that
[115:55] you've  got  is  okay  you'll  do  video  calls 
 and  you'll  walk  them  through  this 
 process  that  you  know  they  care  about 
 like  fat  loss  if  you  recorded  like  a  20
[116:02] minute  training  video  of  you  shopping 
 like  how  to  sign  up  to  the  gym  of  you 
 talking  about  the  ingredients  which  are
[116:07] really  good  for  you  or  really  bad  for 
 you  you  can  just  add  that  to  like  the 
 value  that  you're  giving  and  just
[116:13] constantly  keep  giving  it  keep  in  pretty 
 much  all  of  the  things  that  will  take 
 you  quite  a  while  to  make  right  now  but
[116:19] once  it's  done  you  can  just  keep  giving 
 it  more  and  more  and  more  PDFs  workout 
 routines  videos  courses  one  extra  tip  to
[116:26] manipulate  people  I  don't  know  why  this 
 is  but  people  absolutely  love  things
[116:31] like  templates  and  checklists  so  you've 
 seen  me  on  this  video  I've  mentioned  a 
 few  times  that  I'll  make  like  the  notion
[116:37] template  for  you  when  you  heard  that 
 whether  you  were  conscious  of  it  or  not 
 you  just  liked  me  more
[116:44] you  liked  me  like  five  percent  more  just 
 because  I  mentioned  that  I'll  go  and 
 make  like  a  five  minute  template  for  you
[116:50] that's  just  added  like  how  valuable  this 
 video  is  because  I've  said  that  I'll  go 
 and  make  like  this  template  or  habit
[116:55] tracker  or  a  checklist  or  whatever  it  is 
 for  you  people  love  these  kinds  of
[117:00] things  so  notion  is  like  a  software  you 
 can  use  for  free  and  you  can  make  all 
 the  habitators  templates  everything  so
[117:06] if  you  add  that  to  your  Solutions  list 
 like  if  one  of  their  problems  is  I  can't 
 get  into  the  gym  consistently  like  I'm
[117:11] not  consistent  in  the  gym  you  could  say 
 the  solution  to  that  is  like  a  habit 
 tracker  that  keeps  you  accountable  and
[117:17] you'll  give  them  a  notion  template  habit 
 tracker  for  that  when  we  eventually  make 
 our  sales  page  when  we  mention  what  the
[117:22] customer's  gonna  get  and  they  see  like 
 notion  habit  tracker  to  Skyrocket  you're 
 consistent  that  sees  it  to  go  to  the  gym
[117:28] they  literally  like  people  just  love 
 that  stuff  they'll  be  way  more  likely  to 
 buy  it  takes  you  like  five  minutes  to
[117:34] set  it  up  once  and  you  give  it  to 
 everyone  who  buys  it  now  you  still 
 probably  want  to  do  some  of  the
[117:39] Intensive  things  that  require  your  time 
 so  the  video  calls  maybe  even  meeting 
 people  in  person  maybe  the  texting  the
[117:45] accountability  because  that's  like  the 
 core  offer  that's  like  the  biggest  most 
 important  most  valuable  part  of  the
[117:52] product  that  we're  going  to  sell  this 
 big  package  I  know  that  everything  I've 
 made  you  go  through  over  the  last  like 
 10  minutes  20  minutes  of  this  video  is
[117:58] quite  a  lot  and  I  don't  expect  you 
 watching  this  right  now  so  we've  done 
 all  that  you're  probably  thinking  okay 
 I'll  watch  a  bit  more  of  the  guide  then
[118:03] I'll  do  that  soon  that's  absolutely  fine 
 when  I  was  going  through  this  process 
 myself  about  two  years  ago  I  remember
[118:09] that  doing  this  task  like  making  the 
 massive  problems  list  the  massive 
 Solutions  list  try  me  trimming  it  and
[118:15] everything  I  remember  that  taking  me 
 like  a  solid  week  of  waking  up  early  at 
 5am  black  coffee  and  grinding  it  out  and
[118:22] honestly  it  was  absolutely  worth  it  so 
 when  you  do  have  the  the  sort  of  mental
[118:27] bandwidth  for  this  maybe  starting  like 
 today  or  tomorrow  start  waking  up  early 
 black  coffee  and  just  like  get  to  work
[118:34] when  it's  still  dark  outside  making  this 
 massive  problems  and  solutions  list 
 whilst  you're  fasted  you  haven't  ate  any
[118:40] food  because  this  is  like  the  Deep  work 
 like  the  grind  that  you've  always  wanted 
 I  know  it  can  seem  a  bit  kind  of  scary
[118:45] and  mentally  fatiguing  to  think  of  this 
 big  task  I've  got  to  think  of  hundreds 
 of  problems  hundreds  of  Solutions  but
[118:52] the  question  I  always  keep  asking  is  as 
 a  young  guy  are  you  willing  to  work 
 super  hard  to  make  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  money
[118:58] well  yes 
 so  why  don't  you  try  to  start  waking  up 
 at  5am  tomorrow  like  I  do  I  wake  up  at
[119:03] five  every  or  half  four  actually  every 
 morning 
 and  just  grind  this  through  grind  these
[119:09] tasks  through  this  is  a  lot  of  work  I'm 
 not  going  to  [ __ ]  you  this  is  in 
 some  like  side  hustle  thing  that  you  can
[119:14] like  those  [ __ ]  YouTubers  they  make 
 videos  like  this  top  seven  ways  to  to 
 side  hustles  to  get  money  online  like
[119:20] this  it's  gonna  require  active  income 
 you  want  to  make  more  money  well  then 
 you've  got  to  work  harder  for  it  of
[119:25] course  you  do  you  want  to  make  more 
 money  you've  got  to  put  in  more  of  your 
 own  like  active  time  into  it  of  course
[119:30] you  do 
 you've  been  fine  with  this  idea  well  now 
 it's  time  to  put  in  the  work  for  it  so
[119:35] now  we  have  this  sort  of  cultivated  list 
 of  solutions  this  massive  list  like
[119:40] numbered  lists  and  it  says  you  know 
 we'll  make  this  course  we'll  do  this 
 call  we'll  text  them  like  this  we'll
[119:45] give  them  these  reminders  we'll  give 
 them  these  templates  these  are  the 
 things  that  we're  actually  willing  to  do 
 and  it's  like  a  massive  sort  of
[119:51] unorganized  list  of  solutions  to  all  of 
 their  problems 
 all  we  need  to  do  now  it's  very  clever
[119:57] marketing  trick  that  you  can  do  just  to 
 make  you  seem  like  more  of  an  authority
[120:02] figure  what  we  want  to  do  is  bundle  the 
 solutions  that  we  have  into  separate
[120:07] parts  so  you  could  call  this  for  example 
 your  seven  steps  to  Fat  Loss  the  four
[120:13] phases  of  fat  loss  or  something  like 
 that  so  you  would  bundle  it  in  a  certain 
 number  of  steps  you  know  if  you  look  at
[120:18] your  solution  list  right  now  or  you  can 
 just  imagine  the  kind  of  solutions  you 
 will  have  if  you're  going  to  do  this 
 soon  just  think  about  what  could  go  into
[120:25] the  same  like  topic  so  for  example  if 
 we're  selling  a  fitness  program  then  all
[120:30] of  the  things  about  exercise  would  go 
 into  the  same  part  right  and  then  all 
 the  ones  about  cooking  would  be  there
[120:35] then  all  the  ones  about  healthy  eating 
 all  the  ones  about  recovery  so  then  what 
 we  do  is  like  we're  just  kind  of  use
[120:42] sort  of  cool  sounding  words  and  names  to 
 instead  of  us  saying  yeah  we'll  give  you
[120:48] all  of  this  random  stuff  what  we  say  is 
 I'm  gonna  take  you  through  my  four-step 
 framework  of  fat  loss  think  about  what
[120:54] level  of  like  professionalism  the 
 difference  is  there  one  guy  just  says
[120:59] yeah  it  has  a  massive  list  I'm  going  to 
 give  you  right  he  has  a  bullet  point 
 list  of  72  things  which  is  all  random
[121:04] and  everything  the  other  guy  says  I've 
 got  a  seven  step  framework  to  muscle 
 building  and  I'm  gonna  walk  you  through
[121:09] it  the  first  step  is 
 um  I  don't  know  your  measurements  the
[121:14] second  step  is  the  fat  loss  the  third 
 step  is  is  the  workout  routines  and
[121:19] inside  each  step  or  inside  each  phrase 
 or  block  or  whatever  you  want  to  call  it 
 is  like  the  solutions  that  are  relevant
[121:25] to  that  step  this  just  makes  you  seem 
 like  more  of  a  professional  and  it'll 
 just  increase  the  amount  of  sales  that
[121:30] you  eventually  get  once  we  make  the 
 sales  page  so  for  example  inside  of  the 
 package  that  you're  selling  you  could
[121:36] have  four  different  steps  and  one  of 
 them  could  be  healthy  eating  for  noobs
[121:42] that's  the  second  step  framework  for 
 your  bodybuilding  program  healthy  eating 
 for  noobs  inside  of  that  would  be  the
[121:48] list  of  solutions  that  are  relevant  to 
 that  sort  of  topic  or  block  or  you  know 
 healthy  eating  for  noobs  so  it'd  be  it'd
[121:53] be  the  video  of  you  describing  the  foods 
 they  should  eat  it  should  be  maybe  like 
 the  Amazon  wish  list  of  the  ingredients
[121:59] that  you  know  the  foods  they  should  buy 
 it  should  be  videos  of  you  literally 
 cooking  the  food  that  they  should  be
[122:04] cooking  so  that  they  can  watch  you  cook 
 it  should  be  like  the  offer  of  like  yeah 
 I'll  go  on  one  call  with  you  on  WhatsApp
[122:09] a  live  call  whilst  you're  in  your 
 kitchen  and  I'll  give  you  some  feedback 
 of  like  whilst  you  cook  live  so  I'll
[122:14] tell  you  okay  yeah  yeah  turn  over  the 
 meat  now  so  yeah  yeah  okay  looks  good 
 okay  no  no  put  it  on  like  220  degrees  or
[122:19] something  and  that's  like  one  block  of 
 your  package  now  imagine  10  of  those
[122:24] healthy  easing  for  noobs 
 starting  the  gym  guide 
 maxing  out  the  PRS  whatever  you've  got
[122:31] like  five  ten  different  parts  to  your 
 package  and  they're  all  worded  or  named
[122:37] in  a  way  that  makes  you  seem  like  you 
 know  what  you're  doing  and  that  you've 
 created  this  sort  of  special  unique
[122:43] system  so  now  think  about  where  we  are 
 we've  autistically  thought  about  every 
 problem  that  the  customer  has  then  we
[122:48] thought  about  solutions  to  every  problem 
 then  we  trimmed  that  list  of  solutions 
 so  that  it's  actually  relevant  and
[122:55] reasonable  okay  these  are  the  things  we 
 could  do  these  are  the  things  they'd 
 actually  value  and  then  we've  just  sort 
 of  packaged  those  Solutions  and  bundled
[123:01] them  up  so  now  what  we  have  is  like  a 
 cool  sounding  list  of  you  know  seven 
 phases  to  Fat  Loss  three  ways  of
[123:07] whatever  you  want  to  like  sort  of  name 
 it  this  is  actually  what  we're  selling 
 think  about  how  different  this  is  we're
[123:13] selling  this  huge  package  inside  of  it 
 is  the  same  things  it's  the  call  it's
[123:18] the  courses  it's  the  workout  routines 
 it's  it's  the  accountability  the  the 
 templates  and  everything  but  instead  of
[123:23] us  just  selling  a  product  like  for 
 example  just  like  a  one-to-one  video
[123:28] call  you  can  see  that  we're  not  really 
 selling  a  product  anymore  it's  more  like 
 we're  selling  the  solution  we're  selling
[123:35] their  dream  results  we're  not  going  to 
 be  telling  them  like  oh  hey  you  know 
 like  this  is  the  thing  that  I  sell  it's
[123:40] one-to-one  video  calling  this  and  this 
 and  this  and  this  we're  rather  gonna  say 
 like  okay  you  have  this  problem  where 
 you're  struggling  to  lose  weight  just  as
[123:46] an  example  in  the  fitness  niche  I  have 
 the  solution  which  is  my  seven  step 
 framework  and  I'm  going  to  take  you
[123:52] through  that  how  much  is  the  problem 
 worth  for  you  to  solve  well  you've  been 
 stressing  out  about  weight  loss  for  the
[123:57] past  five  years  and  most  people 
 literally  struggle  with  weight  loss  for 
 most  of  their  lives  so  it's  worth  a  few 
 grand  right
[124:02] so  I'm  gonna  fix  that  problem  for  you 
 doing  it  in  my  seven  step  framework  too
[124:07] noobs  guide  to  whatever  you  want  to  call 
 it  and  you  can  see  how  much  more  you 
 seem  like  a  professional  this  is  your
[124:13] core  package  done  this  is  the  thing  that 
 we  are  actually  gonna  sell  you're  no 
 longer  selling  this  one  random  thing
[124:19] you're  selling  the  whole  package  the 
 solution  to  their  problem  that  means 
 that  you  can  charge  whatever  you  want
[124:26] which  is  very  powerful  we'll  get  to  the 
 pricing  very  soon  but  there's  a  quick 
 way  that  we  can  just  increase  the  value
[124:32] of  this  package  that  you've  made  even 
 more  step  five  enhancing  your  product  I
[124:37] played  a  video  game  called  RuneScape  and 
 I  was  addicted  to  it  for  most  of  my  life
[124:42] from  childhood  to 
 teenage  or  even  adult  years  I  had  about 
 10  000  hours  on  that  game  bro  [ __ ]  me  so
[124:49] it's  like  an  MMORPG  game  you  probably 
 know  what  that  is  it's  kind  of  like 
 you've  got  your  own  character  like  your
[124:54] own  accounts  that  you  log  into  every  day 
 and  you  level  it  up  but  also  there's 
 everyone  else  and  they  level  up  their
[124:59] characters  too  and  there's  like  Monsters 
 to  kill  and  quests  to  do  and  everything 
 and  on  this  game  there's  kind  of  like  a
[125:05] Marketplace  like  there's  items  that  gets 
 dropped  from  Monsters  or  you  know  from
[125:10] the  ground  whatever  and  you  get  them 
 they're  worth  a  certain  amount  of  like 
 gold  like  cash  and  you  can  start  to
[125:15] trade  it  with  people  you  can  go  it's 
 like  What's  called  the  Grand  exchange 
 which  is  like  a  big  shop  where  we  can
[125:20] all  buy  and  sell  each  other's  products 
 and  I  want  you  to  really  think  about 
 this  game  right  I  want  you  to  think 
 imagine  there's  like  a  sword
[125:26] what  would  happen  if  the  developers  of 
 this  game  release  the  new  patch  notes
[125:31] saying  this  sword 
 is  now 
 significantly  stronger  the  attack  level
[125:38] like  the  strength  or  you  know  like  the 
 power  of  this  sword  has  just  been  three 
 times  imagine  they  just  released  that
[125:43] like  the  developers  right  what  would 
 happen  inside  the  game  for  the  price  of 
 the  sword
[125:49] if  you  go  up 
 why  would  it  go  up  really  think  about  it 
 why  would  it  what  action  would  cause  it
[125:55] to  go  up 
 more  people  would  be  buying  it  because
[126:02] it's  better  it  would  cause  a  demand  and 
 when  the  demand  goes  up  the  price  goes
[126:09] up  because  if  this  sword  was  for  a 
 hundred  gold  points  like  that's  the  cash 
 in  this  game  100  gold  points  but  we've
[126:16] just  doubled  how  powerful  the  sword  is 
 well  then  more  people  are  instantly
[126:21] gonna  log  in  and  think  oh  man  I'm  gonna 
 go  buy  that  sort  of  800  gold  coins  or 
 whatever  the  guy  who's  got  it  and  now  he
[126:27] has  like  three  people  message  him  or 
 I'll  say  to  him  like  oh  I'll  buy  it  for 
 a  hundred  I'll  buy  it  for  110  I'll  buy 
 it  for  150  I'll  buy  it  for  200.  just
[126:35] doubled  in  price  the  bids  keep  going 
 higher  and  higher 
 when  we  make  something  better
[126:42] the  demand  goes  up  and  therefore  the 
 price  goes  up
[126:48] why  not  do  that  with  your  package 
 why  not  think  to  yourself  how  could  you
[126:53] be  the  that  developer 
 who  just  tweaks  a  few  things  and  then 
 makes  that  that  sword  better
[127:02] how  could  you  make  your  package  better 
 so  that  it  cause  more  of  a  demand  more 
 people  want  to  buy  it  and  then  you  can
[127:07] just  raise  the  prices  this  is  demand  but 
 what  about  Supply  you've  heard  the  term 
 before  supply  and  demand  Supply  is  the
[127:14] quantity  of  the  thing  simply  put  the  the 
 more  quantity  like  the  more  of  a  thing
[127:21] the  less  valuable  it  is  that  makes  sense 
 right  so  this  sword  here  is  worth  100
[127:26] gold  points  and  there's  a  thousand  in 
 the  game 
 if  the  developers  say  oh  yeah  the
[127:32] monster  that  drops  this  sword  it's  only 
 gonna  drop  the  sword  half  as  much
[127:38] what's  gonna  happen 
 the  supply  of  the  sword  coming  you  know
[127:43] generated  into  the  game  with  RNG 
 generated  into  the  game  it's  going  to  be 
 cut  in  half  which  means  that  the  supply
[127:48] of  the  sword  is  going  to  be  lowered 
 which  means  that  the  sword  is  going  to 
 be  rarer  which  means  that  again  the
[127:54] price  goes  up 
 Supply  the  quantity
[128:01] so  how  could  you  lower  the  supply  of 
 your  package
[128:09] what  could  you  do  to  like  lower  the 
 amount  that  is  available
[128:16] you  can  use 
 scarcity 
 and  urgency
[128:22] scarcity  is  when  you  limit  the  quantity 
 of  the  product  or  service  that  you  have
[128:29] and  you  say  okay  there's  only  a  certain 
 amount  that  is  available
[128:36] now  you  see  this  when  you  when  you  go 
 into  like  some  sales  Pages  you  see  this 
 often  where  the  person  will  say  like  oh
[128:41] yeah  like  you  know  there's  only  like 
 seven  left  or  I've  only  have  set  five 
 more  spots  or  whatever  it  is  let's  be
[128:46] honest  it  kind  of  looks  a  little  bit 
 like  sleazy  but 
 it's  the  name  of  the  game  it's  just  like
[128:52] it  you  will  undeniably  get  more  sales  if 
 you  just  have  some  kind  of  scarcity  and
[128:57] urgency  so  if  you've  got  like  some  kind 
 of  limiting  belief  right  now  I  think  I 
 always  hate  that  when  I  see  it  on  like  a 
 website  when  they  say  like  oh  only  seven
[129:03] more  left  only  this  you  know  the  sale 
 ends  on  Friday  why  do  you  think  every
[129:08] single  store  in  the  entire  world  uses 
 like  the  concept  of  a  sale  oh  yeah  you
[129:13] know  this  the  sale  we've  got  lower 
 prices  but  it  ends  next  like  you  know 
 next  week
[129:18] it's  because  it  works  so  if  you're  gonna 
 play  the  game  of  Entrepreneurship  that
[129:23] you  may  as  well  win  the  [ __ ]  game 
 play  it  properly  don't  be  scared  of  like 
 playing  the  game  and  thinking  oh  man  but
[129:28] you  know  it  doesn't  sound  so  cool  like 
 it  doesn't  make  me  feel  good  like  just 
 [ __ ]  play  the  game  right  use  the 
 tactics  that  are  available  because  they
[129:34] work  so  scarcity  is  when  you  lower  the 
 quantity  that  is  available  and  what  I
[129:39] would  say  that  would  work  for  pretty 
 much  everyone  who's  watching  this  just
[129:44] use  honestly  about  your  capacity  what 
 this  means  is  like  be  honest  about  how
[129:51] many  people  you  could  actually  help  like 
 that  you've  got  the  brain  power  for 
 chances  are  your  package  is  going  to  be
[129:58] a  big  mix  of  things  but  it's  gonna  have 
 some  kind  of  interactive  component  so 
 you  might  make  for  example  whatever  your
[130:04] like  niches  the  problem  the  result  is 
 you  know  the  fat  loss  let's  say  you'll 
 do  a  bunch  of  things  like  oh  yeah  notion
[130:10] templates  and  courses  and  whatever  you 
 want  to  add  in  but  chances  are  you'll 
 probably  add  in  a  little  bit  of  like 
 your  own  time  to  it  maybe  a  one-to-one
[130:16] call  maybe  a  group  call  maybe  some 
 accountability  ability  and  everything 
 but  you  can  only  do  so  much  of  that
[130:22] so  technically  it's  like  it's  absolutely 
 true  that  you  could  only  actually  handle
[130:28] certain  number  of  sales  right  a  certain 
 number  you  could  probably  only  sell  like 
 a  few  people  a  week  until  you  had  too
[130:35] many  people  in  your  message  you  know  you 
 had  to  wake  up  and  message  like  10  of 
 your  clients  or  something  or  you  had  to
[130:40] like  serve  a  bunch  of  people  and  it 
 started  to  get  like  quite  painful  and 
 quite  um  overwhelming  for  you  you  have
[130:45] your  own  limit  with  work 
 so  that  can  be  your  scarcity  tactic  you 
 can  literally  write  on  your  sales  page
[130:51] which  we  will  be  making  soon  I  can  only 
 take  on  five  clients  this  month  and  I've 
 already  got  four  so  as  soon  as  the  next
[130:57] person  books  in  you  can't  buy  it  till 
 the  next  month  so  if  you  want  to  buy  it 
 like  make  sure  you  buy  it  before  like
[131:02] anyone  else  does  that  will  actually 
 increase  your  sales  significantly 
 urgency  is  another  way  to  enhance  your
[131:08] package 
 urgency  is  specifically  about  the  time 
 so  first  is  the  quantity  that's  scarcity
[131:15] urgency  is  just  time  there's  like  a 
 deadline  okay  you  can  only  buy  by 
 midnight  tonight  otherwise  the  price
[131:22] goes  up  you  can  also  use  guarantees  to 
 increase  the  demand  of  your  product  so 
 guarantee  is  kind  of  like  you  giving
[131:28] reassurance  that  your  product  or  your 
 package  is  actually  going  to  help  them 
 and  that  you  know  they'll  get  the  value
[131:34] that  they've  assumed  so  the  most  common 
 guarantees  are  just  like  the  refunds 
 saying  okay  if  you're  not  happy  if  you
[131:39] want  a  refund  then  I'll  give  you  a 
 refund  in  general  it's  pretty  much 
 always  worth  to  turn  that  on  and  to  just
[131:45] say  like  yeah  you  know  what  within  seven 
 days  days  or  14  days  you  can  use  the 
 thing  if  you  don't  like  if  you  want  a
[131:50] refund  just  get  a  refund  boom  I'm  not 
 gonna  like  stop  you  just  send  me  an 
 email  and  I'll  give  you  a  full  refund
[131:55] and  obviously  like  I'll  revoke  your 
 access  to  the  product  after  that 
 generally  you'll  get  like  an  e  like  more
[132:03] sales  that  to  the  point  that  it's  worth 
 it  so  it  can  seem  kind  of  like  annoying
[132:08] to  think  where  I'm  gonna  like  you  know 
 give  people  a  refund  I  don't  want  to  do 
 that  you  know  they've  used  my  thing  as 
 well  they've  got  to  like  see  my  courses
[132:14] maybe  I  did  a  one-to-one  time  but  you'll 
 get  a  lot  more  sales  if  you  do  offer  the 
 guarantee  so  it's  kind  of  like  it's
[132:20] pretty  much  always  worth  it  this  is 
 something  you  can  experiment  on  but  as  a 
 beginner  if  I  could  just  give  you  advice
[132:25] that  you'd  like  blindly  follow  but  I 
 will  say  it's  just  like  just  allow  the 
 refunds  allow  just  give  this  guarantee
[132:30] full  refund  within  seven  or  maybe  14 
 days  if  you're  not  happy  you  literally
[132:35] just  send  me  an  email  and  I'll  just  give 
 you  a  full  refund  that's  it  so  you've 
 got  nothing  to  worry  about  I  want  you  to 
 be  super  happy  and  I'll  try  my  best  to
[132:40] make  you  happy  and  like  I'll  try  my  best 
 to  make  sure  that  you  don't  want  a 
 refund  that's  it  you'll  actually  get  way
[132:45] more  sales  to  the  point  that  it's 
 actually  worth  turning  that  on  so  here's 
 your  actionable  step  for  this  part  of 
 the  guide  which  you  can  take  some  time
[132:51] on  think  about 
 how  you  can  add  scarcity 
 urgency  guarantees  and  also  how  you
[132:57] could  just  increase  the  demand  of  your 
 product  by  making  it  better  can  you 
 think  of  any  more  bonuses  that  you  could
[133:02] add  in  there 
 think  about  that  patch  notes  that  the 
 developer  are  going  to  say  like  oh  yeah
[133:07] the  sword  is  better  how  could  you 
 uh  buff  yeah  the  video  game  terminal
[133:13] like  oh  they  buffed  the  sword  or  they 
 nerfed  the  sword  how  could  you  buff  like 
 each  part  inside  of  your  uh  package
[133:20] think  of  that  right  now  maybe  write  it 
 down  spend  a  few  minutes  thinking  and 
 then  continue  watching  step  six  charge
[133:26] high  prices  and  make  it  worth  it  in  this 
 part  of  the  guide  you're  going  to  learn 
 exactly  what  to  price  your  package  and
[133:32] it's  actually  going  to  be  worth  it  and 
 the  price  is  actually  going  to  be  super 
 high  so  this  is  how  beginners  who  never
[133:39] make  any  money  in  business  this  is  how 
 they  choose  their  pricing  they  go  and 
 see  what  competitors  are  doing
[133:46] Tate  has  a  program  which  is  it's  47  a 
 month  sneako  had  one  which  is  about  47  a
[133:53] month 
 I  want  to  make  something  similar  so  I'll 
 make  mine  35  a  month
[133:59] do  that 
 if  you  are  a  terrible  entrepreneur  this
[134:04] is  like  no  offense  to  them  but  this  is 
 what  like  brown  like  immigrants  do  it's
[134:09] just  like  I  see  this  so  often  with  the 
 the  sort  of  lower  end  businesses  of  you
[134:14] know  making  the  corner  store  and 
 everything  it's  always  okay  look  at  your 
 competition  and  literally  price  your
[134:19] products  a  few  pennies  cheaper  than 
 theirs  hoping  that  that's  going  to  be 
 the  reason  why  you  get  a  sale  when  you 
 try  and  like  undercut  your  competition
[134:25] by  by  just  making  your  price  cheaper 
 than  them  it's  just  a  purely  depressing 
 experience  because  you're  just  making
[134:31] less  money  and  you  hear  you  are  like 
 fighting  for  the  scraps  going  lower  and 
 lower  and  lower  and  lower  a  new  guy
[134:36] comes  in  and  his  his  thing  is  lower  then 
 your  thing  is  lower  then  his  thing  is 
 lower  than  your  thing  is  lower  and  then
[134:41] before  you  know  it  no  one's  actually 
 making  any  money  the  top  tier 
 entrepreneurs  don't  do  that
[134:48] they  look  around  what  everyone's  doing 
 and  they  honestly  don't  even  let  it
[134:54] influence  the  idea  of  pricing
[134:59] instead  what  they  do 
 they  think  about  how  much  the  solution
[135:05] of  the  problem  is  worth  to  that  dream 
 customer
[135:11] you  see  you  don't  want  a  price 
 for  the  product  you  don't  want  a  price
[135:16] for  the  package  so  you're  thinking  okay 
 how  much  is  a  live  call  with  me  worth 
 how  much  is  like  this  notion  template
[135:21] this  course  worth  you  don't  want  to  do 
 that  this  is  what  low-level 
 entrepreneurs  do  what  you  want  to  do  is
[135:26] think  to  yourself  how  much  is  it  worth 
 for  my  person  like  my  customer  to
[135:31] finally  fix  this  problem  that  they've 
 had  for  however  long  think  about  how
[135:36] powerful  that  is  let's  say  it's  weight 
 loss  for  middle-aged  women  let's  say 
 that's  like  our  market  and  our  product 
 our  Solutions  are  about  weight  loss
[135:43] we  could  think  to  ourselves  yeah  you 
 know  like  my  training  programs  worth 
 twenty  dollars  and  like  one  to  one  call 
 fifty  dollars  this  is  okay  whatever  it's
[135:49] a  bit  long  okay  or  we  could  think  how 
 much  is  this  problem  worth  for  this
[135:54] middle-aged  woman  who  struggled  with 
 weight  loss  already  for  10  years  and 
 will  continue  to  struggle  for  the  rest
[136:00] of  her  life  thousands 
 thousands  if  we  can  finally  fix  this
[136:07] problem  for  her  it  is  literally  like 
 tens  of  thousands  hundreds  of  thousands 
 [ __ ]  Millions  she's  gonna  spend
[136:14] hundreds  thousands  of  her  hours  of  her 
 mental  fatigue  literally  feeling 
 self-conscious  and  and  jealous  every
[136:22] time  she  goes  into  the  supermarket  and 
 she  sees  a  woman  who's  got  a  better 
 physique  than  her  she  will  literally  get
[136:27] like  a  mental  slight  twinge  of  mental 
 illness 
 it's  worth  tens  of  thousands  if  not
[136:34] hundreds  of  of  thousands  of  pounds  to 
 fix  this  problem  for  her
[136:44] now  you're  talking  now  you're  not  gonna 
 go  and  charge  but  most  likely  you're  not 
 going  to  charge  a  hundred  thousand
[136:49] pounds  for  this 
 but  you're  gonna  actually  like  have  some 
 confidence  about  you  thinking  like  [ __ ]
[136:54] me  yeah  if  I  help  them  solve  this 
 problem  I  will  literally  save  them
[136:59] [ __ ]  Decades  of  just  spinning  around 
 in  circles  I'll  save  them  like  years  of
[137:04] experiencing  pretty  much  mental  illness 
 jealousy  insecurity  self-hatred
[137:10] the  thing  I've  got  is  actually  amazing 
 now  you're  talking
[137:15] and  so  you  think  to  yourself  okay  well 
 what's  a  what's  a  pretty  high  price  for 
 this
[137:22] and  in  general 
 the  higher  the  better
[137:29] what  I  would  do  is  I  would  align  how 
 much  you're  going  to  charge 
 with  how  intimate  and  intensive  your
[137:38] program  is  so  remember  we  say  like 
 there's  the  DIY  done  with  you  done  for
[137:43] you  if  it's  like  a  DIY  like  you're  just 
 going  to  make  the  courses  and  stuff  and 
 it's  kind  of  like  done  it's  automated
[137:48] after  that  I  would  have  it  less  if  it's 
 done  with  you  and  you're  gonna  do  like 
 these  weekly  check-ins  or  calls  or
[137:54] something  then  I  would  price  it  more  and 
 if  it's  done  for  you  if  you're  able  to 
 like  literally  be  there  and  like  kind  of
[137:59] do  as  much  as  possible  to  literally  just 
 force  them  to  get  the  results  and  you 
 pretty  much  like  in  Fitness  you  can't  do
[138:05] this  you  can't  lift  the  weights  for  them 
 but  you  do  as  much  as  you  possibly  could 
 then  that's  the  most  expensive
[138:10] it  could  be  hundreds  of  dollars  for  DIY 
 thousands  of  dollars  for  done  with  you
[138:17] and  tens  of  thousands  for  done  for  you
[138:22] and  this  might  scare  you  straight  away 
 you're  thinking  no  no  the  Ham's  is  wrong 
 I  I  couldn't  price  minor  hundreds  of
[138:27] dollars  or  thousands  of  dollars  on  and  I 
 couldn't  I  couldn't 
 yeah
[138:33] yeah 
 if  that's  what  the  belief  you  have  in 
 your  mind  then  you  couldn't  yeah  you
[138:38] couldn't 
 if  you  think  you  can't  then  you  can't 
 simple  as  that
[138:45] but  your  dream  customers  one  percent  of 
 them  or  0.1  percent  of  them  are  buying
[138:52] similar  products 
 with  a  similar  price
[138:57] from  someone  else  right  now 
 someone  else  is  selling  a  similar  thing
[139:03] that  you've  got  and  they're  making  the 
 money  that  you're  scared  of  making 
 this  isn't  the  objective  truth  of  the
[139:09] universe  that  you  couldn't  charge  that 
 month  this  is  your  own  limiting  belief 
 because
[139:15] yeah  why  did  you  get  this  limiting 
 belief  was  it  a  teacher  when  you  were 
 seven  years  old  who  who  said  some  snide
[139:20] comments  is  it  one  of  your  parents  who 
 ended  up  saying  oh  you  can't  do  anything 
 when  they  were  angry  at  you  when  you 
 were  12  years  old  which  one  was  it
[139:27] this  limited  belief  you  kept  in  your 
 mind  for  10  years  and  you're  still  gonna 
 let  it  rule  you 
 that's  how  you  want  to  live  your  life
[139:33] right 
 sounds  pretty  [ __ ]  stupid  to  live 
 your  life  like  that  right
[139:38] so  what's  stopping  you  right  now 
 grabbing  that  limiting  belief  destroying 
 it  and  thinking  to  yourself  yeah  [ __ ]
[139:43] yeah  the  solution  to  that  problem  is 
 worth  thousands  of  dollars  I'm  gonna 
 help  them  to  solve  this  problem  for  the
[139:49] rest  of  their  lives  like  they  are  done 
 once  they  have  my  program  they'll  never 
 struggle  with  weight  loss  or  whatever 
 the  the  topic  is  that  you're  helping
[139:55] them  with  ever  again  that  is  worth 
 thousands 
 yeah  I  am  worth  thousands  yeah  I  can
[140:00] charge  a  package  that's  worth  thousands 
 and  I  will  get  them  the  happy  results 
 that  they  want
[140:06] because  when  you  have  that  belief 
 well
[140:11] yeah  you  will  if  you  believe  that  you 
 you  your  product  is  worth  it
[140:16] and  you  believe  that  you  can  get  them 
 the  results  and  you're  willing  to  work 
 hard  as  [ __ ]  you  know  stay  in  like
[140:21] communication  with  them  see  where 
 they're  at  then  yeah 
 then  you  will  this  is  a  sticking  point
[140:26] for  many  young  men  because  your 
 self-image  is  very  important  here  so
[140:31] this  is  going  to  sound  kind  of  weird  we 
 clicked  on  this  section  because  you  just 
 wanted  to  make  money  you  wanted  to  know
[140:36] what  to  price  your  product  actually  this 
 section  needs  to  be  about  your  own
[140:41] psychology  and  your  own  deep  beliefs 
 about  yourself  because  how  much  you  will 
 price  your  product  how  much  you're
[140:46] willing  to  make  per  year  is  purely  based 
 on  how  you  see  yourself  some  people  some
[140:52] men  do  see  themselves  as  too  high  and 
 they  make  no  progress  you  know  some  some 
 guys  will  start  off  in  in  their  shitty
[140:58] like  first  business  and  expect  to  become 
 like  a  millionaire  within  six  months  you 
 know  they'll  be  setting  smart  goals  or
[141:03] something  and  that's  like  you'd  be  into 
 it  again  come  on  let's  slow  it  down  a 
 little  bit  you  you've  got  like  too  much
[141:08] self-belief  which  in  itself  isn't  even 
 self-belief  it's  more  like  the  same  kind 
 of  fear  that  holds  the  other  opposite
[141:13] end  of  the  Spectrum  which  is  the  people 
 who  don't  have  the  belief  to  begin  with 
 either  way  or  this  problem  is  just  stems
[141:18] from  like  fear  and  resentment  and  lack 
 of  love  and  um  conditional  love  that  you
[141:23] experience  as  a  child  I  know  this  sounds 
 really  deep  but  it's  absolutely  the 
 truth  You've  Got  Deep  psychological
[141:28] wounds  and  like  [ __ ]  up  beliefs  about 
 the  world  which  is  why  you're  struggling 
 in  business  because  if  you  did  have  the
[141:33] right  kind  of  self-belief  you  wouldn't 
 struggle  to  sell  a  PR  a  package  for  what 
 it  was  worth  if  there's  a  good  price  for
[141:39] your  your  Solutions  and  you're  thinking 
 oh  yeah  I'll  just  you  know  I'll  just 
 lower  it  a  little  bit  because  of  X
[141:45] reason  whatever  it  is  Yo  Yo  I  just  want 
 to  get  some  experience  oh  you  know  my 
 people  don't  have  much  money  they've  got
[141:51] airpods  how  many  times  do  we  need  to  go 
 over  this  the  people  that  you're  selling 
 to  have  money
[141:57] you  need  to  destroy  any  limiting  belief 
 you  have  inside  of  you  right  now  and 
 think  to  yourself  okay  [ __ ]  me  like  I'm 
 willing  to  work  super  hard  to  make  a  lot
[142:03] of  money  right  I'm  willing  to  Skyrocket 
 my  active  income  I'm  willing  to  work
[142:08] like  five  hours  a  day  to  make  sure  that 
 this  client  actually  gets  the  results 
 I'm  willing  to  over  deliver
[142:15] and  if  I'm  gonna  do  that  I  need  to  be 
 motivated  to  do  if  I  charge  them  100  or 
 200  then  I'm  not  gonna  go  above  and
[142:21] beyond  but  if  I  charge  them  a  thousand 
 two  thousand  three  thousand  like  dollars 
 for  this  package
[142:27] I'm  gonna  feel  the  pressure  I'm  gonna 
 wake  up  early  and  literally  message  them 
 saying  yo  come  on  get  up  like  do  the 
 thing  that  you  bought  my  package  for
[142:33] you  see  there  is  a  cycle  a  positive 
 feedback  loop  to  pricing  high  like
[142:39] increasing  your  prices  when  you  increase 
 your  prices  you  care  more  you're  more
[142:44] motivated  because  you're  getting  paid 
 for  it  the  beauty  of  a  capitalistic 
 society  when  you  increase  your  prices
[142:49] they  care  more  because  they've  invested 
 more  so  they  take  it  more  seriously  you 
 might  have  heard  of  the  study  where  the
[142:55] participants  have  brought  in  and  given 
 three  bottles  of  wine  to  taste  and 
 there's  like  the  cheap  bottle  the  median
[143:00] price  bottle  and  the  high-end  bottle  and 
 they're  asked  to  give  them  a  rating  of 
 like  the  taste  or  the  or  the  like  how
[143:05] good  they  are  and  they  rate  the  cheap 
 bottle  as  the  worst  taste  the  medium 
 bottle  is  the  medium  taste  and  the
[143:11] expensive  bottle  is  the  best  taste 
 they're  all  the  same  wine  it  was  all  the 
 same  but  you  just  told  them  you  just
[143:17] made  them  believe  that  one  was  more 
 expensive  if  something  is  more  expensive 
 people  just  believe  that  it's  more
[143:22] valuable  that  it's  better  and  so  they 
 get  better  results  with  it 
 so  literally  a  fast  way  of  you  getting
[143:29] your  people  more  resulted  simply  to  just 
 charge  more  and  then  if  we're  being
[143:34] honest 
 if  we're  being  totally  honest  which 
 might  offend  some  people
[143:39] when  you  charge  more  you  get  better 
 customers 
 you  simply  just  get  better  customers
[143:44] when  you  charge  less  you  attract  the 
 worst  people  you  attract  like  cheap
[143:49] [ __ ]  you  never  want  to  sell 
 like  a  cheap  product  because  especially 
 when  there's  like  a  service  when  you
[143:54] want  to  like  you  know  do  some  kind  of 
 interactive  component  with  them  the 
 amount  of  like  emails  and  complaints  you 
 get  from  like  lower  tier  people  broke
[144:00] people  because  they've  like  imagine  like 
 a  broke  person  who's  barely  got  any 
 money  and  hey  you  are  trying  to  sell  him
[144:05] like  a  10  a  month  thing  they  will 
 [ __ ]  like  they  will  ruin  your  mental 
 health  you  don't  want  to  sell  anything
[144:11] like  low  ticket  the  lowest  thing  that 
 I'll  ever  sell  is  like  500  because  that 
 means  that  like  the  absolute  brokies
[144:17] can't  afford  it  which  I  know  sounds 
 horrible  but  it's  the  absolute  truth 
 that  sounds  horrible  you  can  criticize
[144:22] me  all  you  want  but  it's  the  absolute 
 [ __ ]  truth  you  don't  want  to  sell  to 
 like  absolute  broke  people  because
[144:27] they're  the  worst  customers  by  far  you 
 want  us  like  the  more  expensive  your 
 product  can  be  simply  the  better  the
[144:34] customer  will  be  the  more  they'll  care 
 the  more  they'll  respect  you  the  the 
 higher  end  they  are  that  you  might  even 
 want  to  network  with  imagine  if  you  sell
[144:40] something  for  5K  for  10K  for  50k  for  25k 
 for  example  imagine  the  level  of
[144:46] difference  between  the  person  who  would 
 actually  be  interested  in  that  when  they 
 start  off  as  like  better  customers
[144:51] because  they  can  afford  your  more 
 expensive  product  they'll  care  more 
 they'll  invest  more  into  it  they'll  get
[144:56] better  results 
 when  they  get  better  results  you  get  to 
 Showcase  that  you  get  testimonials  which
[145:02] add  also  your  own  self-belief  about  your 
 own  program  your  package  goes  up  because 
 they've  got  great  results  and  so  you
[145:08] start  getting  conviction  which  is  the 
 most  important  part  of  sales  is  like  you 
 genuinely  believe  that  your  package  will
[145:13] work 
 so  it's  a  very  positive  feedback  loop 
 when  you  charge  higher  prices  now
[145:18] imagine  the  exact  opposite  now  imagine 
 we  decrease  our  price  we  start  with  a 
 very  low  price  then  you  attract  the
[145:25] worst  customers  the  most  demanding 
 customers  the  guys  who  won't  even  put  in 
 any  any  real  effort  because  they've
[145:30] barely  spent  any  money  so  they  don't  put 
 in  effort  because  they  didn't  invest 
 financially  they  don't  get  the  results
[145:37] and  then  they  blame  you  they  didn't  even 
 do  what  was  required  and  they'll 
 literally  blame  you
[145:42] and  now  instead  of  getting  testimonials 
 and  positive  reviews  you're  getting  hate
[145:47] hate  like  posts  and  you  know  people 
 saying  oh  yeah  I  bought  this  thing  for 
 seven  dollars  it  wasn't  even  worth  it
[145:52] guys  it's  just  the  scam  guys 
 you  don't  want  to  be  selling  to  those 
 people  and  also  if  we're  totally  honest
[145:57] you  don't  want  to  be  interacting  with 
 those  people  either  you  don't  want  to  be 
 interacting  with  the  kind  of  person 
 who's  sending  you  like  a  list  of
[146:02] questions  before  he  buys  for  something 
 for  like  ten  dollars  where  he's  like 
 autistically  trying  to  okay  so  is  it
[146:08] like  this  or  is  it  like  this  and  if  I 
 buy  it  like  this  like  you  don't  want  to 
 be  like  interacting  actually  spending 
 hours  of  your  day  with  those  kinds  of
[146:14] people  do  you  you're  an  entrepreneur  you 
 don't  want  to  be  like  serving  the  lowest 
 sort  of  financial  tiers  it's  just  the
[146:21] the  brutal  truth  of  the  world  this  will 
 offend  many  people  but  a  certain  like 
 the  entrepreneurs  and  like  a  certain
[146:26] class  of  of  people  of  intelligence  of  of 
 maturity  and  values  will  understand  what 
 I'm  getting  at  here  and  you'll  be
[146:31] thinking  like  thank  [ __ ]  actually  Hans 
 is  absolutely  right  here  like  the  more 
 expensive  I  can  sell  the  better  you  want
[146:36] to  have  like  gatekeep  some  of  like 
 access  to  you  you  don't  want  to  have
[146:41] just  any  one  of  like  the  the  lower 
 Financial  levels  to  be  able  to  buy  it
[146:46] because  often  they  are  the  worst  now 
 this  isn't  always  the  case  there's  a  guy
[146:51] in  India  who  makes  a  thousand  times  less 
 than  than  me  but  he's  a  better  person
[146:56] that  I  could  ever  imagine  to  be  of 
 course  there's  always  exceptions  to  this 
 but  in  general  money  does  rule  it  it
[147:02] really  does  it's  it's  not  so  much  that 
 you  know  money  makes  the  person  or 
 anything  it's  just  that  when  a  broke
[147:08] person  spends  like  whatever  pennies  they 
 have  it  becomes  a  headache  for  the 
 seller  who  has  to  like  deal  with  that
[147:14] customer  but  when  you  charge  hundreds  of 
 dollars  you've  just  taken  out  99  of  the
[147:19] population  they  can't  buy  it  anymore 
 guess  what  that  means
[147:25] you're  selling  to  the  one  percent 
 that's  better  you're  selling  to  like  the
[147:30] one  percent  of  young  men  let's  say  for 
 me  for  my  product  I'm  selling  for  the 
 one  percent  of  young  men  who  actually
[147:35] would  buy  like  an  educational  product 
 for  500  because  they  actually  think  it's 
 worth  it  if  I  made  my  product  like  I'd
[147:41] done  a  school  five  dollars  or  ten 
 dollars  or  twenty  dollars 
 imagine  that  the  kind  of  people  who
[147:47] would  flood  in  who  weren't  willing  to 
 spend  more  on  their  education  they'll
[147:52] certainly  there'll  be  a  percentage  of 
 those  new  people  who  come  in  who  like 
 actually  really  care  about  education  but 
 they  just  simply  couldn't  afford  it
[147:57] because  you  know  the  conversion  rates  of 
 currency  in  India  and  stuff  absolutely 
 but  most  of  the  people  who  would  join
[148:02] would  be  like  would  care  less  they'd 
 start  like  [ __ ]  posting  low  quality 
 posts  they  would  they'd  like  you  know
[148:08] watch  like  20  minutes  of  the  course  then 
 like  not  even  take  any  more  of  it  and 
 then  complain  that  their  YouTube  channel
[148:13] isn't  growing  with  like  my  YouTube 
 course  for  example  and  then  they'd  leave 
 bad  reviews  saying  yep  it  didn't  work
[148:18] it's  just  the  scam  guys  haha  like  you 
 can  just  find  it  online  for  free
[148:23] you  don't  want  to  be  selling  to  those 
 people  and  so  when  you  charge  high 
 prices  you  cut  them  off  way  better  the
[148:29] broke  14  year  olds  who  don't  understand 
 entrepreneurship  and  money  might  get 
 angry  at  you  and  this  is  something  I'm
[148:34] just  going  to  be  honest  with  you  when 
 you  do  charge  the  higher  prices  it  is 
 like  it's  so  unfortunate  that  the  game
[148:39] of  Entrepreneurship  is  so  hated  these 
 days  that  when  you  do  charge  the  higher 
 prices  especially  when  you're  like  an 
 influencer  if  you're  going  through  it
[148:45] about  like  you  know  these  sort  of 
 YouTube  routes 
 you  will  get  some  level  of  hate  you  will
[148:50] do  it's  always  like  sad  when  I  see  it 
 when  I'll  see  like  someone  will  just 
 comment  like  oh  yeah  a  scammer  you  can 
 you  know  you  don't  need  like  hamza's
[148:55] course  or  his  program  you  can  just  find 
 everything  online  it's  like  yeah  like 
 you  can  go  and  find  like  education  and
[149:00] information  about  any  topic  online  fine 
 go  ahead  but  like  isn't  your  biggest
[149:05] problem  in  life  your  content  consumption 
 anyway  isn't  your  biggest  problem  that 
 you  spend  like  four  hours  a  day  on
[149:11] YouTube  and  you're  just  watching  [ __ ]  to 
 your  like  content  if  I've  got  a  YouTube 
 course  yeah  you  can  go  and  learn  YouTube
[149:16] online  for  free  but  like  join  me  like  it 
 just  it  starts  that  like  play  on  you 
 absolutely  I'm  not  going  to  sugarcoat
[149:22] things  if  you  are  gonna  sell  as  like  an 
 influencer  a  YouTuber  Tick  Tock  or 
 whatever  and  you're  gonna  sell  at  high
[149:28] prices  you  will  get  people  who  complain 
 but  here's  the  thing  if  you  sold 
 anything
[149:33] for  one  dollar 
 you'd  get  people  who  complain  that  it 
 wasn't  for  free  let's  just  be  honest  99
[149:38] of  people  are  [ __ ]  losers  they're 
 gonna  try  and  pull  you  down  the  [ __ ] 
 crabs  in  the  bucket  they're  gonna  be
[149:44] they'll  literally  pull  you  down  and  keep 
 you  there  like  just  being  absolutely 
 broken  amongst  them  when  they  see  you
[149:51] hey  you  are  trying  to  be  an  entrepreneur 
 they  will  try  and  bring  you  down  they 
 will  question  it  and  be  like  oh  but  why
[149:56] don't  you  just  like  people  have  said 
 this  to  me  why  don't  you  just  make  your 
 business  for  free  why  don't  you  just 
 make  it  for  free  I'm  thinking  bro  the
[150:01] [ __ ]  YouTube  videos  are  free  what  are 
 you  on  about  I'm  sat  here  with  a  throat 
 that  [ __ ]  hurts  because  I've  been 
 recording  for  four  hours  today  this  is
[150:07] for  free  for  you 
 let  me  make  some  [ __ ]  money  there's  a
[150:12] product  which  I  can  like  if  I  sell  it  at 
 a  good  price 
 not  only  do  we  have  all  those  positives
[150:19] of  you  know  like  the  best  customers  come 
 in  they're  more  invested  so  they 
 actually  get  more  more  value  but  when
[150:24] that  product  makes  me  money  then  I 
 reinvest  back  into  it  and  then  I've 
 hired  teachers  and  coaches  and  more 
 moderators  and  everything  so  the  product
[150:30] gets  even  better 
 people  will  question  this  and  they  will 
 like  dislike  you  for  it  I'm  just  giving
[150:36] you  the  truth  and  this  is  something  that 
 like  it  doesn't  hurt  me  anywhere  near  as 
 much  as  it  used  to  but  this  used  to  be
[150:41] like  the  biggest  pain  that  I  had  in  this 
 entire  business  of  being  a  YouTuber  and 
 having  a  product  because  it  would  really
[150:47] get  to  me  when  people  would  write  like 
 little  words  like  you  know  a  14  year  old 
 saying  like  haha  he's  a  scammer  like  you
[150:52] can  just  watch  all  this  stuff  for  free 
 online  and  it  I'd  be  there  like  thinking 
 like  what  how  do  I  respond  to  this  I
[150:57] can't  be  the  big  YouTuber  who  responds 
 to  a  14  year  old  they're  trying  to  break 
 it  down  how  they're  a  [ __ ]  idiot 
 saying  like  yes  like  information  is
[151:04] readily  available  but  it  isn't  about  the 
 information  like  like  if  you  can  learn 
 it  for  Freedom  why  aren't  you  a  [ __ ]
[151:09] YouTuber  if  I've  got  this  YouTube  course 
 and  you're  saying  Oh  but  you  can  learn 
 it  for  free  why  aren't  you  like  why 
 aren't  you  growing  on  YouTube  then
[151:14] because  it's  more  than  just  finding  it 
 for  free  on  YouTube  or  it's  a  scam 
 because  you  can  just  get  it  for  free 
 like  it  it  rarely  got  to  me  for  a  good
[151:20] few  years  it  does  a  lot  less  now  I  think 
 just  because  of  like  exposure 
 intolerance  but  if  you're  quite  new  to
[151:26] this  I  really  do  want  to  just  give  you 
 this  slight  like  sort  of  mental 
 preparation  to  get  ready  but  get  warmed
[151:32] up  for  this  [ __ ]  because  when  you  do 
 open  the  floodgates  and  you  do  announce 
 it  by  the  way  I've  got  this  product  and 
 I'm  going  to  be  selling  it  to  my
[151:37] followers 
 let's  say  90  of  people  will  see  it  and 
 think  I'm  not  really  interested  nine
[151:44] percent  of  people  will  literally  start 
 to  dislike  you  for  it  because  people 
 just  dislike  someone  else  making  money
[151:50] these  days  it's  just  the  sad  truth  of  it 
 and  it's  even  even  young  men  which  which 
 sadded  me  because  I'm  just  thinking  like
[151:56] how  do  you  not  think  that  this  is  cool 
 how  do  you  not  look  at  it  and  like 
 instead  of  hating  the  like  the  game  or
[152:02] the  player  of  the  game  why  don't  you 
 look  at  it  and  think  oh  damn  that's 
 that's  a  pretty  good  way  to  make  money
[152:07] like  I'm  not  gonna  buy  it  but  like  I'm 
 just  kind  of  smart  with  this  okay  he's 
 done  that  okay  he's  done  that  I  might 
 try  so  I  might  learn  the  lesson  there
[152:13] like  nine  percent  of  people  will  just  be 
 the  haters  and  one  percent  of  people 
 your  loyal  fans  they'll  buy  it  the  one
[152:20] percent  of  people  they'll  buy  it 
 whatever  price  it  is  they'll  buy  it 
 you're  selling  to  them  don't  think  about
[152:26] the  90  who  aren't  really  interested 
 don't  think  about  the  nine  percent  who 
 might  be  like  the  haters  you  think  only
[152:32] about  the  one  percent  and  what  they're 
 willing  because  they're  literally  there 
 thinking  oh  man  another  day  where
[152:37] they've  stepped  on  a  scale  and  the 
 weights  gone  high  and  they  really  wish 
 there  was  a  solution  to  this  problem 
 they've  got  2K  or  3K  sat  in  the  bank
[152:43] right  now  they're  just  kind  of  saving  it 
 up  for  like  no  clear  reason  if  you  were 
 going  to  guarantee  them  that  forever
[152:49] their  problem  of  like  weight  loss  was 
 going  to  be  fixed  they'd  be  thinking  you 
 know  they'd  be  scared  of  spending  that 
 much  but  they'd  be  thinking  you  know
[152:54] what 
 it's  actually  kind  of  worth  it  and  I 
 really  like  this  guy  I  really  trust  him 
 I  might  do  it
[153:00] they're  who  you  want  to  sell  to  those 
 are  the  people  that  you  can  actually 
 really  help  you  can  change  their  lives
[153:08] and 
 if  we're  being  totally  honest  which  is 
 absolutely  okay  you  need  to  be  motivated
[153:14] for  it  and  so  when  that  person  transfers 
 you  over  3  000  pounds  for  your  fitness
[153:20] program  where  you're  gonna  go  on  to  a 
 daily  call  with  them  to  make  sure  that 
 they  don't  eat  any  [ __ ]  food  or  anything
[153:25] you're  gonna  care  because  you're 
 thinking  [ __ ]  me  they  just  gave  me 
 thousands  of  dollars  I  used  to  like  I
[153:30] needed  to  work  for  about  two  months  to 
 make  that 
 I'm  gonna  make  sure  this  this  fat
[153:35] [ __ ]  loses  weight  right  you're 
 gonna  you're  gonna  really  care  about 
 them  you're  gonna  like  make  like  you  see
[153:40] the  Habit  tracker  I've  got  there  this  is 
 like  my  for  my  own  one  right  right  there 
 this  um  this  one  here  yeah  so  this  is  my
[153:46] own  like  habit  I  take  them  off  you're 
 gonna  make  one  for  your  client  thinking 
 okay  I've  got  to  make  sure  he  ticks
[153:51] these  habits  off  you're  gonna  message 
 him  at  like  7pm  I'm  like  have  you  done 
 that  thing  no  no  do  it  do  it  do  it  do  it 
 do  it  call  him  like  no  no  what  are  you
[153:57] doing  resting  bro  just  do  it  for  five 
 minutes  come  on  like  you're  literally 
 like  pressing  them  because  you  want  to 
 get  them  the  result  because  they've  paid
[154:03] you  a  lot  this  makes  you  a  way  better 
 entrepreneur  because  you're  actually 
 getting  results  and  that's  what  I  want
[154:08] for  you  I'm  super  interested  about  your 
 thoughts  of  this  last  section  especially 
 about  the  concept  of  charging  higher
[154:13] prices  but  then  some  people  might  kind 
 of  like  hate  you  for  that  what  do  you  do
[154:18] with  the  haters  like  what's  your  opinion 
 on  that  if  you  go  and  comment  that  right 
 now  I  just  be  like  what  I'm  interested
[154:23] to  see  but  of  course  too  if  you  do  that 
 the  YouTube  algorithm  will  promote  this 
 video  so  it's  like  a  win-win  I'll  be
[154:28] reading  some  of  the  comments  so  I'm  just 
 very  interested  like  how  are  you  gonna 
 cope  with  it  when  you  do  see  a  comment
[154:33] from  someone  saying  like  oh  yeah  he's  a 
 scammer  what  are  you  gonna  do  it's  very 
 like  it's  a  very  powerful  practice  to  um
[154:40] think  about  the  bad  things  that  could 
 happen  you  know  the  obstacles  that  could 
 arise  and  how  you'd  overcome  them  it's  a
[154:45] very  powerful  practice  doing  that  so 
 this  can  just  be  your  practice  of 
 thinking  okay  but  I  do  get  some  kind  of 
 hater  or  someone  who's  like  complaining
[154:51] saying  like  oh  my  business  isn't  for 
 free  that  I'm  not  working  for  free 
 what  am  I  going  to  do  how  would  I
[154:58] respond  would  I  respond  would  I  reply  to 
 their  comments  what  would  I  do  go 
 comment  your  answer  to  that  below  right
[155:03] now  step  7  getting  customers  now  we  have 
 a  package  that's  ready  to  sell  but  we
[155:08] need  to  actually  get  the  customers  who 
 are  interested  in  our  package  and 
 there's  four  ways  that  you  can  get
[155:14] customers 
 there's  only  really  one  way  that  is
[155:19] worth  it  in  my  opinion  from  you  and  for 
 most  of  the  guys  watching  this  like  for
[155:24] my  younger  self  there's  only  one  way 
 that  I  would  recommend  but  there  is  four 
 ways  you can  get  customers  and  they  are
[155:29] warm  Outreach  warm  Outreach  is  where  you 
 message  people  that  you  know
[155:34] so  straight  away  like  this  just  seems 
 cringe  to  me  because  it's  imagine 
 messaging  like  your  old  high  school
[155:39] friends  on  on  Instagram  if  they  want  to 
 buy  this  package  that  you've  set  for  a 
 few  thousand  dollars  like
[155:45] Joe  I  mean  if  like  if  you're  a 
 professional  and  you're  30  years  old  and 
 you  know  loads  of  business  men  okay  fair
[155:50] enough  but  if  you're  like  a  young  guy 
 and  you  only  know  like  other  young  guys 
 I  don't  think  warm  Outreach  the  people
[155:55] you  know  is  gonna  like  work  so  well  you 
 could  try  and  you  know  message  the 
 people  that  you  know  who  are  the  most
[156:01] successful  maybe  the  head  teacher  of 
 your  school  but  again  it's  like  it's 
 still  a  little  bit  like  there's  quite  a 
 lot  of  friction  and  almost  embarrassment
[156:07] for  most  young  guys  to  consider  that  the 
 second  is  cold  Outreach  that's  where  you
[156:12] message  people  that  you  don't  know  maybe 
 you  try  and  find  like  random  phone 
 numbers  online  or  email  addresses  or
[156:17] message  random  people  on  Instagram  and 
 pretty  much  say  like  oh  hey  bro  wanna 
 you  wanna  buy  my  my  things  for  like  it
[156:24] can  work  and  people  do  get  a  good  level 
 of  success  with  it  but  it's  not  what  I 
 would  recommend  and  the  third  is  paid
[156:31] ads  that's  where  you'll  go  on  to 
 websites  like  for  example  YouTube  Google 
 Instagram  and  on  those  platforms  you
[156:38] could  pay  like  you  can  pay  the  platform 
 to  put  your  advert  in  front  of  people 
 this  means  that  you're  going  to  be
[156:43] paying  25  50  a  hundred  dollars  per  day 
 to  get  your  like  advert  scene  in  front
[156:49] of  other  people  and  you'll  need  to  learn 
 the  skill  of  like  how  to  actually  get 
 the  ROI  which  is  quite  difficult  and
[156:55] it's  going  to  require  quite  a  lot  of 
 upfront  money  if  you  could  spend  50  or 
 100  every  single  day  then  this  could  be
[157:01] something  you'd  consider  but  most  young 
 guys  can't  do  that  and  so  in  my  opinion 
 we  are  left  with  actually  the  best  way
[157:06] to  get  customers  which  is  to  post  free 
 content  and  to  build  up  an  audience
[157:12] that's  exactly  what  I've  done  here  which 
 is  the  business  model  so  I  actually  feel 
 very  strong  in  teaching  you  this  because
[157:17] you  can  see  this  like  on  my  channel  I've 
 built  up  an  audience  of  two  million  guys 
 and  then  it's  just  those  same  guys  that
[157:22] I  mentioned  my  product  to  this  is  in  my 
 opinion  the  single  greatest  way  to  to 
 get  customers  in  this  modern  day  because
[157:28] not  only  do  you  get  the  customers  but 
 you  also  build  the  loyal  audience  which 
 is  genuinely  the  most  valuable  asset
[157:34] that  you  could  accumulate  in  business 
 plus  just  think  about  the  scale  imagine 
 being  a  completely  new  YouTuber  is  it
[157:41] absolutely  unreasonable  to  think  that  a 
 new  guy  who's  you  know  posting  his  first 
 few  videos  would  get  a  hundred  views  on
[157:47] a  YouTube  video  is  that  unreasonable 
 like  crazy  like  not  really  most  guys 
 will  probably  only  get  like  10  views  on
[157:52] the  first  video  that's  fine  but  it's  not 
 crazy  to  think  that  you  get  a  hundred 
 right 
 well  to  match  that  you'd  need  to  go  and
[157:59] send  out  a  hundred  messages  or  a  hundred 
 DMS  when  you  really  think  about  like  how
[158:04] tedious  it  would  be  going  on  Instagram 
 and  sending  everyone  a  message  going 
 like  you  know  calling  a  hundred  people
[158:09] and  not  even  knowing  like  who  the  [ __ ] 
 they  are  sending  emails  it's  like  it 
 seems  kind  of  quick  but  you  could 
 imagine  sending  every  cold  email
[158:15] actually  takes  like  five  ten  minutes 
 whereas  you  could  record  a  video  where 
 you  just  talk  about  you  know  some  topic
[158:22] like  oh  hey  guys  I  just  discovered  this 
 new  weight  loss  trick  which  is  really 
 really  good  you  know  this  is  all  you  do 
 you  take  a  picture  of  your  meal  and  I
[158:28] actually  literally  that's  all  you  have 
 to  do  is  just  take  a  picture  of 
 everything  you  eat  and  automatically
[158:33] you'll  end  up  losing  more  weight  than 
 usual  just  because  you're  way  more  held 
 accountable  to  it  and  if  you  even  send
[158:38] that  picture  to  someone  else  then  you 
 know  you'll  lose  even  more  weight 
 because  of  the  accountability  and 
 everything  and  by  the  way  I've  got  a
[158:43] fitness  course  just  go  click  on  the  top 
 Link  in  the  description  boom  it's  not 
 unreasonable  to  think  that  you'd  get  100
[158:48] views  in  a  social  media  post 
 maybe  a  thousand
[158:53] now  we  can  say  I'm  kind  of  like  a 
 professional  here  and  I've  been  doing 
 this  and  practicing  this  for  a  few  years
[158:58] and  maybe  I  got  lucky  in  some  areas  but 
 how  many  views  does  this  video  have  I've 
 mentioned  my  product  a  few  times  in  this
[159:03] video 
 look  at  the  views  of  this  video  imagine 
 if  I  had  to  message  that  many  people  so
[159:09] you  can  see  that  posting  content  gives 
 you  a  huge  number  of  people  that  you  can 
 reach  out  to  so  we'll  choose  this  as  our
[159:15] path  to  getting  customers  so  what  we're 
 going  to  do  is  we're  going  to  post  onto 
 a  social  media  that  we  can  learn  to
[159:21] master  over  time  and  this  is  where  we 
 need  to  decide  okay  well  Which  social 
 media  should  we  get  good  at  is  just
[159:26] telling  me  to  be  a  YouTuber  but  Tick 
 Tock  is  doing  really  well  right  now 
 isn't  it  and  Alex  Mosey  says  that
[159:31] Twitter  is  really  good  so  maybe  we 
 should  do  Twitter  and  you  know  maybe 
 you're  bouncing  around  which  one  which 
 social  media  platform  should  you  do  what
[159:37] I  recommend  is  what  I've  learned  from 
 another  entrepreneur  named  Dan  Co  and  he 
 said  first  figure  out  if  you  want  to
[159:43] speak  or  write  so  I'd  ask  you  this  do 
 you  want  to  be  a  speaker  like  I'm 
 speaking  right  now  perhaps  being  on
[159:49] camera  or  maybe  would  you  enjoy  typing 
 words  on  a  keyboard  instead  which  one
[159:54] would  you  enjoy  more  which  one  would  you 
 actually  like  want  to  do  more  as  hard  as 
 it  is  to  like  you  know  set  up  recording
[160:00] and  speak  for  an  hour  or  two  hours  or 
 three  hours  straight  I  actually  have 
 more  fun  doing  this  that  I  would  just
[160:06] typing  and  bashing  my  like  another 
 keyboard  and  so  this  is  what  I've  chosen 
 so  speak  or  write  which  one  would  you
[160:12] rather  do  once  you  have  your  idea  then 
 we  choose  the  social  media  platform 
 based  on  which  skill  that  we  want  to
[160:18] level  up  for  speaking  there's  podcasts 
 YouTube  maybe  Tick  Tock  if  you  want  to
[160:23] make  like  educational  content  on  there 
 and  if  you  want  to  write  then  Twitter  is 
 probably  the  best  place  in  general  if
[160:29] you're  trying  to  figure  out  which  social 
 media  you  should  post  on  the  easiest 
 answer  is  like  just  post  on  the  one  that
[160:34] you  consume  on  Chances  Are  YouTube  is 
 probably  like  your  most  popular  social 
 media  that  you're  watching  on  right  now
[160:39] it's  the  one  that  you  spend  your  most 
 time  on  just  post  on  that  you  understand 
 it  you  know  how  it  works  you  see  which
[160:46] videos  do  quite  well  you  see  like  the 
 creators  who  have  got  a  certain  style 
 and  you  see  the  trends  and  and  the  hot
[160:52] topics  so  just  go  with  the  one  that  you 
 actually  spend  your  time  consuming  a 
 quick  powerful  tip  once  you  have  chosen
[160:58] whether  you're  gonna  speak  or  write 
 the  single  highest  Roi  activity  that  you
[161:06] could  do  in  your  entire  business  like 
 the  single  most  powerful  activity  you
[161:12] could  do 
 in  work 
 is  to  level  up  either  the  skill  of
[161:18] speaking  or  writing 
 because  with  everything  that  we've 
 covered  with  making  money  we've  talked
[161:24] about  you  know  the  package  and  the 
 problems  and  solutions  everything  like 
 that
[161:29] the  most  powerful  leverage  that  we  have 
 right  now  is  social  media  if  you  can  pop
[161:34] off  on  social  media  that  is  the  single 
 like  greatest  thing  that  could  happen  to 
 you  in  like  a  business  sense  might  not
[161:40] be  good  for  your  mental  health  it 
 probably  won't  be  but  for  business  it 
 will  be  really  good  and  so  the  single
[161:45] greatest  thing  you  could  do  to  pop  up  on 
 social  media  is  not  to  just  like  try  and 
 get  lucky  or  some  [ __ ]  but  it's 
 rather  to  think  okay  I  chose  to  speak  on
[161:52] YouTube  then  you  just  level  up  your 
 speaking  skill  you  go  and  get  books  on 
 speaking  or  for  example  if  you  wrote  if
[161:58] you  chose  writing  then  you'll  get  books 
 on  writing  you  go  search  for  a  speaking 
 coach  or  a  writing  coach  depending  on
[162:03] with  social  media  you've  chosen  and 
 you'd  literally  just  level  it  up  for 
 speaking  there's  also  storytelling  so
[162:08] for  example  I  have  a  speaking  coach  and 
 also  a  storytelling  coach  and  now  my 
 videos  are  doing  better  than  ever  so
[162:13] this  is  what  you  do  to  get  customers  you 
 start  your  own  social  media  profile  okay 
 you've  made  your  YouTube  channel  or  your
[162:19] Twitter  account  then  what  you  do  is  you 
 post  free  content  so  you  write  tweets 
 maybe  threads  or  you  post  YouTube  videos
[162:25] where  all  you're  thinking  about  you're 
 not  trying  to  grow  an  audience  you're 
 not  trying  to  get  views  all  you're
[162:31] trying  to  think  of  is  I  want  to  give  as 
 good  advice  as  possible  to  my  dream
[162:37] customer  remember  like  the  dream  Avatar 
 the  kind  of  person  we're  trying  to  help 
 all  you're  thinking  about  is  just  trying
[162:43] to  help  them  as  much  as  possible  and 
 working  super  hard  at  that  I  want  you  to 
 really  think  right  now  like  this  video
[162:49] that  you're  watching  think  about  how 
 hard  and  difficult  this  video  is  for 
 hours  I've  been  speaking  I've  had  to 
 take  breaks  because  my  throat  literally
[162:55] hurts  my  brain  feels  like  not  very  foggy 
 but  quite  like  weirdly  heavy  right  now 
 because  of  how  how  I  can't  even  speak
[163:02] properly  like  do  you  literally  see  hear 
 me  stuttering  as  I  try  and  explain  to 
 you  how  hard  I've  worked  for  this  and 
 think  about  this  now  this  video  is  going
[163:08] to  make  a  fair  amount  of  money  on 
 AdSense  and  everything  but  really  just 
 think  about  my  intention  here
[163:14] it's  to  help  you 
 it's  to  get  you  insane  results  because
[163:20] if  this  video  can  be  so  good  that  you 
 literally  follow  it  and  actually  make 
 some  money  in  real  life  you're  going  to
[163:26] like  me  right  you're  actually  gonna  like 
 really  really  like  me  you  might  even 
 send  this  video  to  a  few  people
[163:33] when  you  end  up  speaking  to  someone 
 maybe  even  six  months  from  now  maybe 
 five  years  from  now  you  might  even  end
[163:38] up  telling  them  oh  you  should  watch 
 hamza's  money  guide  that's  how  I  started 
 maybe  you'll  be  like  it's  like  famous  in
[163:44] a  year  from  now  mentioning  the  start  of 
 like  your  business  was  when  you  watched 
 hamza's  money  guide  and  this  video  keeps
[163:49] popping  off  more  and  more  and  more  and 
 more  and  maybe  if  you  wanted  more 
 support  because  you  liked  me  because  you
[163:55] know  this  video  has  helped  you  because 
 you  trusted  me  because  my  advice  worked 
 for  you
[164:00] you'd  see  that  the  one  program  that  I 
 sell  at  Donna's  School  you'd  look  at  it
[164:05] and  think  damn  I  can  actually  afford  it 
 now 
 I  mean  if  his  video  worked  I  wonder  what
[164:12] his  online  school  would  be  like 
 and  then  you  might  consider  buying  it 
 that's  the  exact  process  that  we  want
[164:18] you  to  follow  you  make  super  helpful 
 content  like  the  greatest  kind  of 
 content  the  most  helpful  content  that
[164:24] you  could  think  of  you  know  for  your 
 dream  customers  problems  so  for  example 
 if  we're  in  the  fitness  Niche  we're
[164:29] thinking  okay  these  fatties  are 
 struggling  with  losing  weight  and  why 
 because  they've  got  all  those  remember 
 that  massive  problem  list  they've  got
[164:35] all  those  problems  like  oh  but  you  know 
 I  don't  even  know  how  to  sign  up  to  the 
 gym 
 then  we  just  make  a  piece  of  content
[164:42] titled  how  to  sign  up  to  the  gym 
 complete  beginner's  guide 
 and  there's  someone  who's  going  to  see
[164:48] that  as  a  title  and  be  like  wait  that's 
 [ __ ]  perfect  that's  exactly  what  I 
 they're  fat  as  [ __ ]  that's  exactly  what
[164:53] I  needed  if  this  guy's  got  a  workout 
 routine  I  might  end  up  buying  it  you 
 want  to  know  why  most  people  struggle  at
[164:58] this  point  and  they  never  get  any  growth 
 on  social  media 
 because  they're  obsessed  with  the  growth
[165:04] is  the  guy  who's  obsessed  with  the  girl 
 who's  needy  for  the  girl  is  he  gonna  get
[165:09] her 
 probably  not  right  you  understand  this 
 as  young  men  we've  we've  really  been
[165:14] hearing  this  message  recently  like  being 
 needy  for  girls  is  a  bad  thing  not  right 
 but  most  most  little  YouTubers  that  I
[165:21] speak  to  they  are  needy  for  subs  and 
 Views  they're  like  little  [ __ ]  for 
 like  views  they'll  do  anything  for  a
[165:27] little  a  new  view  or  a  like 
 the  issue  is  that  people  can  see  that 
 like  the  viewer  can  see  that  they  can
[165:33] see  that  this  guy  is  too  needy  and  it's 
 just  kind  of  repulsive  he's  making  like 
 whatever  video  he  can  possibly  try  and
[165:39] get  some  views  on  it's  not  nice  for  the 
 viewer  to  see  that  what  you  want  to  do 
 is  give  the  best  most  effective  advice
[165:46] that  you  can  to  that  population  that 
 you're  trying  to  help  the  dream  customer
[165:52] the  Avatar  that  you've  been  thinking  of 
 and  you  can  just  go  down  your  problems 
 list  and  literally  just  make  a  bunch  of
[165:57] content  just  aimed  at  them  when  these 
 potential  customers  of  yours  stumble
[166:02] upon  your  content  and  it  actually  helps 
 them  get  results  not  like  some  random
[166:07] [ __ ]  little  shallow  video  like  most 
 like  creators  you  know  new  people  will
[166:12] be  making  think  about  how  different  this 
 video  is  that  you're  watching  compared 
 to  like  the  videos  like  I'm  used  to  make
[166:17] and  I  could  be  making  right  now  the  top 
 seven  ways  to  make  money  online
[166:22] videos  that  are  helping  no  one 
 but  if  you  literally  imagine  if  you 
 literally  make  a  few  hundred  dollars  by
[166:28] following  this  guide  that  I've  put 
 together  over  like  hours  of  brain 
 numbing  studying  and  journaling  and
[166:33] thinking  and  everything  right 
 when  you  make  the  few  hundred  dollars 
 and  you  see  that  I've  got  a  program  that
[166:39] I  sell  and  my  advice  on  a  YouTube  video 
 has  worked  you  might  be  interested  in 
 actually  buying  from  me  this  is  how  you
[166:46] make  money  from  social  media  you  first 
 literally  get  people  results  just
[166:51] through  your  content  which  means  that 
 your  content  like  the  advice  you  give 
 needs  to  be  powerful  it  needs  to  be 
 actually  right  it  means  that  you  hold
[166:57] nothing  back  you  give  all  your  gifts 
 you're  all  all  your  understanding  the 
 best  like  teaching  that  you  can  do  and
[167:03] then  when  they  realize  that  your  stuff 
 works  and  that  you've  got  some  kind  of 
 paid  product  people  are  very  interested
[167:09] in  that  because  it's  it  kind  of  like 
 people  aren't  stupid  like  if  your  advice 
 works  for  them  and  they've  seen  that  it
[167:15] works  they  automatically  assume  like 
 okay  well  I  can  follow  this  guy  and  I 
 can  afford  that  thing  now  I'll  probably
[167:22] buy  it  there's  a  very  powerful  mindset 
 here  that  I  got  from  Alex  hamosi  give 
 away  the  secrets  sell  the  implementation
[167:29] think  about  this  video  here 
 I  genuinely  could  have  sold  as  a
[167:34] thousand  dollar  course  really  could  have 
 like  let's  just  give  me  like  a  little 
 bit  of  credit  there  I  genuinely  could
[167:39] have  made  this  into  a  thousand  dollar 
 course  and  if  I  just  sold  it  passively 
 it  would  have  added  about  10  20  30  000  a
[167:45] month  to  my  monthly  income  which  would 
 have  been  nice  right 
 but  20  people  a  month  would  have  bought
[167:51] it  30  people  a  month  would  have  been 
 helped  by  it 
 again  look  at  the  views
[167:56] so  I'm  sacrificing  like  let's  say  20  or 
 30  000  a  month  by  just  making  this  video
[168:01] and  putting  it  out  there  instead  of  just 
 making  it  a  thousand  dollars  in  people 
 like  you  know  10  20  30  people  would
[168:06] actually  buy  it  per  month  right 
 I'm  sacrificing  like  thirty  thousand 
 dollars  up  front
[168:12] but  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  are 
 going  to  be  helped  by  this  but  probably 
 Millions  let's  say  after  a  few  years
[168:18] this  is  gonna  have  a  few  million  views 
 I'm  quite  sure  of  it 
 of  those  few  million  people  let's  say
[168:25] just  one  hundred  thousand  actually  get 
 some  kind  of  like  positive  results  in 
 real  life
[168:31] and  of  those  100 
 000 
 let's  say  one  thousand  their  lives
[168:36] changed  forever  because  of  this  guide 
 which  isn't  like  totally  crazy  right  if 
 this  got  a  million  views  we  could
[168:41] imagine  that  for  1  000  people  of  that 
 million  their  lives  changed 
 significantly  like  forever  because  of
[168:47] this  guy  because  of  what  they've  learned 
 and  and  you  know  kind  of  like  set  the 
 motion  to  change  their  life  with  making
[168:52] money  and  Financial  Freedom  and 
 everything  right  when  those  people  make 
 500  and  they  see  my  programs  five
[168:58] hundred  dollars 
 they'd  buy  it 
 now  I  sacrificed  about  30k  a  month  let's
[169:03] say  but  when  the  thousand  people  spend 
 five  hundred  dollars  and  I've  just  made 
 half  a  million
[169:11] DC 
 I'm  giving  away  the  secret  in  such  a
[169:16] powerful  way  that  has  hooked  your 
 attention  that  is  growing  my  audience 
 that  is  spreading  this  powerful  word  of
[169:21] mouth  because  people  are  like  holy  [ __ ] 
 comes  as  this  video  is  really  powerful 
 and  the  thousand  people  or  so  who  really
[169:27] like  go  ahead  and  take  advantage  of  this 
 video  of  the  advice  that  I've  given  here 
 who  really  take  the  steps  seriously
[169:34] we'll  they'll  go  ahead  and  buy  my 
 program  which  means  that  although  I 
 could  have  made  30  000  a  month  by
[169:40] selling  this 
 I'm  going  to  actually  make  about  half  a 
 million  from  this  video  alone
[169:48] I  just  have  to  wait  about  five  years  for 
 it 
 half  a  million  I've  just  added  for  30
[169:54] year  old  or  31  year  old  me 
 because  I've  just  worked  on  this  for  the 
 last  two  days  think  about  that
[170:01] powerful  isn't  it  you  want  to  know  how  I 
 got  there 
 give  away  the  secrets
[170:07] you  can  you  can  probably  hopefully  tell 
 I'm  not  holding  any  anything  back  now
[170:12] there's  certainly  like  things  that  I 
 sell  which  would  maybe  add  on  to  this 
 you  know  it's  inside  of  a  Donna  school 
 and  stuff  but  you  can  tell  that  I'm  not
[170:17] sat  here  thinking  oh  no  I  won't  teach 
 them  that  thing  because  you  know  that's 
 something  we've  got  inside  of  a  donor
[170:22] School  my  mindset  is  that  I  know  that 
 this  guide  will  only  actually  go  viral 
 if  I  make  it  as  good  as  possible  with  no
[170:28] holding  back  so  every  secret  that  I  know 
 about  making  money  is  here  I'm  not 
 getting  scared  with  this  idea  of  like  oh
[170:34] but  what  if  like  they  they  use  it  and 
 then  they  don't  need  to  buy  my  product 
 you  know  what  if  they  I  give  them  the
[170:39] really  good  advice  and  then  they  use  it 
 what  if  you  give  them  bad  advice  and
[170:45] then  no  one  uses  it  and  then  no  one  even 
 likes  your  content  and  then  no  one 
 spreads  it  or  if  anything  when  people
[170:50] mention  your  content  they  say  ah  it's 
 crap  it's  like  it's  just  a  waste  of  time 
 when  you  give  away  the  secrets  in  your 
 content  and  you  hold  nothing  back  you
[170:56] just  try  and  give  as  much  of  your 
 valuable  knowledge  that  you  know 
 what  happens  is  that  99  of  the  viewers
[171:04] they  weren't  gonna  buy  your  product 
 anyway  and  they're  still  not  gonna  buy 
 it  but  those  99  will  now  actually  like
[171:11] you  and  you  know  feel  in  some  ways  like 
 indebted  to  you  that  they  can't  help  but
[171:16] to  mention  your  content  to  other  people 
 that's  what  causes  growth  that's  what
[171:22] causes  growth  let  me  just  give  a  quick 
 tip  to  all  of  the  YouTubers  out  there
[171:27] just  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  about  the 
 algorithm  just  like  so  many  guys  are
[171:32] obsessed  with  it  the  algorithm 
 click-through  rate  all  of  this  literally 
 just  forget  about  that  and  just  think  to
[171:37] yourself  let  me  make  a  video  that's  so 
 good  that  the  viewers  will  just  be 
 sharing  it  more  and  more  and  more
[171:43] literally  just  like  make  yourself 
 believe  that  the  only  way  that  you  could 
 get  new  viewers  and  new  subscribers  is
[171:50] if  your  current  viewers  however  small 
 that  amount  is  it's  only  if  those 
 current  viewers  shared  your  video
[171:57] so  your  video  has  to  be  so  good  that  the 
 limited  amount  of  people  who  see  it 
 right  now  are  sharing  it  to  others
[172:04] everyone's  trying  to  play  this  game  and 
 it's  always  so  [ __ ]  embarrassing 
 seeing  like  this  entire  space  of
[172:09] YouTubers  trying  to  grow  and  getting 
 like  look  at  the  metrics  of  like 
 click-through  rate  watch  time  click 
 through  late  watch  that  and  I'm  like  bro
[172:14] just  shut  up  and  just  treat  like  the 
 algorithm  is  just  people  just  treat  them 
 like  people  just  like  make  the  humans
[172:20] who  watch  your  video  so  impressed  that 
 they  just  keep  sharing  it  they  can't 
 stop  mentioning  it  if  you  stop  making  it
[172:26] like  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  money  after  this 
 video  you're  going  to  mention  this 
 you're  gonna  mention  it  because  if  it's
[172:31] helped  you  it  will  probably  help  like 
 this  friend  that  you  end  up  meeting  who 
 probably  don't  want  to  walk  someone
[172:36] through  a  five-hour  conversation  you  can 
 just  send  them  the  link  to  this  video 
 knowing  that  it  worked  for  you  and  it's
[172:41] going  to  work  for  your  future  friends 
 and  if  it  works  for  them  and  you  and  you 
 sort  of  introduce  them  to  something  of 
 value  then  they  accredited  that  value  to
[172:47] you  and  your  status  goes  up  so  it's  a 
 win-win-win  situation  because  of  how
[172:52] good  this  guide  actually  is  now  there's 
 going  to  be  some  insecure  people  who 
 don't  like  the  way  that  I'm  speaking
[172:57] thinking  like  oh  well  you  shouldn't  be 
 saying  good  things  about  yourself 
 because  that  makes  me  feel  even  more 
 secure  they  can  go  [ __ ]  themselves  I
[173:02] know  that  this  is  a  good  guide  you  know 
 the  that  this  is  a  good  guide  you 
 wouldn't  have  put  hours  of  your  time  to
[173:07] watch  this  you  need  this  level  of  like 
 arrogance  to  think  like  this  is  some 
 good  content  that  I've  made  like  all  the
[173:13] little  rubbish  pieces  of  like  content 
 videos  that  I've  I've  watched  so  far 
 they  can't  compare  with  this
[173:19] do  you  see  this  conviction 
 so  now  I  will  go  and  share  my  own  videos
[173:25] I  will  go  and  promote  them  and  I  will 
 like  I'm  going  to  tell  you  to  share  this 
 to  other  people  when  you  meet  someone
[173:30] who  needs  to  make  money  tell  them  just 
 send  them  here  you  don't  need  to  walk 
 them  through  a  five-hour  step-by-step
[173:35] process  I've  set  it  here  when  you 
 introduce  them  to  this  and  it  works  for 
 them  you've  got  another  friend  who's
[173:41] actually  making  money  that  you  can 
 travel  with  now
[173:46] see  how  powerful  this  is 
 I  have  spent  the  last  few  days  making 
 this  and  you  will  share  this  for  me
[173:53] growing  my  business  for  the  next  few 
 years  simply  because  this  guide  is  so
[173:58] good  that  it's  helped  you  and  you 
 literally  just  want  it  to  help  other 
 people  that  you  care  about  you're
[174:03] literally  going  to  help  me  grow  my 
 business  and  I'm  not  even  like  paying 
 you  for  it
[174:09] that's  the  power  when  you  give  away  the 
 secrets  and  you  really  put  in  the  work
[174:14] other  people  will  literally  help  you 
 grow  your  business  for  free  then  the 
 second  part  of  this  is  sell  the
[174:19] implementation  so  it's  give  away  the 
 secrets  sell  the  implementation  we  make
[174:24] content  where  we  literally  just  think  to 
 ourselves  I'm  gonna  expose  everything  in 
 this  Niche  like  you  know  how  to  lose
[174:29] weight  I'm  gonna  make  a  full 
 step-by-step  guide  which  has  got  so  much 
 detail  and  like  I'm  I'm  gonna  make  all
[174:34] the  you  see  the  um  habit  trackers  and 
 everything  else  like  I'm  just  going  to 
 give  as  much  resources  as  much  great
[174:40] advice  as  possible  walk  someone  through 
 this  problem  step  by  step 
 you  give  away  the  secrets  and  then  what
[174:46] you  do  is  your  paid  program  the  package 
 a  lot  of  that  is  about  the 
 implementation  because  90  something
[174:52] percent  of  people  they'll  watch  the 
 video  but  they  won't  actually  take
[174:57] action  on  it  it's  just  the  the  shame  of 
 like  the  DIY  you  know  do  it  yourself 
 like  this  video  is  a  do-it-yourself  a
[175:03] course  is  like  do  it  yourself  in  the 
 case  that  like  the  Creator  just  kind  of 
 makes  it  and  then  he's  out  of  the
[175:08] picture  then  it's  up  to  you  the  consumer 
 to  use  it  90  of  people  have  already  like
[175:13] literally  the  point  that  we're  on  in 
 this  video  95  of  people  have  already 
 clicked  off  you're  genuinely  in  the  top
[175:19] five  percent  of  like  people's  attention 
 spans  and  commitment  to  this
[175:24] that  means  that  barely  five  percent  of 
 people  actually  genuinely  like  use  the
[175:29] content  and  see  results  it's  just  the 
 way  that  it  is 
 now  the  idea  is  that  for  the  guys  who
[175:34] use  it  and  Who  start  you  know  seeing 
 some  kind  of  results  and  start  trusting 
 the  Creator
[175:40] a  lot  of  them  will  want  extra  help  with 
 it  a  lot  of  them  will  want  guidance  on
[175:45] how  to  implement  what  they've  just 
 learned  you  want  to  give  all  the 
 education  away  for  free  but  you  want  to
[175:51] be  available  there  with  your  package  if 
 anyone  wants  like  your  intensive  extra 
 help  and  that's  exactly  what  my  program
[175:57] is  this  is  exactly  what  I'm  suggesting 
 to  you  I'm  telling  you  literally  just 
 like  you  can  see  it's  working  for  me
[176:03] copy  it  make  super  super  helpful  videos 
 that  really  just  help  a  bunch  of  people
[176:08] that  you  know  it's  like  just  free 
 education  that  we're  putting  out  there 
 and  for  the  small  percentage  of  people
[176:14] who  appreciate  that  education  but  also 
 want  your  extra  help  and  they've  got  a 
 bit  of  money  to  spend
[176:19] well  they'll  buy  your  product  we  just  do 
 this  long  term  so  we  start  posting  onto
[176:24] social  media  and  retirement  gets 
 valuable  as  possible  and  we  get  into 
 like  a  nice  Cadence  like  a  system  a
[176:29] schedule  an  upload  schedule  so  on 
 Twitter  you  could  discipline  yourself  to
[176:34] write  three  tweets  a  day  maybe  five 
 tweets  a  day  on  YouTube  you  could 
 discipline  yourself  to  post  once  a  week
[176:39] maybe  twice  a  week  three  times  what 
 depends  on  like  how  long  your  video  is 
 you  can  see  with  these  videos  since 
 they're  so  long  I  go  once  a  week  but  if
[176:45] my  videos  were  only  10  minutes  or  20 
 minutes  I  would  be  posting  every  single 
 day  at  the  same  time
[176:51] once  you've  got  that  consistent  schedule 
 what  we  want  to  do  is  start  to  capture 
 the  sale  so  okay  we're  understanding
[176:57] that  the  people  who  watch  our  content 
 who  are  really  helped  would  want  to 
 potentially  buy  from  us  how  do  we
[177:02] actually  get  the  sale  but  it's  simply 
 with  just  like  putting  the  links  in  the 
 description  as  you've  seen  here  we're
[177:07] going  to  be  creating  the  sales  page  in 
 just  a  second  I'll  give  you  the  link 
 there  you  can  see  like  my  top  Link  in
[177:12] the  description  in  the  Donna  school  and 
 what  we  just  need  to  do  is  a  very 
 specific  term  called  CTA  call  to  action
[177:19] what  this  means  is  inside  of  our  content 
 every  now  and  then  we  will  tell  the
[177:24] viewer  exactly  what  to  do  so  for  the 
 last  few  minutes  I've  mentioned  it  on  a 
 school  to  you  but  not  actually  to  try
[177:30] and  sell  it  to  you  I  didn't  tell  you 
 yeah  go  and  check  out  the  the  link  in 
 the  description  that  go  and  buy  the 
 product  but  rather  I  was  just  using  it
[177:35] as  an  example  because  it's  relevance  for 
 this  but  a  CTA  would  be  for  me  saying 
 okay  you  go  you  want  to  be  an
[177:40] entrepreneur  if  you  want  my  help  with 
 that  go  and  click  the  top  Link  in  the 
 description  description  right  now  that's 
 a  CTA  when  you  say  it  like  that  the
[177:47] amount  of  people  who  will  click  on  the 
 link  Skyrocket  so  you  must  tell  like  the 
 viewer  the  consumer  exactly  what  to  do
[177:53] so  interspersed  in  your  content  let's 
 say  in  these  long  videos  maybe  I'll  say
[177:58] it  twice  in  like  a  shorter  video  like  10 
 minutes  or  20  minutes  long  I'll  just  say 
 it  once  for  literally  about  just  10
[178:04] seconds  and  if  you  want  to  learn  more 
 about  this  go  click  on  the  top  Link  in 
 the  description  that's  Adonis  schools  my 
 paid  program  but  that's  it  for  Twitter
[178:10] for  example  you'd  write  a  few  tweets 
 like  normal  you're  writing  quotes 
 whatever  and  then  maybe  you'll  write
[178:15] like  one  tweet  which  is  about  your  paid 
 product  you  post  it  and  then  you  go  back 
 to  writing  your  normal  tweets  straight
[178:21] after  that  you've  got  to  make  sure  you 
 don't  oversell  you've  got  to  identify 
 that  pretty  much  every  time  you  try  and 
 sell  to  your  audience  it  kind  of  like
[178:28] lowers  how 
 good  or  positive  they  view  you  right  now
[178:33] so  I  could  give  you  like  this  amazing 
 like  this  guide  here  and  if  I  didn't 
 mention  it  on  his  school  even  once  in
[178:39] this  video  you'd  like  me  even  more  the 
 issue  is  like  we  still  we  want  to  make 
 our  money  we  want  to  sell  the  product  so
[178:44] it's  like  you  want  to  use  some  call  to 
 actions  mention  your  product  but  you 
 don't  want  it  to  be  like  too  much  or  too
[178:50] long  you  don't  want  to  have  like  you  see 
 those  sort  of  the  old  school  like  shitty
[178:55] YouTubers  who  do  like  the  sponsorships 
 and  it's  a  two-minute  thing  of  them 
 talking  about  the  the  little  [ __ ] 
 Dollar  Shave  Club  or
[179:01] um  I  don't  know  the  website  or 
 skillshare  or  whatever  the  [ __ ]  they've 
 been  like  sponsored  by  and  they  just 
 waste  like  five  minutes  of  your  time  per
[179:07] video  you've  never  seen  me  do  that 
 [ __ ]  have  you  it's  just  one  it's 
 cringe  and  it's  like  I  think  this  is  a 
 big  part  of  the  reason  why  I  was  able  to
[179:13] grow  so  quickly  was  because  I  very  much 
 undersold  for  a  long  time  and  kept  like
[179:18] my  courses  and  stuff  previously  like 
 very  hidden  I  tried  not  to  like  sell  too 
 much  it's  only  in  the  last  few  months
[179:24] that  I've  wanted  to  like  actually  like 
 bump  up  my  income  level  up  my  business 
 and  now  it's  like  I'm  at  the  phase  of
[179:29] like  wanting  to  slow  down  because  I  want 
 my  audience  to  grow  so  when  you  want 
 your  audience  to  grow  don't  sell
[179:35] anywhere  near  as  much  when  you  want  to 
 make  more  money  then  sell  more  call  to
[179:40] actions  you've  got  to  just  find  this 
 subtle  balance  if  you're  first  starting 
 off  I  would  say  literally  just  put  the
[179:45] call  to  action  in  every  video  but 
 literally  just  five  to  ten  seconds  right 
 at  the  last  and  also  by  the  way I've  got
[179:51] a  paid  program  top  Link  in  the 
 description  that's  it  literally  just 
 that  boom  move  on  to  the  next  here's
[179:56] your actionable  step  for  this  part  of 
 the  guide  you  need  to  decide  if  you  want 
 to  be  a  speaker  or  a  writer  for  your
[180:01] social  media  content  if  you're  unsure 
 just  ask  yourself  do  you  want  to  be  on 
 like  video  like  on  YouTube  or  maybe  just
[180:07] speaking  into  the  mic  on  like  Spotify 
 you  know  podcasts  or  do  you  want  to  for 
 example  write  tweets  or  blogs  or  any  any
[180:13] kind  of  like  keyboard  writing  thing  just 
 make  the  decision  and  you  don't  have  to 
 get  like  two  like  you  know  ah  which  one
[180:19] is  it  going  to  be  I  don't  know  just 
 choose  one  right  now  don't  say  you'll  do 
 both  or  any  [ __ ]  just  choose  one  go
[180:24] all  in  and  then  we're  just  gonna  choose 
 the  social  media  platform  for  it 
 honestly  I  just  say  just  do  YouTube
[180:29] you're  watching  this  long  video  on 
 YouTube  you  use  YouTube  Fairly  regularly 
 if  you  use  for  or  like  Spotify  podcasts
[180:37] twice  as  much  as  you  actually  watch 
 YouTube  then  fair  enough  choose  one  of 
 those  ones  but  in  general  most  of  the
[180:43] people  watching  this  would  be  like 
 fantastic  at  YouTube  Just  because  you've 
 already  watched  so  much  content  here  so
[180:48] you  kind  of  understand  what's  going  on 
 so  you  know  exactly  Which  social  media 
 now  to  go  all  in  now  just  spend  a  second
[180:54] just  to  think  about  the  right  mindset  to 
 posting  we're  just  trying  to  help  our
[181:00] Dream  customer  our  Avatar  if  you  can  go 
 and  have  a  look  at  the  problems  list  if 
 you've  made  one  already  or  if  you're
[181:06] going  to  do  that  very  soon  that  massive 
 problems  list  is  our  content  ideas  and 
 we're  just  going  to  try  and  like  give
[181:11] away  the  secrets  the  the  knowledge  that 
 we  know  about  this  area  step  8  how  to
[181:18] sell  in  this  part  of  the  guide  you  are 
 going  to  learn  the  skill  of  sales  you
[181:23] know  you've  probably  clicked  and  watched 
 those  videos  that  say  like  the  top 
 skills  to  to  learn  how  to  make  money  and
[181:28] they  always  say  sales  but  they  never 
 actually  explain  to  you  what  sales  is  do
[181:33] they  it's  all  these  [ __ ]  [ __ ] 
 YouTubers  will  make  the  same  videos  as 
 always  sales  sales  sales  will  help  you
[181:38] for  every  interaction  but  they  don't 
 even  explain  what  sales  is  sales  is  the
[181:43] skill  of  destroying  someone  else's 
 limiting  beliefs  about  your  product
[181:48] I'll  say  that  again  you  must  listen 
 sales  is  the  skill  for  destroying 
 someone  else's  limiting  beliefs  like
[181:54] their  objections  their  problems  we're 
 going  to  set  you  up  to  learn  this  skill 
 and  to  literally  like  use  it  in  live
[182:01] video  calls  with  people  who  will  like 
 see  your  content  and  book  calls  with  you 
 so  this  is  what  we  need  in  this  section
[182:07] we  need  a  way  for  people  to  book  video 
 calls  with  us  using  a  link  that  we'll
[182:12] put  inside  of  our  social  media  content 
 you  know  like  our  social  media  bio 
 YouTube  descriptions  with  the  bio  we
[182:18] want  a  link  there  that  when  someone 
 Clicks  in  they  can  see  like  a  calendar 
 like  our  schedule  and  they  can  book
[182:24] video  call  slots  with  us  we'll  see  that 
 we've  got  like  a  notification  okay  sweet 
 we've  got  a  call  with  Jack  today  at  five
[182:30] we'll  come  to  our  computer  we'll  start 
 the  call  we'll  end  up  speaking  to  them 
 about  like  you  know  what  they're
[182:35] interested  in  with  the  topic  so  it's 
 like  let's  say  if  you  sold  like  a 
 fitness  program  it  would  hype  it  all  up
[182:40] yeah  if  you  know  Fitness  is  really 
 awesome  when  you  get  muscle  it  feels  so 
 awesome  so  what  are  your  fitness  goals 
 I'll  tell  you  how  to  like  actually  sell
[182:46] something  to  someone  and  then  you  can 
 them  to  buy  your  product  straight  after 
 the  call  you'll  send  them  a  payment  link
[182:52] that  you  can  set  up  for  free  and  that 
 they'll  be  able  to  like  buy  and  you 
 start  work  with  them  so  the  first  thing
[182:57] we  need  to  do  here  is  we  need  to  set  up 
 that  sort  of  video  calling  system  the 
 booking  system  there's  a  software  which
[183:02] is  very  well  known  it's  called  calendly 
 I'll  link  it  in  the  in  the  description 
 so  I'll  go  and  find  a  guide  on  how  to
[183:09] set  up  calendly  you  can  go  find  like  a 
 different  software  if  you  want  to  this 
 is  the  one  that  I've  always  used  this  is
[183:14] the  one  that  I've  seen  other  big 
 YouTubers  use  so  it's  just  the  one  that 
 I'd  recommend  let's  say  you've  got  that 
 set  up  you've  got  the  calendly  set  up
[183:19] people  can  book  a  call  with  you  now  and 
 you  put  that  calendar  link  on  your 
 social  media  Post  in  the  description  the
[183:25] Twitter  bio  the  YouTube  channel  profile 
 thing  now  you  just  keep  posting  the
[183:30] valuable  content  that  you  are  on  social 
 media  tell  people  to  book  the  call  with 
 you  if  they're  interested  in  like  the
[183:36] high  ticket  like  package  that  you  offer 
 and  you  should  hopefully  very  soon  see
[183:42] your  first  call  booked  this  means  that 
 you're  about  to  go  on  to  like  maybe  your 
 first  ever  sales  call  which  was  it's
[183:48] quite  an  exhilarating  experience  if 
 you've  ever  called  approach  to  women  in 
 public  like  you  know  or  at  night  time  or
[183:54] something  you  know  in  clubs  or  parties 
 it's  a  very  similar  experience  to  that 
 like  your  heartbeat  will  go  because
[183:59] you're  like  getting  girls  and  sales  is 
 the  exact  same  thing  by  the  way this  is 
 why  most  guys  were  good  at  sales  will
[184:05] get  girls  most  guys  who  are  good  at  like 
 picking  up  girls  speaking  to  them  pick 
 up  artists  type  of  stuff  they're  very
[184:10] good  at  sales  as  well  now  I'll  walk  you 
 through  how  to  sell  I'm  not  a  master 
 salesman  like  at  all  I  only  know  like
[184:16] the  basics  but  honestly  the  basics  is 
 more  than  enough  because  you  don't  want 
 to  go  like  hard  sales  mode  to  the  point
[184:22] that  people  think  that  you're  acting 
 like  a  scammer  or  sleazy  or  anything 
 these  days  the  sort  of  softer  sales
[184:28] approach  Works  probably  better  so  you 
 hop  onto  the  call  you  see  their  little 
 screen  open  up  you've  got  yours  on  and
[184:34] you  literally  just  speak  to  them  like 
 you  take  an  interest  in  them  and  it's 
 Matthew  for  example  is  that  oh  Matthew
[184:39] looking  also  what  what  brought  you  to  my 
 um  my  call  today  Matthew  will  say  oh 
 yeah  you  know  like  I  saw  your  video  on
[184:45] like  Fitness  it  was  really  good  so 
 you'll  and  you  just  start  speaking  to 
 him  literally  just  about  his  goals  okay
[184:50] so  yeah  if  you've  got  fitness  goals  like 
 what  do  you  desire  with  that  what  do  you 
 want  with  Fitness  and  I  say  yeah  I  just
[184:55] want  to  lose  like  a  little  bit  off  my 
 stomach  and  stuff  you  say  okay  what  have 
 you  tried  so  far  and  he  says  oh  yeah  I
[185:00] tried  this  diet  and  this  diet  and  this 
 diet  but  it  didn't  I  didn't  really  work 
 then  straight  away  you  get  something  in
[185:06] your  mind  where  you're  thinking  oh  yeah 
 I  know  why  it  didn't  work  it's  because 
 of  this  like  because  you  could  kind  of 
 understand  your  own  Niche  your  own  topic
[185:12] their  their  pains  and  problems  so  you 
 teach  them  a  little  something  you  say 
 like  oh  yeah  you  know  yeah  it's  hard  for
[185:17] that  diet  to  work  because  you  probably 
 didn't  have  this  did  you  and  he's  like 
 oh  no  I  didn't  actually  you  teach  him
[185:22] something  so  he's  like  he  kind  of  thinks 
 oh  damn  this  guy  is  really  an  expert 
 then  you  start  to  just  really  hype  up
[185:27] how  good  the  dream  result  is  gonna  be  so 
 you  don't  actually  want  to  tell  them
[185:33] like  oh  like  yeah  you  know  losing 
 weight's  so  awesome  losing  weights  like 
 this  no  no  it's  not  about  losing  weight
[185:39] the  dream  result  is  that  he  doesn't  have 
 that  fat  anymore  the  dream  result  is
[185:44] that  his  shirt  fits  and  he's  got  more  of 
 an  aesthetic  taper  that  like  women 
 notice  and  he  gets  more  likes  on  Tinder
[185:51] that's  the  dream  results 
 that's  what  you  want  to  be  talking  about
[185:56] how  awesome  it  is  chances  are  you  might 
 even  have  their  dream  results  so  if  it's 
 for  Fitness  if  I  was  doing  like  Fitness
[186:01] sales  calls  I'd  say  like  bro  I've  been 
 in  a  relationship  for  the  past  few  years 
 but  when  I  was  single  when  I  would  make
[186:07] a  new  Tinder  account  I  honestly  just 
 because  of  my  physique  I  would  get
[186:13] if  you  wouldn't  even  believe  me  I  would 
 get  honestly  more  than  20  to  30  likes 
 per  day  like  it  was  like  a  super  male
[186:19] supermodel  level  just  because  of  my 
 physique  literally  just  because  of  that 
 I  don't  think  my  face  is  like  overly
[186:24] attractive  or  anything  just  because  I'm 
 good  at  taking  shirtless  pictures  where 
 like  I  look  like  a  like  a  [ __ ]  like
[186:29] Chad  in  a  certain  way  and  it's  it's  nice 
 it's  nice  because  growing  up  is  the  guy 
 who  never  really  got  the  attention  from
[186:35] the  girls  this  really  meant  a  lot  to  me 
 for  a  long  time  when  I  say  this  to  him 
 and  he's  literally  thinking  like  oh  yeah
[186:40] yeah  it  must  be  nice  supposed  to  be  nice 
 he's  gonna  do  anything  possible  now  to 
 go  and  experience  that  so  when  you
[186:45] mention  to  him  and  so  let  me  tell  you 
 about  my  package  in  my  package  I'm  gonna 
 get  you  to  this  result  in  three  months
[186:51] it's  a  three  month  thing  we're  gonna  do 
 this  or  it's  a  one  month  thing  whatever 
 it  is  right  you  tell  your  package  we're 
 gonna  do  weekly  calls  we're  gonna  do
[186:56] this  we're  gonna  do  this  I'll  even  give 
 you  this  I'll  give  you  this  I  literally 
 I'll  give  you  this  this  which  means  that
[187:01] right  here  right  now  that  pain  that 
 you're  experiencing  you  know  that  like 
 that  sort  of  feeling  of  insecurity  it 
 will  go  forever  not  only  will  I  work
[187:07] with  you  till  we  see  the  results  that 
 you  want  but  I'll  also  set  up  the  system 
 and  train  you  in  a  way  that  you  will 
 maintain  this  progress  for  the  rest  of
[187:13] your  life  we  will  change  the  beliefs 
 that  you  have  so  that  you  will  always 
 have  that  tight  shirt  around  your
[187:18] stomach  that  it'll  never  be  like  flabby 
 anymore  that  you'll  always  be  able  to 
 attract  more  women
[187:24] you  down 
 ready  to  get  started  the  package  is  2500 
 the  package  is  a  thousand  dollars
[187:30] whatever  you  want  to  say 
 at  that  moment  quite  a  few  people  will 
 be  like  oh  oh  I  didn't  realize  oh  I
[187:36] didn't  realize  you  were  selling  right  I 
 thought  it  was  going  to  be  free  your 
 scammer  like  10  of  people  are  just  going
[187:41] to  be  absolute  dumbasses  they'll  be  like 
 that  maybe  about  70  I  don't  know  what 
 the  percentage  but  like  a  certain  number
[187:46] of  people  will  be  like  oh  yeah  that's 
 too  expensive  for  me  you  can  try  and 
 sell  them  harder  those  people  who  say
[187:51] it's  too  expensive 
 if  I'm  honest  for  me  personally  I 
 wouldn't  try  and  like  sell  harder  to
[187:57] someone  who  just  says  like  oh  yeah  yeah 
 it's  too  expensive  I  don't  know  if  I  can 
 afford  it  whatever  what  you  want  is 
 maybe  the  five  to  ten  percent  of  people
[188:03] who  will  literally  just  be  like  yep  done 
 let's  go  that's  it
[188:08] boom 
 do  you  hang  up  the  call  you  tell  them 
 obviously  yes  we  are  selling  you  the 
 payment  link  it  will  begin  straight  away
[188:13] I'm  so  excited  you're  gonna  get  this 
 you're  gonna  get  this  you're  gonna  get 
 this  you're  gonna  like  you  know  feel 
 confident  in  your  body  which  when  you
[188:18] think  about  it  how  awesome  that  is  that 
 most  people  even  don't  ever  get  to  the 
 point  where  they  feel  even  nice  in  their
[188:23] own  skin  and  we're  gonna  get  that  for 
 you 
 I'll  send  you  the  payment  link  after 
 this  you  end  the  call  you  create  what's
[188:29] called  a  stripe  payment  link  you  can 
 just  uh  YouTube  it  I'll  find  you  a 
 YouTube  I'll  do  everything  for  you  but
[188:35] I'll  find  you  the  YouTube  tutorial  on 
 how  to  set  up  a  stripe  payment  link  I'll 
 link  it  below  and 
 you  just  set  it  up  it's  very  easy  it's
[188:41] like  free  to  do  with  stripe  stripe  takes 
 like  a  one  up  two  percent  or  whatever  it 
 is  from  your  payment  which  is 
 unfortunate  but  like  you  don't  actually
[188:47] pay  for  Stripes  so  it's  kind  of  nice  so 
 whatever 
 um  and  then  you  just  send  that  link  over 
 to  them  maybe  on  email  or  phone  number
[188:52] whatever  they  pay  for  it  and  you  begin 
 working  with  them  now  that's  the  process 
 of  a  sales  call  it's  a  very  exhilarating
[188:58] part  of  business  honestly  it's  probably 
 like  the  most  exciting  part  of  a 
 business  is  sales  because  you  are  there
[189:05] like  one  to  one  like  almost  hand-to-hand 
 combat  like  immediate  feedback  Flow 
 State  trying  to  sell  this  person  to  your
[189:11] thing  it's  like  every  sentence  you  say 
 every  little  facial  detail  that  you  make 
 slightly  changes  there  but  there
[189:18] um percentage  chance  of  buying  from  you 
 so  at  first  it's  literally  just  about 
 volume  just  get  on  to  100  sales  calls  no
[189:25] problem  but  soon  you're  going  to  want  to 
 level  your  skill  up  which  we'll  talk 
 about  in  The  Next  Step  but  first  your
[189:30] actionable  step  for  this  part  of  the 
 guide  is  to  set  up  your  calendly  booking 
 page  you  can  use  whatever  software  I'm
[189:36] not  affiliated  with  calendly  whatever 
 you  can  use  whatever  software  I  just 
 like  colored  leads  to  my  one  that  I've 
 always  used  is  the  one  that  I  understand
[189:41] and  I  do  think  it's  really  nice  set  up 
 the  calendly  page  also  set  up  your
[189:46] stripe  payment  link  and  then  add  your 
 calendly  link  not  the  straight  one  but 
 the  currently  link  to  your  social  media
[189:52] profiles  and  from  now  on  when  you  make 
 social  media  content  every  now  and  then 
 just  very  quickly  mention  that  if
[189:58] they're  interested  in  like  a  high  ticket 
 or  like  you  know  package  a  paid  package 
 to  get  to  their  dream  results  remember
[190:04] the  dream  result  isn't  like  weight  loss 
 it's  to  be  skinny  there's  a  difference
[190:09] right  the  dream  thing  that  they  want 
 isn't  to  go  through  the  progress  It's  to 
 be  at  the  end  point  so  you  mentioned
[190:15] that  in  every  video  from  now  on  oh  yeah 
 go  and  book  a  call  with  me  let's  see  if 
 you're  a  good  fit  boom  step  nine  more
[190:21] better  new  this  is  a  phrase  by  Alexa 
 MOSI  that  has  served  me  really  well  so  I
[190:27] wanted  to  just  teach  you  it  more  better 
 new  now  this  is  what  most  beginners  do
[190:32] when  they  start  with  their  business 
 they  make  tiny  bit  of  progress  in 
 setting  up  like  maybe  let's  say  for  you
[190:37] you've  set  up  the  calendly  okay  you've 
 set  up  like  you  know  the  pro  the 
 problems  your  customer  is  going  to  have
[190:42] the  solutions  social  media  whatever 
 you've  set  some  stuff  up  you  made  some 
 progress  and  before  they  know  it  they've 
 clicked  on  another  video  that  said
[190:48] actually  there's  a  better  business  model 
 you  can  go  try  agency  instead 
 copywriting  YouTube  there's  just
[190:53] different  businesses  and  they  go  and  try 
 something  new  over  and  over  and  over 
 again 
 most  people  at  this  stage  they  will
[191:00] suffer  and  stay  in  the  state  of  just 
 staying  like  broke  because  they're 
 addicted  to  new  they're  addicted  to  new
[191:07] things  new  business  models  new  ways  of 
 doing  things  you  don't  deserve  to  start 
 doing  anything  new  right  now  you  don't
[191:13] need  anything  new  any  business  model  can 
 work  the  idea  that  you've  got  will  work 
 but  you  need  to  exhaust  more  and  better
[191:19] first  what  this  means  is  that  there  is  a 
 step-by-step  process  of  the  things  that 
 you  should  focus  on  and  new  doing
[191:25] something  new  is  at  the  end  of  it  right 
 now  what  we  want  you  to  focus  on  is  more 
 doing  more  of  the  exact  same  thing  that
[191:32] simply  just  means  do  more  volume  so  if 
 you  look  at  your  package  you  know  that 
 massive  Solutions  list  and  we  created  it
[191:38] into  this  bundle 
 what  if  you  just  offer  more  what  if  you 
 literally  just  did  more  right  now  you
[191:43] want  to  get  more  sales  you  want  to  get 
 like  your  customer  better  results  so 
 that  you  know  they  actually  genuinely
[191:48] change  their  lives  and  they  thank  you 
 for  it  and  they  make  the  testimonial  and 
 the  review  and  you  feel  better  because
[191:53] you  know  that  you're  you'll  think  that's 
 results  right 
 you  know  a  really  fast  easy  way  to  get
[191:58] them  more  results  is  to  just  add  more  of 
 what  you've  already  got  inside  of  your 
 package  for  example  if  you've  told  them
[192:04] you'll  do  a  weekly  call  with  them 
 what  if  you  just  did  two  calls  a  week  or 
 three  calls  a  week  and  again  this  is
[192:11] where  like  so  many  young  guys  will  stop 
 it  like  their  brains  will  fart  and 
 they'll  say  like  oh  but  wait  that's  like
[192:16] that's  a  you  know  that's  that's  more 
 time  I'm  not  trading  time  for  money  I'm 
 like  bro  again  are  you  willing  to  work
[192:22] hard  to  make  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  money  yes  or 
 no  you  said  yes  every  single  time  have 
 you  not  so  why  not  work  harder  to  make
[192:28] more  money  right  now  if  this  is  your  big 
 goal  in  like  you  know  this  is  like  the 
 thing  you're  focused  on  are  you  spending
[192:33] like  pretty  much  all  day  thinking  about 
 money  anyway  just  be  honest  you're 
 probably  all  right  so  either  you  can  do
[192:38] more  which  will  actually  get  you  money 
 or  you  can  keep  coping  watching  [ __ ] 
 take  videos  Hamza  [ __ ]  videos  right
[192:44] so  do  you  want  to  make  more  money  right 
 so  you  may  as  well  work  just  do  more  of 
 the  the  valuable  things  so  for  example
[192:50] change  the  weekly  call  to  three  times 
 what  if  you  just  did  something  crazy 
 what  if  you  did  literally  a  call  every
[192:57] single  day  just  a  little  WhatsApp  one 
 you've  got  like  it  sounds  crazy  but  like 
 you've  got  the  time  for  it  right  you
[193:02] could  literally  call  someone  on  Whatsapp 
 for  10  minutes  a  day  and  you'd  actually 
 have  the  time  for  it  now  imagine  that
[193:07] that's  gonna  get  you  like  twice  as  many 
 sales  why  wouldn't  you  do  it  if  this  is 
 the  biggest  thing  in  your  life  right  now
[193:12] now  again  you  want  to  get  to  the  point 
 where  you  can  have  like  a  bit  more 
 passive  income  and  freedom  and  less  time
[193:17] involved  in  business  I  understand  that 
 that's  a  nice  goal  to  have  but  right  now 
 at  these  earlier  levels  you  really  need
[193:24] way  more  momentum  and  you'll  get  that 
 from  just  offering  more  like  like 
 craving  more  active  income  instead  of
[193:29] passive  income  in  the  future  you  can 
 minimize  this  and  and  you  know  kind  of 
 like  turn  it  down  okay  I'll  do  one  call
[193:34] a  week  I'll  change  my  package  I'll  do 
 this  sorry  if  you  got  a  current  customer 
 you're  like  sorry  I  can  give  you  a 
 refund  if  you  want  but  I'm  only  gonna  do
[193:40] one  call  that's  like  in  the  future  when 
 money  doesn't  feel  important  to  you  but 
 right  now  you're  watching  this  because 
 it  does  so  you  may  as  well  work  more  so
[193:46] offer  the  the  two  times  weekly  call  or 
 the  three  times  calls  or  the  daily
[193:51] texting 
 add  more  to  it  and  then  that's  just  your 
 package  how  about  for  your  marketing  for
[193:56] the  the  content  you're  making  to  get 
 customers  you're  making  content  on 
 Twitter  on  YouTube  what  if  you  just  made
[194:02] more  what  if  you  posted  more  often  right 
 now  if  you're  posting  on  YouTube  three 
 times  a  week  why  not  just  scale  that  up
[194:07] to  four  times  five  times  and  this  is 
 where  the  cope  will  come  in  and  people 
 will  say  oh  no  but  I've  got  school
[194:12] because  I've  got  this  I've  got  this 
 chances  are  you  do  actually  have  the 
 time  to  do  more  it's  just  that  you're
[194:17] wasting  like  at  least  an  hour  a  day  I  at 
 least  waste  an  hour  a  day  so  if  you  tell 
 me  you  don't  waste  an  hour  a  day  I  know
[194:22] it's  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  because  I'm  I'm 
 like  a  boasting  whatever  but  but  I'm
[194:27] very  [ __ ]  good  at  keeping  my  calendar 
 in  check  that  my  phone's  been  on 
 airplane  mode  do  not  disturb  my  every
[194:32] minute  is  tracked  of  my  day  I  still 
 probably  waste  about  an  hour  a  day  so  if 
 you  tell  me  that  you  you  don't  I  don't
[194:37] believe  you  so  there  you've  just  got  an 
 hour  boom  post  more  content
[194:42] tweet  more 
 when  you  do  more  you  get  more  it's 
 literally  it's  just  as  simple  as  that
[194:47] the  business  world  doesn't  work  the  same 
 as  like  as  building  muscle  there  isn't 
 diminishing  returns  and  this  is  actually
[194:52] more  kind  of  like  linear  or  even 
 exponential  like  if  you  post  more  on 
 social  media  you  will  simply  just  grow
[194:58] more  you  will  get  more  results  it's  as 
 simple  as  that 
 if  you  add  more  to  your  package  of  like
[195:03] the  things  that  are  actually  valuable 
 for  example  the  live  calls  with  you 
 you'll  simply  just  get  more  sales  so
[195:09] just  start  with  that  then  once  you  feel 
 like  you've  maxed  out  the  volume  that 
 you  could  do  and  you're  actually  working 
 pretty  much  like  all  day  and  you're
[195:15] thinking  yeah  I  couldn't  post  more  I'm 
 literally  posting  every  day  or  I  do 
 really  long  videos  like  this  one  and  I 
 post  weekly  or  maybe  twice  a  week  for
[195:21] example  you  can't  add  more  that's  when 
 you  start  to  consider  okay  better  how  do 
 you  do  the  current  things  but  better  at
[195:28] a  higher  skill  level  so  for  this  you 
 could  look  at  your  package  at  every 
 little  bit  that  you've  got  in  there  you
[195:33] know  if  you've  got  the  course  you've  got 
 the  live  calls  you've  got  their  daily 
 accountability  you've  got  this  and  now 
 you  could  be  thinking  okay  how  do  I  make
[195:39] every  little  part  of  this  better  and 
 more  effective  at  getting  the  customer
[195:44] the  results  that  they  want  so  maybe  you 
 look  at  your  course  that  you've  made 
 like  if  you've  made  a  collection  of
[195:49] videos  for  example  training  videos  and 
 you  look  at  them  and  you  think  you  know 
 what  this  is  a  20  minute  video  I  could
[195:54] probably  say  this  in  about  10  minutes 
 that  probably  means  that  like  more 
 people  will  watch  through  it  because  you
[195:59] know  some  people  end  up  clicking  off 
 because  it's  too  long  whatever  I  could 
 make  this  video  better  this  um this
[196:04] template  that  I  made  I  could  make  this 
 better  the  live  calls  that  I  have  with 
 them  you  know  what  sometimes  my  focus
[196:09] Falls  away  maybe  I  could  meditate  for 
 five  minutes  first 
 maybe  you  can  even  make  the  sales
[196:15] process  better  so  you  can  go  and  study 
 books  on  sales  level  up  your  scale  of 
 sales  to  know  what  like  a  couple  more
[196:20] like  tactics  that  you  can  use  and  then 
 you  can  actually  bring  that  to  your 
 sales  calls  making  them  better  and
[196:25] you're  more  likely  to  get  money  then  you 
 can  also  make  your  social  media  content 
 better  you  can  learn  more  things  about
[196:31] YouTube  about  like  leveling  up  your 
 thumbnails  about  your  speaking  skill 
 about  storytelling  maybe  you're  you're
[196:36] more  on  Twitter  so  you  learn  how  to  like 
 grow  on  Twitter  more  you  learn  about  how 
 to  um write  in  a  more  persuasive  way  you
[196:42] see  that  there's  so  much  that  you  can  do 
 for  what  you've  got  right  now  before  you
[196:47] should  ever  consider  doing  something  new 
 so  if  you've  got  to  this  point  if  I 
 could  force  you  to  do  something  which
[196:52] hopefully  that  you're  going  to  take  that 
 seriously  if  I'm  telling  you  okay  then 
 please  just  do  this  forget  anything  new
[196:58] the  next  time  you  click  on  a  random 
 video  and  Andrew  Tate's  there  talking 
 about  yeah  this  business  model  is  really
[197:03] good  then  you  click  on  the  next  one  and 
 this  one  and  this  one  you're  not  going 
 to  make  any  progress  doing  that  right
[197:08] now  forget  about  the  concept  of  anything 
 new  stay  dedicated  committed  to  this  one 
 path  that  that  you've  got  and  just  do
[197:14] more  of  it  and  do  it  better  I  think 
 there  isn't  a  better  time  for  me  to  now
[197:19] finally  like  officially  plug  Adonis 
 school  to  you  this  is  what  I've  wanted 
 with  the  Donna  school  it's  it's  a  place
[197:25] for  young  men  to  come  in  and  gain  an 
 education  for  like  essentially  for  the
[197:30] real  world  instead  of  the  way  that  the 
 education  system  set  us  up  with  and  you 
 learn  things  about  entrepreneurship
[197:35] money  investing  Fitness  relationships 
 all  these  things  but  I  think  the  most 
 valuable  part  is  that  it's  a  community
[197:40] of  guys  who  are  doing  this  together  and 
 so  I  keep  seeing  every  day  that  there's 
 a  new  guy  who's  who's  been  doing  like
[197:45] weekly  calls  with  another  guy  they've 
 been  holding  each  other  accountable  and 
 I  think  that's  like  some  of  the  best
[197:50] parts  not  only  that 
 I  give  like  a  lot  of  lessons  there  so
[197:55] this  video  here  that  you're  watching  has 
 been  a  Adonis  School  lecture  over  about 
 two  weeks  every  day  I've  been  in  there
[198:01] we  have  about  a  10  hour  lecture  on  money 
 we  have  a  five  or  six  hour  lecture  on
[198:07] Willpower  plus  every  course  that  I've 
 made  plus  live  calls  from  teachers  that 
 I've  hired  it's  it's  a  place  that's  like
[198:13] going  to  the  top  it's  a  very  good  place 
 so  this  is  just  me  Shilling  it  for  the 
 first  time  and  like  official  time  in
[198:18] this  video  go  click  the  top  Link  in  the 
 description  if  you're  interested  in 
 getting  this  community  at  on  a  school 
 making  money  online  step  12  spending
[198:25] money  when  you  follow  this  part  of  the 
 guide  the  benefit  you're  going  to  get  is 
 that  soon  when  you  go  to  the  store  you
[198:30] won't  ever  need  to  look  at  the  price  for 
 pretty  much  anything  again  and  that's  a 
 really  calming  experience
[198:37] you'll  also  be  able  to  buy  some  things 
 that  other  people  will  look  at  and 
 you'll  get  some  sense  of  status  with 
 that  if  that's  the  thing  that  you  care
[198:42] about  but  more  importantly  you  will  get 
 the  freedom  that  you've  desired  all  this
[198:47] time  you'll  be  able  to  invest  in  your 
 growth  by  buying  the  right  things  at  the 
 right  time  which  many  other  people  don't
[198:53] do  you  see  the  average  guy  but  it  gets  a 
 little  bit  of  money  but  then  he  wastes 
 it  on  low  quality  status  symbols  he  gets
[198:58] a  car  on  finance  he  he  goes  and  eats 
 like  take  away  or  something  and  he  has 
 nothing  to  really  show  for  it  whereas
[199:04] for  us 
 we're  going  to  go  down  a  different  path 
 we're  going  to  use  money  to  put  our
[199:09] trajectory  on  even  more  of  a  fast  track 
 so  there  are  five  levels  to  spending
[199:14] money  five  things  that  you  can  spend 
 your  money  on  this  is  in  my  opinion  and 
 I'm  sure  everyone  else  will  disagree  but
[199:20] I  will  just  tell  you  about  the  things 
 that  have  served  me  and  if  you're 
 anything  like  me  then  your  experiences 
 will  probably  be  similar  level  zero
[199:26] material  objects  for  status  this  is  the 
 car  the  watch  the  fancy  Apartments  the
[199:35] fancy  branded  clothing  this  can  be  fine 
 and  you  will  get  like  status  by  buying
[199:40] this  so  for  example  if  you've  been 
 leveling  up  your  business  and  you  go  and 
 buy  like  the  Rolex  that  you've  really
[199:45] wanted  or  you  know  you're  going  upgrade 
 your  wardrobe  you  will  get  noticed  more 
 you  will  get  more  validation  and
[199:51] acceptance  from  more  people  that's  100 
 the  case  the  reason  why  I'd  argue  that
[199:56] that  isn't  so  great  is  that  in  general 
 only  unintelligent  people  validate  you
[200:01] when  you  buy  some  kind  of  status  object 
 the  kind  of  person  who's  actually  on 
 your  level  when  you  think  about  the  kind
[200:07] of  thinking  that  you  do  the  values  that 
 you  have  the  amount  of  character  that 
 you've  become  the  truth  is  that  only
[200:13] people  who  are  far  below  you  in  terms  of 
 intelligence  and  values  will  actually 
 look  up  at  you  when  you've  got  like  the
[200:19] Branded  T-shirts  they  it  absolutely  will 
 happen  more  like  like  degenerate  women
[200:24] will  want  to  have  sex  with  you  but  when 
 you  take  a  step  back 
 and  you  think  to  yourself  okay  I'm  not
[200:29] gonna  just  indulge  in  my  monkey  like 
 little  monkey  impulse  here  is  it
[200:34] actually  a  good  thing  is  it  a  good  thing 
 that  more 
 common  people  like  you  now
[200:41] it  can  be  nice  to  feel  socially  involved 
 I'm  not  saying  you've  got  to  you  know 
 hate  everyone  or  anything  but
[200:46] it's  usually  it's  just  unintelligent 
 people  who  will  like  you  more  because
[200:51] you've  bought  something  that  they  think 
 is  expensive  which  elevates  your  status 
 in  their  eyes  what  I  have  found  which  is
[200:57] very  interesting  which  the  people  who 
 buy  these  objects  don't  speak  about  the 
 most  intelligent  people  that  I  know
[201:03] never  validated  me  with  every  single 
 material  purchase  I  ever  had  when  I  got
[201:09] like  the  fancy  apartment  in  Dubai  which 
 was  ten  thousand  dollars  a  month  when 
 I've  had  like  the  fancy  clothing  the  400
[201:15] shirt  whatever  like  obviously  there's 
 levels  to  this  and  some  some  rich  guy 
 might  be  watching  this  they  get  off  400 
 sure  that's  not  even  that  expensive  but
[201:21] you  know  this  it's  all  relevant  right 
 the  intelligent  people  that  I  know  never
[201:26] validated  me  for  it  and  yet  when  I 
 downscaled  my  life 
 when  I  was  making  twenty  thousand
[201:32] dollars  a  month  and  I  moved  back  in  with 
 my  parents  so  that  I  could  focus  on  my 
 business  every  intelligent  person  that  I
[201:38] knew  on  WhatsApp  they  actually  validated 
 me  for  it  it's  so  interesting  because 
 what  I  found  is  truly  like  smart  people
[201:45] know  exactly  the  issues  with  spending  on 
 like  material  objects  that  we  know  that
[201:51] it's  like  this  it's  almost  like  this 
 low-level  desire  that  you're  really 
 hoping  that  someone  else  like  looks  at
[201:56] you  now  you  can  certainly  do  it  and 
 there's  always  going  to  be  a  Coke  that  a 
 lot  of  people  will  have  thinking  no  no 
 Hamza  I  really  like  the  watch  but  I
[202:03] really  want  that  car  absolutely  if 
 there's  something  that  you've  got  of 
 this  massive  interest  in  and  you  really
[202:08] are  like  super  super  interested  in  this 
 certain  car  then  like  who  am  I  to  tell
[202:14] you  to  go  otherwise  if  that's  what  you 
 truly  truly  desire  I  would  just  ask  you
[202:19] to  take  a  step  back  and  really  just  be 
 honest  to  yourself  is  it  for  yourself  is
[202:25] it  actually  because  you  genuinely  want 
 that  or  is  it  as  pathetic  as  like  you 
 literally  just  want  to  see  someone's
[202:30] head  turned  towards  you  and  that's  what 
 will  make  it  all  worthwhile  because  most
[202:35] of  the  guys  who  are  really  obsessed  with 
 a  certain  material  object  like  the  watch
[202:40] or  the  car  or  the  apartment  or  whatever 
 for  most  of  them  it  isn't  about  the 
 utility  of  the  thing  it  isn't  about  the
[202:46] real  value  of  the  thing  it's  kind  of 
 like  a  Band-Aid  over  the  childhood 
 trauma  of  like  a  lack  of  condition  like
[202:52] unconditional  love  it's  so  sad  to  say 
 that  but  it  is  the  case  and  I  don't  mean 
 to  like  psychoanalyze  anyone  but  it  is
[202:58] the  case  that's  why  we  Chase  these 
 material  objects  because  we  just  want  to 
 feel  welcomed  in  our  society  which  is
[203:03] really  sad  because  you  probably  spent 
 like  a  month  of  your  life  just  trying  to 
 get  that  watch  and  now  you've  got  some
[203:08] dumb  girl  who's  more  into  when  the 
 actual  girl  who's  on  your  level  who's  an 
 intelligent  woman  who's  well  educated
[203:14] she's  gonna  think  that  you're  kind  of 
 like  insecure  and  lame  for  having  that
[203:19] would  you  want  the  female  equivalent  of 
 you  would  you  want  the  woman  who  gets  a
[203:24] breast  job  because  more  guys  will  turn 
 towards  her  then  why  would  you  be  the 
 guy  with  the  car  it's  the  same  thing  the
[203:29] truth  is  that  the  spiritual  people  are 
 absolutely  right  when  you  see  this  like
[203:34] two  kinds  of  people  in  society  there's 
 the  material  people  just  the  normal 
 person  average  guy  who  goes  into  the
[203:39] nine-to-five  job  but  also  the 
 entrepreneurs  the  rich  guys  the  athletes 
 the  people  who  are  like  here  in  this
[203:44] real  world  trying  to  make  money  and 
 success  and  then  there's  those  spiritual 
 people  who've  got  a  lot  of  faith  a  lot
[203:49] of  belief  who  have  got  a  lot  of 
 alignment  to  their  values  and  for 
 example  it's  like  who  you  could  imagine
[203:54] if  you've  seen  Wim  Hof  or  David  dadiff 
 the  author  of  the  way  the  superior  man 
 or  any  deeply  religious  people  like
[203:59] imams  for  example  these  people  are 
 absolutely  right  when  they  tell  you  that 
 these  material  desires  won't  amount  to
[204:04] anything  other  than  actual  pain  and  and 
 frustration  in  life  that  the  true  path
[204:09] to  happiness  and  Enlightenment  and  like 
 sort  of  a  positive  life  experience
[204:14] doesn't  come  from  random  objects  that 
 you  can  buy  from  someone  else  but  it 
 comes  through  like  your  alignments  or
[204:19] something  that  that  feels  important  to 
 you  maybe  God  maybe  love  maybe  liked 
 there's  a  lot  of  spiritual  people  say
[204:24] like  we  are  all  beings  of  light  and 
 that's  what  we  should  pursue  so  if  you 
 are  absolutely  certain  there  is  some
[204:29] material  object  that  close  the  car 
 whatever  that  is  at  you  you  are  like 
 yeah  100  of  buying  that  what  I  would  say
[204:34] is  just  limit  it  to  about  five  to  ten 
 percent  of  your  profits  so  if  you 
 genuinely  profit  not  just  get  money  in
[204:40] but  profit  from  your  business  like  minus 
 your  expenses  of  business  if  your  profit 
 is  like  10  000  a  month  you  could  maybe
[204:47] get  like  a  thousand  dollar  like  purchase 
 which  is  about  status  maybe  which  means 
 that  you  can't  even  get  the  fancy
[204:52] apartment  which  is  you  know  5K  7K 
 whatever  in  my  most  stressful  unhealthy
[204:57] or  unhappy  time  when  I  moved  to  Dubai  my 
 business's  profit  was  barely  like  10K
[205:02] and  I  was  using  that  on  the  apartments 
 and  the  clothing  and  everything  my  cash 
 was  quite  high  it  was  you  know  it's  like
[205:07] 40K  but  we  were  reinvesting  that  back 
 into  the  business  and  it  just  makes  you 
 a  weak  entrepreneur  when  you  have  this
[205:12] like  materialistic  lifestyle  now  I  know 
 you're  probably  thinking  of  the 
 entrepreneurs  out  there  like  our  name
[205:17] like  Iman  and  Tate  who  are  quite 
 materialistic  they've  got  the  fancy 
 objects  but  they  are  quite  they're
[205:23] amazing  at  business  at  the  same  time 
 what  I  will  say  from  what  I  can  see  is 
 like  these  men  are  the  outliers  that
[205:30] they  absolutely  are  they  are  like  the 
 outliers  what  you're  not  seeing  is 
 through  the  survivorship  bias  is  the
[205:36] amount  of  people  who  have  the  same 
 materialistic  tastes  as  these  men  but 
 who  didn't  make  it  so  this  is  more
[205:42] credit  to  these  men  to  show  how  amazing 
 they  are  but  also  like  less  credit  to 
 like  the  average  folk  who  also  for
[205:48] example  wants  the  same  like  cars  and  you 
 know  you've  seen  the  entrepreneur  you're 
 thinking  yeah  take  so  cool  with  this  car 
 and  everything  and  this  and  the  watch
[205:53] Iman  with  his  watches  chances  are  if 
 we're  just  being  honest  most  of  the
[205:59] people  who  have  the  same  desires  end  up 
 in  absolute  ruin 
 just  because  you  see  this  one  guy  who's
[206:05] been  able  to  manage  it  doesn't  actually 
 mean  that  you  will  now  of  course  we  want 
 to  have  like  powerful  beliefs  about 
 ourselves  but  we  also  need  to  be
[206:10] rational  to  think  that  the  disease  of 
 materialism  has  claimed  the  lives  of  of 
 a  lot  of  disciplined  hard-working  people
[206:17] these  aren't  average  people  that  you're 
 competing  against  when  you  think  of  like 
 the  top  level  athletes  who  literally 
 became  too  materialistic  and  they  lost
[206:23] it  all  and  became  bankrupt  they  were 
 more  disciplined  than  you  could  ever 
 hope  to  be  so  don't  believe  that  oh  yeah
[206:28] it  won't  happen  to  me  I  won't  waste  all 
 my  money  in  my  business  or  my  my 
 athletic  career  just  goes  to  [ __ ]
[206:34] because  of  the  the  headache  caused  by  my 
 incessant  desire  of  status  objects  if 
 you're  really  interested  in  this  there's
[206:40] a  video  on  my  channel  which  is  called 
 don't  make  this  mistake  when  you  get 
 rich  and  I've  explained  it  in  about  a
[206:45] two-hour  Loom  presentation  like  a  screen 
 recording  of  me  just  talking  and  showing 
 you  pictures  of  the  stuff  I  bought  the
[206:51] people  I  met  and  the  experience  I  had  in 
 Dubai  and  like  how  materialistic  that 
 side  of  like  that  part  of  the  world  is
[206:56] and  every  step  that  I've  taken  towards 
 this  materialistic  object  has  just  been
[207:01] a  wasted  step  it's  been  a  waste  of  time 
 and  often  I've  noticed  that  it's 
 actually  reduced  my  health  at  the  same
[207:06] time  which  is  just  it's  unacceptable 
 every  step  that  I've  taken  towards  the 
 spiritual  path  has  improved  my  health  my
[207:12] happiness  my  love  has  improved  even  my 
 productivity  my  contributions  to  others
[207:17] so  that's  just  the  lesson  I'd  give  you 
 there  is  I  would  say  this  is  a  level 
 zero  purchase  buy  if  you  must  if  you've
[207:23] got  some  addiction  to  this  this  thing 
 but  I  would  I  would  love  to  like  see  you 
 almost  psychoanalyze  yourself  and  think
[207:29] you  know  what  actually  if  I'm  being 
 honest  the  reason  why  I  want  to  buy  this 
 thing  is  because  I  just  keep  thinking
[207:34] about  this  girl  from  high  school  that  if 
 I  ended  up  driving  the  car  past  my  city 
 she  might  look  at  me  and  how  [ __ ]  sad
[207:40] that  is  that  I'd  go  and  spend  the  next 
 year  of  my  life  with  this  desire  just 
 hopefully  that  like  some  girl  from  high
[207:45] school  might  pay  more  attention  to  me  a 
 lot  of  it  comes  down  to  that  the  second 
 level  of  things  you  can  buy  is  with
[207:50] travel 
 experiences  are  shown  statistically  to
[207:55] give  you  like  a  a  better  feeling  of 
 Happiness  then  objects  are  so  what  this
[208:00] means  is  getting  the  holiday  like  the 
 the  travel  experience  to  a  different 
 country  will  actually  serve  your  life
[208:07] more  than  buying  an  item  so  I  would 
 actually  support  you  in  this  decision  of 
 like  if  you've  saved  up  a  few  thousand
[208:13] and  you  want  to  go  to  like  I  don't  know 
 Europe  or  this  other  country  or  this 
 country  you  want  to  book  this  Airbnb 
 actually  serve  you  mostly  because  of  the
[208:20] learning  lessons  that  arise  when  you  go 
 traveling  when  you  leave  your  home  the 
 environment  that  you're  used  to  and  you
[208:25] go  somewhere  else  especially  if  it's  for 
 quite  a  long  period  of  time  and  you're 
 especially  if  you're  quite  social  when 
 you  go  there  you'll  get  a  bunch  of
[208:31] learning  lessons  and  realizations  that 
 you  might  not  have  gotten  if  you  stayed 
 at  home  one  realization  like  that  could
[208:38] be  worth  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars 
 like  it  could  be  like  you  know  something 
 that  you  implement  through  your  business 
 that  could  be  worth  thousands  it  could
[208:43] be  something  that  you  realize  about  your 
 purpose  about  your  direction  in  life 
 that  could  be  worth  like  it  could  be
[208:48] Priceless  so  basically  every  trip  that 
 I've  been  on  I've  had  quite  a  good 
 realization  that  has  been  extremely
[208:55] valuable  but 
 I'm  gonna  sound  a  bit  odd  here  but  I 
 actually  have  quite  unique  views  towards
[209:01] traveling  I  believe  that  the  travel 
 industry  by  the  way the  travel  industry 
 is  like  a  700  billion  or  even  a  trillion
[209:06] dollar  industry  like  you  know  the  planes 
 the  flights  the  hotels  everything  right 
 I  believe  that  they  have  brainwashed  us
[209:13] to  believe  that  the  height  of  life  is  to 
 go  on  a  holiday  when  you  think  about  the 
 average  person's  beliefs  the  average  guy
[209:19] you  know  he  works  in  a  shitty  career 
 then  50  weeks  of  the  year  and  he's 
 allowed  to  take  two  weeks  off  when  his
[209:25] boss  his  daddy  tells  them  that  you  can 
 go  and  like  have  fun  in  a  different 
 country  and  the  thing  that  he  does  in 
 those  two  weeks  he  books  a  holiday  but
[209:31] what  I  would  say  is  like  if  I'm  speaking 
 to  younger  Hamza 
 he  had  in  his  mind  for  about  three  years
[209:37] this  dream  of  of  being  a  digital  Nomad 
 and  I  would  just  ask  him  and  say  like
[209:42] why  do  you  have  that  like  what  do  you 
 think  life  is  going  to  be  when  you're 
 there  I  was  in  a  work  mode  I  wanted  to
[209:48] work  super  hard  and  get  results  in  my 
 business  and  I  would  go  to  a  kind  of  the 
 kind  of  place  where  that  doesn't  happen
[209:53] when  you  are  in  like  this  focused  work 
 mode 
 flying  around  and  like  going  to  these
[209:59] nice  like  little  places  bro  I'm  gonna 
 say  this  again  no  one's  doing  deep  work 
 in  Thailand  it's  just  the  way  it  is  no
[210:05] one's  doing  deep  work  there  in  your  own 
 little  home  here  when  you're  focused  in 
 like  an  apartment  in  in  your  own  home
[210:10] country  you  can  grind  away  if  this  is 
 the  priority  of  your  life  right  now  go
[210:15] to  those  places  when  you  actually  want 
 to  kind  of  like  rest  off  when  you 
 specifically  don't  even  care  about
[210:20] business  you  don't  mind  if  the  results 
 go  down  a  little  bit  that's  fine  but 
 don't  think  to  yourself  like  as  I  did
[210:25] yeah  I'll  go  to  Thailand  and  you  know 
 I'll  stay  there  for  months  and  months 
 and  months  and  you  know  all  my  business 
 it's  like  the  environment  isn't  set  up
[210:32] for  you  to  be  able  to  get  more  results 
 there  it's  just  something  which  is  it's 
 just  the  truth  I  don't  know  now  you  can 
 see  I'm  quite  like  negative  towards
[210:38] traveling  but  I  will  say  that  my  advice 
 for  this  is  there  is  a  certain  kind  of
[210:43] trouble  that  I  think  is  worth  it  for  me 
 and  so  chances  are  if  you  actually 
 really  enjoy  traveling  you  disagree  with
[210:49] what  I  say  what  I'm  about  to  say  will 
 actually  make  your  traveling  still 
 better  anyway  so  if  I  will  travel  for
[210:54] this  then  it  means  that  you  know  like  if 
 you  already  enjoy  traveling  this  will  be 
 supplement  to  it  I  believe  that
[210:59] traveling  for  the  sake  of  just  like  hey 
 I'm  in  a  different  country  it's  just 
 weird  and  pathetic  I  just  don't  see  the
[211:04] point  of  that  but  I  think  that  traveling 
 for  your  purpose  traveling  to  go  and 
 learn  something  is  worth  it  so  for
[211:10] example  my  purpose  right  now  is  not 
 actually  my  work  I've  kind  of  completed 
 that  layer  I  feel  like  financially  free
[211:16] it's  fine  now  my  purpose  right  now  is  to 
 free  my  body  I've  realized  that  like  the
[211:21] next  level  of  Freedom  that  I  want  to  get 
 to  is  like  my  own  body  Freedom  my 
 physical  Freedom  it's  like  my  joints  are
[211:26] stiff  I  [ __ ]  hate  like  how  I  feel  in 
 my  body  it's  nothing  particularly  bad  I 
 don't  have  any  juice  or  anything  but
[211:31] it's  only  like  now  that  I've  got  the 
 space  away  from  work  and  money  that  I'm 
 actually  realizing  like  my  knees  click
[211:36] when  I  when  I  squat  down  I've  got  like 
 you  know  sort  of  like  a  stiffness  here 
 so  I  want  to  get  all  into  yoga  but  I
[211:42] also  want  to  get  all  into  cold  exposure 
 the  Wim  Hof  method  and  the  Wim  Hof 
 method  is  like  you'll  go  with
[211:47] instructors  and  climb  up  like  mountains 
 and  stuff  and  you'll  like  go  shirtless
[211:52] and  you'll  do  this  breathing  thing  which 
 will  help  you  like  release  trauma  and 
 cold  you  know  it  sounds  awesome  right  so 
 I'm  gonna  go  and  do  an  event  with  that
[211:58] so  it's  like  I'm  gonna  travel  I'm  gonna 
 get  the  flight  and  everything  but 
 there's  a  specific  like  learning  event
[212:04] that  I'm  going  for  I  think  traveling 
 just  for  the  sake  of  traveling  and  this 
 idea  of  being  a  digital  Nomad  I  don't
[212:10] think  it's  great  every  every  digital 
 Nomad  I  speak  to  or  that  I  see  their
[212:15] results  just  Pluto  you  just  don't  get 
 good  results  in  business  when  you're 
 being  a  digital  Nomad  you  just  don't
[212:20] it's  just  a  fact  as  it  is  but  don't  be  a 
 digital  Nomad  instead  work  super  hard  at
[212:26] home  in  your  environment  where  you  can 
 do  that  and  then  if  you  want  to  go  take 
 a  holiday  where  you  don't  even  look  at
[212:31] work  for  like  a  week  or  two  weeks  or 
 even  a  month  that's  fine  don't  think  to 
 yourself  again  I'll  just  take  my  laptop 
 and  I'll  stay  there  all  the  time  because
[212:36] then  it's  like  you're  in  this  place 
 which  should  be  enjoyed  but  hey  you  are 
 trying  to  cultivate  like  a  deep  work
[212:41] routine  when  there's  like  you  know 
 you're  there  hot  and  humid  in  this 
 exotic  country  it's  not  at  all  that  it's
[212:47] cracked  up  to  be  go  over  to  these 
 countries  for  a  specific  reason  so  for 
 example  if  I  really  wanted  to  I  don't
[212:53] think  that  you  know  it's  not  my  purpose 
 or  anything  but  if  my  purpose  became 
 like  oh  I  really  want  to  learn  about  the
[212:58] Thai  culture  and  I  want  to  learn  Muay 
 Thai  and  get  into  a  Muay  Thai  fight  then 
 go  into  Thailand  would  be  an  amazing
[213:03] reason  for  that  but  I  would  ask  you  not 
 to  cope  and  just  to  choose  some  random 
 desire  just  because  it  sounded  cool  and
[213:09] you  know  you  really  want  to  go  to 
 Thailand  with  Bali  or  whatever  and 
 rather  I  just  say  just  follow  your
[213:15] purpose  if  your  purpose  right  now  is 
 pure  just  work  and  business  and  money 
 just  stay  where  you  can  work  the  hardest
[213:22] don't  consider  going  somewhere  else 
 where  you're  not  going  to  work  as  hard 
 and  you're  not  going  to  have  as  great  of 
 a  routine  if  your  purpose  changes  and  it
[213:29] becomes  to  like  learn  this  a  particular 
 skill  then  go  where  that  skill  is
[213:34] learned  best 
 so  part  of  my  new  purpose  will  be  yoga
[213:39] because  I  want  to  be  able  to  get  like 
 really  flexible  and  also  to  be  able  to 
 actually  like  cultivate  my  breath
[213:44] through  my  entire  body  so  soon  I'm  gonna 
 go  move  right  next  like  a  yoga  studio  so
[213:49] I  can  go  and  train  for  hours  a  day  and 
 if  that  involves  traveling  to  a 
 different  country  then  for  like  some
[213:54] kind  of  intensive  yoga  Workshop  then  I 
 think  that's  an  awesome  reason  to  travel 
 I  think  traveling  just  for  like  no
[214:00] reason  other  than  like  haha  like  let's 
 go  to  Thailand  let's  go  to  Europe  guys 
 it's  I  just  think  it's  just  what  I've
[214:07] found  I'm  just  gonna  like  I  know  I'm 
 gonna  get  loads  of  hate  for  this  this 
 part  of  the  video  because  people  will 
 just  disagree  but  I  found  that  a  lot  of
[214:12] people's  pursuit  of  traveling  actually 
 comes  because  of  their  addiction  of
[214:17] dopamine  they  just  need  more  novelty 
 they  need  something  new  it's  like  oh 
 let's  go  to  this  place  and  let's  go  do
[214:23] something  like  let's  go  drinking  and  eat 
 stuff  there  and  like  let's  have  sex  with 
 the  girl  that  I'm  going  with  it's  it's
[214:28] just  dopamine  after  dopamine  after 
 dopamine  if  you  just  sit  still  and  just 
 ask  yourself  why  am  I  considering  going
[214:34] to  these  countries  if  there's  a  great 
 reason  that  arises  fine  but  like  I
[214:39] haven't  really  ever  met  anyone  who's 
 actually  had  such  a  great  reason 
 sometimes  there  is  you  know  for  example 
 this  someone  who  wants  to  study  the
[214:46] course  of  like  some  University  in  a 
 particular  place  okay  fine  you  want  to 
 move  over  maybe  for  taxes  or  something
[214:51] okay  fine  you  want  to  like  you  know  move 
 to  to  try  and  see  if  this  is  the  country 
 that  you  want  to  raise  your  children
[214:56] sounds  awesome  there's  a  particular 
 event  or  learning  or  skill  that  you  want 
 to  learn  awesome  digital  normally  like
[215:02] oh  I  want  to  move  and  just  like  you  know 
 work  on  my  laptop  it  it's  terrible  it's 
 so  terrible  out  the  reason  why  I'm
[215:08] saying  this  even  though  I  know  so  many 
 people  won't  understand  and  that  their 
 their  ears  will  just  be  closed  off  I
[215:13] wish  that  someone  spoke  to  younger  Hamza 
 like  this  because  I've  wasted  about 
 about  nine  months  of  my  life  traveling
[215:19] just  in  the  last  few  years  I've  wasted 
 nine  months  in  different  countries  when 
 I  was  in  a  work  mode  anyway  if  you're  in
[215:25] a  work  mode  just  stay  where  you  work 
 best  remember  the  travel  industry  is 
 huge  and  so  their  brainwashing  is  deep
[215:32] inside  of  your  mind  to  a  level  that  you 
 don't  even  understand  it  is  totally  like 
 a  normal  belief  for  you  that  once  you
[215:38] make  money  you  go  to  a  different  country 
 that  might  not  even  be  your  own 
 authentic  belief  you  should  question  it
[215:43] just  because  it's  what  you  see  other 
 people  doing  doesn't  mean  that  it's 
 actually  for  you  I'm  not  saying  don't 
 travel  at  all  don't  go  to  a  different
[215:48] country  but  I'm  just  saying  to  have  a 
 great  reason  the  next  level  of  spending 
 is  to  free  your  loved  ones  honestly  it
[215:54] takes  about  one  or  two  thousand  dollars 
 to  take  most  of  the  stress  away  from
[216:00] your  family  like  if  I'm  imagining  that 
 you're  somewhat  of  like  in  the  middle 
 you  know  your  family  aren't  rich  but
[216:05] your  family  aren't  like  fully  like 
 ghetto  broke  poor  but  somewhere  around 
 here  working  class  if  you  were  able  to
[216:11] give  your  parents  one  or  two  thousand 
 dollars  a  month 
 their  cortisol  would  probably  half  you
[216:17] know  koth  is  always  like  the  stress 
 hormone  if  we  like  got  a  blood  test 
 would  be  able  to  see  a  number  for  our
[216:22] cortisol  for  all  parents  it  would 
 probably  be  like  above  high  if  they're 
 waking  up  sleep  deprived  if  they're
[216:27] working  some  [ __ ]  job  they've  been  sleep 
 deprived  for  about  10  years 
 imagine  that  you  could  see  a  number  in
[216:33] their  blood  that  shows  their  stress  if 
 you  gave  them  one  or  two  thousand  a 
 month  it  gave  them  space  to  breathe  and
[216:39] not  need  to  like  feel  so  scared  of  like 
 you  know  rushing  and  trying  to  save 
 money  one  pound  here  one  dollar  here
[216:44] you'd  actually  see  that  causes  all 
 numbered  drop  by  like  half  with  1K  a
[216:49] month 
 it's  very  powerful  it's  like  a  very  like 
 low-hanging  fruit  that  you  could  use 
 that  still  have  to  work  the  current  you
[216:56] know  the  job  if  you  gave  them  like  1K  a 
 month  or  your  parents  probably  wouldn't 
 just  stop  working  they'd  still  work  the 
 same  job  but  it  gave  them  the  space  to
[217:01] breed  then  if  you  give  them  about  three 
 or  four  or  five  k  a  month  they  could
[217:06] actually  leave  this  job  that  they  don't 
 like  and  that  would  free  up  their  time 
 to  actually  find  like  what  kind  of
[217:11] person  they  are  and  this  is  a  very 
 interesting  experience  especially  for 
 our  parents  like  for  us  we've  kind  of
[217:18] come  into  adulthood  with  another 
 understanding  of  money  than  our  parents 
 have  haven't  we  we  kind  of  understand  a 
 lot  more  about  entrepreneurship  we
[217:24] understand  that  a  little  girl  on  Tick 
 Tock  can  make  more  money  than  a  doctor 
 our  parents  don't  know  that  and  so  our 
 parents  have  lived  this  life  where
[217:29] they've  worked  like  40  50  60  hour  weeks 
 for  the  last  few  decades
[217:34] they've  got  to  have  points  where  they 
 don't  even  know  themselves  they  don't 
 even  know  what  they  desire  your  dad 
 doesn't  even  know  his  purpose  he's  even
[217:40] for  like  he  hasn't  felt  his  purpose  in 
 decades
[217:46] so  it's  very  easy  to  improve  their  life 
 and  to  give  them  not  even  improve  their 
 life  but  to  give  them  life
[217:52] their  life 
 has  been  kind  of  like  a  mule  like  a 
 donkey  just  like  a  slave  a  slave  to  you
[217:59] when  you  really  see  like  how  your  father 
 and  your  mother  have  lived  from  most 
 young  men  it's  kind  of  like  they've 
 worked  as  slaves  for  you
[218:05] and  when  you're  able  to  free  them 
 they're  able  to  become  like  human  beings
[218:10] again 
 and  suddenly  when  you  do  get  to  this 
 point  when  you're  able  to  give  them  a
[218:15] few  thousand  a  month  you'll  see  that 
 they  had  interests  and  hobbies  that 
 they've  wanted  to  do  for  decades  that
[218:20] they  weren't  able  to  do  because  they 
 needed  to  prioritize  working  to  support 
 for  you
[218:25] and  so  it  was  at  this  point  when 
 I  basically  retired  everyone 
 that  my  dad  went  all  in  on  Cricket  and
[218:33] he  became  the  cricket  team  captain  and 
 he  practices  every  day  and  he  really 
 like  enjoys  it  I  assume  it's  like  the
[218:38] most  important  part  of  his  life  now  it's 
 like  I  feel  like  it's  his  purpose  he 
 mentioned  once  that  he  wants  to  become
[218:43] like  the  Umpire  like  kind  of  like  the  um 
 kind  of  like  the  the  referee  in  cricket
[218:48] and  that  like  it  just  makes  total  sense 
 it's  like  yeah  of  course  you  would 
 you've  liked  Cricket  all  your  life  and
[218:53] for  years  you  he  didn't  play  because  he 
 had  to  work  16  hours  a  day
[218:58] so  he  gets  to  go  and  pursue  something  he 
 actually  loves 
 and  when  you  do  that  it's  like  it's  it's
[219:04] like  this  sad  Bliss  feeling  like  kind  of 
 like  how  you  feel  when  you  think  about 
 Minecraft  it's  like  it's  it's  loving  but
[219:10] it's  also  sad  at  the  same  time  because 
 you  think  damn  like 
 you  really  like  lived  your  life  for  me
[219:15] didn't  you  [ __ ] 
 it's  a  very  sweet  experience  when  you 
 can  just  give  enough  to  your  parents
[219:20] that  they  don't  even  need  to  work  some 
 [ __ ]  job  that  they  don't  care  about  it's 
 crazy  to  think  that  their  entire  lives
[219:26] have  been  structured 
 to  just  make  money  for  you
[219:31] they've  been  on  this  this  purpose  layer 
 like  this  grind  of  making  money  and 
 they've  not  even  like  fulfilled  it
[219:38] they  were  just  able  to  maintain  for  the 
 last  few  while  and  with  the  money  that
[219:43] you  make  and  gives  to  the  family  you're 
 able  to  put  them  into  the  positive  which 
 is  really  nice  you  feel  awesome  you
[219:49] instantly  get  respect  from  everyone  in 
 your  family  you'll  notice  that  at  this 
 point
[219:55] the  family  arguments  cut  down  by  about 
 90  especially  with  you  like  no  one  ever
[220:00] really  argues  with  you  and  you're  the 
 one  like  essentially  paying  for 
 everything  paying  for  every  family 
 member  with
[220:06] no  one  argues  with  you  anymore  no  one 
 this  isn't  to  say  you  become  an  [ __ ] 
 but  rather  like  your  family  like  lose  a
[220:12] lot  of  the  tension  and  you  realize  that 
 the  a  lot  of  like  the  arguments  and 
 hostility  you  may  have  had  as  a  family 
 we're  actually  just  down  to  like
[220:18] financial  reasons  and  that  stops  which 
 is  just  so  awesome  to  to  see  the  next 
 level  of  spending  so  the  better  level  of
[220:24] spending  level  three  is  learning  skills 
 I've  actually  put  learning  skills  above
[220:29] freeing  your  family  so  it's  in  learning 
 skills  there's  higher  Roi  the  reason  why 
 is  because  you  are  the  money  maker  and
[220:35] anything  we  can  do  to  improve  your 
 ability  to  make  money  means  that  you've 
 got  more  to  give  to  other  people  so  this
[220:42] is  kind  of  like  the  saying  of  like 
 you've  got  to  fill  your  cup  before 
 filling  the  cups  of  others  if  the
[220:47] plane's  crashing  you  have  to  put  on  the 
 oxygen  mask  on  you  first  instead  of 
 others  even  though  we'd  like  to  be  that
[220:52] sort  of  heroic  guy  who  saves  the  other 
 person  you  can't  save  the  other  person 
 if  you  pass  out  so  it's  like  you  can't
[220:58] keep  providing  for  your  family  if  you 
 don't  continuously  level  up  your  skills 
 otherwise  you  know  the  nature  of
[221:03] business  is  like  everyone's  getting 
 better  everyone's  because  of  the  how 
 lethal  entrepreneurs  are  becoming  if  you
[221:09] don't  invest  in  your  skills  someone  else 
 will  overtake  you  in  the  money  you  can 
 give  to  your  family  goes  down  so  the
[221:14] priority  isn't  actually  to  give  money  to 
 your  family  the  priorities  to  use  money 
 to  actually  help  you  develop  more  it
[221:19] doesn't  sound  as  cool 
 but  it  is  actually  more  of  a  long-term 
 play  there's  a  really  interesting
[221:24] concept  I  want  to  walk  you  through  the 
 first  10  to  20  hours  of  learning  a  skill 
 you  will  literally  get  to  the  point
[221:30] where  you've  about  80  percent  mastered 
 it  so  a  master  is  someone  who's  done  10
[221:36] 000  hours  20  000  hours 
 in  20  hours  you  get  about  80  of  the  way
[221:41] there  so  if  we  take  three  guys  and  put 
 them  onto  a  basketball  court  one  guy  has
[221:46] never  learned  anything  about  basketball 
 he's  a  complete  beginner  this  is  his 
 first  session  the  other  guy  has  had  20
[221:51] hours  of  a  coach  giving  him  instructions 
 on  like  how  to  throw  the  ball  and  the 
 other  guy  is  a  professional  NBA  10  000
[221:58] hours  whatever  right  he's  been  playing 
 since  he  was  four  years  old  right  and  we 
 asked  him  okay  take  this  ball  throw  it
[222:03] into  the  hoop  a  hundred  times 
 the  professional  will  get  it  in  what 
 what  do  you  think  maybe  about
[222:09] 99.98  94  something  like  that  right  High 
 90s  right  the  complete  beginner  who's
[222:15] never  had  any  practice  would  probably 
 get  it  in  maybe  about  like  20  times 
 but  you  know  the  guy  who's  had  20  hours
[222:21] of  practice 
 he  would  get  it  in  about  80  85  times
[222:27] he  got  like  not  that  far  like  about  10 
 15  less  than  the  actual  Master  who's
[222:34] played  for  literally  a  hundred  times  or 
 a  thousand  times  more  hours
[222:39] you  can  imagine  the  difference  like 
 that's  [ __ ]  huge  right  you  can 
 literally  get  to  like  80  out  of  100  of
[222:45] like  this  free  throw  in  only  20  hours 
 you  get  most  of  the  gains  in  20  hours
[222:51] because  you  learn  so  much  in  those  first 
 few  hours  but  only  only  if  there's  one
[222:57] condition  which  is  met 
 there's  one  vital  condition  to  learning 
 and  this  is  why  it's  something  we  need
[223:03] to  spend  money  on  you  specifically  need 
 a  teacher  you  specifically  need  a  coach
[223:09] you  need  someone  who's  more  advanced 
 than  you  who's  giving  you  feedback  as
[223:14] you  do  the  thing  you  see  learning  by 
 reading  books  and  watching  videos  like 
 this  is  awesome  but  the  way  that  you
[223:19] learn  like  super  fast  you  know  that  20 
 hours  where  you  get  like  80  as  good  as  a 
 pro
[223:24] is  where  you  have  a  one-to-one  teacher 
 who's  literally  watching  you  whilst  you
[223:29] do  the  thing  so  imagine  your  trajectory 
 of  business  now  you've  watched  this  guy 
 you're  using  the  principles  right  and
[223:34] you're  gonna  make  some  progress  right 
 imagine  if  I  was  there  in  the  room  with
[223:39] you  for  20  hours  watching  you  implement 
 these  actionable  steps  and  watching  you 
 create  your  package  watching  you  create
[223:45] the  YouTube  video  imagine  if  I  was  sat 
 next  to  you  whilst  you  were  like 
 creating  a  YouTube  video  and  I  could
[223:50] constantly  keep  like  shouting  out  and 
 saying  no no  say  it  like  this  do  it  like 
 this  do  it  like  this  these  little  bits
[223:55] of  feedback  every  single  one  would  just 
 kind  of  bump  up  you're  learning  way  more 
 than  the  guy  who  might  watch  a  YouTube
[224:01] video  but  isn't  actually  getting  the 
 feedback  from  an  expert  this  is  how  you 
 put  your  learning  on  The  Fast  Track  and
[224:07] it's  learning  these  skills  that 
 increases  the  ceiling  to  how  much  money 
 you  make  but  also  just  how  much  progress
[224:12] you're  making  like  all  skills  even 
 business  or  non-business  related  the 
 most  powerful  thing  you  can  do  for
[224:17] learning  is  to  go  and  find  a  one-to-one 
 teacher  or  a  coach  and  pay  them  for
[224:22] about  10  to  20  hours  of  their  time  this 
 is  such  a  high  Roi  it's  insane  the  way
[224:28] that  you're  going  to  find  the  teacher  or 
 coach  the  way  that  I  do  it  is  I  will 
 read  books  on  a  certain  topic  so  for
[224:34] example  like  storytelling  I  tell  stories 
 at  the  start  of  every  one  of  my  videos 
 don't  I  I'll  go  and  find  a  good
[224:39] storytelling  book  find  one  that  is 
 actually  helping  me  that  I  like  I  like 
 you  know  the  author  is  writing  in  a  way
[224:45] that  resonates  for  me  I  use  the  advice 
 and  it  works  and  then  I  literally  just 
 go  and  contact  the  authors  like  you  can
[224:51] contact  authors  that  you  know  like 
 people  who  write  books  you  can  literally 
 just  search  their  name  on  Google  and 
 most  of  them  actually  do  coaching  so
[224:57] that's  how  I've  found  coaches  myself  I 
 find  an  awesome  book  and  I  literally 
 just  Google  the  author's  name  and  find
[225:02] their  website  and  I  just  send  them  an 
 email  saying  like  I  want  to  do  some 
 one-to-one  coaching  I  do  offer  that  and
[225:07] most  of  them  already  do  because  someone 
 else  has  already  mentioned  them  so  I 
 have  two  coaches  just  for  YouTube  I  have
[225:12] a  storytelling  coach  and  a  speech  coach 
 like  someone  who  helps  me  speak  better 
 and  I  literally  just  message  them  and
[225:17] just  got  their  hourly  rate  okay  then  I 
 said  can  we  do  10  pack  10  hours  can  we 
 do  20  hours  and  they  agreed  and  we  just
[225:23] hop  on  video  calls  once  a  week  or  twice 
 a  week  and  I  literally  like  share  my  my 
 uh  YouTube  script  like  the  video  script
[225:29] live  and  live  they'll  like  watch  me  type 
 in  what  I'm  about  to  say  for  like  you
[225:34] know  the  points  I'm  using  and  they'll 
 give  me  feedback  back  on  that  so  I  have 
 a  new  mindset  when  it  comes  to  learning
[225:39] skills  I  don't  even  like  learn  unless  I 
 can  go  and  get  a  one-to-one  teacher  so
[225:44] if  for  example  there's  something  I  want 
 to  do  like  right  now  I  want  to  do  yoga 
 it  feels  like  my  purpose  to  you  know 
 free  my  body  and  stuff  I'm  not  gonna  do
[225:50] it  just  yet  I'm  waiting  for  the  next  few 
 days  because  I'm  gonna  soon  go  and  like 
 move  close  to  the  yoga  place  I'm  not
[225:56] even  gonna  go  and  practice  it  by  myself 
 just  yet  this  is  like  a  very  like 
 privileged  little  stubborn  place  to  be
[226:01] but  in  my  perception  it's  like  it's 
 almost  a  waste  of  time  to  learn  a  new 
 skill  if  you  can  afford  to  just  go  and
[226:07] get  a  teacher  so  there's  like  three 
 levels  one  would  be  for  example  you  read 
 or  you  watch  a  YouTube  video  let's  say
[226:13] on  yoga  right  so  you're  watching  the 
 stretch  routine  and  you  practice  it 
 yourself  the  next  thing  would  be  when
[226:18] you  go  physically  to  like  a  class  or  you 
 go  to  a  yoga  class  and  there's  you  and 
 like  five  or  ten  students  in  the  yoga
[226:24] teacher  and  for  the  entire  lesson  maybe 
 it  comes  up  to  you  once  and  tells  you 
 like  one  bit  of  feedback  okay  do  this  do
[226:30] this  thing  then  the  ultimate  lesson  is 
 when  you  just  do  a  one-to-one  and  it's  a 
 little  you  and  the  teacher  and  he  he
[226:36] tells  you  in  that  hour  like  20  50 
 different  things  that  you  can  do  to 
 improve  it's  those  bits  of  feedback  that
[226:44] is  actually  how  you  learn  just  doing  the 
 thing  gives  you  some  progress  but  it's 
 the  feedback  that  actually  puts  your
[226:50] learning  on  steroids  and  you  can  mix 
 this  with  traveling  so  you  can  go  and 
 see  if  there's  like  intensive  workshops
[226:55] events  that  you  can  go  and  attend  maybe 
 there's  some  for  business  maybe  there's 
 some  for  like  even  weight  lifting  or
[227:01] something  you  go  to  these  events  and 
 it's  usually  like  an  intensive  Training 
 Day  where  they'll  have  a  teacher  who 
 will  give  you  a  bunch  of  advice  so  the
[227:07] Wim  Hof  method  has  like  these  um  travel 
 with  instructors  or  these  Advanced 
 workshops  that  you  can  go  travel  to  and
[227:13] you'll  have  someone  who's  like  a  pro  who 
 will  watch  you  get  into  like  an  ice  bath 
 and  tell  you  the  way  to  breathe  Alex
[227:18] hamosi  talks  about  this  a  lot  that 
 spending  money  on  leveling  up  your 
 skills  is  one  of  the  like  the  highest
[227:24] rois  you  can  get  so  go  ahead  and  don't 
 be  scared  of  buying  like  the  one-to-one 
 coaching  personal  training  courses
[227:31] workshops  events  mentorship 
 um  communities  all  these  like  random
[227:37] things  courses  and  everything  don't  be 
 scared  of  investing  in  your  education 
 and  in  your  skills  because  these  these
[227:42] often  have  the  highest  rois  and  again 
 this  is  exactly  what  we  have  in  Adonis 
 school  just  let  me  just  sell  you  done  a
[227:48] school  just  quick  you  can  skip  30 
 seconds  if  you  want  but  I  think  this  is 
 really  interesting  the  way  that  Adonis 
 School  works  is  that  everyone  joins  they
[227:53] pay  the  joining  fee  then  they  pay  99  a 
 month  after  that  and  you  only  pay  99  a 
 month  like  recurring  right  but  the  more
[227:59] students  that  we  get  the  more  money  that 
 I'm  making  the  more  that  I'm  putting  it 
 back  inside  of  Adonis  school  so  before
[228:04] we  know  it  we've  got  five  teachers  we've 
 got  six  teachers  like  these  live  coaches 
 teachers  who  are  experts  in  their  field
[228:09] so  our  students  are  only  paying  99  a 
 month  but  they're  getting  access  to  like 
 five  different  teachers  and  my  goal  is
[228:14] to  get  that  to  more  like  10  teachers  so 
 that  with  your  same  99  a  month 
 membership  you've  got  access  to  so  many
[228:20] different  teachers  that  you're  in  like 
 three  calls  a  day  which  usually  you'd  be 
 paying  like  hundreds  per  call  and
[228:26] because  of  the  way  the  business  model 
 works  you  can  if  you  can  wrap  your  mind 
 around  that  the  business  model  is  really
[228:31] positive  because  all  the  money  that 
 these  students  are  paying  goes  to  me  I'm
[228:37] able  to  hire  these  teachers  for  a  few 
 grand  a  month  to  give  you  know  one  or 
 two  calls  a  week  for  example  but  the
[228:43] students  are  only  paying  99  a  month 
 for  me  for  my  coaches  it's  like  250
[228:49] dollars  per  hour  that  I  pay  and  yet  the 
 students  are  getting  access  to  like  five
[228:55] teachers  for  99  a  month  so  it's  a  very 
 positive  feedback  loop  if  you're 
 interested  in  that  and  that  we've  got
[229:01] teachers  for  business  for  sleeping  for 
 masculinity  for  finding  your  purpose 
 spirituality  at  other  school  is  the  top
[229:07] Link  in  the  description  the  next  level 
 of  spending  money  is  spending  to  improve 
 your  health  you've  heard  so  much  and
[229:13] you've  probably  said  it  yourself  that 
 health  is  the  priority  maybe  your  big 
 Focus  right  now  is  your  work  money
[229:18] Fitness  whatever  it  is  with  your  health 
 you  do  everything  better
[229:24] and  I  can't  help  but  think  about  the 
 time  with  my  health  drastically  got
[229:29] worse  you  don't  often  hear  of  like  a 
 young  guy  tell  you  this  do  you  but 
 there's  been  like  two  moments  of  my  life
[229:34] where 
 I'll  tell  you  about  both  of  them  okay  in
[229:39] 2020  early  2020  January  February 
 I  had  been  living  like  a  degenerate  for
[229:46] the  last  like  nine  months  I'd  been 
 smoking  weed  every  single  day  I  had  been
[229:51] like  in  this  relationship  with  this  girl 
 that  I  was  living  with  who  I  didn't  even 
 trust  or  like  or  you  know  want  to  be
[229:57] with  but  I  was  so  afraid  of  breaking  up 
 with  them  we  lived  together  I  was  eating 
 junk  food  every  single  day  and  then  when
[230:03] covid  started  and  a  lockdown  happened 
 then  I  stopped  exercising  completely  and 
 literally  all  I  was  doing  was  just
[230:08] indulging  watching  content  watching 
 movies  smoking  weed  playing  video  games
[230:13] and  everything 
 and  I  remember  my  mental  health  getting 
 like  really  really  bad
[230:19] really  bad  that  I  couldn't  help  but  get 
 negative  thoughts  all  the  time  I  could
[230:24] wake  up 
 and 
 I  you  know  I'd  smoke  first  thing  in  the 
 morning
[230:30] I'd  be  fapping 
 I'd  go  and  like  sit  on  the  toilet  and
[230:35] literally  just  like  scroll  and  look  at 
 like  Instagram  girls  and  fap  like 
 literally  within  the  first  hour  like
[230:41] it's  part  of  my  morning  routine
[230:46] playing  video  games  for  hours  like  my 
 girlfriend  at  the  this  girl  I  was  living
[230:51] with  she  was  like  a  gamer  girl  like 
 alongside  me  so  we  both  used  to  play 
 and  um  it  was  just  so  depressing  like
[230:58] there  was  nothing  that  was  happening 
 there  was  no  growth  no  progress  no 
 nothing  productive  that  we  were  doing
[231:04] and  I  remember  just  my  mental  health  was 
 so  bad  then  my  girlfriend  got  a  message
[231:11] from  my  father 
 he  wanted  to  message  me  but  I  had  him
[231:16] and  the  rest  of  my  family  blocked  for 
 the  last  year 
 it's  one  whole  year  like  my  family
[231:22] weren't  able  to  contact  me 
 because  we  had  like  a  massive  argument 
 and  I  realized  like  you  know  I  hated
[231:27] them  and  everything  and  so  I  blocked 
 them  all  kept  on  deleting  their  numbers 
 kept  you  know  they'd  message  me  with 
 like  a  new  number  I  kept  on  blocking  it
[231:33] blocking  it  blocking  it 
 and  eventually  she  receives  a  message 
 from  my  father  saying  that  they're  just
[231:38] worried  about  me  and  that  they  wanted  to 
 let  me  know  that  my  brother  was  getting
[231:43] married 
 and  honestly  it  hit  me  like  a  ton  of 
 bricks  here  I  was  with  pure  anxiety  and
[231:49] depression  for  the  last  like  year 
 but  life  moves  on
[231:55] I  felt  so  horrible  and  I  was  I  was  like 
 stressed  and  anxious  and  so  sad  and
[232:00] depressed  and  not  to  mention  that  then 
 when  a  covert  did  happen  it  was  like  the
[232:05] most  stressful  period  of  my  life  because 
 I  was  working  in  a  homeless 
 accommodation  shelter  and  I  was  like
[232:10] helping  one  of  the  guys  there  to  like 
 not  be  like  on  the  Street  Homeless  and 
 that  was  like  super  stressful  for  me  I
[232:15] remember  I  would  literally  like  wake  up 
 in  the  middle  of  the  night  drenched  like
[232:20] wet  in  sweat  like  literally  imagine 
 you've  got  a  water  bottle  imported  there
[232:25] was  fully  like  it  was  the  bed  would  be 
 soaked  because  of  how  stressed  I  was  I 
 would  sleepless  nights  and  I  don't  blame
[232:31] her  for  this  but  like  she  used  to  get 
 pissed  off  at  me  because  I'd  be  so  like 
 wet  and  uncomfortable  at  night  time  and
[232:36] everything  and  so  she'd  be  like  pushing 
 me  away  and  it  was  a  very  like  lonely 
 time  and  I  never  contemplated  suicide
[232:43] but  I  don't  think  I  would  have  been  like 
 that  far  from  the  point  of  like  where 
 those  thoughts  would  have  come  into  my
[232:49] mind 
 and  self-improvement  really  saved  me 
 there 
 and  the  next  time  where  my  health  was
[232:55] really  bad  it  was  in  uh  late  2022  this
[233:00] year  just  gone 
 I  had  moved  from  like  the  countryside  of
[233:05] the  UK  and  we  moved  directly  to  London 
 and  it  was  like  a  really  overwhelming
[233:11] for  me  I've  never  lived  in  like  the  big 
 big  city  before  I'm  always  I'm  quite 
 like  a  natural  simple  guy  so  I  live  in
[233:17] like  a  town  next  to  families  and  schools 
 and  everything 
 but  I  thought  you  know  I'll  be  a
[233:22] business  is  booming  I'm  making  you  know 
 a  lot  of  money  and  stuff  let's  go  get  an 
 apartment  in  London  because  that's  what 
 you're  supposed  to  do  when  you  move  out
[233:27] and  stuff  and  it  was  just  instantly  like 
 just  very  overwhelming  like  dizzying
[233:32] it's  not  for  me  and  then  from  that  point 
 I  decided  to  move  to  Dubai  and  that's 
 when  things  got  so  much  worse  before  I
[233:38] know  it  I  was  waking  up  every  single  day 
 with  a  headache  every  single  day  with 
 like  nosebleeds  I  track  my  uh  my  health
[233:45] I'm  not  wearing  it  right  now  but  I 
 usually  have  like  a  whoop  strap  on  or  an 
 aura  ring  and  you  literally  saw  all  my
[233:51] health  stats  just  go  like  that  in  those 
 months  that  I  I  moved  over  to  Dubai
[233:56] super  stressful  time  business  isn't 
 doing  so  well  relationship  with  my 
 girlfriend's  falling  apart  it  was  like  a
[234:01] horrible  time 
 foreign
[234:10] you  can't  even 
 do  anything  else  even  if  work  is  your 
 priority  with  poor  health  it  takes  you
[234:17] away  from  work 
 when  you  have  a  woman  that  you  love  with 
 poor  health  you  turn  into  an  [ __ ]
[234:24] towards  her 
 you  can't  be  productive  you  can't  be
[234:29] focused  your  brain  doesn't  work  as  well 
 and  so  any  money  that  you  can  spend  to 
 improve  your  health  is  really  high  Roi
[234:35] so  I  want  to  tell  you  specifically  some 
 products  I'm  not  going  to  like  link 
 affiliate  links  or  anything  I'm  just 
 going  to  mention  them  to  you  products
[234:41] that  have  really  helped  me 
 the  eighth  sleep  is  a  very  expensive
[234:46] product  it's  like  two  thousand  dollars 
 it's  like  a  mattress  topper  that 
 regulates  your  temperature  and  it  just
[234:51] means  that  like  you'll  sleep  better 
 because  your  mattress  normally  will  be 
 like  too  warm  with  this  it's  like  an  AI
[234:57] system  that  I  can  track  your  body  heat 
 and  then  perfectly  aligns  your 
 temperature  to  it  it's  two  thousand
[235:02] dollars  so  it's  unaffordable  for  most 
 people  but  as  you  begin  to  make  more 
 money  if  you  want  to  invest  in  your 
 sleep  this  will  improve  your  sleep  by
[235:07] like  10  20  every  night  that  you  sleep  on 
 it  maybe  a  higher  quality  mattress  like
[235:12] the  eight  sleep  is  like  a  mattress 
 topper  but  an  actual  higher  quality 
 mattress  I  went  to  one  of  those  local
[235:17] like  the  the  big  stores  dream  or 
 whatever  it  was  I  went  there  and  they 
 like  literally  like  you  just  go  into
[235:23] like  I'm  looking  for  a  new  mattress  this 
 is  the  size  that  I  want  and  with  a  lot 
 of  these  like  big  mattress  companies
[235:28] they'll  make  you  go  into  like  some 
 scanner  thing  where  you  just  like 
 pretend  to  sleep  and  they'll  find  out 
 which  one's  perfect  for  you  and  a  lady
[235:34] showed  me  around  like  a  bunch  of  beds 
 let  me  try  them  on  and  there  was  one 
 that  fit  just  perfectly  and  my  sleep  has
[235:39] improved  since  then  and  even  pillows 
 like  be  honest  with  you  sleeping  on  the 
 same  shitty  pillow  from  the  last  like
[235:44] years  and  years  and  you  know  that  it's 
 not  even  that  like  not  nice  but  you're 
 just  like  you  just  keep  procrastinating
[235:49] getting  a  different  one  trying  one  out 
 spending  a  day  to  end  up  maybe  a  hundred 
 dollars  or  something  to  go  try  out  like
[235:55] a  bunch  of  pillows  to  the  one  that  you 
 find  that  is  absolutely  perfect 
 your  sleep  is  going  to  improve  by  like
[236:00] five  percent  straight  after  that  and 
 then  I  have  a  bunch  of  supplements  I 
 have  this  uh  subscription  supplement
[236:06] which  is  called  bionic  bio  Nick 
 and  they  they  um do  a  blood  test  and
[236:12] then  they  find  out  which  like  nutrients 
 you  need  and  then  they  just  send  it  to 
 you  every  month  so  I've  got  like  a  bunch 
 of  bottles  over  there  I've  got  some
[236:18] premium  uh  fish  oil  as  well  probiotics 
 also  higher  quality  food  I  get  all  of  my
[236:23] food  delivered  I  don't  like  go  to  the 
 grocery  store  or  anything  I  don't  even 
 buy  from  grocery  stores  because  that's
[236:28] like  no  offense  it's  like  it's  it's  like 
 normal  mediocre  people  food  when  you  go
[236:33] to  like  a  normal  grocery  store  so  I  buy 
 my  stuff  directly  from  the  Farms  I  only 
 eat  like  single  ingredients  and  so  from
[236:40] the  Farms  who  have  like  the  pasta  fed 
 cows  I  buy  their  beef  it  gets  delivered
[236:46] to  my  house  you  can  do  this  in  the  UK 
 you  can  just  search  like  farms  near  me 
 and  usually  they've  got  websites  where
[236:51] they're  literally  come  and  like  deliver 
 you  meat  fresh  directly  from  them  and
[236:56] cutting  out  the  middleman  of  the 
 supermarket  where  they  put  in  all  the 
 extra  like  processing  packaging 
 everything  you  can  even  find  the  Farms
[237:02] who  won't  even 
 um  make  their  meat  touch  Plastics  or 
 anything  like  that  so  there's  less
[237:07] estrogens  the  Farms  that  you  know 
 promise  no  home  hormones  everything  like 
 that  so  it  isn't  that  much  more
[237:12] expensive  like  my  steak  cost  me  like 
 eight  pounds  you  go  to  like  a  cheap 
 grocery  store  it's  probably  like  five
[237:17] dollars  or  six  pounds  or  something  it's 
 not  that  much  more  expensive  my  health 
 has  improved  significantly  because  of
[237:22] that  also  talking  about  estrogenics  I've 
 mentioned  a  few  times  on  my  videos  what 
 they  are  estrogenics  are  like  these
[237:27] Plastics  and  chemicals  in  the 
 environment  which  mimic  estrogen  and 
 essentially  like  [ __ ]  up  your  health  as
[237:33] a  man  it's  estrogen  so  you  get  [ __ ] 
 titties  and  everything  it  lowers  your 
 testosterone  your  fertility  and  it's  all
[237:39] around  you  it's  all  in  like  it's  in  your 
 drinking  water  it's  in  the  Plastics  that
[237:45] you  touch 
 and  so  with  money  you  can  afford  to  buy 
 like  estrogen  free  products  like  for
[237:50] example  I  don't  use  like  any  kind  of 
 normal  skin  care  products  or  or  tooth
[237:55] paste  or  anything  like  that  shower  stuff 
 all  of  my  stuff  is  like  estrogenic  free 
 I  also  have  a  reverse  osmosis  water
[238:01] filter  installed  into  my  house  it's  not 
 as  complicated  as  it  seems  but  if  you  go 
 onto  Amazon  and  search  for  r  o  reverse
[238:08] osmosis  water  filter  you'll  see  that 
 they're  like  a  few  hundred  dollars  and 
 you  might  need  to  like  pay  someone  some
[238:13] I  don't  know  I  think  my  dad  did  it  for 
 me  but  like  you  might  need  to  like  pay 
 someone  like  fifty  dollars  to  come
[238:18] around  that  again  is  like  that's  gonna 
 filter  out  the  water  so  you're  not 
 drinking  water  that's  got  estrogenics  in
[238:24] so  like  a  testosterone  is  not  being 
 affected  because  tap  water  is  not  even 
 like  safe  to  drink  how  [ __ ]  is  that
[238:29] people  don't  even  know  this  and  for  500 
 you  can  save  yourself 
 when  you  live  with  your  woman
[238:35] and  you  want  to  get  pregnant  and  have  a 
 child  with  her 
 you  know  she's  drinking  like  poisoned
[238:41] birth  control  water 
 think  about  how  mad  this  is  there's 
 literally  like  birth  control  hormones
[238:47] you  know  the  pill  that  women  take  a  lot 
 of  women  take  every  day  that's  not 
 filtered  out  from  the  water  system  and
[238:52] so  when  you  drink  tap  water  that's 
 literally  like  it's  not  filtered  out  so 
 you're  drinking  [ __ ]  birth  control 
 which  is  [ __ ]  up  your  your  health
[238:58] when  your  woman  drinks  it  when  she's 
 pregnant  with  your  child  she's  drinking 
 birth  control  while  she's  pregnant  your
[239:05] child  is  in  her  stomach  and  she's 
 drinking  the 
 like  the  diluted  version  of  the  pill
[239:10] that  women  take  to  to  not  be  able  to 
 have  children
[239:17] five  hundred  dollars  to  potentially  save 
 a  [ __ ]  miscarriage
[239:22] that's  a  high  Roi
[239:30] you  can  see  why  I  think  this  is  one  of 
 the  best  ways  to  spend  money  is  make 
 sure  your  health  is  top  tier  health
[239:37] coaches  as  well  you  can  go  find  like 
 online  pts  and  everything  kind  of  relate 
 it's  like  the  skill  section  but  you  can
[239:42] go  find  some  teachers  and  some  coaches 
 who  will  literally  look  after  your  sleep 
 they'll  track  if  like  you  know  they'll 
 get  all  the  data  from  like  you  wearing
[239:48] the  ring  and  they'll  tell  you  okay  yeah 
 try  this  try  drinking  this  tea  let's  see 
 the  stats  and  everything  that  can  be
[239:53] powerful  and  even  private  healthcare  in 
 the  UK  we  have  the  NHS  but  it's  not  very
[239:59] good  and  so  I  only  go  private  I  had  a 
 surgery  recently  for  varica  like  I  had 
 this  thing  which  you  might  even  have
[240:05] which  is  like  the  veins  in  your 
 testicles  are  like  too  big  and  it  causes 
 like  too  much  heat  which  lowers
[240:10] testosterone  and  fertility  and  to  get  an 
 appointment  with  the  NHS  would  have 
 taken  like  six  months
[240:16] you  pay  private  pay  four  thousand  pounds 
 the  surgeries  next  week
[240:23] very  powerful  and  level  5  the  best  use 
 of  money  possible  in  my  opinion  Saving
[240:31] Time  spending  money  to  save  your  time  is 
 the  highest  Roi  thing  because  with  your
[240:36] time  then  you  can  do  everything  else  so 
 all  of  the  other  levels  here  are 
 unlocked  when  you've  got  the  free  time
[240:42] to  pursue  them  so  this  is  literally  the 
 priority  any  money  you  can  spend  to  save 
 your  time  is  very  powerful  and  I
[240:48] realized  this  as  I  was  becoming  an 
 entrepreneur  in  2019  when  I  was  playing 
 with  this  idea  of  becoming  an
[240:53] entrepreneur  I  realized  what  I  was  going 
 to  do  I  was  going  to  save  up  some  money
[240:58] and  invest  that  but  not  in  real  estate 
 not  in  like  you  know  the  the  stocks  or
[241:03] crypto  or  any  [ __ ]  like  that  but 
 rather  just  keep  it  in  my  bank  account 
 and  essentially  view  it  as  an  investment
[241:10] for  the  next  like  three  months  of  Runway 
 so  I  didn't  need  to  work  a  job
[241:16] mark  my  words  when  I  say  this  this  is 
 going  to  sound  weird  but  because  no  one 
 else  has  said  this  before  but  mark  my
[241:21] words  the  greatest  investment  that  you 
 could  possibly  make  is  saving  up  a
[241:27] couple  of  months  of  expenses  and  then 
 being  able  to  quit  your  job  and  give 
 yourself  some  Runway  so  that  you  can  go
[241:32] and  start  a  business 
 the  greatest  investment  is  one  in  your
[241:37] time  this  doesn't  sound  as  cool  of  like 
 an  investment  as  real  estate  but  if  you 
 save  up  like  2  000  pounds  and  you  don't
[241:44] need  to  work  for  the  next  like  six 
 months  because  you  live  at  home  with 
 family  so  you've  got  like  no  expenses
[241:49] you've  just  given  yourself  six  months  of 
 life
[241:54] can  you  comprehend  that  you've  just 
 given  yourself  six  months  of  Life  of 
 like  40  hours  or  50  hours  a  week
[242:00] including  commutes  just  gone  you  don't 
 need  to  work  that  anymore  for  any  guys 
 out  there  who  are  working  full-time  at  a
[242:06] job  that  they  hate  this  is  the  greatest 
 move  they  could  pull  this  save  up  a  few 
 thousand  pounds  just  move  back  to  your
[242:11] parents  if  you  need  to  save  up  like  six 
 months  worth  of  your  bills  and  literally 
 just  go  all  in  on  your  business  don't
[242:17] work  a  normal  shitty  job  just  go  all  in 
 on  your  business  for  like  six  months  to 
 save  your  time  you  can  also  get  services
[242:22] like  meal  prep  so  I  had  one  where  they 
 would  deliver  it  to  me  like  every  week
[242:28] and  they'd  be  like  20  meals  I'd  have 
 like  three  a  day  or  something  and  that 
 means  that  you  don't  need  to  go  shopping 
 for  groceries  because  it  gets  delivered
[242:34] to  you  and  you  just  you  know  choose  the 
 one  that  you  want  on  the  website  it 
 means  that  you  don't  even  need  to  cook 
 because  you  just  put  it  in  the  oven  for
[242:39] like  15  minutes  instead  of  you  needing 
 to  like  chop  things  or  prepare  things 
 it's  literally  just  ready  to  go  in  the 
 oven  and  it  even  means  you  don't  even
[242:45] need  to  clean  up  because  the  little  car 
 body  like  thing  that  like  the  bowl  of  it 
 you  just  throw  it  away  afterwards
[242:51] there's  no  cleaning  up  with  the  washing 
 up  liquid  or  anything  like  that  it  will 
 literally  save  you  about  500  hours  a
[242:57] year 
 that's  [ __ ]  huge  hiring  people  to  do
[243:02] things  so  that  you  don't  need  to  do  them 
 will  also  save  you  time  the  best  hire 
 that  I  can  think  of  for  you  it's  gonna
[243:08] sound  super  odd 
 it's  to  hire  a  sibling  specifically  a
[243:13] sibling  or  a  family  member  who  lives  in 
 your  home  because  if  you  like  the 
 conventional  advice  people  will  say  is
[243:18] like  oh  yeah  hire  a  personal  assistant 
 but  there's  a  lot  of  friction  so  that 
 you  you  don't  even  know  how  it  works 
 it's  a  bit  complicated  do  you  want  to
[243:24] give  them  your  card  details  but  if  you 
 hire  your  sibling  and  you  literally  say 
 to  your  sibling  like  save  me  time  and
[243:30] I'll  give  you  a  few  hundred  pounds  a 
 month  they  probably  do  it  or  maybe  your 
 father  would  probably  do  it  right  and  it
[243:36] means  that  they  could  do  all  your  chores 
 for  you  it  means  that  they  can  even  like 
 you  know  look  at  your  emails  and  make
[243:41] sure  if  there's  anything  important  they 
 send  it  to  you  if  it's  not  important  you 
 don't  even  ever  look  at  your  emails  like 
 I  haven't  been  on  my  emails  in  about  two
[243:47] years  now  my  sister  for  example  she  even 
 does  like  some  of  the  YouTube  stuff  so 
 when  my  videos  are  done  she'll  schedule
[243:52] it  for  me  so  it  saves  me  a  few  minutes 
 there  my  water  bottles  she'll  literally 
 just  walk  into  my  room  take  my  water
[243:57] bottles  go  and  fill  them  up  and  bring 
 them  back  up  again  minutes  here  minutes 
 here  minutes  here  she  checks  my  emails 
 or  even  my  post  she'll  open  it  as  well
[244:03] and  like  if  it's  something  important 
 she'll  come  give  it  to  me  if  it's  not  I 
 don't  need  to  see  it  it  sounds  odd  but
[244:08] it's  like  paying  your  siblings  or  one  of 
 your  family  members  maybe  even  your 
 mother  or  something  and  just  telling
[244:14] them  like  I  just  want  to  focus  on  my 
 business  as  much  as  possible  if  you  can 
 save  me  10  20  30  minutes  a  few  different
[244:20] times  in  the  day  if  you  can  just  make 
 the  food  and  literally  bring  it  up  to  me 
 if  when  I  want  like  a  cup  of  tea  or
[244:25] coffee  you  would  just  make  it  and  it 
 wouldn't  feel  kind  of  weird  between  us 
 for  you  being  servants  or  anything  but 
 you  would  be  like  happy  to  do  it  to  kind
[244:31] of  support  me  just  do  that  I  think 
 specifically  hiring  like  a  family  member 
 is  valuable  because  they're  already  in
[244:37] the  house  they're  all  ready  they  get 
 this  intimate  level  where  like  you  know 
 a  personal  assistant  online  can  do  some
[244:42] emails  and  stuff  but  a  sibling  in  your 
 house  can  literally  like 
 Hoover  your  room  and  can  get  your
[244:48] clothes  ready  and  can  fill  up  your  water 
 bottles  and  save  you  five  minutes  here 
 10  minutes  here  five  minutes  here  that
[244:53] sounds  like  small  amounts  this  is  how 
 you  get  to  the  next  level  you  prioritize 
 your  time  you  put  your  time  into  your
[244:58] business  to  do  those  deep  work  tasks  you 
 can  also  invest  in  a  home  gym  you  don't 
 need  a  full-on  setup  all  you  actually
[245:04] really  need  is  two  kettlebells  so  I  just 
 went  on  Amazon  I  searched  for 
 kettlebells  I  got  20  kg  and  I  literally
[245:09] just  did  like  an  eight  minute  workout 
 every  day  instead  of  doing  my  normal 
 like  one  and  a  half hour  of  routine  and
[245:15] you  know  you  need  to  get  ready  and  go  to 
 the  gym  and  everything  the  most  progress 
 I've  ever  made  in  business  was  earlier
[245:20] this  year  when  I  stopped  going  to  the 
 gym  and  all  I  was  doing  was  like  those 
 home  workouts  quick  five  ten  minutes  a
[245:25] day  and  then  back  to  work  again  and  you 
 might  be  wondering  about  the  actual 
 Investments  so  people  talk  about  crypto
[245:31] and  real  estate  and  stocks  I've  always 
 had  a  very  different  opinion  about  that 
 and  I'll  just  give  you  mine  you  might
[245:37] want  to  take  someone  else's  advice  but 
 this  is  what  served  me  well  I  don't 
 think  it's  worth  looking  into  investing
[245:42] money  like  real  estate  because  when  you 
 become  a  businessman  the  truth  is  that 
 the  highest  just  Roi  you're  going  to  get
[245:48] is  first  of  all  on  yourself  like  on 
 these  levels  you  know  Saving  Time  health 
 and  everything  right  and  your  skills  but
[245:54] after  that  it's  like  just  spend  more 
 money  on  your  business  the  highest  Roi 
 you're  going  to  get  is  if  you  just  hire
[246:00] more  people  spend  more  money  on  your 
 business  pay  for  like  advertisements 
 learn  those  things  it's  such  a  higher
[246:07] Roi  than  just  buying  it  you  know  like 
 what  your  parents  would  suggest  or  what 
 some  YouTuber  tells  you  like  yeah  our
[246:12] real  estate's  so  awesome  and  this  is 
 awesome  you  know  why  because  the  best 
 investment  advice  that  I  have  seen
[246:17] online  so  far  is  to  invest  in  the  things 
 that  you  actually  know  too  many  young
[246:23] people  are  being  told  they  get  invest  in 
 stocks  invest  in  real  estate  be  honest 
 bro  do  you  really  understand  real  estate
[246:29] do  you  really  understand  like  the 
 infrastructure  of  a  house  what  materials 
 it's  made  if  it's  triple  glazed  or
[246:35] quadruple  glazed  windows  and  how  much 
 that  will  change  its  ability  to  sell  10 
 years  from  now  do  you  really  understand
[246:40] like  the  market  of  like  a  city  if  you  do 
 fair  enough  but  for  most  guys  it's  like 
 you  probably  don't  and  you're  probably
[246:46] just  thinking  like  oh  but  I  thought  you 
 know  I  could  just  rent  it  out  and  you 
 know  every  year  the  price  goes  up  right 
 I  don't  think  that's  a  good  idea  because
[246:51] do  you  really  want  to  be  powerless  in 
 your  Investments  you  buy  a  house  if  your 
 whole  country's  Market  goes  down  like
[246:56] you  didn't  get  any  control  of  that  you 
 buy  a  stock  or  index  funds  and  other
[247:01] people  are  controlling  the  the  price  of 
 it  crypto  it's  like  nobody  [ __ ]  knows 
 like  what  the  hell  is  happening  with  the
[247:07] price  of  crypto  but  with  your  own 
 business  you  reinvested  in  that  you  look 
 for  ways  that  you  could  spend  money  in 
 your  own  business  and  you  can  forcefully
[247:14] make  your  business  worth  more 
 so  to  date  even  though  I  make  like  a
[247:19] fair  amount  of  money  I'm  not  even 
 considering  any  kind  of  normal 
 investments  just  putting  it  back  into
[247:25] the  business  why  invest  in  real  estate 
 when  you've  got  a  business  and  you've 
 got  all  that  extra  [ __ ]  to  think  about 
 like  where's  the  house  and  you  know  it's
[247:30] kind  of  new  dopamine  where  it's  like  oh 
 yeah  I'm  gonna  make  so  much  money  you 
 know  house  prices  always  go  up  but  then
[247:35] you  have  to  go  and  find  the  house  then 
 you've  got  to  go  and  find  like  the  way 
 to  rent  it  out  and  you've  got  like  these 
 people  coming  in  into  the  house  and
[247:41] they've  made  some  damages  and  this  and 
 this  and  here  you  are  literally  like 
 you've  got  this  business  and  you're 
 spending  more  time  literally  fighting
[247:47] over  the  house  which  you're  getting  like 
 700  a  month  in  rent  oh  but  it  goes  up  by
[247:52] like  30  000  a  year  that's  3K  a  month  bro 
 by  this  point  when  you  can  afford  the
[247:58] house  your  business  is  probably  doing  10 
 15  20K  a  month  why  would  you  wanna  like 
 like  deviate  your  attention  away  I've
[248:04] seen  I've  never  understood  it  so  I'm  not 
 going  to  advise  you  to  to  get  into 
 normal  Investments  like  everyone  else 
 would  my  advice  to  you  is  literally  just
[248:10] keep  investing  back  into  your  business 
 step  14  and  now  you  realize  the  truth
[248:15] props  it  might  take  you  a  few  years  to 
 get  to  this  point  I  hope  that  it  doesn't 
 take  you  much  longer  than  that  but  you
[248:20] will  realize  at  a  certain  point  if  you 
 allow  yourself  to  if  you  take  a  step
[248:25] back  from  your  work  and  sometimes  you  go 
 out  into  the  mountains  and  you  you 
 broaden  your  horizon  like  your  visual
[248:31] spatial  field 
 you'll  start  to  get  the  thoughts  that 
 like  working  so  hard  and  making  more
[248:37] money  isn't  actually  as  productive  as 
 you  think  it  is  what  I'm  saying  right 
 now  will  scare  you  and  cause  fear  inside
[248:43] of  you  maybe  some  kind  of  sadness  or 
 agitation  I  don't  expect  you  to  listen 
 to  this  right  now  but  if  you  just  Heed
[248:49] These  words  hopefully  this  will  come 
 back  up  again  for  you  in  a  few  years 
 most  men  waste  their  lives  working  for
[248:58] money 
 you  absolutely  need  money  and  you  should
[249:03] make  an  awesome  amount  of  it 
 but  to  waste  your  life  doing  it  is  a
[249:08] mistake  to  prioritize  making  money  over 
 prioritizing  your  purpose  your  masculine
[249:14] purpose  is  a  mistake 
 I  believe  that  money  should  be  used  for
[249:19] your  purpose  I  don't  think  that  the 
 pursuit  of  money  like  you  know  overly 
 working  should  be  used  as  a
[249:24] procrastination  from  your  purpose  and 
 I'm  guilty  of  this  all  the  time  it's  so 
 comforting  and  so  nice  to  work  it's
[249:29] almost  like  a  game  where  you  want  to  see 
 the  score  go  up 
 but  if  you're  pushing  off  your  purpose
[249:34] for  that  it's  actually  procrastination 
 you  call  it  a  game  well  it's  it's  very
[249:39] much  like  a  video  game  it's  just  it 
 becomes  a  bad  habit 
 you  should  absolutely  have  work  that  you
[249:44] love  that  feels  like  positive 
 contribution  to  the  world 
 making  a  bunch  of  money  at  the  same  time
[249:50] is  really  awesome  you  get  to  enjoy  like 
 you  know  some  of  the  finer  things  in 
 life  that  are  a  little  bit  pricey  but
[249:55] try  not  to  sacrifice  your  purpose  for  it 
 for  many  men  their  purpose  isn't
[250:00] actually  to  make  money  for  most  men 
 honestly  I  don't  believe  that  there's  a 
 man  out  there  whose  purpose  is  genuinely
[250:06] just  just  make  money  I  don't  like  you 
 know  your  purpose  is  like  your  souls 
 your  your  body's  reason  for  existing
[250:12] your  body  and  your  soul  was  not  put  here 
 to  just  make  money 
 perhaps  to  create  an  impact  or  to
[250:17] contribute  to  the  people  that  you  care 
 about  perhaps  maybe  it  was  for 
 fatherhood  who  knows  what  what  it  is
[250:23] but  just  be  careful  not  to  spend  all 
 your  your  life  all  your  hours  grinding 
 away  before  you  realize
[250:29] that  you've  just  wasted  a  lot  of  it  that 
 the  extra  numbers  in  your  bank  account 
 didn't  actually  make  a  difference  and
[250:35] that  if  you  spent  those  years  pursuing 
 your  purpose  that  would  have  actually 
 changed  your  life  and  improved  your  life 
 even  further  whether  you  make  two
[250:41] thousand  dollars  a  month  or  two  hundred 
 thousand  a  month 
 the  real  quality  of  life  comes  from  the
[250:48] spiritual  path  it  comes  from  those 
 immeasurable  things  like  mindfulness
[250:53] gratitude  love  community 
 again  this  isn't  me  saying  yeah  don't
[250:58] make  money  and  money  is  so  evil  no  no  no 
 money's  fun  to  make  it's  awesome  to  work 
 and  to  contribute  and  to  provide  value
[251:04] to  others  business  is  awesome 
 but  do  so
[251:09] whilst  you  prioritize  your  purpose 
 if  your  calendar  doesn't  reflect  this  if
[251:15] every  day  you  grind  at  your  work  whilst 
 calling  yourself  a  purposeful  man  but 
 realizing  that  your  purpose  is  maybe
[251:20] fatherhood  and  you're  spending  almost  no 
 time  developing  that  in  your  all  your 
 time  in  front  of  your  computer  screen
[251:26] it's  procrastination  this  is  just  a 
 message  to  my  younger  self  that  this  is 
 how  I've  lived  for  the  past  couple  of
[251:31] months  when  I  should  have  been  pursuing 
 my  purpose  more 
 I  hope  that  you're  able  to  free  yourself
[251:39] from  the  the  need  the  disease  of  like 
 needing  as  much  money  as  possible
[251:44] because  too  many  men  waste  their  lives 
 like  that  when  there's  bigger  more 
 ambitious  things  that  we  can  aim  for
[251:53] hope  that  this  guide  serves  you  well 
 and  helps  you  complete  this  layer  of 
 your  obsession  of  your  desire
[251:59] much  faster  than 
 most  other  people  do  when  you're 
 speaking  to  someone  who  would  need  this
[252:04] advice  whether  it's  in  person  or  online 
 please  mention  it  to  them  just  hey  you
[252:09] should  watch  hamza's  full  guide  on 
 making  money  if  you  write  that  in  some 
 comments  around  the  internet  if  you  send
[252:14] the  link  over  to  some  people  if  you 
 mention  it  to  a  friend  that  would  spread 
 this  wisdom  to  them  so  that  they  can
[252:19] Achieve  Financial  Freedom  alongside  you 
 click  and  watch  this  video  right  now  do 
 the  hard  work  especially  when  you  don't
[252:25] feel  like  it  mwah
"
7ZTsqm1ilp0,"[00:00] there  isn't  a  single  YouTuber  out  there 
 who  has  spoke  about  this  monk  mode 
 protocol
[00:05] this  is  the  most  extreme  protocol  that  I 
 found  three  years  ago  on  this
[00:12] this 
 underground  group  that's  what  we'll  call 
 them  that  no  longer  really  exist
[00:19] this  is  the  hardest  mug  mode  protocol 
 out  there 
 and  it's  not  one  of  those  average  ones
[00:24] where  you're  supposed  to  meditate  for  10 
 minutes  a  day  and  not  not  drink  coffee 
 or  something
[00:29] this  is  specifically  for  the  men  who 
 genuinely  need  to  fix  their  lives
[00:35] if  you  look  around  right  now 
 and  your  room
[00:40] is  filthy 
 and  your  mind  is  filthy
[00:46] and  your  body  is  flabby 
 and  you  need  something  extreme  to  change
[00:53] your  life 
 then  this  is  probably  going  to  be  the 
 monk  mode  protocol  for  you
[01:02] I  was  in  this  position  about  three  years 
 ago  exactly  three  years  ago  today 
 exactly  three  years  ago  March  2020
[01:10] that  was  the  month  of  the  months 
 where  I  used  to  stay  up  late  till  2  3  4
[01:17] A.M 
 and  I  used  to  go  on  the  website  for  Chan 
 I  used  to  be  like  you  don't  understand
[01:22] this  bro 
 I  used  to  be  a  four  Channel  if  you  don't 
 know  what  4chan  is  it's  like  one  of  the
[01:28] most  like  [ __ ]  disgusting  dirty 
 websites  out  there
[01:33] it's  like  it's  where  the  full-on 
 degenerates  go  and  I  used  to  be  the  guy 
 who'd  go  on  there  till  4am  watching  like
[01:40] disgusting  porn 
 just  wasting  time  I'd  be  high  as  [ __ ] 
 whilst  doing  it
[01:46] I  used  to  literally  fap  at  least  five 
 times  a  day
[01:53] I'd  literally 
 I  would  wake  up  right 
 I'd  wake  up  I'd  go  to  the  toilet  I
[01:59] always  needed  like  I  I've  always  needed 
 this  [ __ ]  in  the  morning  it's  just 
 something  I  don't  know  so  I  wake  up  have
[02:04] a  [ __ ]  first  thing  right 
 and  these  were  the  months  where  I  used 
 to  have  a  [ __ ]  and  whilst  I  was  having  a
[02:09] [ __ ]  I  would  fap 
 every  morning
[02:14] and  I  actually  wanted  to  be  an 
 entrepreneur  I  wanted  to  be  like 
 successful  at  this  time  so  straight 
 afterwards  you  know  the  idea  would  be
[02:20] okay  come  on  let's  get  on  my  laptop 
 let's  learn  like  these  online  money 
 making  methods  like  Drop  Shipping  and
[02:25] writing  ebooks  and  like  coding  was 
 becoming  really  popular  at  the  start  of 
 of  covid
[02:30] so  I'm  trying  to  learn  how  to  like  make 
 a  website  or  some  [ __ ]  you  know  I'm  just 
 trying  loads  of  different  things  and  my 
 habits  are  so  terrible  I  needed  like  a
[02:37] complete  complete  Extreme  Makeover
[02:45] and  I  found  this  idea 
 and  genuinely  I  knew  what  I  was  about  to
[02:50] teach  you  in  in  this  video  was  gonna 
 work  for  me 
 I  went  from  being  a  full-on  degenerate
[02:56] who  was  broke 
 it's  a  long  story  but  I  literally  had 
 less  money  than  a  homeless  man  that  I
[03:01] was  hell  that  I  was  helping  there  was  a 
 homeless  guy  I  was  helping  he  literally 
 had  more  money  than  I  did
[03:08] bro 
 imagine  being  Broker  Than  a  homeless  guy 
 that  you're  helping
[03:21] for  some  dark  days  what  I'm  telling  you 
 right  now  doesn't  really  justify  uh  that 
 period  of  my  life
[03:27] I  am  um 
 I  will  have  a  book  published  about  my 
 life  later  on  this  year  it'll  be  like  my
[03:34] first  like  book  and  I  think  it'll  be 
 quite  inspiring  to  read  like  the  details 
 of  my  life  that  I  haven't  Dove  that
[03:40] deeply  into  on  YouTube  and  you'll  read 
 about  this  period  of  my  life  or  the  the
[03:45] details 
 me  helping  this  homeless  guy  whilst  I 
 was  broke  and 
 I  used  to  I  used  to  get  night  sweat  I
[03:52] couldn't  sleep  at  night  for  months 
 so  much  [ __ ]  I  was  going  through  around
[03:58] this  time 
 and  I  got  myself  out
[04:05] I  made  a  huge  change  to  my  life  I  got 
 onto  this  monk  mode  protocol  that  we're
[04:10] gonna  like  fully  I'm  gonna  give  you  this 
 full  guide  to  literally  all  you  just 
 have  to  do  is  just  not  be  a  Jeffrey  stop
[04:17] scrolling  down  to  the  comments  for  extra 
 dopamine  stop  looking  at  the  suggested 
 video  stop  checking  your  phone
[04:23] and  for  the  first  time  in  a  little  while 
 just  hold  direct  eye  contact  with  me
[04:28] right  now  and  throughout  this  video 
 this  video  is  fairly  long  so  100  if  you
[04:34] need  to  split  it  up  and  watch  a  little 
 bit  tomorrow  that's  absolutely  fine  but 
 for  what  any  minute  any  second  that
[04:40] you're  gonna  spend  on  this  video  give  it 
 like  full  attention  no  scrolling  down 
 make  it  full  screen  and  just  [ __ ]
[04:46] stare  at  me  practice  like  some  presents 
 like  you  know  really  really  invest  into
[04:52] this  mentally  and  think  okay  you  know 
 he's  describing  things  that  are  quite 
 similar  to  my  life  so  maybe  you  know  he
[04:58] got  himself  out  and  like  oh  [ __ ]  he's 
 got  two  million  subscribers  or  1.9 
 million  subscribers  so  you  know  he's 
 he's  probably  kind  of  successful  now  so
[05:03] it's  kind  of  insane  that  in  only  three 
 years  he's  been  able  to  transform  his 
 life
[05:11] because  if  you  can  relate  to  the  kind  of 
 life  that  I  had  just  three  years  ago 
 and  you  maybe  want  to  get  to  the  point
[05:17] where  I  am  now 
 with  quite  a  successful  business  and
[05:25] I  don't  know  man  it's  it's  always  looked 
 down  upon  to  talk  about  your  successes
[05:30] online  like  if  I  if  I  was  about  to  list 
 some  some  accomplishments  to  you  but 
 then  people  often  just  kind  of  think
[05:35] you're  a  bad  person  if  you  talk  about 
 your  success  online  I  think  that  comes 
 from  you  know  people's  own  um
[05:41] low  self-esteem  or  something
[05:47] but  maybe  you  can  just  speculate  what 
 kind  of  life  that  I  have  and  how  much 
 money  that  I  make  with  a  channel  this
[05:52] big 
 bearing  in  mind  that  being  a  YouTuber 
 was  genuinely  my  childhood  or  my  Teenage
[05:58] Dream
[06:04] so  what  I  did
[06:09] I  got  onto  this  monk  mode  protocol  that 
 we  can  describe  as  military  discipline
[06:16] I  copied  what  the  military  use  it's  a  TR 
 not  to  train
[06:22] but  to  destroy  their  new  recruits  I
[06:27] copied  what  the  military  do  to  destroy 
 their  newest  recruits  and  I  did  that 
 myself  without  being  in  the  military
[06:35] you  know  how  like  the  guys  who  want  to 
 join  the  Army  you  go  through  like  you 
 know  some  assessment  periods  whatever
[06:40] health  checks  but  then  if  you  do  get 
 accepted  and  enlisted  and  then  you  go 
 and  you  go  to  the  boot  camp  the  basic
[06:46] training  for  like  eight  weeks  and  it's 
 just  a  grueling  period  of  of  okay  5am 
 wake  up  5  30
[06:52] bed  and  uniform  inspection  6  a.m  drill  7 
 A.M  workout  9  A.M  eat  9  30  this  like
[07:01] don't  regimented  like  an  extreme  version 
 of  the  timetable  that  we  had  in  school 
 where  every  part  of  your  day  was  planned
[07:07] out  beforehand  and  you  had  to  be  the 
 this  extreme  discipline  that  you  would
[07:12] trim  your  hair  off  for 
 that  that  not  only  trains  the  young  men
[07:17] who  are  the  recruits  but  it  destroys 
 them  it  pushes  them  past  the  point  that 
 they  thought  they  could  ever  get  to
[07:23] and  then  pushes  them  past  that  point 
 it  destroys  them  and  rebuilds  them
[07:31] I  realize  that  this  is  actually  what  I 
 needed
[07:37] and  on  a  little  bit  of  a  side  track  I 
 did  actually  enlist  into  the  Royal  Air 
 Force  because  I  wanted  this  experience
[07:46] I  decided  to  be  a  YouTuber  instead  so  it 
 kind  of  worked  out  for  me  but  still
[07:52] the  idea  behind  all  this 
 was  just  copying  this  military
[07:57] discipline  and  and  to  be  productive  all 
 day  you  see  at  the  time  I  was  looking  at
[08:02] some  self-improvement  videos  like  you 
 might  do 
 and  I  was  honestly
[08:07] I  was  only  seeing  soft  [ __ ]  I 
 was  only  seeing  soft  guys  recommend  to
[08:12] you  like  cute  little  phrases  like  don't 
 push  yourself  too  hard  and  it's  about 
 the  journey  not  the  destination  and  and
[08:19] you  know  it's  okay  like  you  know  life's 
 about  balance  and  it's  okay  to  play  one 
 hour  video  games  it's  okay  to  you  know 
 just  eat  a  little  bit  of  junk  food  it's
[08:25] okay  to  smoke  a  little  bit  of  weed  maybe 
 for  healthy  people  maybe  for  normal 
 people  that's  fine
[08:31] but  I've  known  I'm  not  in  like  a  normal 
 average  person  I'm  not  a  mediocre  person
[08:36] so  that  hasn't  been  fine  for  me  because 
 I  am  a  shell  of  the  man  that  I'm 
 supposed  to  be  if  I  don't  live  to  my
[08:41] potential 
 and  I  think  you  should  say  that  I  think 
 you  should  like  whisper  those  words 
 outside  of  your  mouth  right  now  and  if
[08:47] you've  got  more  confidence  say  it  loudly 
 I  am  a  shell  of  the  man  that  I  am 
 supposed  to  be  if  I  do  not  live  to  my
[08:54] potential 
 and  one  hour  of  video  games  a  day  and  a 
 little  bit  of  weed  put  into  a  [ __ ]
[08:59] crack  pipe  like  that's  how  I  used  to 
 smoke  weed  is  not  like  it  rolled  up  into 
 a  smoking  joint  but  I  would  put  it  in  a
[09:05] pipe  and  like  all  that  or  like  in  a 
 [ __ ]  plastic  bong  that  crackheads  use 
 a  little  bit  of  that  like  would  any  of
[09:11] us  say  like  oh  guys  come  on  like  just 
 just  a  little  bit  of  Pawn  is  okay
[09:17] no 
 I  couldn't  have  lived  like  that 
 I'm  a  very  extreme  guy  and  and  when  you
[09:24] are  like  me 
 your  life  is  going  to  be  one  of  the  two 
 extremes  either  you're  going  to  be
[09:29] extremely  [ __ ]  up  and  you  need  to  fix 
 your  life  or  you're  going  to  be 
 extremely  successful
[09:35] and  I  think  the  beautiful  thing  about 
 the  internet  about  what  you're  literally 
 watching  right  now
[09:40] not  to  sound  like  egotistical  or 
 something  but  you're  genuinely  watching 
 like  you're  listening  to  someone  who's
[09:45] giving  you  advice  who  has  crossed  this 
 I  have  bridged  this  Gap  from  extremely
[09:51] stupid  extremely  lazy  extremely  weak 
 extremely  drug  addicted  extremely  sex
[09:57] addicted 
 to  what  a  lot  of  people  would  call 
 extremely  successful
[10:05] I'm  certainly  not  all  the  way  there  I've 
 got  so  much  more  to  learn  and  you  know 
 to  keep  building
[10:12] but  this  is  the  beauty  this  is  the 
 beauty 
 you're  learning  today  from  someone  who's
[10:17] actually  done  this  journey 
 because  at  the  time  when  I  was  looking 
 at  like  self-improvement  advice  and  you
[10:23] know  how  to  like  stop  playing  video 
 games  and  everything  and  everyone's 
 telling  me  like  oh  you  know  but  you  know 
 like  just  if  you  want  to  play  one  hour  a
[10:29] day  that  you  know  you  go  ahead  and  you 
 know  like  this  and 
 I  was  just  thinking  like
[10:34] I  can't  relate  to  any  of  these 
 [ __ ]  giving  advice  online 
 I  needed  someone  who  was  quite  extreme
[10:39] who  was  gonna  tell  me  like  you're  better 
 than  playing  even  one  second  of  video 
 games
[10:45] and  so  I  became  that  person  for  myself 
 and  so 
 I'm  going  to  walk  you  through  the  exact
[10:50] process  that  I  did 
 and  I  think  this  will  change  your  life
[10:56] as  much  as  it  changed  mine 
 at  the  time  of  recording  this  video
[11:01] we're  close  to  the  end  of  March  in  2023 
 and  I'd  like  you  now
[11:07] just  to  prep  ourselves  and  get  ready  for 
 the  four  steps  of  this  protocol  it's 
 just  to  close  your  eyes
[11:13] and  just  to  imagine  what  you  want  the 
 end  of  this  year  to  be  like 
 what  you  want  December  to  be  like
[11:23] what  do  you  want  to  be  like  who  do  you 
 want  to  be  what  goals  do  you  want  to 
 accomplish  and  how  will  it  feel  when 
 you've  accomplished  those  goals  and  you
[11:29] walk  past  the  people 
 who  doubted  you
[11:34] and  also  how  would  it  feel 
 when  you're  surrounded  by  the  people  who
[11:39] always  believed  in  you  and  they  do 
 finally  see  that  you've  lived  up  to  your 
 potential
[11:45] the  Pats  on  the  back 
 the  warm  welcome  the  respect
[11:51] the  improved  posture  the  way  that  you 
 carry  yourself  now 
 the  way  that  your  shirt  fits  tight  on
[11:57] your  sleeves  because  you've  been  hitting 
 the  gym  hard  and  you've  been  improving 
 your  diets
[12:03] how  awesome  it  feels  that  when  you  do 
 finally  go  out  with  a  bunch  of  good 
 people
[12:08] you  cover  the  bill  like  it's  nothing 
 because  you  are  that  one  now
[12:13] and  you  can  get  to  that  point  faster 
 than  you  think  it  can 
 the  protocol  that  we're  about  to  discuss
[12:18] today  has  four  steps  and  you  must  go 
 through  each  step  consecutively  like  one
[12:24] two  three  four  you  must  do  that  there's 
 gonna  be  points  in  each  of  these  steps 
 that  you're  not  going  to  want  to  do  and
[12:30] there's  going  to  be  points  in  each  of 
 these  steps  that  your  brain  is  going  to 
 start  to  convince  you  and  say  like  oh  no 
 no  you  don't  need  to  do  that  one  yeah  no
[12:36] that's  a  bit  extreme  don't  do  that 
 I  want  to  tell  you  right  now
[12:42] you  are  where  you  are  because  you've 
 listened  to  your  brain 
 so  if  you  look  around  right  now  and
[12:47] again  there's  filth  if  you  look  at  your 
 bank  balance  and  it's  filth
[12:52] if  you  aren't  at  a  good  place  in  life  if 
 you're  a  bad  place  where  you  need  to 
 watch  a  video  like  this  which  is  about
[12:57] how  to  fix  your  life  I'm  telling  you 
 right  now  your  brain  got  you  here
[13:02] for  a  lot  of  people  out  in  the  world  you 
 can't  actually  trust  your  brain  you
[13:07] trusted  your  brain  and  it  got  you  to 
 this  moment  that  you  need  to  fix  your 
 life 
 some  of  the  best  advice  I  ever  heard  was
[13:13] don't  trust  your  own  Brain  Trust  the 
 brain  of  the  person  who's  achieved  what 
 you  want  to  achieve
[13:19] you  trusted  your  brain  and  you  it  led  up 
 to  you  being  in  this  moment  right  now 
 when  you're  probably  broken  on  her
[13:25] unhappy  unhealthy 
 so  when  you're  you're  Jeffrey  brain  when
[13:30] your  lizard  brain  does  pipe  up  and  it 
 does  tell  you  like  oh  no  you  don't  need 
 to  do  do  what  he's  saying  right  now  nah
[13:36] nah  nah  you  don't  have  to  do  that 
 just  understand  that  when  you  have 
 listened  to  your  brain  it  hasn't  LED  you
[13:41] to  a  good  place  in  life 
 let's  go  over  the  four  Pro  steps  of  this
[13:47] protocol  the  first  step  is  to  set 
 reasonable  goals
[13:52] you  see  a  lot  of  people  get  onto  monk 
 mode  or  onto  a  period  where  they  want  to
[13:57] improve  their  lives  like  you've  probably 
 tried  to  improve  your  life  before  but 
 here's  the  issue  when  you  don't  set  a 
 clear  goal  when  you  don't  have  like  a
[14:04] piece  of  paper  like  maybe  I  should  just 
 show  you  you  want  to  see  something 
 look  this  is  literally  my  wall
[14:11] I  have  pieces  of  paper  over  my  wall 
 with  my  goals  written  on  them  and  my
[14:16] plans  what  what  the  paper  like  I  know 
 you're  probably  trying  to  pause  the 
 video  I  think  anyway  I  need  to  see  what
[14:21] it  says  it  doesn't  matter  what  it  says 
 it's  just  simply  my  goals  you  don't  need 
 to  copy  exactly  what  it  says  it's  just
[14:26] literally  okay  I've  got  goals  I've  got 
 notes  and  stuff 
 we're  the  extreme  kind  of  guy  where  we
[14:31] need  to  put  our  goals  in  our  face  you 
 know  some  some  guys  can  literally  just 
 think  of  a  new  goal  and  just  go  and 
 achieve  it  we're  the  kind  of  people  that
[14:37] we  need  to  like  think  of  a  new  goal  set 
 it  as  our  phone  wallpaper  literally 
 write  it  on  paper  and  stick  it  up  on  our
[14:42] [ __ ]  wall  stick  it  up  on  our  door  and 
 everything  to  kind  of  remind  ourselves 
 like  to  obsess  over  it  with  just  those
[14:48] kinds  of  people  we  need  to  be  quite 
 extreme 
 we  need  to  set  reasonable  goals  and
[14:54] specifically  do  sets  written  out  goals 
 for  this  because  a  lot  of  guys  will  try 
 to  improve  their  lives  like  you  may  have
[14:59] and  within  three  days  you  kind  of  lose 
 direction  get  a  bit  bored  it's  a  little 
 bit  too  hard  and  then  you  go  back  to
[15:05] watching  Rick  and  Morty  and  playing 
 video  games  with  your  Discord  friends 
 again  has  that  not  happened  to  you
[15:10] before 
 we  can't  have  that  happen  again  and  the 
 reason  why  this  happens  the  reason  why 
 you  make  a  little  bit  of  progress  and
[15:15] then  you  snap  back  to  where  you  were  is 
 because  you  didn't  set  this  clear  goal
[15:20] to  actually  reach  for  you  didn't  set 
 this  goal  that  you  genuinely  believed 
 you  could  achieve
[15:26] interestingly  before  I  have  said  that  we 
 should  set  massive  goals  I  think  that  we 
 should  be  very  ambitious  men  but
[15:32] when  you're  at  this  point  right  now  when 
 you  need  to  fix  your  life 
 this  is  so  interesting  if  you  set  a  big
[15:38] goal  right  now 
 it  will  actually  be  a  bad  thing  for  you
[15:44] remember  that  if  we  set  a  big  goal  right 
 now  really  big  audacious  you  know
[15:49] ambitious  goals  like  yeah  I  want  to  be 
 really  rich  in  a  year  or  something  it 
 will  be  a  bad  thing  because  you  simply
[15:54] don't  have  the  capacity  for  that  so  this 
 is  gonna  somewhat  hurt  our  egos  but  also
[15:59] slightly  excite  us  because  it's 
 something  we  haven't  tried  we  need  to 
 set  such  a  reasonable  goal
[16:05] that  is  almost  gonna  seem  like  it's 
 below  us  and  we're  gonna  think  again 
 we're  almost  gonna  be  smug  like  yeah  I 
 could  do  that  easily
[16:14] there's  a  lot  of  people  online  right  now 
 who  say  that  you  shouldn't  set  goals  and 
 that  the  journey  is  better  than  the
[16:20] destination  and  that  with  systems  you 
 know  James  Clear  in  his  book  Atomic 
 habits  says  this  and  a  lot  of  people 
 start  pirating  it  our  systems  over  goals
[16:27] you  should  just  you  know  know  like  what 
 habits  and  systems  to  do  over  goals  it's 
 like  all  of  that  is  is  brain  dead  to  me
[16:32] because  the  reason  why  we  set  systems 
 the  reason  why  we  develop  habits  is  for
[16:37] the  goal  with  the  goal  is  like  the 
 navigation  this  is  like  like  when  you 
 get  into  like  in  a  car  you  know  where
[16:42] you're  going  that's  the  whole  point  you 
 set  the  goal  okay  I  want  to  go  to  this 
 this  shop  over  there  that's  the  goal
[16:48] then  you  focus  on  the  road  but  once  you 
 know  that  you're  going  to  that  goal  a
[16:53] lot  of  people  in  these  days  criticize 
 goal  setting  and  say  that  it's  not 
 needed  and  instead  you  should  just  do 
 like  systems  and  you  know  this  wholesome
[16:59] cute  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  that's  not  how  it  works 
 you  need  to  have  the  clear  goal  to  begin 
 with  and  then  you  do  the  [ __ ]  like
[17:05] systems  and  your  daily  habits  to  get 
 there
[17:10] this  is  what  we're  gonna  do  and  I  will 
 do  it  next  to  you  grab  a  piece  of  paper
[17:15] right  now  and  a  pen  you  can  use  a 
 computer  or  a  phone  or  whatever  you  want
[17:20] to  do  but  find  somewhere  that  we  can 
 write  I'm  gonna  do  this  together  right 
 now  so  if  right  now  your  brain's  already 
 telling  you  that  yeah  yeah  just  continue
[17:25] watching  I'll  do  this  later  that  means 
 you're  a  [ __ ]  get  ready  to  write  right 
 now  there's  no  excuses  this  is
[17:30] non-negotiable  if  you're  not  going  to 
 follow  these  steps  then  don't  watch  this 
 video 
 by  now  you  are  literally  ready  to  write
[17:37] agreed  you're  not  just  gonna  say  oh  I'll 
 do  this  later  do  this  with  me  right 
 in  this  paper
[17:43] we're  gonna  write  five  to  ten  goals  that 
 we  want  to  achieve  by  the  end  of  this 
 year  so  by  December  if  you're  watching
[17:48] this  video  later  on  and  it's  like 
 September  maybe  change  it  to  like  six 
 months  from  now  but  by  the  end  of  this
[17:53] year  through  the  month  of  December  we 
 want  to  achieve  these  goals  we're  going 
 to  write  five  to  ten  down  and  so  for
[17:58] example  I  could  say  one  thousand  Subs 
 that  could  be  like  my  first  goal  there
[18:03] one  thousand  Subs 
 go  and  you  do  this  now  right  five  to  ten
[18:08] goals 
 so  over  December  we'll  say  either  by  the
[18:13] end  of  the  new  year  or  maybe  what  I  like 
 to  do  personally  is  to  think  about  what 
 I  will  achieve  through  the  month  of
[18:19] December  so  over  December  I  will  make 
 500  dollars
[18:25] online 
 with  that  see  500  online
[18:32] by  the  end  of  the  year  I  will  also  bulk 
 up 
 15  pounds  gone  write  your  five  to  ten
[18:38] goals  right  now  and  I'll  write  mine  do 
 them  right  now  keep  the  video  playing 
 because  I'm  gonna  write  mine  right  now 
 we'll  do  this  together
[18:54] foreign
[19:03] what  do  you  want  to  achieve  by  the  end 
 of  the  year
[19:09] if  you've  got  five  to  ten  I've  got  six 
 right  now
[19:38] okay  I've  got  eight  done 
 we've  wrote  down  what  goals  we  hope  to
[19:43] achieve  by  the  end  of  the  year 
 we've  got  eight  I  told  you  to  write  five
[19:49] to  ten  right  I  want  you  to  look  at  this 
 list  right  now
[19:54] and  ask  yourself
[19:59] what  two  goals 
 let's  say  two  to  three  at  a  Max  three
[20:06] one  to  three 
 the  the less  you  choose  for  this  the 
 better  right  if  you  can  just  choose  one
[20:11] that's  even  better  if  you  can  choose  two 
 that's  pretty  good  if  you  can  choose 
 three  that's  acceptable  but  just  one 
 from  one  to  three
[20:17] what  one  to  three  goals  here 
 are  the  most  meaningful  most  impactful
[20:22] that  you  would  like  that  are  the 
 priority  look  around  for  these  like  up 
 to  three  you  can  choose  but  if  you
[20:28] choose  one  that's  way  better  if  there's 
 only  one  that  you  really  care  about  but 
 if  for  example  you  can  choose  up  to
[20:33] three  so  if  looking  at  this  list 
 check  out  the  three  that  you  think  that 
 will  change  your  life  the  most  that  you
[20:39] really  want  to  do  you  really  want  to 
 achieve 
 and  for  those  three  just  circle  them
[20:46] Circle  the  three  goals  or  up  to  three 
 goals  that  are  the  most  important
[20:55] so  mine  are  the  three  that  I  wrote  down 
 first 
 I've  got  one  thousand  Subs  500  a  month
[21:02] online 
 bulk  up  15  pounds  and  then  I  have
[21:07] encircled  the  ones  which  are  kind  of 
 less  important  and  they  are  go  traveling 
 make  a  Blog  learn  to  rap  run  a  marathon
[21:15] write  a  book  and  random  other  ones  right 
 you  right  now  should  have  some  goals
[21:20] which  are  circled  and  some  that  aren't 
 this  is  very  important
[21:26] the  goals  that  are  not  circled 
 cross  them  out
[21:32] aggressively  cross  them  out 
 because  it  is  these  goals
[21:41] it  is  these  goals 
 that  will  stop  you  from  achieving  the 
 ones  in  the  circle
[21:49] one  thing  that  I  should  have  said  just  a 
 few  minutes  ago  in  terms  of  what  we've 
 wrote  down  here
[21:54] we  should  also  write  down  the  the  real
[21:59] real  goals  that  you  have 
 you  see  what  we've  wrote  here  like  1  000
[22:04] subscribers  and  500  a  month  online  this 
 is  like  nice  boy  stuff  this  is  like  yeah
[22:09] guys  I  want  to  be  productive 
 but  you  should  also  know  right  now  and
[22:15] don't  [ __ ]  yourself 
 that  you  have  some  dark  desires  that  you 
 have  some  real  reasons  why  you  want  to
[22:21] achieve  these  things 
 you  probably  know  what  I'm  hinting  at
[22:26] we  all  have  these  like  real  goals  inside 
 of  our  mind  inside  of  our  hearts  and
[22:31] inside  of  our  genitals 
 and  it'd  be  worth  it  for  you  to  right 
 now  you  know  as  part  of  the  the  ones
[22:37] we've  just  scribbled  out 
 to  maybe  add  in  there  some  of  those
[22:43] that  show  you  know  the  eight  goals  that 
 I've  wrote  down  here  1  000  subscribers 
 and  learn  to  rap  These  are  nice
[22:49] but  actually  a  big  goal  that  you  have 
 maybe  to  try  and  [ __ ]  as  many  women  as
[22:55] possible 
 a  big  goal  that  you  have  maybe  to  try
[23:00] and  make  enough  money  to  buy  a  car 
 because  you  visualize  yourself  driving 
 through  the  streets  with  this  car  and
[23:06] hopefully  get  some  level  of  status  that 
 will  allow  you  to  sleep  with  more  girls
[23:11] maybe  you  want  to  go  party  maybe  you 
 want  to  go  take  some  drugs  maybe  you 
 finally  want  to  go  get  the  girl  or  make
[23:17] some  friends  who  you  know  might  not  be 
 good  for  you
[23:23] the  reason  why  I'm  making  you  do  this 
 practice  is  to  understand  that 
 we  only  have  a  limited  capacity  for  the
[23:30] things  that  we  can  accomplish  and  if  we 
 can  hyper  focus  on  just  a  few  things
[23:36] we  can  accomplish  them  but  when  we  open 
 up  the  desire  for  more  things  that  will
[23:41] actually  lead  to  less  success 
 these  three  goals  that  I've  circled  here
[23:47] 1  000  subscribers  five  hundred  dollars  a 
 month  online  and  both  got  15  pounds 
 they're  awesome  goals  but  if  I  also  try
[23:54] to  do  some  of  the  other  ones  like  go 
 traveling  and  write  a  blog  and  learn  to 
 rap  and  run  a  marathon  and  write  a  book
[23:59] those  would  actually  distract  you  to  the 
 point  that  you  achieve  nothing
[24:05] the  most  successful  guys  literally  just 
 focus  on  one  thing
[24:10] think  about  it  like  the  reason  why  you 
 look  up  to  a  particular  athlete 
 is  for  one  reason
[24:17] no  one  would  say  to  Mike  Tyson
[24:25] oh  but  you  you  you  you  can't  rap  though
[24:30] but  no  because  he  was  a  boxer 
 do  you  understand  what  I'm  getting  at
[24:35] here 
 the  route  to  success  that  you  actually
[24:41] really  need  is  to  simplify  your  life  and 
 to  destroy  these  distractions  these 
 other  desires  that  you  have
[24:47] and  to  just  focus  in  on  just  the  few 
 that  will  really  change  your  life  and  so 
 if  I  was  going  to  be  honest  to  you  when
[24:53] I  was  in  your  position  a  few  years  ago 
 and  I  was  like  you  know  really  thinking 
 okay  what  I  wanted  to  achieve  in  life
[24:59] I  would  have  wrote  on  this  paper  for 
 goal  number  nine 
 [ __ ]
[25:06] I  wanted  to  [ __ ]  a  lot  of  girls  I  would 
 have  wrote  as  number  10  party
[25:11] because  I  wanted  to  party  and  I  linked 
 that  to  [ __ ]  because  I  wanted  to 
 party  so  I  could  [ __ ]  more  girls
[25:18] and  buy  [ __ ] 
 buy  materialistic  objects
[25:24] probably  because  it  didn't  lead  to  me 
 [ __ ]  more  girls
[25:29] it's  worth  it  right  now  for  you  to  think 
 about  what  your  your  real  desires  are 
 and  you'd  have  to  tell  me  you'd  have  to
[25:34] write  them  on  paper 
 but  don't  [ __ ]  yourself  you  have 
 some  real  desires  that  you  don't  want  to
[25:39] talk  about 
 you  should  own  those  desires  you  should 
 not  be  afraid  of  them  you  should  not  be
[25:44] scared  of  them  in  the  modern  day  we're 
 so  scared  of  our  dark  desires 
 we're  so  scared  of  our  dark  desires  that
[25:51] sometimes  you  desire  to  to  violently 
 violently  dominate  another  man  violently
[25:57] brutally  dominate  a  woman 
 the  modern  day  we're  so  scared  to  say
[26:02] this 
 we  put  on  our  like  happy  faces  yep  yep
[26:07] see  we're  all  civil 
 you  have  inside  of  you  that  the  blood
[26:12] and  the  DNA  from  the  Vikings 
 the  merchants
[26:19] the  Warriors 
 you  have  inside  of  you
[26:24] the  DNA  of  a  man  in  your  bloodline 
 who  smiled  as  he  ripped  apart  another
[26:31] man  and  then  raped  his  wife
[26:37] in  the  modern  day  we  don't  talk  about 
 this  at  all 
 and  that's  actually  a  problem
[26:43] some  little  chump  can  watch  this  and 
 think  yep  see  hums  is  a  misogynist  and 
 he's  promoting  violence  and  like  no
[26:49] that's  clearly  not  what  we're  doing  here 
 we  should  acknowledge
[26:54] all  sides  to  ourselves  especially  our 
 shower  our  shadow  our  dark  side  we
[26:59] should  acknowledge  it  understand  it's 
 there 
 and  realize  how  we  can  even  harness  that
[27:05] dark  desire  for  a  positive  impact  on 
 ourselves  and  the  world
[27:11] you  see  when  I  did  this  and  I  realized 
 that  I  was  deeply  motivated  by  quite
[27:17] frankly  wanting  to  [ __ ]  as  many  girls  as 
 possible 
 this  is  when  my  motivation  to  be
[27:22] productive  and  successful  first  came  in 
 when  I  realized  that  this  was  a  desire 
 that  I  had  that  I  literally  like  if  I'm
[27:28] being  honest  to  you  bro  I  could  imagine 
 no  life  better  than  than  one  of  like
[27:33] Genghis  Khan  just  pillaging  Villages  and 
 stuff  and  taking  all  their  women  and 
 literally  having  thousands  of  babies  I
[27:40] know  that  this  is  [ __ ]  crazy  of 
 course  I'm  not  gonna  do  that  but  like  if 
 I  was  going  to  be  totally  honest  that's 
 like  I've  always  kind  of  felt  that  I've
[27:46] always  known  it  but  like  we  don't  talk 
 about  these  things  right  and  so  I  could 
 have  just  like  you  know  buried  it  deep 
 like  everyone  else  has  and  we've  all  got
[27:52] them  right  so  if  some  little  [ __ ] 
 skinny  neck  chump  is  going  to  look  at 
 this  and  be  like  yeah  this  is  so  evil 
 guys  it's  like  trust  me  the  guys  who
[27:58] think  that  what  we're  talking  about 
 right  now  is  evil  or  scary  they've  got 
 Works  worse  dark  desires  than  like  the
[28:04] guy  who  can  openly  say  it 
 but  what  I  realized  this  years  ago  that 
 I  was  deeply  motivated  by  this  idea  of
[28:10] like  dominating  and  spreading  my  seed 
 and  in  a  way  that  I'm  obviously  not
[28:15] gonna  do  Suddenly  It's  like  I  I  was  able 
 to  reframe  things  like  the  work  that  I'm
[28:20] doing  in  a  way  that  now  started  to 
 deeply  motivate  me  it  was  like  I  was 
 able  to  delude  myself  but  maybe  in  truth
[28:26] that  if  I  become  successful  in  YouTube 
 and  in  business  I  will  [ __ ]  more  girls
[28:33] I  will  elevate  my  status  to  a  point  then 
 where  there's  higher  quality  women
[28:39] who  want  me  to  impregnate  them 
 now  you've  never  heard  someone  talk  like 
 this  before
[28:45] this  is  just  unspoken  about  because  this 
 is  weird  this  is  abnormal  this  is  going
[28:50] to  get  me  branded  as  a  weird  person  but 
 I'm  telling  you  right  now  but  this  saved 
 my  life
[28:55] because  suddenly  I  integrated  that 
 shadow  inside  of  me  and  it  started  to
[29:00] fuel  the  good  habits  that  I  was  doing 
 and  of  course  I  haven't  went  to  any
[29:05] Village  in  [ __ ]  cut  a  man  open  in 
 half  and  raped  his  wife  of  course  if  not 
 bro  but  like  I  was  able  to  take  that
[29:11] core  dark  desire  that  is  inside  of  each 
 of  us  man  and  woman  child
[29:16] is  inside  of  each  of  us 
 and  reframe  that  in  a  way  that
[29:21] slingshotted  me  to  make  it  more  progress 
 on  my  goals 
 I  don't  expect  you  to  be  ready  for  this
[29:28] to  be  ready  to  do  this  task  maybe  you're 
 just  watching  this  thinking  okay  this  is 
 a  bit  weird  what  the  [ __ ]  happening  in 
 this  video  I  just  thought  that  he's  just
[29:33] gonna  teach  us  about  monkey  world  but  he 
 wants  us  to  rape  and  kill  some  people 
 like  no  I  totally  understand  if  you
[29:38] don't  understand  but  there's  gonna  be  a 
 moment  when  you'll  think  back  to  what 
 I'm  saying  here 
 and  you'll  think  oh  [ __ ]  I  could  have
[29:45] actually  made  this  progress  so  much 
 faster  if  I  just  really  thought  about 
 what  he  was  saying
[29:51] once  you  have  these  goals 
 this  is  the  direction  of  our  monk  mode
[29:56] for  me  the  three  goals  that  I  have 
 chosen  reflect  this  period  of  my  life
[30:01] which  is  all  about  business  and  health 
 my  first  goal  which  is  very  ambitious  is
[30:06] to  save  one  million  dollars  this  year 
 not  just  make  but  save  one  million
[30:11] dollars 
 that  means  I  need  to  make 
 just  over  100k  a  month  which  I  know
[30:17] sounds  silly  and  stuff  but  YouTube  like 
 you  make  a  lot  of  money  as  a  big 
 YouTuber 
 second  goal  of  mine  is  to  improve  my
[30:23] health  and  that's  through  some  like 
 Health  metrics  that 
 um a  lot  of  people  don't  really  know
[30:28] about  heart  rate  variability  and  hot 
 resting  heart  rate  and  stuff  so  improve 
 my  health  and  the  third  goal  that  I  have
[30:34] for  this  period  is  to  publish  a 
 life-changing  inspirational  book
[30:39] you've  got  three  major  goals  we've 
 crossed  out  all  of  the  other  ones  we've 
 crossed  out  those  desires
[30:45] one  point  I  will  tell  you 
 is  that  you  can  have  you  know  these
[30:50] three  goals  that  we've  got  of  course 
 they  can  have  like  milestones  and  mini 
 goals  inside  of  them
[30:56] so  for  example  we're  only  going  to do 
 let's  say  three  goals  and  one  of  them 
 for  you  can  be  something  to  do  with 
 weight  lifting  or  making  muscle  you  want
[31:02] to  bulk  up  10  pounds  or  you  want  to  you 
 know  get  stronger  or  something 
 but  inside  of  that  goal  can  be  a  mini
[31:07] goal  of  like  a  milestone  so  for  example 
 one  of  your  goals  could  be  I  want  to 
 bulk  up  to  170  pounds  at  the  end  of  this
[31:14] year  and  a  mini  goal  inside  of  that 
 could  be  to  bench  press  80  kilograms
[31:19] because  it's  kind  of  relevant  you  know 
 it's  tied  to  the  same  Big  Goal  so  you 
 can  have  a  big  goal  which  then  has  like
[31:25] milestones  and  extra  things  which  are 
 completely  tied  to  it  so  that  you  know 
 you've  got  to  achieve  these  things  to  do
[31:30] the  big  goal  so  for  example  my  big  goal 
 is  publish  a  life-changing  book  but  then 
 a  mini  goal  inside  of  that  is  like  is  to
[31:36] get  David  Goggins  to  write  the  forward 
 of  like  you  know  the  start  of  the  book 
 another  goal  okay  the  big  goal  of  mine
[31:42] is  to  save  one  million  dollars  this  year 
 but  then  many  goals  inside  of  that  is  to 
 produce  like  42  videos  like
[31:49] life-changing  videos  once  a  week  onto 
 the  YouTube  channel  and  also  to  send 
 people  to  Adonis  Academy  which  is  like
[31:55] my  like  my  online  community  which  is 
 where  I  make  most  of  my  money  that's 
 Linked  In  the  description
[32:00] three  reasonable  pretty  big  goals  now  my 
 and  mine  are  big  by  the  way  like  mine
[32:05] are  really  big  like  audacious  and 
 ambitious  goals  but  I've  got  to  the 
 point  where  I  can  like  I  can  achieve
[32:11] that  so  for  you  I've  told  you  okay  you 
 don't  really  choose  reasonable  goals  but 
 that's  because  you  know  you're  just
[32:17] starting  this  journey  you  still  you're 
 still  at  the  point  where  you  need  to  fix 
 your  life  I'm  only  three  years  in  and
[32:22] look  how  much  I've  been  able  to  increase 
 my  goals  because  when  I  started  in  your 
 position  my  goals  were  probably  the  same
[32:27] as  yours  1  000  subscribers  by  the  end  of 
 the  year  and  500  pounds  through  the  the
[32:33] month  of  December  online  those  were  my 
 goals  when  I  first  started  so  you  can
[32:38] see  that  in  less  than  like  three  years 
 I  went  from  that  reasonable  goal  to  now
[32:44] what  seems  like  a  stupid  like  my  goal 
 seems  stupidly  ambitious  save  one 
 million  dollars  this  year
[32:51] I  genuinely  think  I  probably  will  I 
 probably  will  will  achieve  that  because
[32:56] they're  still  reasonable  for  me 
 does  this  make  sense  so  we  need  to  you
[33:02] need  to  really  make  sure  the  goal  that 
 you've  set  is  reasonable  for  you  and 
 your  position  in  life  right  now  the
[33:07] number  one  reason  why  you  could  fail  so 
 far  is  because  you've  set  a  goal
[33:12] that  you  genuinely  just  can't  achieve 
 because  you're  not  at  that  level  that 
 you  need  to  be
[33:17] the  bigger  a  goal  is  right  now  the  more 
 it's  actually  going  to  put  you  off  just 
 for  now  and  then  you'll  get  to  a  point
[33:23] when  you're  actually  productive  and 
 you're  working  and  you're  healthy  and  at 
 that  point  you  can  set  some  bigger  goals
[33:28] we're  on  to  the  next  step  the  second 
 step  of  this  protocol  and  this  is  the
[33:33] one  where  your  Jeffrey  brain  is  going  to 
 Hype  up  and  really  piss  you  off  now 
 for  this  step  we're  going  to  cut  out  all
[33:40] bad  habits 
 this  isn't  that  I'm  telling  you  yep  you
[33:45] can  still  play  one  hour  video 
 we're  cutting  out  all
[33:50] 100  of  our  bad  habits
[33:56] there  is  no  protocol  or  self-improvement
[34:01] Guru  online  who  speaks  like  this  all  of 
 them  tell  you  to  have  balance  all  of 
 them  tell  you  that  you  can  go  and  enjoy
[34:06] a  little  bit  don't  be  so  extreme 
 and  those  same  people  if  you  have  a  look
[34:11] at  their  YouTube  channels  or  their 
 profiles  or  whatever  and  you  scroll  down 
 for  months  and  years  you  realize  that
[34:16] they've  actually  not  even  made  that  much 
 progress  in  their  lives  they  literally 
 that
[34:21] so  you  can  choose  you  want  to  live  that 
 life  of  balance  than  you  can  but  I'm 
 telling  you  right  now  that  every 
 successful  guy  is  actually  extreme  I'm
[34:27] just  telling  you the  truth  from  what 
 I've  seen  in  a  successful  guys  they're 
 actually  all  extreme  you  can't  even  get 
 to  a  good  level  of  success  by  being  like
[34:33] a  balanced  guy  you  can  be  extreme  and 
 then  switch  your  focus  of  extremity  to 
 eventually  your  life  is  somewhat
[34:39] balanced  but  you've  got  to  have  like 
 somewhat  of  an  extreme  personality  to 
 get  to  a  good  level  of  success  which  you
[34:44] probably  do  once 
 so  we're  gonna  go  extreme  with  this  and 
 we're  going  to  cut  out  all  bad  habits
[34:50] there's  something  that  I  learned  from 
 this  this  scientist  online  on  YouTube
[34:55] called  Andrew  huberman  you  may  have  seen 
 some  of  his  posts  before  like  this 
 neuroscientist  then  he's  got  like  a  big
[35:00] podcast  with  like  2  million  subscribers 
 and  he  speaks  about  dopamine  and  how
[35:05] this  works  and  you've  probably  heard  the 
 word  dopamine  before  and  I'm  going  to 
 explain  to  you  like  the  Bro  Science 
 version  of  this  I'm  not  a  scientist  but
[35:11] I  do 
 I'm  not  a  scientist  but  I'm  the  kind  of 
 guy  who  implements  the  science  and  then
[35:16] tells  you  in  basic  English  what  to  do  so 
 I'm  going  to  tell  you  from  my 
 perspective  of  how  dopamine  will  change
[35:21] your  life  you  see  dopamine  is  kind  of 
 like  our  hormone  and  a  feeling  inside  of
[35:26] us  that  we  want  to  do  something  dopamine 
 is  like  motivation
[35:31] it's  this  feeling  this  somewhat  positive 
 feeling  that  we  want  to  go  and  do  this
[35:37] thing 
 your  dopamine  receptors  get  fried 
 through  all  bad  habits  because  modern
[35:44] day  inventions  has  has  hyper  stimulated 
 everything
[35:50] not  just  you  know  social  media  but  porn 
 all  kinds  of  internet  related  screen
[35:55] related  things  and  even  Junk  Food  and 
 Drugs  all  of  it's  like  like  a  hyper 
 amount  of  what  it  should  be
[36:02] and  so  now  when  you  do  any  bad  habits 
 your  dopamine  receptors  get  fried  to  the
[36:07] point  that  it  actually  negatively 
 impacts  you  even  when  you're  not  even 
 doing  that  bad  habit  so  if  so  this  is
[36:13] how  it  works  right  every  time  you  do  a 
 bad  habit  it  feels  good  right  so  when 
 you  play  video  games  it  feels  good  when
[36:19] you  watch  porn  it  feels  good  when  you 
 eat  junk  food  it  feels  good  and  so  you 
 get  this  rise  of  like  this  feel  nice
[36:24] feeling  but  as  soon  as  it's  done  like  as 
 soon  as  you're  done  you  know  and  you're
[36:29] cleaning  up  after  you've  just  fat  or 
 you've  you  know  you  swallowed  the  bite 
 of  food  that  was  bad  for  you  like  the
[36:34] chocolate  or  something  you  swallowed  it 
 it's  like  all  of  that  feeling  good  just
[36:39] stops 
 and  it  actually  goes  down 
 and  what's  so  interesting  with  all  of
[36:45] these  bad  habits 
 that  feeling  of  feeling  good
[36:50] it  goes  down  below  where  it  started  up 
 so  what  this  means  is  that  every  single
[36:57] time  you  do  a  bad  habit  it  actually  like 
 you  get  like  a  nice  feeling  for  some 
 time  pleasure  but  after  it's  done  after
[37:05] you've  not  after  you've  logged  off  the 
 video  game  your  Baseline  for  how  good
[37:10] you  feel  goes  down 
 and  now  sure  you  can  go  get  another  high
[37:15] like  another  fix  of  your  bad  habit  of 
 your  of  your  video  games  or  something 
 and  you'll  go  up  in  pleasure  till  you
[37:20] log  off  and  I'll  go  down  and  it'll  go 
 below  the  Baseline  and  you'll  get  a  new 
 low  bass  line  and  then  you'll  go  play
[37:27] video  games  but  you  know  the  game 
 doesn't  feel  any  fun  as  much  anymore  and 
 then  it  goes  down
[37:33] and  then  you  play  video  games  whilst 
 also  eating  junk  food  and  you  know  that 
 feels  really  nice  okay  sweetheart  okay 
 guys  I'm  gonna  go  offline  now  and  it
[37:38] goes  down  and  down  and  down  and  down  and 
 before  you  know  it  your  fat  doctor  tells
[37:43] you  that  you're  clinically  depressed  and 
 you  need  some  pills
[37:49] this  I  think  is  one  of  the  biggest 
 problems  of  the  modern  day  people's 
 dopamine  people's  like  like  feelings  of
[37:56] of  of  well-being  are  so  low  because 
 we've  all  just  overdone  the  bad  habits
[38:01] every  time  you  do  a  bad  habit  it  just 
 drops  your  Baseline  of  feeling  good  even
[38:07] lower  and  lower  and  lower
[38:12] this  is  why  bad  habits  these  modern  bad 
 habits  are  so  Cutthroats
[38:18] it's  not  just  that  you  know  you  once 
 you're  done  okay  you  know  you  get  the 
 high  and  now  okay  things  are  back  to
[38:24] normal  no  no 
 it's  like  when  you  go  back  to  normal  you 
 go  below  where  you  were  beforehand  and
[38:30] you  just  keep  going  below  and  below  and 
 below  and  below  and  before  you  know  it 
 you've  completely  forgotten
[38:36] that  childlike  happiness  that  you  used 
 to  have 
 but  you  remember  how  innocent  and  how
[38:42] genuinely  like  like  happy  and  joyful 
 used  to  be  as  a  child 
 and  we  see  this
[38:48] and  we  often  just  think  that  that's  oh 
 yeah  that's  just  what  children  are  like 
 no 
 there  are  some  adults  out  there  who  have
[38:54] the  same  childlike  happiness 
 it's  not  about  children  it's  not  about
[38:59] genetics  or  any  of  this  [ __ ] 
 it's  that  they  haven't  [ __ ]  up  their
[39:04] Baseline  through  in  excess  of  of 
 dopamine  through  an  excess  of  bad  habits
[39:09] so  what  this  means  for  you 
 is  that  we  know  the  bad  habits  are  bad
[39:16] for  us  we  know  Pawn's  bad  for  us  we  know 
 junk  food  is  bad  for  us  and  you  might  be 
 coping  right  now  there's  this  one 
 particular  bad  habit  that  you  don't
[39:21] think  is  that  bad  and  you  know  it's  not 
 that  much  of  a  problem  the  the  junk  food 
 or  maybe  it's  video  games  for  you  maybe
[39:26] it's  a  bit  of  fapping  for  you  maybe  it's 
 weed  or  something  there's  something  you 
 know  that's  already  in  your  mind  right 
 now  isn't  that  just  be  honest  is  there
[39:32] something  in  your  mind  right  now  some 
 activity  that  you  know  objectively  is 
 bad  but  like  you're  actually  trying  hard
[39:37] to  rationalize  it  and  say  like  oh  yeah  I 
 don't  know  I  don't  actually  feel  that 
 way  about  that  one  no  no  that  that
[39:43] activity  which  is  the  one  I'm  most 
 addicted  to  that  one's  fine  I  swear  guys
[39:49] you're  experiencing  that  in  your  own 
 mind  right  now  aren't  you  didn't  I  tell 
 you  that  your  own  brain  is  literally
[39:54] leading  you  astray 
 I'm  genuinely  telling  you  you  can't  even 
 trust  your  own  brain  the  reason  why
[39:59] unfortunately  is  that  these  [ __ ] 
 companies  that  have  made  these  bad 
 habits  they've  hijacked  your  brain  and 
 literally  can  like  made  you  convince
[40:06] yourself  to  keep  playing  you  know 
 because  they've  made  them  so  addictive 
 this  is  why  you  can't  even  trust  your
[40:12] own  brain  anymore 
 you  don't  even  know  what's  right  or 
 wrong  this  is  why  I'm  able  to  call  you
[40:17] out  and  say  exactly  what  your  brain's 
 going  through  because  I've  been  there 
 now  I'm  on  the  other  side  and  I  see  how
[40:22] [ __ ]  my  brain  was  how  much  I  argued 
 for  weed  how  much  I  argued  for  video
[40:27] games  and  I  look  at  it  now  like  what  the 
 [ __ ]  those  things  were  ruining  my  life 
 and  I  was  defending  them
[40:32] the  reason  why  you  you  know  like  some 
 stupid  girl  defends  Tick  Tock  is  because 
 she's  literally  been  manipulated  by
[40:38] those  software  developers  that  have  made 
 the  app  so  that  it's  so  addictive  that 
 she  fights  for  it  and  it's  the  same  with
[40:44] the  nutritionists  who  make  this  like 
 Ultra  tasty  palatable  junk  food
[40:49] you  realize  this  the  level  that  we've 
 got  to  with  you  know  Scientific 
 Technology  research  and  everything  it's
[40:55] like  these  nerds  know  how  to  make  you 
 fight  for  the  thing  that's  killing  you
[41:00] not  fight  the  thing  that's  killing  you 
 make  you  fight  for  it  in  defense  for  it
[41:09] there  is  something  in  your  mind  some 
 [ __ ]  going  on  as  a  certain 
 activity  that  you  don't  want  to  give  up
[41:15] and  it's  usually  that  one  it  is  that  one 
 that's  the  one  that's  going  to  give  you 
 the  biggest  boost  because  here  is  the
[41:21] opposite  side  of  things  when  we  do  these 
 bad  habits  our  Baseline  Goes  Down  and 
 Down  and  Down
[41:27] but  when  we  do  the  good  habits  the  hard 
 things
[41:32] what  happens 
 well  since  they're  hard  and  oftentimes 
 quite  painful
[41:38] you  know  we  feel  bad  in  some  ways  whilst 
 we  do  it  don't  we  like  exercise  for  a
[41:44] lot  of  people  feels  quite  painful 
 doesn't  it  so  it  you  go  from  here  this 
 bass  line  and  you  actually  go  below  it
[41:50] for  a  little  while  because  it's  painful 
 and  it's  really  uncomfortable  but  then 
 when  you  do  these  good  habits  like
[41:56] exercise  and  reading  and  meditation  and 
 working  hard 
 taking  a  walk  in  nature  you  know  those
[42:02] things  that  you  know  are  good  for  you 
 and  you  know  sometimes  it  feels  a  bit 
 boring  you  don't  really  want  to  and 
 stuff  it  goes  down  like  it  dips  down
[42:09] like  a  little  bit  from  Baseline  of 
 boredom  and  discomfort  but  then  it  rises 
 and  it  rises  above  the  Baseline  and  then
[42:17] you  have  a  new  Baseline 
 okay  now  you're  up  here  and  then  you  do
[42:22] the  same  thing  now  you're  gonna  go  hit 
 like  a  really  hard  workout  okay  it's 
 really  uncomfortable  now  you're  here  and
[42:27] then  you  rise  you  build  the  muscle  you 
 feel  good  about  yourself  and  your  bass 
 lines  went  higher  and  higher  and  higher
[42:32] and  higher 
 when  you  do  the  bad  habits  your  Baseline 
 of  of  how  you  feel  goes  down  and  down
[42:38] and  down  until  eventually  you  literally 
 just  feel  like  [ __ ]  24  7.  even  if  you're 
 not  even  currently  doing  the  the  bad
[42:44] habits  you  know  like  video  gamers  are 
 all  depressed  mostly  right  but  like 
 they're  not  just  depressed  when  they
[42:49] play  the  video  game  they  just  depressed 
 24  7  like  their  bass  Line's  so  [ __ ] 
 low  but  imagine  on  the  opposite  hand
[42:55] imagine  the  guy  who  is  like  a  really 
 good  athlete  he's  really  intelligent
[43:00] he's  a  really  good  student  he's  he's  got 
 like  a  really  awesome  life 
 and  he  does  nothing  right  here  right  now
[43:06] we  just  put  him  into  an  empty  room 
 he'd  just  be  smiling  like  imagine  for
[43:11] you  right  if  we  if  you  literally  over 
 the  next  nine  months  we're  Ultra 
 productive  and  you  achieve  those  three
[43:16] goals  that  you  wrote  down  and  suddenly 
 you've  literally  got  a  [ __ ]  six-pack 
 and  you're  actually  like  happy  about
[43:22] your  life  and  you've  improved  your 
 relationship  and  maybe  you've  got  a 
 girlfriend  you've  improved  your 
 relationship  with  your  family  you  know
[43:27] you've  built  a  good  life  from  doing  the 
 good  habits  and  then  let's  say  we  just 
 locked  you  in  in  an  empty  room
[43:33] you  would  sit  in  that  room  literally 
 just  with  us  like  this  happy  smile  on 
 your  face  wouldn't  you
[43:38] your  Baseline  would  be  so  high  that  you 
 don't  even  need  to  do  anything  to  feel
[43:43] good 
 that  is  when  like  the  snowball  the 
 momentum  hits  and  you  start  to  like  do
[43:48] these  these  good  habits  automatically 
 without  even  feeling  like  they're  like 
 that  hard  to  do
[43:55] people  say  that  they  just  want  to  play 
 some  video  games  and  smoke  some  weed 
 because  it's  fun  but  the  thing  is  it's 
 not  fun  because  those  people  are
[44:00] depressed  so  it's  not  fun  it's  like 
 those  people  literally  you  know  the 
 video  gamer  when  you  think  about  your
[44:05] video  game  friends  they're  not  actually 
 having  that  much  fun  in  their  day
[44:10] if  you  like  you've  watched  your  friends 
 play  video  games  sometimes  right  you've 
 literally  seen  them  just  like  this
[44:16] they're  not  actually  even  having  that 
 much  fun  when  you  really  imagine  the
[44:21] last  time  you  watched  someone  play  video 
 games  they're  literally
[44:26] of  your  [ __ ]  controllers 
 ah
[44:33] it's  like  they're  not  even  having  that 
 much  fun 
 but  when  you  see  someone  who  is  really
[44:38] really  done  a  bunch  of  good  habits  for  a 
 long  time  you  literally  see  them  just
[44:43] smiling  just  for  no  reason 
 so  this  is  the  beauty  about  cutting  out
[44:49] all  bad  habits 
 and  it's  gonna  sound  weird
[44:54] but  if  you  cut  out  all  bad  fun  habits 
 you  will  literally  have  more  fun  than
[45:00] you  did  before 
 when  you  cut  out  all  of  the  bad  habits 
 you  literally  have  more  fun  than  you  did
[45:06] when  you  were  doing  the  fun  stuff 
 but  now  you  have  it  24  7  because  of  the
[45:12] man  that  you've  become  because  the 
 accomplishments  that  you  have  and  the 
 life  that  you've  built
[45:18] video  games  porn  social  media 
 Point  like  just  watching  random
[45:23] pointless  YouTube  videos  Junk  Food  and 
 Drugs  weed  alcohol
[45:30] there's  one  important  part  of  this  and 
 it's  something  that  you  might  not  even 
 accept  right  now  and  if  you  don't  I
[45:37] guarantee  maybe  in  six  months  or  a  year 
 or  two  years  you  might  end  up  seeing 
 this  video  again
[45:42] and  you'll  wish  that  you  had  taken  this 
 piece  of  advice  that  I'm  about  to  tell 
 you
[45:48] secret  to  self-improvements  the  real 
 self-improvement  not  the  kind  of  one 
 that  you  see  like  these  [ __ ]  talk
[45:54] about  online  or  anything  but  the 
 Secret's  actually  fixing  your  life 
 is  to  genuinely  cut  out  all  bad  habits
[46:00] that  last  moment  when  you  cut  out  like 
 literally  all  of  them
[46:05] all  of  these  bad  horrible  things  for  you 
 that's  when  things  just  suddenly  go  like
[46:10] zero  to  one  and  like  the  good  habits  in 
 the  in  your  life  becomes  fun  again
[46:16] when  you  have  this  one  nagging  thing 
 that  you  don't  want  to  get  rid  of  and 
 you  could  probably  think  which  one  it  is
[46:21] for  you  right  now  when  you  keep  that  one 
 thing  in  your  life  it's  not  you  still 
 live  this  like  semi-depressed  life  and
[46:27] that  that  saps  your  spirits  it  saps  like 
 your  productivity  and  your  focus  and 
 you'll  not  achieve  the  goals  that  you
[46:33] wanted 
 remember  we're  not  like  those  average 
 mediocre  people  who  can  live  a  life  of
[46:38] balance  or  anything  we're  not  like  them 
 if  you  were  you  already  would  be  living 
 a  life  of  balance  wouldn't  you  by  you
[46:43] needing  to  fix  your  life  and  being  at 
 such  a  [ __ ]  position  beforehand  you're 
 like  we've  like  you  have  to  be  quite  an
[46:48] extreme  guy  right  because  those  balanced 
 people  they  play  Like  You  Know  video 
 games  twice  two  hours  a  day  or  something
[46:53] and  they're  just  kind  of  like  happy  just 
 being  mediocre  you're  not  one  of  them 
 you're  the  guy  most  likely  that  you've
[46:58] had  an  extreme  like  [ __ ]  life  and  you 
 could  have  an  extremely  good  life  you're
[47:03] not  the  kind  of  guy  who  can  have  like 
 somewhere  in  the  middle  most  people  are 
 near  the  middle  okay  sweet
[47:09] so  what  this  means  is  you  can't  live 
 like  most  people  you  can't  just  keep 
 video  games  in  your  life  and  expect  to
[47:14] actually  have  still  have  a  good  life 
 because  you're  not  the  kind  of  guy  who 
 can  play  one  hour  of  video  games  you  can 
 cope  and  say  like  yeah  you  know  video
[47:19] games  aren't  that  bad  it's  just  one  hour 
 to  find  like  we  can't  play  one  hour 
 we're  the  kind  of  people  we  will  play  as
[47:24] much  as  we  possibly  can  but  there's  just 
 something  like  wrong  with  us  in  that 
 sense  but  when  you  get  rid  of  these
[47:29] distractions  these  awful  things  for  you 
 suddenly  you  will  literally  enjoy
[47:34] working  and  then  it's  like  working  and 
 being  productive  to  your  goals  becomes
[47:39] your  video  game  that  you  can't  stop 
 doing  and  you  become  that  guy  that 
 people  think  like  is  crazy  because
[47:44] you're  doing  two  workouts  a  day  because 
 you're  working  on  your  business  10  hours 
 a  day  and  I  promise  you  that  you'll  only 
 get  there  with  this  major  extreme  level
[47:50] of  success  if  you  cut  out  all  of  these 
 this  is  non-negotiable
[47:55] there's  a  reason  why  you  clicked  on  this 
 video  and  there's  a  reason  why  you 
 stayed  watching  to  my  to  my  words  here
[48:01] because  you  know  that  the  normal  life  is 
 never  going  to  work  for  you  you  know 
 that  you're  not  that  average  mediocre 
 person  who  can  do  the  life  of  balance
[48:08] so  you  must  understand  right  now 
 there's  multiple  bad  habits  that  you're
[48:13] doing  we  need  to  literally  cut  out  all 
 of  them
[48:18] and  I  totally  understand  that  by  the  way 
 I  totally  understand  that  for  me  for  a
[48:23] long  time  it  was  weed 
 I  used  to  smoke  weed  every  single  day
[48:28] and  the  thing  is 
 I  didn't  even  enjoy  it  that  much 
 honestly  like  I  wanted  to  quit  so  many
[48:33] times  you  know  if  there's  like  a  habit 
 that  you've  wanted  to  quit  like  you've 
 tried  to  quit  like  five  times  over  the
[48:39] last  few  years  that  says  it  itself  no 
 one  tries  to  quip  exercise  do  they  no
[48:44] one  tries  to  like  oh  yeah  I'm  really 
 trying  to  quit  exercise  guys  when  I'm 
 strong  no  one  tries  to  quit  reading
[48:49] books  do  they 
 so  when  there's  something  like  an 
 activity  that  you're  defending  in  your
[48:54] mind  that  yeah  but  it's  not  really  a 
 problem  I  swear  it's  like  if  you  you've 
 tried  to  quit  it  like  five  times  before
[49:00] this  that  says  in  itself  that  you  know 
 that  that's  like  a  stupid  thing  for  you 
 you  know  it  so  right  here  right  now  for
[49:06] maybe  the  first  time  in  a  while  we  need 
 to  just  it's  someone  sense  we  need  to 
 just  hold  our  hands  up  and  say  yep  the
[49:12] bad  habits  that  I  do 
 are  bad 
 we  need  to  just  see  them  as  a  bad  thing
[49:18] don't  cope  and  say  they're  productive 
 don't  cope  and  say  you  know  one  hour  I'm 
 just  unwinding  at  the  end  of  a  day  or
[49:23] something  don't  say  that  and  just  say 
 yep  these  are  bad  habits  that  are  bad 
 for  me  that  I  actually  would  be  better
[49:29] off  of  if  I  didn't  do  them  and  I'll 
 explain  exactly  how  to  get  rid  of  all  of 
 these  bad  habits  by  the  way  but
[49:35] there's  two  extra  points  for  this 
 there's  multiple  reasons  to  do  this  you 
 know  it'll  reset  your  dopamine  Baseline
[49:40] it'll  give  you  more  time  and  this  is 
 what  most  people  say  it's  like  you  know 
 you'll  save  the  time  to  then  go  and  use
[49:45] productively  that's  nice  but  actually  I 
 think  there's  a  hidden  benefit  to  this 
 especially  with  things  like  video  games
[49:51] and  social  media  and  porn 
 it  gives  you  more  of  your  mental  load
[49:56] your  brain  power  back  you  see  to  become 
 successful  to  the  level  that  you  want
[50:02] you  need  to  have  as  many  of  your 
 thoughts  directed  to  your  goals
[50:09] what  I  mean  by  this  is  that  your  shower 
 thoughts  must  be  related  to  your  goals
[50:15] the  thoughts  that  you  get  when  you're 
 having  a  [ __ ] 
 when  you're  literally  having  a  piss  the
[50:21] thoughts  that  you  get  must  be  related  to 
 your  goals  if  you  want  to  become 
 successful  like  successful  people  are
[50:27] very  extreme  they  were  literally  getting 
 ideas  once  we're  having  a  [ __ ]  bro
[50:32] so  if  you're  playing  video  games  the 
 thing  is  sometimes  you're  having  a  [ __ ] 
 and  you  think  about  the  video  game  you 
 think  about  oh  man  I'm  gonna  message
[50:37] this  guy  on  Discord  I  can't  wait  to  play 
 with  him  you're  thinking  about  the  the 
 time  you  just  died  or  whatever  on  League
[50:42] of  Legends  or  some  [ __ ] 
 it  takes  your  thoughts  away  from  you
[50:48] these  bad  habits  they  take  your  thoughts 
 away  from  you  that's  unacceptable
[50:55] but  one  of  the  points 
 this  also  includes  hanging  out  with
[51:00] friends 
 being  social
[51:05] and  having  friends  is  an  awesome  thing 
 that's  a  good  habit
[51:11] but  if  you're  watching  this  video  right 
 now 
 and  you  relate  to  this  need  of  of
[51:16] needing  to  fix  your  life  if  you're  at 
 this  position  in  life  right  now  where 
 you  need  to  fix  your  life
[51:22] I  guarantee  you 
 that  your  friends  are  pieces  of  [ __ ]
[51:27] I  guarantee  you  but  your  friends  aren't 
 even  nice  people
[51:33] I  guarantee  you 
 that  you  will  be  better  off  without  them
[51:39] now  I'll  give  you  a  disclaimer  here 
 being  social  is  so  important  like  I'm 
 very  much  a  guy  who  likes  to  think  of
[51:45] like  Primal  stuff  and  we  should  live  in 
 a  tribe  genuinely  we  should  live  in  a 
 tribe  we  should  be  close  to  family  and
[51:50] friends  and  work  together  of  course  we 
 should  but 
 that  means  that  we  should  have  good 
 people  in  our  lives  and  if  you  are  at
[51:55] this  point  right  now  where  you  need  to 
 fix  your  life  bro  that  probably  means 
 you  don't  even  have  any  good  people  in
[52:00] your  life  it  probably  means  that  the  the 
 friends  you  do  have  are  actually  holding 
 you  back
[52:05] because  I  guarantee  that  when  you  do 
 make  progress  in  your  self-improvements
[52:10] when  you  do  make  progress  and  become 
 more  successful  those  people  will 
 actually  look  down  upon  you  they  will 
 feel  negative  towards  your  success
[52:16] they'll  think  worse  of  you  as  you  get 
 better 
 because  they're  crabs  the  crab  is  in  a
[52:22] bucket  they're  trying  to  pull  you  back 
 down  into  mediocrity  amongst  them
[52:27] the  idea  is 
 to  go  out  go  alone  on  monk  mode
[52:33] ruthlessly  improve  yourself  detach  away 
 from  these  Jeffries  and  you  know  just 
 don't  even  reply  to  the  messages  mute
[52:39] all  of  the  group  chats  don't  even  look 
 at  them  even  if  if  you  think  you'll 
 never  be  friends  with  them  again  like  if 
 you  suddenly  became  successful  and
[52:45] intelligent  and  stuff  you'd  probably 
 never  speak  to  them  again  anyway  so  why 
 the  [ __ ]  would  you  still  be  friends  with
[52:50] them  now  if  you  know  you're  not 
 eventually  gonna  be  speaking  to  them 
 long  term 
 the  idea  is  just  detach  away  from  them
[52:56] go  monk  Mode  come  out  a  new  person  and 
 then  attract  like  friends  who  are  of
[53:02] higher  quality 
 those  higher  quality  people  you  can't 
 just  be  friends  with  right  now  because
[53:07] those  higher  quality  people  won't  be 
 friends  with  you  whilst  you're  friends 
 with  low  quality  people  because  if
[53:12] you're  friends  with  low  quality  people 
 it  means  you're  a  low  quality  person  and 
 the  fastest  way  to  to  get  rid  of  this
[53:18] negative  social  influence  is  to  go  it 
 alone  for  some  time
[53:23] you  can  try  like  I'd  love  to  tell  you 
 yeah  you  know  the  wholesome  thing  is  to 
 get  your  friends  on  self-improvement  bro
[53:28] I've  tried  giving  that  advice  so  many 
 times  and  almost  no  one's  ever  been 
 successful  with  it  either  you  find 
 someone  who's  already  on
[53:33] self-improvement  who's  already  going  to 
 the  gym  and  you  grow  together  that's 
 awesome  but  your  old  Jeffrey  friends 
 aren't  just  gonna  suddenly  like  quit
[53:39] playing  video  games  just  because  you're 
 telling  them  to  I  promise  you  you  can 
 try  all  you  want  but  I'm  telling  you
[53:44] right  now  I've  never  once  seen  this 
 actually  work  they  need  to  discover  the
[53:49] truth  the  darkness  of  their  lives  first 
 like  you  did  and  then  go  through  the 
 trials  and  tribulations  for  months  of
[53:55] trying  to  figure  out  what  to  do  just 
 like  you  did 
 you  can't  just  suddenly  take  them  in
[54:00] that  period  where  you  were  at  where  you 
 were  totally  fine  and  content  playing 
 video  games  and  to  try  and  help  them  out 
 of  it  I've  never  seen  that  happen  before
[54:06] but  I'd  love  to  be  proven  wrong  if  you 
 can  save  your  friends  do  it  but  I've 
 never  actually  seen  that  so
[54:11] how  do  you  actually  go  about  creating  a 
 bad  habit  you  know  I'm  telling  you  right 
 now  yeah  we  need  to  quit  all  bad  habits
[54:16] and  it  sounds  like  okay  fair  enough  yeah 
 okay  we  probably  do  but  how  do  you 
 actually  go  and  do  that  what  we  need  to
[54:21] do  is  change  our  basic  attack  now  before 
 you  watch  this  part  of  the  video  which
[54:26] is  going  to  be  very  interesting  you  need 
 to  clarify  right  now  if  you  totally  are 
 convinced  to  give  up  all  bad  habits  be
[54:33] totally  honest  right  now  is  there 
 something  like  just  be  honest  with 
 yourself  is  there  a  habit  like  a  task  an
[54:38] activity  in  your  brain  that  you  don't 
 want  to  give  up  that  your  brain  keeps 
 talking  to  you  about
[54:43] and  they  keep  saying  like  no  no  maybe  I 
 can  do  this  maybe  I  can  do  this  how 
 about  this  no  no  he's  not  talking  about
[54:48] this  thing  like  no  no  it's  not  even  that 
 bad  no  I'm  not  like  him  it's  not  that 
 bad  is  there  something  that  you're  still 
 coping  about
[54:53] if  there  is  I  urge  you  to  re-watch  the 
 previous  section  at  normal  speed  and 
 just  re-watch  it  and  really  take  it
[54:59] seriously  what  I've  just  said  now  if 
 you're  watching  this  section  right  here 
 right  now  that  means  that  you  are
[55:04] totally  convinced  that  we  need  to  get 
 rid  of  all  bad  habits  but  we  just  need 
 to  figure  out  how  to  actually  do  that
[55:09] and  we  do  that  through  changing  our 
 basic  attack 
 a  lot  of  guys  try  and  quit  playing  video
[55:15] games  and  smoking  weed 
 and  they  do  you  know  a  lot  of  guys  will 
 tell  you  maybe  you've  tried  yeah  I've
[55:21] quit  playing  video  games  now 
 but  then  you  have  nothing  else  to  fill 
 your  time  with
[55:27] and  so  you  get  really  really  bored 
 and  then  you  end  up  going  back
[55:34] we're  going  to  change  this  with  our 
 basic  attack  which  is  kind  of  like  a 
 filler  activity
[55:40] there's  a  YouTuber  uh  a  friend  of  mine 
 actually  Ali  abdal  and  he  mentioned  this
[55:46] in  a  video  we  should  change  our  basic 
 attack  so  if  your  chances  are  if  you
[55:51] know  what  I'm  talking  about  right  in  a 
 in  a  video  game  you  have  a  basic  attack 
 and  you  have  special  attacks  special
[55:56] attacks  are  things  that  you  do  every  now 
 and  then  when  you've  got  enough  mana  and 
 energy  and  everything  but  a  basic  attack
[56:02] is  the  thing  that  you  naturally 
 gravitate  towards 
 for  most  of  our  lives
[56:08] our  basic  attack 
 has  been  pointlessly  surfing  on  the
[56:14] internet 
 watching  [ __ ]  on  YouTube  Tick  Tock 
 checking  notifications  on  Snapchat  and
[56:19] stuff 
 playing  video  games  hopping  on  Discord 
 and  then  checking  notifications  then
[56:24] checking  Discord  again  then  hopping  on 
 call  with  Discord  and  one  of  your 
 friends  is  just  eating  he'll  be  there  in
[56:29] 10  minutes  let's  all  go  play  a  few  games 
 League  or  some  [ __ ]  right  our  basic 
 attack  has  always  been  bad  habits  and  so
[56:34] when  we  change  or  when  we  remove  bad 
 habits  as  our  basic  attack  but  we  don't
[56:39] replace  it  with  anything  else  suddenly 
 you're  left  like  just  with  nothing  to  do 
 and  then  you  go  back  to  the  old  basic
[56:45] attack  of  of  bad  habits  right  so  what  we 
 need  to  do
[56:50] we  need  to  change  our  basic  attack  the 
 thing  that  we  just  naturally  do 
 throughout  the  day  when  we've  got
[56:56] nothing  to  do  which  previously  used  to 
 be  video  games  and  social  media  and  [ __ ] 
 we  need  to  change  that  to  something
[57:01] productive  and  there's  two  activities 
 that  you  can  use  here 
 and  they  are
[57:06] reading 
 and  specifically  watching  full  length
[57:11] educational  podcasts  these  are  the  two 
 activities  that  have  most  developed  me
[57:17] and  they  will  develop  you  essentially 
 learning  through  books  and  full  length
[57:22] podcasts  everything  that  I  know 
 everything  that  I've  gotten  the  success 
 that  I've  built  has  come  from  the
[57:28] knowledge  that  I've  gained  from  books 
 and  full  length  of  YouTube  videos  like 
 podcasts  right  now  I'm  going  to  give  you
[57:35] a  disclaimer  which  is  very  interesting 
 in  this  space  because  this  is  something 
 that  actually  most  people  on  on  YouTube
[57:41] disagree  with  me  with  especially  the  the 
 self-improvement  guys
[57:49] this  is  technically  consuming  contents
[57:54] you've  heard  online  that  this  everyone 
 parrots  the  same  phrase  and  it's  gonna 
 seem  so  weird  that  I'm  like  countering
[58:01] this  right 
 everyone  pirates  the  same  phrase  and 
 it's  when  everyone  agrees  on  something
[58:06] it's  probably  wrong  every  single  person 
 on  self-improvement  every  single  person 
 on  YouTube  says  this  you  shouldn't  watch
[58:12] these  kinds  of  content  educational  stuff 
 if  you're  not  gonna  take  action
[58:17] that's  what  everyone  says  right  everyone 
 says  that  watching  self-improvement 
 content  but  not  taking  action  is
[58:23] pointless  reading  self-improvement  books 
 but  not  taking  action  is  pointless  I've 
 actually  realized
[58:29] I  think  that's  wrong 
 I  think 
 consuming  educational  content  and  books
[58:36] and  not  taking  action  is  still 
 infinitely  better
[58:42] than  just  doing  the  bad  habits  that 
 we're  used  to  I  think  it's  better  to
[58:47] simply  just  read  and  not  straight  and 
 like  not  go  and  use  what  you've  read 
 than  it  is  to  play  video  games  now  when
[58:54] I've  said  it  like  that  that's  like  well 
 yeah  of  course  it  is  like  this  is  common 
 sense  right  so  we've  all  had  this  idea
[58:59] that  no  if  you're  gonna  if  you're  gonna 
 watch  a  podcast  and  you've  got  to  make 
 sure  you've  got  to  use  it  if  you're 
 gonna  read  then  you've  got  to  make  sure
[59:04] that  you  take  action  on  it  and  that 
 seems  like  good  advice  but  I  realize 
 it's  actually  wrong  because 
 when  we  don't  take  action  straight  away
[59:11] but  we're  just  reading  a  book  for 
 example  or  we're  watching  a  podcast  it's 
 not  like  nothing's  happening
[59:16] what's  happening  is  that  our  brains  like 
 neurons  and  you  know  the  brain  [ __ ]  it's
[59:21] all  forming  new  Pathways  new  beliefs  new 
 mindsets 
 new  stories  to  look  back  on  that  will
[59:28] actually  lead  us  to  go  and  taking  action 
 in  the  right  way  in  the  future  what  I've
[59:33] seen  in  myself  and  also  probably  you've 
 you're  experiencing  this  right  now  and
[59:38] also  I  have  seen  in  literally  so  many 
 guys  that  have  helped  is  that  there  is 
 an  initial  period
[59:43] of  self-improvements  where  you  only 
 consume  the  content  but  you  don't  take
[59:48] action  and  we  think  that  this  period  is 
 like  a  bad  thing  and  we  feel  [ __ ]
[59:53] horrible  when  we're  in  this  period 
 because  we're  we're  learning  about  the 
 things  that  we  should  do  but  we  don't  do
[59:58] them  and  so  we  feel  really  horrible  but 
 what  I've  realized  is  every  guy  that 
 I've  seen  has  went  through  this  period
[60:03] of  consuming  this  educational 
 self-improvements  box  and  everything  and
[60:08] not  taking  action 
 but  then 
 they  start  taking  action  afterwards  you
[60:14] see  if  you've  been  obsessed  recently 
 with  self-improvement  fixing  your  life 
 monk  mode  and  all  this  all  these  things
[60:20] but  you  haven't  really  used  it 
 consistently  in  person  right  now  you'd 
 probably  be  thinking  like  yeah  this  has
[60:25] all  been  a  failure  I've  not  been  able  to 
 improve  my  life  but  I  promise  you  that  I 
 was  in  the  exact  same  boat  as  you  where
[60:30] I  only  consume  the  contents  didn't 
 actually  really  take  real  action  to  it 
 but  then  eventually  I  went  on  to  and  it
[60:37] was  only  when  I  went  on  to  take  the 
 action  that  I  needed  to  I  looked  back  at 
 the  months  that  I  was  reading  without
[60:42] taking  action  the  months  that  I  watched 
 the  self-improvement  videos  to  realize 
 that  they  were  actually  still  helping  me
[60:47] that  I  needed  to  First  change  my  brain 
 and  my  beliefs  through  that  kind  of
[60:52] content  but  I  didn't  yet  have  the 
 capacity  to  do  the  work  does  this  make 
 sense 
 so  I  know  that  this  sounds  weird  and  I'm
[60:58] not  saying  this  like  in  a  way  that  yeah 
 you  should  just  watch  my  videos  keep 
 watching  my  video  I'm  not  saying  to
[61:03] watch  my  videos  I'm  saying  to  read  books 
 and  to  watch  full  length  educational 
 podcasts  right  my  videos  the  recent  ones
[61:09] like  you  know  I've  got  five  videos  just 
 recently  which  you  can  maybe  say  a 
 podcast  but  most  of  my  videos  are  um
[61:14] like  the  short  clickbaity  style  don't 
 watch  those  kinds  of  videos  what  I'm 
 saying  is  consume  the  good  like  a  long
[61:21] really  long  form  one  to  two  hour  long 
 podcasts  on  YouTube  by  Andrew  huberman
[61:26] Chris  Williamson  the  Diary  of  a  CEO 
 these  kinds  of  guys  who  are  very 
 successful  guys  and  they're  doing  like
[61:32] these  unfiltered  unedited  podcasts  I 
 promise  you  that  every  time  I  sit  down 
 and  really  like  pay  attention  to  a  full
[61:38] length  unedited  podcast  right  so  no  like 
 [ __ ]  memes  no  short  form  no  like
[61:44] highlight  clip  that's  five  minutes  long 
 that's  like  Joe  Rogan's  motivational 
 advice  that  will  change  your  life  no  no
[61:49] not  that  [ __ ]  the  full  length 
 educational  podcast  when  I  sit  down  and 
 watch  one  where  I'm  really  paying
[61:55] attention  to  it  I  swear  to  God  I  I 
 actually  like  it's  like  my  I  feel  my 
 brain  change  and  my  beliefs  change  and
[62:01] suddenly  there's  like  a  new  thing  that 
 I'm  keeping  in  mind  for  like  the  rest  of 
 my  life
[62:06] you  don't  realize  how  valuable  it 
 actually  is  to  consume  content  it's  seen 
 as  a  really  like  bad  thing  these  days
[62:12] consuming  pointless  content  social  media 
 and  [ __ ]  okay  it's  bad  but  education  is
[62:17] fantastic  and  again 
 it  needs  to  be  like  if  you're  watching 
 it  on  YouTube  like  full  length  podcast
[62:24] not  the  Highlight  Clips  not  like  you 
 know  the  five  minute  clip  that  teaches 
 you  or  Andrew  huberman's  dopamine  advice
[62:30] I  don't  know  it's  like  the  full  two-hour 
 Andrew  huberman  episode  on  dopamine  and 
 you  literally  sit  there  take  your
[62:36] fingers  off  the  mouse  stop  scrolling 
 down  to  the  comments  and  just  sit  there 
 and  really  pay  attention  to  it  make  this
[62:42] your  new  basic  attack  make  this  the 
 thing  that  you  do  when  you've  got 
 nothing  to  do  I  keep  like  a  book  open
[62:48] like  the  way  of  the  superior  man  this 
 book  I  keep  this  book  open
[62:53] literally  like  open  like  this  next  to  me 
 so  that  anytime  my  brain  starts  cooping
[62:58] and  I  start  thinking  like  oh  maybe  I 
 should  just  go  waste  some  time  on 
 YouTube  or  you  know  I  could  do  whatever 
 [ __ ]  it's  like  I  just  end  up
[63:03] grabbing  this  and  just  reading  it  and 
 it's  like  my  understanding  of  this  book 
 that  is  an  amazing  book  is  has  leveled
[63:10] up  and  now  I  do  this  with  podcasts  too 
 anytime  like  if  I'm  eating  or  if  I've 
 got  some  free  time  and  I'm  just  kind  of
[63:15] you  know  I'd  end  up  like  killing  time 
 and  doing  some  [ __ ]  I'm  watching 
 something  deeply  educational
[63:22] and  so  yes  this  is  consuming  content 
 Brighton  you  think  that  we've  got  it 
 wrong  when  we  we've  always  thought  if
[63:27] you  consume  content  that's  a  bad  thing 
 my  life  has  changed  improved 
 significantly  because  of  this  like
[63:34] consuming  content  that  we  always  thought 
 was  bad  it's  just  the  the  simple  thing 
 is  just  just  don't  consume  [ __ ]
[63:39] don't  consume  by  people  who  are  making 
 [ __ ]  for  views 
 don't  consume  by  people  who  are  making
[63:46] click  bait  titles  like  the  top  seven 
 passive  income  ways  that  you  can  make 
 500  a  month  like  those  [ __ ]  [ __ ]
[63:52] videos  don't  watch  any  like  [ __ ] 
 clickbait  video  which  is  you  know  10 
 minutes  long  and  it's  like  the  top  seven
[63:58] you  know  this  type  of  [ __ ]  because  those 
 videos  don't  actually  [ __ ]  help  you 
 that  much  you  can  sit  there  and  watch 
 and  think  that  my  old  videos  and  and
[64:04] those  type  of  like  YouTubers  are  helping 
 you  but  the  truth  is  like  your  life 
 doesn't  change  from  those  type  of  ones 
 it  changes  from  when  you  really  invest
[64:10] like  two  hours  straight  into  watching 
 like  an  Andrew  huberman  podcast  where 
 he's  going  into  like  the  Deep  science  of
[64:16] something  that  we  can  Implement  in  our 
 lives 
 recently  I've  been  watching  this  or  the 
 guy  the  Diary  of  a  CEO  and  that's  quite
[64:22] nice  specifically  if  you're  going  to 
 watch  podcasts  specifically  Watch  the 
 episodes  that  are  not  just  interesting
[64:28] but  that  are  specifically  aligned  to 
 your  goals  so  you  can  click  on  some  of 
 these  podcasts  and  there'll  be  something
[64:34] that  like  you  can  go  into  the  Diary  of  a 
 CEO  and  there's  a  podcast  with  like
[64:39] um  Zack  and  Cody  like  you  know  the 
 [ __ ]  the  the  one  like  some  like  teen 
 like  some  childhood
[64:44] um  movie  star  or  something  right  and  I 
 used  to  watch  him  as  well  like  some 
 shows  where  I  clicked  on  it  I  was  like
[64:49] oh  well  it's  that  guy  and  I  was  watching 
 it  for  a  few  minutes  I  was  like  wait  why 
 am  I  watching  this  [ __ ]  it's  like  yeah 
 it's  kind  of  interesting  seeing  like
[64:54] some  kid  that  I  used  to  watch  on  TV  you 
 know  growing  up  like  The  Suite  Life  of 
 Zack  and  Cody
[64:59] um  Cole  Sprouse  or  whatever  his  [ __ ] 
 name  is  right  and  I  was  watching  it  for 
 a  few  minutes  I  was  like  wait  this  isn't 
 going  to  be  educational  it's  like  it's
[65:04] just  some  [ __ ]  celebrity  I  don't  give 
 a  [ __ ]  right  so  one  of  that  and  watched 
 about  some  random  businessman  and  they
[65:10] like  giving  tips  to  each  other  and  like 
 the  the  host  of  this  podcast  the  Diary 
 of  a  CEO  he  starts  talking  about  yeah
[65:15] focus  is  really  important  you've  got  to 
 make  sure  you  focus  on  this  and  this  and 
 this  and  I'm  actually  learning  from  that
[65:20] this  I  think  is  so  amazing  so  don't 
 think  to  yourself  right  now  like  oh  no
[65:25] but  you  know  everyone  said  not  to 
 consume  content  if  you're  not  going  to 
 take  action  again  when  I  say  it  like
[65:30] this  it's  common  sense  right  reading 
 just  a  book  and  even  if  you  don't  take
[65:35] action  on  it  it's  better  than  playing 
 video  games  or  taking  drugs  or  watching
[65:41] porn 
 doing  a  good  habit  that  you  don't 
 immediately  take  action  on  is  better
[65:46] than  a  bad  habit  and  again  all  of  the 
 value  of  this  you  know  these  podcasts
[65:51] and  stuff  it  isn't  that  will  suddenly  go 
 and  take  action  it's  that  our  beliefs
[65:56] change  in  our  mind 
 there's  there's  a  guy  I  really  like  Alex 
 hermosi  and  he's  done  a  bunch  of
[66:02] podcasts  like  he's  not  the  podcast  host 
 he  goes  on  podcasts  and  he's  like  just 
 watching  this  guy  talk  about  business
[66:07] has  I've  not  like  you  know  I'm  not 
 straight  away  taking  action  on  what  he 
 said  but  it's  like  the  beliefs  change  in
[66:13] my  mind  and  then  the  action  I  take 
 literally  six  months  later  is  better
[66:18] because  of  that  podcast  that  changed 
 some  belief  some  mindset  that  I  had
[66:23] so  this  now  could  be  your  your  new  go-to
[66:28] activity  that  anytime  you  don't  really 
 know  what  to  do  anytime  that  you're 
 about  to  just  go  play  video  games
[66:34] anytime  that  you've  got  some  free  time 
 you  just  eat  in  some  food  or  you're  just 
 killing  time  you're  bored  or  whatever  it
[66:39] is 
 just  literally  either  read  a  book  I 
 prefer  books  but  I'd  say  most  guys  just
[66:45] go  onto  YouTube  and  watch  a  full  length 
 podcast  and  again  please  trust  me  the 
 Highlight  Clips  don't  count  shorts
[66:52] obviously  don't  count  but  like  the 
 Highlight  you  know  Joe  Rogan's  advice  no 
 you  go  on  to  the
[66:57] um  the  podcast  you  know  YouTuber  page 
 and  often  they'll  post  their  highlight 
 there  which  is  a  bit  more  clickbait  into
[67:03] your  little  Jeffrey  Brian  will  want  to 
 click  on  it  don't  watch  the  full  like 
 two  hour  one  and  a  half  hour  length
[67:08] episode  take  your  hands  off  don't  check 
 the  comments  don't  look  at  the  suggested 
 videos  and  literally  just  watch  it  like
[67:13] you're  like  you're  an  intellectual  who 
 actually  cares  about  knowledge  and 
 education  and  I  promise  you  you  won't
[67:18] like  realize  this  just  yet  but  maybe  you 
 will  know  your  beliefs  about  things  will
[67:23] start  to  change  and  this  is  deeply 
 valuable 
 I  am  where  I  am  today  because  at  that
[67:28] moment  of  my  monk  mode  like  two  and  a 
 half  years  ago  like  you  know  like  three 
 years  ago  I  was  in  the  degenerate  stage
[67:33] but  then  after  a  little  while  I  got  into 
 monk  mode  that  I  spent  a  lot  of  my  time
[67:38] just  learning  and  educating  myself  on 
 like  the  things  that  I  was  eventually 
 going  to  implement
[67:44] learning  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  I  was 
 able  to  surpass  everyone 
 in  the  self-improvement  niche
[67:51] think  about  it  I  started  the 
 self-improvement  YouTube  channel  when 
 everyone  was  telling  me  it  was  too
[67:56] saturated 
 I  started  and  I  I  ended  up  becoming  like 
 the  biggest  like  self-improvement
[68:01] Channel  out  there 
 because  I  literally  spent  most  of  my  day
[68:06] just  learning  I  spent  hours  just  reading 
 because  I  had  nothing  else  to  do  because 
 I  wasn't  doing  bad  habits  anymore
[68:12] does  that  make  sense  so  like  we  cut  out 
 all  of  the  bad  habits  and  now  anytime  we
[68:17] would  have  done  the  bad  habits  anytime 
 we  would  have  hopped  online  with  our 
 little  Discord  Jeffrey  friends  who  keep 
 pressuring  us  to  play  video  games  or
[68:22] anytime  you  want  to  watch  like  some 
 [ __ ]  pointless  non-educational 
 YouTube  video
[68:27] we  now  literally  just  fill  it  up  with 
 learning  think  to  yourself  right  now
[68:32] like  this  new  identity  that  you  can  have 
 of  yourself 
 of  like  you  know  like  like  a  wise  man
[68:38] like  if  you  could  imagine  a  man  like 
 like  Thomas  Edison  Theodore  Roosevelt's
[68:43] like  you  know  like  the  the  like  some 
 high  quality  like  old  school  men  and
[68:49] they  literally  would  have  like  they  they 
 spend  hours  a  day  just  reading  and 
 thinking  and  they  were  able  to  become
[68:55] very  capable  men  because  of  that 
 you  should  think  of  yourself  in  the  same 
 way  like  we  are  young  men  full  of
[69:01] knowledge 
 full  of  good  beliefs  and  education  and 
 what  we  really  value  like  learning  the
[69:07] the  knowledge  and  wisdom  of  more 
 successful  men  so  that  we  can  go  and  use 
 it
[69:12] so  even  if  you  find  yourself  I  I  will 
 say  one  thing  though  if  you've  watched
[69:17] normal  self-improvement  videos  like  a 
 lot  of  my  videos  that  I've  posted  to 
 this  channel  like  probably  not  the  last
[69:22] like  five  videos  that  I've  posted  but 
 before  you  know  recently  I've  been 
 posting  like  longer  videos  with
[69:27] absolutely  no  edits  and  stuff  I  think 
 these  videos  are  really  educational  but 
 before  that  let's  get  posted  700  videos
[69:33] to  my  channel  but  you  can  scroll  down  my 
 channel  and  it's  like  the  top  seven  ways 
 why  girls  won't  like  I  don't  think  those
[69:38] videos  really  [ __ ]  help  you  and  so  I 
 think  that  you  know  all  this  time  we've 
 been  saying  oh  you  shouldn't  consume 
 content  if  you're  not  going  to  take
[69:43] action  I  think  the  reason  why  we  say 
 that  is  because  those  kinds  of  videos 
 aren't  worth  watching
[69:48] the  issue  is  as  a  Creator  and  you  know  I 
 don't  blame  YouTubers  like  most 
 YouTubers  do  this  they  make  these  like
[69:54] clickbait  videos  I  like  samosie 
 unfortunately  does  this  now  most 
 YouTubers  just  do  this  they  make  them 
 more  clickbait  short  edited  video  the
[70:00] reason  why  is  just  because  more  people 
 just  watch  the  more  people  at  Jeffries 
 who  aren't  actually  like  wanting 
 knowledge  they  just  want  stimulation  but
[70:07] you  are  not  that  kind  of  guy  anymore 
 you're  not  the  guy  who  searches  for 
 stimulation  you're  the  guy  who  searches
[70:12] for  education 
 and  so  you  will  watch  these  like  full 
 length  podcasts  like  the  two-hour  ones
[70:18] and  I'm  not  even  saying  my  videos  I'm 
 going  find  like  some  podcasts  that  you 
 really  like  I  like  Andrew  huberman  Chris
[70:23] Williamson  and  the  Diary  of  a  CEO  and  if 
 you  can  find  some  other  ones  that  you 
 like  go  and  watch  them  one  extra  tip
[70:28] I'll  give  you  is  I  think  watching  it  on 
 YouTube  is  better  than  just  listening  to
[70:33] it  on  Spotify  that's  something  that 
 again  that  the  the  guy  I  keep  mentioning 
 Alex  hamosi  that's  something  that  he
[70:38] mentions  at  the  start  of  this  book  it's 
 like  this  research  to  show  that  if  you 
 can  watch  and  listen  at  the  same  time
[70:45] that  will  help  your  brain  more  than  if 
 you  just  listen  you  know  it's  like 
 another  like  visual  like  um  another
[70:51] sense  that's  being  used  so  essentially 
 like  watch  the  full  length  podcast  so 
 you  can  literally  see  the  people  and
[70:56] stuff  rather  than  listen  to  it  still 
 listen  to  podcasts  on  Spotify  when 
 you're  driving  or  when  you're  doing  the
[71:01] dishes  or  something  but  I  would  say  like 
 a  solid  few  hours  like  literally  four  to
[71:06] six  hours  of  your  day  you  could 
 genuinely  spend  watching  full  length 
 podcasts  writing  notes  getting  ideas  and
[71:12] trying  to  just  trying  to  implement  sense 
 one  little  thing  you  watch  a  two  hours 
 podcast  by  Andrew  huberman  and  he  talks
[71:18] about  how  to  use  cold  and  heat  to 
 improve  your  health  and  just  from  that
[71:23] if  all  you  do  is  go  and  take  a  cold 
 shower  for  30  seconds  with  the  thought 
 that  oh  yeah  Andrew  guberman  said  that
[71:29] it's  healthy  to  take  cold  showers  now 
 you've  taken  action  not  only  have  you 
 got  the  new  belief  that  you  know  like
[71:34] being  cold  is  good  for  your  health  but 
 that  now  you're  actually  taking  action 
 with  it 
 be  okay  with  literally  watching  podcasts
[71:41] and  reading  for  six  to  eight  to  ten 
 hours  a  day  because  doing  that  a  day 
 like  a  day  where  you  read  for  10  hours
[71:47] is  better  than  a  day  where  you  play 
 video  games  for  10  hours  it  like  simply 
 like  that  right  that's  all  you've  got  to
[71:52] think  of  and  of  course  it's  not  going  to 
 be  10  hours  you  still  got  to  go  eat  and 
 work  out  and  stuff  but  anytime  you've
[71:57] got  some  free  time  just  learn 
 don't  stimulate
[72:04] so  now  at  this  point 
 you're  you're  beginning  to  replace  all
[72:09] of  your  bad  habits  for  learning
[72:15] your  entire  day  is  filled  up  of  you 
 gaining  the  knowledge  that  you  need  to
[72:20] eventually  become  successful  which  is 
 amazing 
 now  we  need  to  actually  do  the  specific
[72:26] tasks  that  will  get  you  to  those  goals 
 that  we  set  before  you  remember  the  the 
 page  of  goals  that  we  wrote  down  and  we
[72:32] scribbled  a  bunch  of  them  and  we  circled 
 the  three  goals  that  we  need  this  is 
 easy  right  so  right  now  think  about  it
[72:37] we've  already  eliminated  most  of  your 
 bad  habits  right  pretty  much  all  of  your 
 bad  habits  should  be  gone  at  this  point
[72:42] any  time  that  you  find  yourself  doing  a 
 bad  habit  just  like  quickly  go  back  to 
 reading  or  to  watching  the  podcast  and
[72:47] it's  not  going  to  be  perfect  by  the  way 
 you  know  over  the  next  few  days  you're 
 gonna  find  that  you  really  want  to
[72:52] um you  know  you'll  find  yourself  just 
 playing  video  games  by  accident  or 
 something  it's  normal  but  just  keep 
 coming  back  to  just  spending  most  of
[72:58] your  time  as  learning  and  now  we're  on 
 the  easy  part  we  can  almost  imagine  in 
 an  ideal  situation  that  your  entire  day
[73:04] is  just  filled  up  of  learning  you're 
 learning  some  really  good  things  now  we 
 just  need  to  do  the  specific  tasks  the
[73:10] best  most  important  tasks  that  will  get 
 you  to  your  goals  and  we  just  use  a 
 simple  like  formula  for  this  and  this  is
[73:16] the  80  20  rule  you've  probably  heard  of 
 this  like  productivity  tactic  before  the 
 80  20  ruling  Pareto  Principle  the  idea
[73:23] is  that  you  just  just  try  to  figure  out 
 what  is  the  most  impactful  highest 
 leverage  task  that  will  get  you  to  most
[73:30] of  where  you  want  to  be  so  for  example 
 my  first  goal  on  this  so  you  can  look  at 
 your  goal  list  right  my  first  goal  is  1
[73:36] 000  subscribers  we  would  ask  ourselves 
 okay  what  is  the  most  important  crucial 
 80  task  that  would  get  us  to  a  thousand
[73:43] subscribers  what  is  like  the  task  that 
 would  get  us  most  of  the  way  there  think
[73:48] about  it  what  is  the  task  that  would  get 
 us  most  of  the  way  to  a  thousand 
 subscribers
[73:53] recording  videos  literally  just  you're 
 not  getting  your  phone  or  your  camera 
 and  recording  the  video  and  then  also
[73:58] maybe  scripting  the  video 
 that's  it  that's  the  most  important  task 
 right  there
[74:04] another  way  you  can  do  this  which  I  like 
 is  for  for  each  goal  that  you  have
[74:09] 1  000  subscribers  500  a  month  online 
 bulk  up  15  pounds  for  each  goal  that  you
[74:14] have 
 ask  yourself  if  you  could  do  just 
 literally  one  task  for  that  goal  just
[74:19] one  task  forever  for  that  goal  what 
 would  it  be  if  you  could  literally 
 there's  only  one  task  that  likes  one
[74:25] specific  task  that  you  could  do  to  get 
 to  1  000  subscribers  what  would  it  be  if 
 you  chose  for  example  R  writing  a  script
[74:31] then  you'd  fail  because  you  could  write 
 the  script  but  like  we  can  only  do  one 
 task  so  you  wouldn't  be  able  to  record 
 because  that's  a  separate  task  right  so
[74:36] if  to  get  to  a  thousand  subscribers  The 
 One  task  that  you  if  you  can  only  do  one 
 task  it  would  be  to  simply  just  record
[74:41] the  video  right  it  wouldn't  be  to  go 
 update  your  channel  Banner  it  wouldn't 
 be  to  go  reply  to  everyone  who  commented
[74:46] on  your  video  and  go  comments  on  other 
 people's  videos  or  you  know  like  the 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  YouTubers  do  that  like  the
[74:51] small  YouTubers  they  like  they'll  save  a 
 quote  ready  for  when  I  post  and  then 
 they'll  quickly  post  their  quote  like
[74:56] hoping  that  someone  will  click  on  their 
 Channel  or  something  you  wouldn't  do 
 that  right  if  you  could  only  do  just  one
[75:01] task  for  your  goal  what  would  it  be 
 ask  yourself  that  question  and  then
[75:06] think  to  yourself  whatever  the  task  is 
 always  prioritize  that  one  task
[75:12] whatever  that  task  is  the  highest 
 leverage  most  important  task  always 
 prioritize  that  one  task  for  the  1  000
[75:19] subscriber  goal  it's  recording  for  the 
 500  a  month  online
[75:25] honestly  it'd  probably  still  be 
 recording  if  I  was  going  to  make  like  a 
 YouTube  business  business  run  they're 
 probably  still  recording  for  the  bulk  up
[75:31] 15  pounds  it  would  be  to  eat  the  calorie 
 Surplus  per  day  to  eat  200  grams  of
[75:36] protein  per  day 
 so  this  right  here
[75:41] is  where  it  gets  very  interesting 
 because  this  is  how  you  add  in  in  my
[75:46] opinion  the  most  effective  protocol  for 
 you  to  get  you  to  your  goals  you  fill  up 
 your  day  as  much  as  possible  with
[75:52] learning  and  of  course  you're  not  adding 
 in  eating  and  adding  your  workout  and 
 stuff  right  and  added  sleep  and  stuff  of
[75:57] course  right  but  most  of  your  day  is 
 just  learning  then  what  you  do  is  you 
 figure  out  what  would  be  the  highest
[76:02] important  task  for  the  three  goals  that 
 you  wrote  down  and  then  you  add  just
[76:07] those  tasks  inside  so  most  of  your  day 
 is  actually  still  learning  you're  still
[76:13] developing  your  skills  but  you  have  the 
 highest  important  task  that  will 
 actually  make  you  some  progress  so  for
[76:19] example  if  you  wanna  if  you're  like  a 
 new  YouTuber  most  of  your  day  should  be 
 spent  like  researching  and  learning  but
[76:24] you  should  upload  a  video  to  your 
 YouTube  channel  every  single  day  it's 
 when  you  open  yourself  up  to  too  many
[76:29] [ __ ]  mini  like  tasks  that  feel 
 productive  like  you  know  the  [ __ ] 
 YouTubers  like  to  reply  to  everyone's
[76:35] comments  and  they'll  comment  a  little 
 bit  like  when  you  do  that  you  begin  to 
 like  lose  time  from  learning  that  would
[76:40] have  actually  pushed  you  further  I  can 
 give  you  one  more  good  tip 
 when  you  do  find  out  what  the  task  is
[76:46] like  that  major  task  that  you  need  to 
 focus  on  to  get  you  to  your  goals 
 learn  more  specifically  about  that  task
[76:53] so  again  if  the  one  major  most  important 
 task  for  the  Thousand  subscriber  goal
[76:59] that  we  have  is  recording  then  you 
 should  start  to  do  some  learning 
 specifically  on  how  you  could  be  better 
 at  recording  so  you  could  go  and  read  a
[77:06] book  on  public  speaking  you  could  go  and 
 watch  a  podcast  of  some  of  you  like 
 famous  YouTuber  who's  who  teaches  people
[77:12] how  to  like  record  better  and  this  is 
 how  you  get  to  like  some  top  tier  levels
[77:18] I'm  telling  you  right  now  it's  not  the 
 guy  who  tries  to  do  the  entire  thing  and 
 he  tries  to  reply  to  everyone's  comment
[77:23] it's  just  the  guy  who  realizes  okay  what 
 is  the  most  important  task  and  then  gets 
 amazing  at  it  you  structure  your
[77:29] learning  around  that  task  and  you 
 constantly  keep  getting  better  at  that 
 one  major  task  the  task  that  I  do  is
[77:36] recording  I'm  good  at  recording  I'm  good 
 at  being  on  camera  I'm  good  at  telling 
 stories  and  captivating  you  and  making
[77:42] you  listen  to  me  for  one  hour  and  17 
 minutes  with  no  editing 
 this  is  why  I  became  successful  this
[77:48] protocol  right  here 
 now  your  day  is  all  full  of  of  learning
[77:54] and  then  it's  got  the  most  important 
 tasks  that  you  need  to  get  you  to  your 
 most  three  important  goals  you  will  mess
[77:59] up  you  will  make  lots  of  mistakes  you 
 will  mess  up  and  end  up  and  find 
 yourself  on  video  games  or  some  [ __ ]
[78:04] but  as  long  as  you  gravitate  back  to 
 this  with  you  know  a  sense  of  like  yeah 
 of  course  it  couldn't  be  perfect  or  not 
 amazing  just  yet  but  okay  I'm  gonna  go
[78:10] back  to  learning  you  ended  up  fapping  or 
 something  be  like  okay  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  it 
 go  on  it's  stupid  or  fat  but  whatever 
 I'm  gonna  go  back  to  learning  you'll
[78:16] find  that  you'll  make  less  mistakes  as 
 time  go  goes  on  because  you'll  naturally 
 just  learn  how  to  not  make  those
[78:21] mistakes 
 this  is  the  secret  monk  mode  protocol 
 that  changed  my  life  because  it  was  not
[78:26] an  easy  one  it  was  extreme  and  I  am  an 
 extreme  guy 
 when  you're  ready
[78:32] start  being  surrounded  by  Other  Extreme 
 men 
 or  the  men  who  are  on  the  same  path  as
[78:37] you  you  can  click  the  top  Link  in  the 
 description  which  is  the  Adonis  Academy 
 which  is  my  private  Community  go  click
[78:43] that  link  right  now  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 mwah
"
mP78d2JeY1o,"[00:00] Jeffrey  indulges  in  the  six  main  habits 
 for  keeping  men  weak  and  now  just  look 
 at  his  life  he's  a  young  man  with  no
[00:07] energy  no  drive  no  male  aggression  he's 
 a  wimp  a  coward  a  [ __ ]  he  obsesses  over
[00:13] girls  that  don't  even  know  that  he 
 exists  they  never  even  message  him  back 
 zero  matches  per  day  on  Tinder  it's  a
[00:20] sad  reality  being  a  weak  man  Adonis 
 what  kind  of  man  do  you  think  Adonis  is
[00:26] weak  or  strong  neither  Adonis  is  the
[00:31] ultimate  man  but  he  isn't  lucky  he 
 wasn't  born  like  this  Adonis  developed 
 himself  as  a  young  man  through  doing  the
[00:37] right  good  habits  he  stayed  away  from 
 the  instant  gratification  activities 
 that  he  saw  other  young  men  indulging  in
[00:43] the  six  main  bad  habits  that  are  keeping 
 you  weak  and  if  you  watch  till  the  end 
 of  this  video  I'll  explain  to  you  a  way
[00:48] to  overcome  them  much  easier  than 
 everything  else  that  you've  tried  so  far 
 the  first  two  bad  habits  we're  going  to
[00:54] couple  together  and  they  are  social 
 media  and  porn  and  it's  [ __ ] 
 it's  interesting  that  I  can  couple  them
[00:59] two  together  isn't  it  because  it's 
 pretty  much  the  same  thing  social  media 
 is  literally  Soft  Core  Pawn  these  days
[01:04] if  you  go  onto  Instagram  you  see  us  if 
 you're  going  to  tick  tock  you  see  ass  if 
 you  go  on  to  YouTube  you  see  like  sexy
[01:09] [ __ ]  in  a  bathrobe  honestly  I 
 was  just  gonna  make  this  video  as  like 
 one  of  those  clickbait  in  like  a  shorter
[01:14] video  and  it's  gonna  get  lots  of views 
 and  like  you  know  Alpha  M  kind  of  video 
 the  top  seven  bad  habits  to  number  one
[01:19] uh  number  two  but  wait  first  a  moment 
 from  our  sponsor  that  the  Timeless  piece
[01:24] like  [ __ ]  I'm  just  gonna  make  a  basic 
 ass  video  to  get  some  [ __ ]  views  and 
 as  soon  as  I  said  like  social  media  is
[01:29] pretty  much  just  like  porn  I  just  felt 
 [ __ ]  sick  I  [ __ ]  hate  what  the 
 world  has  come  to  bro  honestly  I  [ __ ]
[01:35] hate  that  my  generation  of  men  are  so 
 consumed  by  like  this  modern  technology 
 that's  so  bad  for  them  and  it's  so
[01:40] [ __ ]  hard  to  pull  a  young  man  out  of 
 this  this  is  my  work  this  is  my  purpose 
 my  mission  gives  me  a  great  deal  of
[01:46] fulfillment  but  I  wish  it  wasn't  like 
 this  when  you  overindulge  in  social
[01:51] media  which  is  extremely  hard  not  to  do 
 like  these  platforms  have  been  made  to 
 be  addictive  they've  been  made  to  like
[01:56] put  you  in  a  trance-like  state  you  can't 
 even  remember  like  you  know  what  time  it
[02:01] is  how  long  you've  spent  you  think 
 you've  spent  like  five  minutes  watching 
 YouTube  shorts  and  an  hour  passes  by  the
[02:07] same  with  Tick  Tock  if  you  only  want  to 
 keep  it  to  that  very  practical  level 
 you're  losing  a  lot  of  time  to  social
[02:13] media  and  porn  but  I  think  it's  what  it 
 does  to  like  the  rest  of  your  life  your 
 perception  of  the  world  especially
[02:18] because  of  how  sexualized  social  media 
 is  important  in  itself  is  just  [ __ ]  I 
 said  once  I  gave  this  analogy  which  you
[02:24] might  be  interested  in  what  happens  when 
 you're  watching  porn  in  like  your 
 evolutionary  caveman  kind  of  brain
[02:30] because  our  brain  hasn't  evolved  you 
 know  Evolution  takes  millions  of  years 
 isn't  it  so  our  brain  hasn't  really 
 evolved  we've  only  had  modern  technology
[02:36] for  like  10  20  years  our  brain  hasn't 
 involved  for  this  so  what  does  our  brain 
 think  is  happening  when  we  are  watching
[02:41] porn  it  thinks  it's  real  of  course 
 there's  a  part  of  our  brain  you  know 
 like  the  most  advanced  part  of  our  brain
[02:46] which  of  course  understands  Yep  this  is 
 porn  and  you  know  I'm  actually  a  loser 
 I'm  actually  just  looking  into  a  screen 
 but  there  is  like  an  evolutionary  part
[02:51] of  our  brain  like  the  brainstem  you  know 
 the  oldest  part  of  our  brain  the  caveman 
 kind  of  brain  which  literally  thinks 
 it's  real  it  thinks  that  you  have  such  a
[02:58] variety  city  of  sexual  options  I  know 
 that's  going  to  be  offensive  that  part 
 of  your  brain  doesn't  realize  that  you 
 are  a  [ __ ]  loser  that  you  are  the  one
[03:04] looking  into  a  screen  so  this  part  of 
 your  brain  is  like  caveman  part  of  your 
 brain  thinks  that  you  are  a  winner  it
[03:10] thinks  that  these  women  have  submitted 
 to  you  they're  they're  sexual  that's  why 
 your  dick  gets  hard  and  when  you  bust 
 the  nut  it's  like  oh  wow  like  we've
[03:15] achieved  the  height  of  male  life  we  have 
 successfully  fulfilled  our  sexual
[03:20] strategy  as  men  which  is  you  know  to 
 spread  our  seed  to  like  many  many 
 different  women  if  you  achieve  that
[03:25] ultimate  goal  of  male  life  what  would  be 
 after  that  well  rest  recover  get  some
[03:31] like  high  fat  High  processed  foods  go  to 
 sleep  feel  lethargic  you  don't  need  to 
 work  you  don't  need  to  go  to  the  gym  you
[03:37] don't  need  to  like  work  out  be 
 productive  you  don't  need  those  things 
 because  you've  just  achieved  the  height 
 of  male  life  that's  what  happens  when
[03:42] you  watch  things  like  porn  and  you  go  on 
 social  media  a  part  of  your  brain  just 
 thinks  that  you  are  like  the  ultimate 
 [ __ ]  Legend  and  because  of  that  it
[03:48] strips  you  of  your  motivation  to  go  and 
 do  the  things  that  would  actually  build 
 you  up  to  be  the  kind  of  man  who  can
[03:53] attract  the  women  that  you  actually  want 
 the  third  habit  that  keeps  you  weak  is 
 video  games  and  this  is
[03:58] this  is  a  controversial  it's 
 controversial  to  literally  say  video 
 games  are  bad  because  all  these  nerds
[04:03] will  disagree  with  me  and  they'll  say  oh 
 but  actually  if  I  want  to  shut  the  [ __ ] 
 up  any  argument  that  you  have  against 
 this  the  video  games  actually  help  you
[04:09] to  be  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  they  actually 
 help  you  to  be  creative  shut  up  shut  the 
 [ __ ]  up  the  reason  why  video  games  are
[04:14] fun  is  because  you  are  getting  like  this 
 virtual  stimulation  of  the  real  thing 
 that  you  wanted  you  never  wanted  to
[04:20] [ __ ]  level  up  in  Call  of  Duty  you 
 never  cared  like  we  evolutionarily  don't 
 care  about  prestiging  in  a  [ __ ]  video
[04:26] game  we  care  about  climbing  up  the  ranks 
 of  men  around  us  we  care  about  obtaining 
 status  and  power  and  having  Brotherhood
[04:33] in  our  lives  and  video  games  manipulate 
 those  core  masculine  desires  that  we 
 have  and  make  you  invest  into  the  game
[04:39] instead  because  it's  so  much  easier 
 getting  that  status  that  level  up  in  the 
 virtual  world  where  there's  no  real 
 discomfort  than  there  is  to  actually  go
[04:45] outside  in  the  real  world  and  level  up 
 the  day  in  day  out  after  months  years  a
[04:50] decade  you've  invested  so  much  of  your 
 time  your  mental  energy  that  it  becomes 
 so  hard  to  take  a  step  back  because  now
[04:56] your  life  in  the  real  world  is  so  much 
 worse  unless  you're  a  [ __ ]  gamer  so 
 here  you  are  in  the  Video  Game  World  you
[05:01] are  a  warrior  a  dragon  slayer  Prestige 
 seven  and  you've  left  the  gold  Famas  gun 
 on  [ __ ]  Black  Ops  you  can  tell  how
[05:07] long  I've  not  played  video  games  for 
 like  the  last  Call  of  Duty  I  played  was 
 [ __ ]  Black  Ops  one  the  more  of  a 
 legend  you  are  in  the  virtual  world  the
[05:13] more  of  a  loser  you  are  in  the  real 
 world  the  fourth  habit  that  keeps  you 
 weak  and  I  promise  I  promise  that  you
[05:19] are  suffering  from  this  [ __ ]  up  sleep 
 a  poor  sleeping  pattern  you  thought  all 
 of  the  things  I  was  gonna  say  was  just
[05:24] gonna  be  like  oh  yeah  like  porn  and 
 video  games  bro  sleep  is  the  fundamental 
 thing  that  you  need  to  improve  on  that
[05:29] the  majority  of  young  men  need  to 
 improve  on  I  want  to  ask  you  a  question 
 I'm  gonna  see  how  smart  you  really  are
[05:34] how  many  hours  of  sleep  do  we  need  per 
 night  yeah  everyone  says  like  seven  to 
 eight  or  whatever  right  let's  say  eight 
 if  you  want  eight  hours  of  sleep  and  you
[05:40] need  to  wake  up  at  six  a.m  what  time  do 
 you  go  to  bed  answer  that  question  right
[05:45] now  answer  that  [ __ ]  question  right 
 now  everyone  will  say  10  pm  won't  they 
 one  of  the  truths  that  not  many  people
[05:50] ever  like  to  think  about  is  that  the 
 time  that  you  spend  in  bed  is  not  the
[05:55] same  as  the  hours  of  sleep  that  you  get 
 this  ring  is  very  expensive  it's  like
[06:00] 300  400  but  it  tracks  your  sleep 
 meticulously  and  when  you  track  your 
 sleep  with  a  device  like  this  you
[06:06] realize  that  there's  such  a  thing  called 
 Sleep  efficiency  and  sleep  efficiency  is 
 kind  of  like  the  percentage  of  time  that
[06:12] you  are  asleep  of  the  time  that  you're 
 actually  in  bed  and  a  good  sleep 
 efficiency  is  80  you  know  what  that
[06:19] means  if  you  want  eight  hours  of  sleep 
 like  what's  recommended  by  all  these 
 people  you  know  uh  if  you  want  higher
[06:25] testosterone  asleep  at  least  eight  hours 
 a  night  you  know  you've  always  heard 
 that  right  if  you  want  eight  hours  of 
 sleep  you  need  to  be  in  bed  for  10  hours
[06:31] if  you  need  to  wake  up  at  6am  you  need 
 to  go  to  bed  at  8pm  no  one  is  doing  that
[06:37] so  you  need  to  right  now  not  think  that 
 this  is  talking  about  someone  else  you 
 need  to  hold  your  hand  up  right  now  and
[06:42] say  [ __ ]  my  sleeping  pattern  could  use 
 some  improvements  I  will  do  it  right  now 
 my  sleeping  pattern  me  my  sleeping
[06:48] pattern  could  use  some  improvements  when 
 you  track  your  sleep  you  realize  just 
 how  shitty  sleep  you're  actually  getting
[06:53] even  though  it  kind  of  felt  okay  the 
 fifth  bad  habit  that's  keeping  you  weak
[06:58] is  a  poor  modern  Western  diets  fast  food 
 and  sugar  but  I'm  not  going  to  spend 
 much  time  on  this  because  it's  just
[07:03] common  [ __ ]  sense  if  you're  eating 
 [ __ ]  if  your  diet  isn't  great  and  you're 
 eating  quite  like  processed  you  know  it 
 is  right  A  lot  of  people  will  just  spend
[07:09] so  long  grilling  you  on  it  but  no  one 
 will  tell  you  what  is  literally  the  most 
 practical  specific  advice  that  you  can
[07:14] do  to  like  how  do  you  actually  start 
 eating  healthy  and  no  one  actually  gives 
 you  good  advice  on  that  you  know  people 
 tell  you  oh  well  eat  fruits  and
[07:19] vegetables  but  they  don't  tell  you  okay 
 how  can  a  guy  who's  normally  eating 
 three  to  four  unhealthy  meals  per  day
[07:24] how  can  he  actually  transform  that 
 realistically  in  a  way  that  he  literally 
 would  do  the  specific  advice  that  you
[07:29] can  Implement  is  literally  choose  one 
 meal  a  day  to  change  to  a  meal  that  is
[07:34] just  entirely  of  vegetables  specifically 
 potatoes  as  like  the  main  carb  sauce  and
[07:39] then  if  you  are  a  meat  eater  with  a  bit 
 of  meat  so  essentially  just  one  meal  per 
 day  have  salmon  chicken  whatever  you  can
[07:44] like  bake  in  the  oven  alongside  a  bunch 
 of  vegetables  like  potatoes  drizzled  in
[07:49] olive  oil  and  that  is  like  one  meal 
 that's  now  incredibly  healthy  it's  very 
 minimally  processed  compared  to  like  all 
 the  [ __ ]  that  you  get  from  like
[07:54] McDonald's  like  hyper  processed  foods 
 it's  easy  to  cook  and  it'll  even  taste 
 nice  if  you  bake  it  and  you  actually
[07:59] drizzle  it  with  olive  oil  and  olive  oil 
 is  very  healthy  as  well  finally  the  last 
 habit  that's  keeping  you  weak  is  a  lot
[08:04] less  like  practical  it's  more  bushy 
 washy  but  it's  maybe  one  of  the  most 
 important  and  it's  being  emotional
[08:10] you've  been  convinced  as  a  young  man 
 that  you  should  be  in  touch  with  your 
 emotions  that  you  should  show  your 
 emotions  you  should  be  in  touch  with
[08:16] your  feminine  side  that  makes  you  weak 
 if  you  want  to  be  weak  if  you  want  to 
 not  have  the  respect  of  the  people  in
[08:22] your  life  if  you  want  to  lose  the 
 attraction  of  women  in  your  life  you 
 should  follow  that  [ __ ]  advice
[08:27] that's  pushed  down  young  boys  throats 
 when  they're  in  school  be  emotional  it's 
 okay  to  be  weak  be  in  touch  with  your
[08:32] [ __ ]  off  be  in  touch  with  your  emotions 
 now  that  isn't  to  say  that  you  shouldn't 
 be  aware  of  them  meditation  is  amazing
[08:37] for  this  meditation  will  make  you  aware 
 of  your  emotions  with  more  of  a  distance 
 journaling  does  a  very  similar  thing  and
[08:42] just  being  away  from  technology  and 
 stimulation  and  just  spending  time  in 
 like  nature  will  allow  you  to  observe
[08:47] your  emotions  at  a  distance  that's  an 
 incredibly  powerful  skill  because  a  man 
 who  can't  do  that  is  [ __ ]  worthless  I
[08:53] will  say  this  again  a  man  who  cannot 
 control  his  emotions  is  worthless  and 
 now  yet  again  you're  like  dumbass
[08:59] [ __ ]  Jeffrey  brain  lack  of  humility 
 things  that  I'm  talking  about  someone 
 else  this  may  be  one  of  the  first  times
[09:04] that  you  actually  hear  the  cold  hard 
 truth  like  the  [ __ ]  that  you  don't 
 really  want  to  hear  but  you  needed  to 
 hear  you  are  probably  you  are  my  you  are
[09:11] likely  an  emotional  young  man  you  have 
 been  raised  conditioned  brainwashed  to
[09:16] be  emotional  that  makes  you  worthless  as 
 a  man  no  one  will  speak  to  you  in  this 
 way  because  everyone's  so  used  to
[09:21] sugarcoating  things  and  just  saying 
 we're  all  beautiful  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  if 
 you  cannot  control  your  emotions  as  a 
 man  you  are  worthless  you  must  look  into
[09:28] what  is  called  stoicism  it's  kind  of 
 like  a  philosophy  but  it's  more  so  a  way 
 of  living  stoicism  and  then  also  get
[09:35] into  those  practices  meditation 
 journaling  time  away  from  like 
 stimulating  content  you'll  never  stop
[09:41] having  emotions  remember  this  you  will 
 always  get  emotions  bro  I  really  don't 
 want  to  record  these  videos  today
[09:46] honestly  I  just  didn't  really  feel  like 
 it  it's  11  54  a.m  right  now  I  was
[09:51] supposed  to  start  at  10  and  I  literally 
 just  kept  on  pushing  it  off  pushing  it 
 off  feeling  like  a  little  [ __ ]  oh  you 
 know  I'll  do  it  later  maybe  I  should  go
[09:57] eat  first  because  muscle  protein 
 assistant  all  this  other  [ __ ]  I  was  like 
 Bro  [ __ ]  this  like  the  reason  why  I'm
[10:02] not  recording  right  now  is  simply 
 because  I  don't  feel  like  it  [ __ ]  what  I 
 feel  like  if  you  allow  your  emotions  to 
 dictate  your  actions  you  will  live  such
[10:09] a  pathetic  existence  as  a  man  no  one 
 will  respect  you  no  woman  will  be 
 attracted  to  you  you  must  create  a
[10:15] distance  between  yourself  and  your 
 emotions  now  that  means  that  you  will 
 feel  the  emotion  of  being  a  little  [ __ ]
[10:20] you  will  feel  the  emotion  of  stress  and 
 anger  guilt  shame  whatever  you  will  feel 
 these  emotions  but  you  do  not  allow  them
[10:26] to  control  you  and  in  fact  you  start  to 
 control  your  emotions  now  how  can  you
[10:32] reverse  these  bad  habits  because  you've 
 probably  tried  you've  probably  tried  to 
 you  know  like  quit  porn  and  go  on  to 
 semen  retention  and  no  fat  and  take  a
[10:38] detox  away  from  like  social  media  and 
 video  games  and  you  know  try  a  new  diet 
 you've  probably  tried  those  things  and 
 you've  probably  struggled  a  little  bit
[10:43] the  reason  why  is  because  all  of  the 
 habits  that  we've  just  spoke  about  are 
 not  actually  problems  they  are  symptoms
[10:49] all  of  these  things  are  symptoms  of  the 
 real  core  problem  the  plight  of  modern
[10:55] young  men  and  it  is  mental  health  your 
 problems  right  now  are  not  problems  they
[11:00] are  simply  just  a  symptom  of  your  poor 
 mental  health  I've  made  videos  on  Mental 
 Health  that  you  can  find  you  can  just
[11:05] search  like  Hamza  mental  health  onto 
 YouTube  or  click  on  my  channel  and 
 you'll  be  able  to  find  them  if  you 
 invest  your  time  instead  about  learning
[11:11] and  then  improving  your  mental  health 
 you'll  find  that  these  bad  habits 
 they'll  automatically  with  ease  start
[11:17] dropping  away  from  your  life  a  person 
 with  good  mental  health  does  not  jack 
 off  six  times  a  day  a  person  with  good
[11:22] mental  health  does  not  eat  [ __ ]  food  a 
 person  with  good  mental  health  has  good 
 sleep  focus  on  Mental  Health  First  and
[11:27] you'll  find  that  all  of  these  other 
 things  just  fix  themselves  click  on  this 
 video  to  learn  more  right  now  do  the 
 hard  work  especially  when  you  don't  feel
[11:32] like  it
"
_mEXEIwsNkU,"[00:00] Jeffrey  was  never  given  proper  life 
 advice  he's  25  years  old  and  yet  he's 
 still  lonely  broke  and  weak  he's  still
[00:07] sitting  around  waiting  for  someone  to 
 give  him  Direction  you're  wasting  your 
 life  Jeffrey
[00:15] I'd  honest  grew  up  with  two  loving 
 parents  his  father  spent  years  teaching
[00:20] him  about  the  game  of  life  so  that  he 
 knew  when  it  was  time  to  play  he'd  take 
 All  the  Right  Moves  he  lives  with
[00:26] purpose  ambition  and  drive  this  is  why 
 Adonis  is  so  successful
[00:31] number  one  start  self-improvement  now 
 when  you  look  around  and  you  see  your 
 peers  who  are  addicted  to  tick  tock  and
[00:38] porn  and  video  games  you  see  that 
 although  they  might  be  having  some  fun 
 they're  not  really  doing  much  productive 
 with  their  lives  the  thing  is  that  right
[00:44] here  right  now  the  time  that  you  spend 
 compounds  exponentially  so  if  you  spend
[00:49] an  hour  working  maybe  an  hour  exercising 
 maybe  an  hour  reading  those  things  are 
 actually  worth  so  much  more  than  an  hour
[00:55] because  you're  so  young  and  so  every 
 decision  you  make  is  kind  of  like  it's 
 bigger  than  the  decision  itself  but
[01:00] every  hour  that  your  friends  spend 
 playing  video  games  or  every  hour  that 
 they  spend  on  Tick  Tock  it's  degrading
[01:05] their  mental  health  their  physical 
 health  they're  just  feeling  lazy  you 
 know  it  [ __ ]  up  their  dopamine  and  now 
 they  can't  even  enjoy  working  or
[01:10] studying  at  this  age  one  of  the  best 
 things  that  you  can  do  is  start 
 self-improvement  and  if  you  just  click
[01:15] on  my  channel  profile  there's  a  video 
 that  presents  itself  on  my  channel  as 
 some  trailer  and  it's  a  full  guide  to
[01:20] self-improvement  it's  about  an  hour  long 
 you  can  watch  it  kind  of  like  a  Netflix 
 episode  and  it's  got  actionable  steps  so
[01:25] watch  that  video  when  you're  ready  to 
 take  some  action  life  lesson  number  two 
 be  independent  having  the  support  of
[01:30] your  parents  and  your  friends  is  amazing 
 but  this  is  the  time  to  really  start  to 
 try  and  make  some  decisions  for  yourself
[01:35] and  be  okay  with  failure  so  that  can  be 
 habit  number  three  be  okay  with  failure 
 be  okay  with  failure  and  making  mistakes
[01:42] make  some  decisions  for  yourself  like 
 what  you  want  to  eat  what  you  want  to  do 
 what  you  want  to  choose  for  your  your 
 gcses  or  your  a  levels  and  if  it's  a
[01:49] mistake  or  a  failure  that's  okay  at  this 
 age  you  need  to  have  this  lesson  that 
 it's  okay  to  mess  up  in  fact  every  great
[01:55] person  that  you  see  before  you  every 
 successful  person  every  strong  man  every 
 rich  guy  they've  made  countless  of
[02:01] mistakes  they've  had  countless  of 
 failures  I  have  a  video  on  my  channel 
 titled  I  am  a  failure  and  you  might  be
[02:07] interested  in  that  number  four  think 
 about  your  future  it's  normal  right  now 
 to  live  in  the  moment  you  know  that
[02:12] phrase  YOLO  you  only  live  once  that's 
 what  a  lot  of  people  your  age  use  as  an 
 excuse  to  just  maximize  the  pleasure
[02:18] that  they  get  today  so  you  know  oh  you 
 only  live  one  so  let's  take  drugs  let's 
 keep  playing  video  games  let's  eat  junk 
 food  YOLO  YOLO  people  do  that  because
[02:24] they  don't  consider  that  they're  still 
 gonna  be  alive  to  experience  the 
 consequences  this  life  lesson  of
[02:29] thinking  about  your  future  is  so 
 important  and  you  right  here  right  now 
 need  to  identify  that  you're  most  likely
[02:34] going  to  keep  living  on  you  you're  going 
 to  be  alive  five  years  from  now  10  years 
 from  now  you  can  be  silly  or  you  are  but 
 what  if  I  get  hit  by  a  butt  just  shut  up
[02:39] bro  come  on  let's  be  serious  you're 
 gonna  be  alive  for  a  long  time  like  what 
 age  do  you  actually  want  to  live  to 
 maybe  you've  never  even  asked  this
[02:45] question  to  yourself  before  and  you  know 
 in  your  mind  you're  just  thinking  oh 
 like  a  79  because  that's  the  average  age 
 that  you  know  a  man  lives  I  don't  know
[02:51] [ __ ]  the  average  what  age  do  you  want  to 
 live  to  100  let's  say  100  right  well 
 you've  identified  you're  going  to  be 
 alive  for  that  amount  of  time  and  so
[02:57] you've  got  to  make  sure  that  you  set 
 your  life  up  in  a  way  that  you're  still 
 having  a  good  life  because  if  you  plan 
 to  live  a  long  life  then  surely  you'll
[03:02] want  to  still  be  fit  and  healthy  and 
 Wealthy  when  you're  50  maybe  even  when 
 you're  60  you  still  want  to  be  able  to
[03:07] like  run  around  and  go  to  the  gym  most 
 people  don't  consider  this  they  don't 
 think  about  their  future  they  don't 
 think  about  the  consequences  of  their
[03:13] actions  and  so  they  do  things  that  gives 
 them  the  most  amount  of  like  pleasure 
 and  fun  and  happiness  today  which  is
[03:18] usually  just  indulging  in  things  that 
 actually  make  your  life  in  the  future 
 worse  most  people  over  indulge  in
[03:23] instant  gratification  so  they'll  spend  a 
 day  just  playing  video  games  eating  junk 
 food  taking  drugs  and  they  don't  realize
[03:28] that  that's  gonna  make  their  future 
 worse  if  this  is  you  right  here  right 
 narrow  start  to  think  about  your  future
[03:33] self  as  like  a  separate  identity  started 
 literally  start  to  like  create  this 
 image  of  your  future  self  this  guy  who
[03:39] is  you  in  the  future  see  him  in  your 
 mind  and  you  want  the  secret  to  a  good 
 life  do  whatever  it  takes  to  make  him
[03:44] grateful  for  you  when  you  look  back  to 
 your  younger  self  maybe  you  have  some
[03:49] level  of  like  self-hate  because  that 
 little  [ __ ]  didn't  study  when  he  was 
 supposed  to  he  ate  the  junk  food  he  took
[03:55] the  drugs  he  wasted  time  and  sure  you 
 know  he  was  young  and  stuff  but  like  you 
 do  have  this  level  of  like  negativity 
 towards  your  younger  self  and  that's  no
[04:01] way  to  live  that's  how  most  people  live 
 but  as  you  get  onto  self-improvement  you 
 know  you  follow  the  first  life  lesson
[04:06] that  we  talked  about  and  you  start  to  do 
 things  for  your  future  self  and  you 
 stick  to  this  as  best  as  you  can  for 
 months  or  years  eventually  you  become
[04:12] that  future  version  of  yourself  and  you 
 can't  help  but  just  look  back  to  you 
 today  and  feel  grateful  for  you  because
[04:18] you  know  for  me  it  wasn't  me  who  built 
 this  YouTube  channel  with  a  million 
 subscribers  it  wasn't  me  who  built  this
[04:24] Physique  in  the  gym  it  was  my  younger 
 self  so  when  I  think  back  about  like 
 younger  me  and  you  know  when  I  think
[04:29] about  myself  I  feel  happy  because  I  I 
 took  the  right  decisions  even  though 
 they  were  painful  at  the  time  you  know  I
[04:34] had  to  do  all  these  like  hard  work  tasks 
 and  I  had  to  go  to  the  gym  and  I  didn't 
 feel  like  it  I  did  those  hard  things  so
[04:39] that  I  today  could  enjoy  the  rewards  of 
 them  and  so  I  love  myself  I'm  so  happy 
 that  younger  me  set  me  up  for  success
[04:45] but  what  if  I  spent  the  last  two  years 
 smoking  weed  what  if  I  never  thought 
 about  my  future  well  me  today  I'd  be
[04:50] Looking  Back  thinking  come  on  man  you 
 stole  my  success  my  happiness  for  your 
 own  Indulgence  and  pleasure  and  that's
[04:55] no  way  to  live  make  sure  you  think  about 
 your  future  number  five  be  immune  to 
 negative  peer  pressure  peer  pressure  is
[05:02] when  your  friends  or  the  people  around 
 you  maybe  your  family  maybe  Society 
 maybe  the  media  maybe  YouTubers  convince
[05:08] you  to  do  something  that  probably  isn't 
 good  for  you  so  this  is  why  I've  called 
 it  negative  peer  pressure  because  some 
 peer  pressure  could  be  a  good  thing  if
[05:14] you're  all  friends  with  a  bunch  of  Rich 
 guys  and  they're  like  come  on  man  make 
 your  own  business  that's  that's  positive 
 peer  pressure  and  we  want  that  in  our
[05:19] lives  but  usually  peer  pressure  is 
 usually  quite  negative  it's  from  like 
 the  generate  friends  who  are  telling  you 
 like  oh  come  on  bro  one  more  game  bro
[05:24] don't  log  off  of  Discord  just  yet  bro 
 one  more  game  or  if  you're  a  little  bit 
 older  and  you're  taking  drugs  it's  all 
 going  bro  just  have  a  smoke  bro  just
[05:30] just  have  a  smoke  a  lot  of  young  guys 
 fall  victim  to  peer  pressure  why  because 
 we're  lonely  as  [ __ ]  and  the  thing  is  as
[05:36] humans  we  are  tribe  creatures  like  we 
 are  like  supposed  to  be  in  a  try  we're 
 supposed  to  be  around  other  people  and
[05:42] so  when  we're  so  lonely  and  we  see  the 
 way  to  actually  have  a  vibrant  social 
 life  it's  to  be  degenerate  with  the
[05:47] degenerates  is  to  be  playing  video  games 
 with  the  video  games  is  to  be  taking 
 drugs  with  the  drug  addicts  like
[05:52] sometimes  we  just  fall  victim  to  this 
 because  we'd  rather  have  this  negative 
 consequence  of  you  know  taking  drugs
[05:57] than  just  being  lonely  like  loneliness 
 is  one  of  the  worst  things  that  can 
 happen  but  sometimes  it  can  be  better  to
[06:03] be  alone  honestly  it's  pretty  much 
 always  better  to  be  alone  than  it  is  to 
 be  surrounded  by  bad  people  who  don't
[06:09] even  like  you  who  don't  even  want  the 
 best  for  you  make  sure  you  stay  immune 
 to  the  negative  peer  pressure  that  can
[06:14] come  from  some  you  know  people  from  your 
 friends  your  family  from  even  the  media 
 broke  if  you  go  onto  Tick  Tock  right  now
[06:19] without  anything  if  you  listen  to  songs 
 on  Spotify  you're  experiencing  some 
 level  of  peer  pressure  you're  hearing
[06:24] these  rappers  talk  about  making  money 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  taking  drugs  killing 
 people  and  you  might  think  oh  you  know
[06:29] it  doesn't  do  anything  to  me  the  thing 
 is  it  does  slightly  really  change  what 
 you  desire  if  you  every  day  you  listen
[06:34] to  some  degenerate  content  you  listen  to 
 like  you  know  degenerates  talking  about 
 like  some  female  rappers  they're  [ __ ]
[06:39] making  this  stuff  yeah  [ __ ]  it  [ __ ]  off 
 you  listen  to  her  like  talking  about 
 like  getting  [ __ ]  down  by  her  drug
[06:44] dealer  or  something  like  that  like  it  is 
 Gonna  Change  you  as  a  person  it 
 absolutely  will  like  you  must  have  this
[06:49] humility  to  admit  like  you're  not  some 
 rock  solid  bulletproof  person  who  these
[06:54] outside  influences  can't  change  you  at 
 all  I  will  admit  right  now  like  I've 
 been  on  self-improvement  for  a  while  I'm 
 kind  of  you  know  confident  quite
[06:59] independent  guy  the  outside  world  still 
 influences  me  heavily  so  if  you're  quite 
 a  young  impressionable  teenager  you
[07:04] should  just  take  some  moments  the  next 
 time  you're  about  to  consume  some  kind 
 of  content  or  the  next  time  you're  about
[07:09] to  speak  to  someone  and  just  ask 
 yourself  what  is  your  life  going  to  be 
 like  if  you  become  just  like  this  person 
 if  you've  got  a  friend  who  smokes  weed
[07:15] all  the  time  and  you  know  you  always 
 smoke  with  them  like  you're  gonna  become 
 like  that  friend  he's  probably  getting 
 bad  grades  he's  probably  going  to  be 
 broke  all  of  his  life  you  don't  want  to
[07:21] be  like  that  if  you're  watching  contents 
 from  inspiring  strong  masculine  men 
 Honestly  by  following  it  you're  probably
[07:27] gonna  become  more  like  that  if  you 
 follow  Andrew  Tate  and  he's  saying  yeah 
 get  into  this  gym  men  do  push-ups  and
[07:32] make  money  you're  probably  going  to 
 become  a  little  bit  more  like  Tate  every 
 time  if  you  watch  my  videos  and  I  tell 
 you  about  mental  health  and 
 self-improvement  you're  probably  going
[07:37] to  become  a  little  bit  more  like  me  if 
 you  listen  to  [ __ ]  little  Naz 
 twerking  on  the  devil  if  you  watch  like
[07:42] this  degenerate  content  then  you're 
 probably  going  to  become  more  like  that 
 and  leading  on  from  that  life  lesson 
 number  six  is  to  not  change  your
[07:48] principles  to  fit  in  you  have  inside  of 
 you  some  core  values  and  principles  most 
 likely  that  your  parents  put  inside  of
[07:53] you  or  maybe  your  religion  or  anyone  who 
 is  quite  important  to  you  and  sometimes 
 you  can  become  very  aware  that  you've
[07:58] started  to  sacrifice  your  principles  and 
 your  values  to  try  and  fit  in  around 
 those  people  maybe  you  know  there's  an
[08:03] element  of  peer  pressure  there  it'd  be 
 so  worth  your  time  right  here  right  now 
 to  just  pause  the  video  and  just  ask
[08:08] yourself  what  do  you  value  what  are  your 
 principles  do  you  really  value  honestly 
 well  if  you  respect  yourself  then  you
[08:14] can't  be  friends  with  Liars  do  you 
 really  value  discipline  well  then  if  you 
 respect  yourself  you  can't  be  friends
[08:19] with  someone  who  isn't  disciplined  or  at 
 least  trying  to  become  disciplined  you 
 know  being  friends  with  someone  who's 
 not  very  disciplined  but  it's  trying  it
[08:25] fair  enough  but  being  friends  with 
 someone  who  doesn't  even  care  about 
 discipline  he  just  wants  to  play  video 
 games  and  eat  junk  food  is  you  two  don't
[08:30] match  if  there  few  minutes  of  this  video 
 is  really  relevant  to  you  and  you  know 
 you're  thinking  about  some  particular 
 friends  right  now  I  have  a  video  on  my
[08:36] second  Channel  called  they're  not  your 
 friends  and  you  might  be  interested  in 
 that  if  you  just  search  Hamza  they're
[08:41] not  your  friends  on  YouTube  you'll  be 
 able  to  see  it  number  seven  earn  respect 
 there's  a  few  ways  to  earn  respect  and
[08:46] they're  very  practical  the  fastest  way 
 to  earn  the  respect  of  someone  instantly 
 literally  the  moment  that  they  look  at
[08:52] you  is  to  literally  just  be  bigger  be 
 physically  bigger  as  a  man  like  the 
 bigger  you  are  as  a  man  in  terms  of
[08:57] muscle  will  get  you  the  respect  of  other 
 guys  now  you  don't  need  to  be  some  like 
 big  steroid  beat  head  or  something  but 
 if  you're  pretty  skinny  right  now  or
[09:02] you're  skinny  fat  or  you're  just  fat  the 
 thing  is  when  someone  instantly  looks  at 
 you  their  respect  for  you  is  not  going
[09:07] to  be  high  honestly  I'm  just  going  to 
 say  this  right  now  I'm  gonna  tell  you  my 
 at  least  truth  and  maybe  this  is 
 relevant  for  other  people  if  I  see  some
[09:12] skinny  guys  like  I  don't  I  don't  respect 
 them  straight  away  if  I  see  some  fat  guy 
 I  don't  respect  him  if  I  see  some  guy 
 who's  in  shape  there's  an  instant  level
[09:18] of  respect  and  like  this  sort  of  like 
 almost  like  a  level  of  admiration 
 Ramirez  fair  enough  he's  put  in  some
[09:23] work  if  you  want  that  kind  of  effect 
 from  people  as  soon  as  they  look  at  you 
 they  literally  just  respect  you  and  even 
 girls  as  well  you  need  to  just  go  to  the
[09:29] gym  start  doing  some  resist  distance 
 training  which  essentially  means  like 
 body  weight  exercises  weight  lifting  or
[09:34] calisthenics  you're  the  kind  of  things 
 that  you  do  like  for  Reps  for  sets  and 
 you  use  weight  or  something  those  are
[09:39] the  things  that  will  build  muscle  and 
 when  you  build  muscle  you  get  so  much 
 more  respect  it's  the  single  greatest 
 thing  you  can  do  I  have  like  three
[09:44] workout  routines  that  you  can  find  in 
 the  description  as  well  after  that  you 
 can  continue  to  Skyrocket  how  much
[09:49] respect  you're  getting  from  people  by 
 the  work  that  you  do  and  the  success 
 that  you've  built  up  you  see  life  is  a 
 masculine  man  is  all  about  just  work  in
[09:55] the  modern  day  there's  a  lot  of  feminine 
 men  out  there  who  are  trying  to  escape 
 work  and  you  know  that  you  don't  like 
 working  you  just  want  to  play  you  just
[10:01] want  to  like  you  know  just  chill  and  be 
 lazy  that's  a  trait  of  feminine  men  who 
 try  and  like  you  know  avoid  work  a
[10:06] masculine  man  craves  work  it's  just  fun 
 as  [ __ ]  it's  the  only  thing  that  you 
 really  want  to  spend  your  time  doing  and 
 so  other  masculine  men  judge  each  other
[10:11] on  the  work  that  the  person  does  and  the 
 amount  of  success  that  they've  built  up 
 so  if  you  do  want  to  get  the  respect  of 
 masculine  men  work  and  build  something
[10:17] successful  number  eight  give  respect  now 
 if  you  want  the  respect  of  other  people 
 well  we  all  do  if  you're  the  person  who
[10:23] gives  respect  to  other  people  and  not 
 you  know  not  in  a  fake  way  don't  just 
 respect  someone  for  no  reason  but  if 
 you're  open  with  how  much  you  admire  and
[10:30] respect  someone  and  you  told  them  I 
 respect  you  for  that  wow  you've  got  such 
 a  nice  physique  yeah  respect  man  I've 
 got  a  lot  of  respect  for  that  discipline
[10:36] well  everyone  wants  respect  so  you're 
 giving  people  what  they  want  this  is  a 
 fundamental  principle  of  social  skills
[10:41] so  if  you  want  to  be  more  socially 
 connected  with  other  people  give  them 
 what  they  want  they  want  some  praise
[10:46] they  want  acknowledgment  for  the  things 
 that  they've  worked  hard  on  especially 
 men  especially  masculine  men  masculine 
 men  are  quite  independent  and  you  know
[10:52] they  just  work  on  their  own  things 
 anyway  so  they  don't  need  this  but  if 
 you  do  compliment  a  masculine  man  for
[10:57] the  work  and  the  success  that  he's  built 
 trust  me  I  want  to  say  like  he  will 
 appreciate  it  heavily  and  he  will 
 remember  you  don't  do  this  in  a  way  to
[11:02] kiss  us  like  I'll  do  this  and  hopefully 
 they'll  like  me  but  just  do  it  because 
 you  actually  really  do  respect  the  guy
[11:07] so  make  sure  you  don't  do  this  in  a  fake 
 way  where  you  know  there's  someone  that 
 you  don't  even  like  you  don't  even 
 respect  but  you're  just  like  practicing
[11:12] this  anyway  literally  go  and  find  the 
 guys  that  you  look  up  to  go  and  find  the 
 guys  that  you  respect  maybe  it's  Andrew 
 say  maybe  to  Me  Maybe  it's  like  some
[11:18] other  role  model  that  you  know  and 
 literally  just  comment  message  them 
 email  them  and  just  tell  them  like  yeah 
 like  I  respect  the  work  that  you've  done
[11:23] and  you  know  I've  watched  you  for  a 
 while  like  when  you  say  these  things  the 
 guy  at  the  top  who  seems  like  this  big 
 guy  like  bro  he  crumbles  and  he's  like
[11:28] suddenly  he  just  seems  like  a  human 
 figure  when  you're  speaking  to  him  like 
 you're  a  man  and  it's  a  nice
[11:33] transformation  for  you  to  go  through  as 
 well  because  your  identity  changes  when 
 you're  the  guy  telling  someone  like 
 Andrew  T  like  yeah  like  you  I  really
[11:38] respect  you  suddenly  you're  not  like 
 some  like  little  follower  fan  or 
 anything  like  he's  gonna  look  at  you 
 like  you're  a  man  number  nine  don't  be
[11:44] afraid  of  outgrowing  your  friends  so 
 this  is  somewhat  similar  to  the  elements 
 of  peer  pressure  that  we  covered  but
[11:50] this  is  something  that  a  lot  of  young 
 guys  who  are  consuming  this  kind  of 
 content  go  through  there's  an  issue  with
[11:55] the  friends  that  you  have  when  you're 
 young  you  know  can  you  guess  what  it  is 
 there  is  one  huge  issue  that  it's  so 
 obvious  it  seems  like  you  and  your
[12:01] friends  became  friends  because  of  the 
 people  you  are  and  you  know  you  like 
 each  other  you  didn't  actually  honestly
[12:06] the  biggest  reason  why  you  become 
 friends  when  you're  young  with  someone 
 else  is  literally  just  because  you  go  to
[12:11] the  same  school  together  it's  as  simple 
 as  that  you  literally  just  become 
 friends  with  people  that  you  have  to  sit 
 next  to  it's  just  like  how  co-workers
[12:17] are  friends  it's  like  yeah  yeah  like  if 
 you  don't  hang  out  outside  of  school 
 like  significantly  then  they're  not  even
[12:22] friends  to  begin  with  just  the  same  as 
 their  co-workers  if  they  don't  hang  out 
 outside  of  work  then  they're  not  friends 
 to  begin  with  but  let's  say  that  there
[12:27] is  a  good  group  of  friends  that  you  have 
 right  now  and  you've  already  started  to 
 feel  this  this  concept  of  like  yeah 
 you're  almost  outgrowing  them  they're
[12:33] still  acting  like  little  [ __ ]  boys 
 playing  video  games  eating  junk  food 
 like  children  and  you  actually  want  to 
 start  looking  into  like  business  and
[12:39] being  productive  and  your  friends  find 
 that  like  gay  for  some  reason  they're 
 just  called  it  gay  or  they  call  it  weird 
 like  oh  why  are  you trying  so  hard  or
[12:44] something  it's  okay  to  abandon  people 
 like  I  know  that  sounds  like  really  sad 
 and  stuff  but  honestly  like  a  lot  of
[12:50] successful  people  have  done  this  as  you 
 improve  and  people  in  your  life  just 
 stay  the  same  it's  like  you're  no  longer 
 relatable  and  so  when  you  do  respect
[12:57] yourself  enough  to  not  waste  time  with 
 people  that  you  don't  even  enjoy  being 
 around  anymore  you  take  a  big  step  back 
 from  it  now  you  don't  have  to  do  this  in
[13:03] some  cringe  way  where  you  message  them 
 the  last  message  oh  goodbye  everyone  but 
 just  slowly  just  distance  yourself  you
[13:08] know  the  the  group  chat's  popping  right 
 now  on  Discord  or  Whatsapp  or  whatever 
 or  SnapChat  don't  open  it  you  know  oh
[13:13] you're  gonna  come  online  today  bro  don't 
 reply  see  them  in  school  or  Whatever 
 Whenever  you  usually  see  them  and  you 
 know  just  be  kind  of  nice  to  them  but
[13:19] just  focus  on  your  work  on  your  studies 
 whatever  and  slowly  and  surely  they'll 
 just  kind  of  like  move  on  without  you 
 and  you'll  realize  that  honestly  you
[13:24] were  never  that  close  anyway  like  they 
 just  moved  on  from  like  easily  half  the 
 guys  in  your  friendship  group  don't  even
[13:29] care  about  you  at  least  one  of  the guys 
 in  the  that  actively  dislikes  you  and 
 there's  usually  just  one  friend  who
[13:34] likes  you  but  who  might  be  like  just  not 
 on  your  level  anymore  and  he's  usually 
 the  one  I  really  recommend  trying  to
[13:39] bring  on  to  self-improvement  so  you 
 probably  have  one  guy  who's  actually 
 like  really  [ __ ]  nice  and  like  you 
 know  you  actually  get  along  with  each
[13:44] other  there's  no  like  ill  feelings 
 there's  no  time  where  he's  like  made  fun 
 of  you  or  anything  that's  usually  the 
 guy  that  I  recommend  like  yeah  like
[13:49] broke  any  amounts  of  self-improvement 
 send  him  some  of  these  videos  tell  him 
 to  stop  meditating  tell  them  stop 
 getting  into  the  gym  he  might  do
[13:54] oftentimes  what  really  happens  is  like 
 the  guy  who's  listening  to  this  tries  to 
 get  his  friend  onto  self-improvements
[13:59] being  productive  and  then  his  friend 
 just  doesn't  and  then  their  relationship 
 diffuses  anyway  I've  honestly  never  met
[14:04] really  anyone  who's  successfully  been 
 able  to  like  get  their  friends  onto 
 self-improvements  because  I  think  it's  a
[14:09] very  individual  solo  Journey  you  really 
 have  to  desire  this  by  yourself  life 
 lesson  number  10  show  gratitude  and
[14:16] especially  to  your  parents  a  lot  of 
 young  guys  don't  actually  do  this  like 
 this  is  the  age  when  you  really  start  to
[14:21] want  to  take  a  big  step  away  from  your 
 parents  control  and  you  want  to  be  your 
 own  man  and  you  know  at  the  start  of 
 this  this  video  I  did  tell  you  yeah  be
[14:27] independent  but  with  being  Independence 
 you  can  still  be  very  grateful  for  your 
 parents  especially  I  only  ever  showed
[14:33] gratitude  to  my  parents  when  I  was 
 around  23  years  old  and  through  all  My 
 Teenage  life  I  was  so  convinced  they
[14:38] were  bad  people  I  hated  them  because  you 
 know  they'd  shout  at  me  and  they  were 
 controlling  and  you  know  sometimes  like
[14:43] there  was  abusive  stuff  going  on  and  so 
 I  only  ever  saw  my  parents  negatively  it
[14:48] was  only  years  later  where  I  actually 
 began  to  like  relate  to  them  you  know  I 
 started  working  full  time  and  when  I
[14:53] worked  like  a  shitty  full-time  job  I 
 literally  just  looked  at  my  father  in  a 
 different  way  and  I  just  thought  like 
 holy  [ __ ]  this  man  has  devoted  his  life
[14:59] to  us  like  I  needed  to  to  work  full  time 
 first  to  be  able  to  relate  to  my  father
[15:04] who  was  working  full-time  to  provide  for 
 the  family  for  like  you  know  20  years 
 working  two  jobs  and  suddenly  I  started
[15:09] to  realize  like  wait  he  has  to 
 absolutely  love  us  if  he's  worked  like 
 that  to  provide  for  us  that's  when  I
[15:15] became  grateful  I'm  glad  that  I  became 
 grateful  for  them  at  this  moments  and  we 
 were  able  to  improve  our  relationship
[15:20] but  some  part  of  me  does  wish  like  what 
 if  I  just  was  grateful  10  years  earlier 
 imagine  how  different  our  relationship
[15:25] would  have  been  so  this  is  a  message  to 
 you  right  now  no  matter  how  you  feel 
 about  your  parents  I  guarantee  these
[15:30] things  that  you  can  be  grateful  for  and 
 especially  right  now  if  you  are  so 
 certain  that  there's  nothing  to  be 
 grateful  for  I  really  really  urge  you  to
[15:36] just  sit  down  and  spend  half  an  hour  on 
 this  if  you  can  just  like  trust  what  I'd 
 say  and  just  blindly  try  it  this  will
[15:41] literally  change  your  life  forever  sit 
 down  with  a  document  open  on  your  PC  or 
 your  notepad  on  your  phone  and  just  ask
[15:46] what  could  I  be  grateful  for  my  parents 
 and  the  first  few  answers  will  literally 
 take  a  while  and  you'll  be  so  pissed  off
[15:51] thinking  yeah  and  you'll  write  some  like 
 condescending  sarcastic  [ __ ]  or 
 something  oh  yeah  I'm  grateful  that  they 
 abused  me  like  if  you  really  dedicate
[15:57] yourself  to  this  and  really  try  and  do 
 it  seriously  your  life  will  never  be  the 
 same  afterwards  because  I  did  it  and  you 
 know  I  I  was  joking  around  I'm  glad  my
[16:04] dad  slapped  me  like  he  was  such  a  bad 
 person  like  I  mentioned  I  started 
 writing  some  good  things  and  then  I 
 started  writing  like  I'm  grateful  that
[16:09] my  father  worked  60  to  80  hours  a  week 
 every  single  week  for  as  long  as  I  can
[16:14] remember  when  I'd  wake  up  early  to  go  to 
 school  he  was  already  out  working  I'd 
 come  back  home  he'd  still  be  at  work
[16:19] he'd  come  home  from  work  when  it  was 
 dark  at  like  6  p.m  7  P.M  stay  up  for 
 like  one  hour  two  hours  then  go  to  bed
[16:24] and  do  it  again  why  to  provide  for  his 
 family  I  was  certain  there  was  nothing 
 to  be  grateful  for  took  me  20  minutes  to
[16:30] come  with  that  and  then  I  realized  oh  he 
 loved  me  all  this  time  life  lesson 
 number  11  take  responsibility  and
[16:37] ownership  of  everything  that  happens 
 it's  very  easy  for  you  right  now  since 
 you  are  quite  young  to  not  take
[16:42] ownership  of  certain  things  so  if 
 there's  a  problem  that  happens  if 
 there's  an  accident  if  you  know 
 something  messes  up  it's  very  easy  for
[16:47] you  right  now  to  just  kind  of  you  know 
 push  off  the  blame  a  little  bit  to 
 someone  else  and  to  say  oh  you  know  it's
[16:52] um it's  the  school's  faults  that  I've 
 been  getting  bad  grades  oh  you  know  it's 
 my  parents  fault  that  I'm  fat  oh  you 
 know  it's  my  parents  my  mom's  fault  that
[16:58] I'm  not  muscular  because  she  won't  let 
 me  get  protein  powder  so  easy  for  you  to 
 blame  someone  else  but  the  teenagers  who
[17:03] go  on  to  become  strong  successful  Men 
 start  to  take  ownership  of  everything 
 and  this  might  piss  you  off  a  little  bit
[17:08] because  you  might  be  sat  here  right  now 
 saying  but  no  no  but  it  really  is 
 someone  else's  faults  and  the  thing  is
[17:13] objectively  by  the  the  objective  truths 
 of  the  universe  it  might  be  someone 
 else's  fault  but  you  don't  gain  anything
[17:18] from  saying  that  you  see  you  gain  the 
 most  when  you  take  total  ownership 
 control  and  responsibility  of  every
[17:25] situation  in  your  life  so  why  not  try 
 that  next  time  something  like  [ __ ] 
 happens  next  time  you  get  bad  grades  or 
 the  next  time  shutters  or  whatever  it  is
[17:32] blame  it  on  yourself  in  a  mature  way  I'm 
 responsible  for  that  and  I'm  gonna  try 
 my  best  not  to  let  that  happen  again
[17:37] lesson  number  12  have  some  humility  now 
 humility  is  the  skill  of  disobeying  your
[17:43] ego  your  ego  is  this  thing  inside  of  you 
 that  thinks  you're  so  amazing  everyone 
 else  is  is  really  bad  you're  better  than
[17:49] everyone  else  and  that  you  don't  really 
 need  to  learn  anything  else  like  you're 
 already  so  great  ego  is  what  leads  a  lot
[17:55] of  people  to  initial  success  you  know 
 because  they  believe  yeah  I'm  so  great 
 and  so  they  end  up  making  some  progress
[18:00] but  then  they  actually  get  complacent 
 and  they  fail  after  that  so  this  is  when 
 you  see  someone  who's  gotten  100K
[18:05] subscribers  or  500k  and  then  their 
 Channel  just  dies  or  disappears 
 afterwards  it  was  ego  ego  is  the  thing
[18:10] that  convinces  you  that  you  don't  really 
 need  to  learn  or  develop  anything  in 
 terms  of  becoming  more  successful  right
[18:15] you  probably  don't  even  realize  that  you 
 have  this  massive  ego  that  you  know  oh 
 yes  you're  so  amazing  guess  where  you
[18:20] actually  got  it  from  it's  so  interesting 
 guess  where  you  got  massive  ego  from 
 this  idea  of  like  yeah  you're  so  amazing
[18:25] you  don't  need  to  change  yourself  from 
 the  politically  correct  like  Western 
 Society  you  know  this  sort  of  like 
 society  that  tells  little  boy  boys  and
[18:31] little  girls  yeah  you're  so  amazing 
 here's  a  participation  trophy  you're  so 
 amazing  you're  you're  a  superstar  you 
 don't  need  to  change  anything  about
[18:36] yourself  and  so  these  kids  are  growing 
 up  with  this  weird  self-image  which  is 
 so  heightened  and  eventually  when
[18:41] reality  hits  them  and  they  realize  like 
 yeah  they're  not  that  great  this  is  when 
 depression  occurs  it's  actually  more
[18:46] valuable  for  you  to  think  to  yourself 
 like  yep  I'm  not  that  great  right  now 
 but  I  strive  to  become  it  I'm  not  that
[18:51] advanced  and  my  skills  aren't  that  high 
 right  now  but  I'll  keep  learning  and 
 I'll  keep  improving  so  when  you  develop
[18:56] the  skill  of  humility  that's  when  you 
 start  to  see  these  holes  inside  of  you 
 and  you  start  to  like  just  not  in  a
[19:01] self-deprecating  way  but  almost  in  a 
 level  of  awareness  and  Analysis  you  look 
 at  some  of  your  weaknesses  and  you  think
[19:06] yourself  yeah  I  could  improve  that  part 
 of  me  my  social  skills  aren't  that  great 
 because  if  they  were  I'd  have  more
[19:11] friends  so  I  need  to  improve  my  social 
 skills  I'll  read  some  books  on  that  you 
 know  what  like  I'd  really  like  a
[19:16] girlfriend  but  girls  don't  seem 
 attracted  to  me  for  some  reason  I'll 
 start  researching  what  girls  are 
 actually  attracted  in  and  maybe  I'll
[19:21] start  like  going  to  the  gym  more  and 
 I'll  get  more  like  fit  and  I'll  look 
 better  maybe  I'll  learn  like  how  to 
 actually  date  and  speak  to  girls  better
[19:27] because  I'm  probably  not  that  good  at  it 
 just  yet  with  that  skill  of  humility 
 you'll  actually  go  on  to  make  more
[19:32] progress  life  lesson  number  13  don't 
 Focus  too  much  on  the  past  so  maybe 
 you're  watching  this  and  quite  often  you
[19:38] recap  some  mistakes  that  you  made  in  the 
 past  so  before  I  just  said  you  know 
 successful  men  make  a  lot  of  mistakes
[19:43] and  that's  fine  well  the  thing  is  the 
 successful  man  who's  made  these  mistakes 
 and  failures  he  doesn't  look  back  with
[19:48] this  sense  of  like  depression  and 
 sadness  all  the  time  but  I've  seen  a  lot 
 of  teenagers  do  this  especially  with
[19:53] grades  you  look  back  at  the  past  that 
 you  didn't  really  study  that  well  and 
 then  you  get  some  bad  grades  and  you 
 keep  looking  back  and  you  keep  feeling
[19:58] like  [ __ ]  because  of  it  it  was  nothing 
 to  serve  you  this  is  one  of  the  reasons 
 why  I  really  like  one  of  Andrew  Tate's
[20:03] mindsets  where  he  says  that  there's  no 
 reason  having  beliefs  that  don't  serve 
 you  you  should  only  keep  in  mind  the
[20:08] things  that  actually  help  you  and  if 
 looking  back  to  some  mistake  or  some 
 failure  keeps  making  you  feel  bad  and
[20:14] not  in  any  kind  of  like  encouraging  way 
 there's  no  value  in  doing  that  it's  just 
 like  self-deprecating  it's  literally
[20:19] just  self-harm  at  that  point  try  your 
 best  not  to  look  back  into  the  past  and 
 the  way  you  do  that  is  by  working  as
[20:25] hard  as  you  possibly  can  on  the  presence 
 instead  of  even  spending  five  minutes 
 feeling  depressed  about  something  that
[20:30] happened  been  a  while  ago  like  some  girl 
 broke  up  with  you  or  you  got  rejected  or 
 you  got  bad  grades  go  and  spend  those
[20:35] five  minutes  reading  a  book  and  studying 
 and  working  out  at  least  that's  going  to 
 create  something  different  for  you  and
[20:40] so  leading  on  to  this  number  14  stop 
 worrying  about  the  future  again  a  bunch 
 of  young  students  have  this  where  you
[20:46] know  you're  so  scared  of  this  upcoming 
 exam  and  it's  so  like  there's  so  much 
 pressure  and  the  thing  is  I  don't  even 
 blame  you  I'm  a  very  big  advocate  for
[20:52] talking  about  the  issues  of  the 
 education  system  I  think  it's  a  corrupt 
 silly  stupid  inhumane  system  that  you  go
[20:58] through  and  you  have  to  go  to  school  as 
 a  child  honestly  in  one  of  my  like 
 long-term  goals  has  been  to  like  reform
[21:03] the  education  system  because  I  just  I 
 think  it's  [ __ ]  the  school  system 
 honestly  the  fact  that  you  go  through  so
[21:08] much  pressure  and  so  much  stress  at  such 
 a  young  age  to  prepare  for  these  like 
 [ __ ]  one  day  you  know  like  just  one
[21:13] specific  exam  that  you've  got  to 
 remember  all  this  [ __ ]  for  then  you've 
 just  got  to  forget  everything  you  just 
 learned  to  remember  something  for  the
[21:19] next  exam  it's  so  like  the  systems  are 
 stupid  but  either  way  worrying  about  the 
 future  is  not  going  to  help  you  now  the
[21:24] system  is  stupid  and  you  know  leave  it 
 to  me  I'll  try  and  change  it  for  you  but 
 right  here  right  now  you  worrying  about
[21:29] the  future  is  not  gonna  say  of  you  in 
 any  positive  way  you  should  prepare  for 
 the  future  you  know  you've  got  some
[21:34] upcoming  exams  so  study  today  you  want 
 to  get  a  girlfriend  later  on  in  the 
 future  when  you've  got  more  free  time
[21:39] we'll  start  to  go  to  the  gym  right  now 
 and  you  know  get  more  in  shape  and  you 
 know  build  some  muscle  cut  down  some
[21:44] body  fat  look  good  smell  good  prepare 
 for  the  future  but  worrying  for  it  well 
 there's  no  value  in  that  is  there
[21:49] there's  no  benefit  to  yourself  and  I  get 
 it  because  I'm  quite  a  warrior  myself  I 
 have  a  tendency  to  feel  quite  anxious  at
[21:55] things  that  could  happen  and  I  worry 
 about  you  know  situations  not  happening 
 in  my  favor  so  I  get  it  like  it  just
[22:00] happens  automatically  doesn't  it  you 
 don't  actually  sit  there  thinking  oh 
 yeah  I'm  gonna  go  panic  about  the  future 
 right  now  it  just  you  know  pops  into
[22:05] your  mind  the  way  to  control  your  mind 
 you  know  I've  told  you  a  lot  about  stop 
 worrying  about  the  future  or  the  past  or
[22:11] you  know  like  a  lot  of  like  mindset 
 things  the  way  to  change  your  mind  and 
 how  it  thinks  is  to  just  forcefully
[22:16] manually  think  the  thoughts  that  you 
 want  so  maybe  your  mind  is  automatically 
 you  know  regurgitating  the  thoughts
[22:22] about  the  upcoming  exam  and  you're 
 feeling  anxious  again  just  manually  say 
 the  words  in  your  brain  like  I'm  gonna
[22:27] prepare  for  it  I'm  not  gonna  waste  any 
 time  just  worrying  right  now  I'm  gonna 
 go  and  study  right  now  for  an  extra  10 
 minutes  today  that's  going  to  make  a
[22:32] difference  life  lesson  15  be  present 
 presence  is  when  you're  totally  focused
[22:37] in  the  Here  and  Now  rather  than  in  your 
 mind  somewhere  else  so  oftentimes  you 
 can  just  find  yourself  deep  in  thought
[22:42] about  something  instead  of  actually  just 
 experiencing  real  life  as  we  are  today 
 maybe  you've  been  watching  this  video
[22:47] and  you've  barely  even  been  hearing  my 
 words  because  in  your  own  brain  is  like
[22:52] irrelevant  thoughts  sometimes  it  can  be 
 so  hard  to  catch  yourself  when  you're  so 
 deep  in  thought  and  only  when  you  do
[22:57] catch  yourself  you'll  realize  like  [ __ ] 
 like  I  haven't  been  present  for  the  last 
 like  10  minutes  I've  just  been  AFK  you
[23:02] know  the  phrase  AFK  away  from  keyboard 
 most  people  are  AFK  and  there's  no  way 
 to  live  like  you'll  probably  see  this  in 
 some  of  your  friends  who  are  really
[23:07] addicted  to  video  games  and  social  media 
 and  you'll  see  this  in  a  lot  of  girls  as 
 well  who  are  addicted  to  tick  tock
[23:12] they're  literally  just  AFK  as  you  speak 
 to  them  like  their  attention  spans  all 
 [ __ ]  like  that  you  see  their  eyes  like 
 fully  in  away  from  them  and  everything
[23:17] the  cure  to  this  and  honestly  the  cure 
 to  a  lot  of  problems  is  meditation  I
[23:22] have  a  10  minute  follow  along  meditation 
 it's  easy  as  hell  to  do  literally  10 
 minutes  and  I'll  have  like  a  card  pop-up 
 and  you  can  follow  with  that  number  16
[23:28] learn  from  the  mistakes  of  others  men 
 learn  from  their  mistakes  but  a  wise  man
[23:33] learns  from  the  mistakes  of  others  so  if 
 you  want  to  be  this  wise  man  seek  out 
 the  advice  and  the  mentorship  of  men  who
[23:39] have  probably  experienced  the  path  that 
 you  want  to  go  down  and  there's  no 
 better  time  in  history  to  have  this 
 desire  you  can  literally  go  onto  YouTube
[23:45] and  find  someone  who's  already  achieved 
 the  life  that  you  want  and  chances  are 
 he's  already  got  a  podcast  where  he's
[23:50] speaking  for  like  50  hours  just  talking 
 about  his  life  and  the  problems  that  he 
 went  through  and  the  mindset  that  caused
[23:55] him  to  be  successful  it's  such  an 
 amazing  time  this  is  why  like  podcasts 
 and  books  and  YouTube  videos  are  so
[24:00] valuable  because  you  can  literally  just 
 find  the  kind  of  mind  that  you  want  to 
 be  like  and  just  learn  directly  from  him 
 and  so  the  mistakes  that  he  talks  about
[24:05] you  can  just  try  and  avoid  and  save 
 yourself  some  time  on  the  journey  so  if 
 you  see  on  my  YouTube  channel  we  have
[24:10] like  700  videos  and  at  the  start  of 
 every  single  video  after  the  Jeffrey  and 
 Adonis  intro  I  tell  you  my  mistake
[24:16] that's  relevant  to  the  video  title  so 
 maybe  it's  a  video  about  obsession  over 
 a  girl  too  much  well  in  that  video  I'll
[24:21] tell  you  about  the  exact  story  where  I 
 obsessed  over  a  girl  too  much  and  why  it 
 was  a  mistake  because  probably  chances 
 are  she  didn't  like  me  back  and  I  just
[24:26] wasted  time  and  then  I  try  and  convince 
 you  to  not  make  the  same  mistake  as  me 
 that  means  that  I  wasted  months  of  my
[24:32] time  you  know  being  obsessed  with  some 
 girl  who  didn't  like  me  and  by  you  just 
 watching  a  10  minute  video  you  could 
 probably  save  those  months  of  pain
[24:37] yourself  I  think  that  concept  of 
 learning  from  another  man  that's  like 
 such  an  incredible  thing  that  we  can  do
[24:42] with  the  internet  because  before  this 
 the  only  kind  of  life  lessons  you  could 
 get  was  from  the  village  Elders  in  our
[24:47] tribe  and  now  you  can  get  the  life 
 lessons  as  we're  covering  in  this  video 
 from  a  guy  who  might  be  across  the  globe
[24:52] from  you  number  17  stand  up  straight 
 with  your  shoulders  back  this  is  a 
 chapter  from  Jordan  Peterson's  Book  12
[24:58] rules  for  life  and  I  really  like  it  and 
 it  goes  way  deeper  than  just  body 
 language  and  posture  and  the  short
[25:03] version  is  that  the  better  your  body 
 language  the  happier  you're  gonna  be  the 
 more  dopamine  you're  gonna  produce  the 
 more  serotonin  you're  going  to  produce
[25:09] and  even  the  more  testosterone  you're 
 going  to  produce  a  lot  of  guys  with  like 
 [ __ ]  up  for  sure  literally  showing
[25:14] that  they  are  like  a  weak  man  and  when 
 you  show  that  to  the  world  the  world 
 responds  to  you  as  if  you  know  you're 
 some  weak  fragile  man  who's  got  like
[25:20] [ __ ]  up posture  and  when  the  world 
 responds  to  you  like  you're  a  weak  man 
 well  then  the  inside  of  you  literally 
 changes  to  that  like  if  everyone  treats
[25:26] you  like  a  beta  male  little  [ __ ]  the 
 testosterone  is  going  to  go  down  so  when 
 you  walk  into  a  new  place  or  just  24  7.
[25:31] keep  your  posture  as  good  as  you  can 
 naturally  make  it  number  18  talk  loudly 
 and  confidently  now  you  don't  need  to
[25:37] overdo  this  and  start  shouting  at  people 
 you're  not  trying  to  like  fake  a  deep 
 voice  like  this  or  anything  don't  be 
 stupid  with  it  but  there's  a  lot  of
[25:42] young  guys  who  talk  very  timidly  like 
 they'll  be  speaking  like  this  they'll  be 
 hiding  their  breath  away  oh  yeah  yeah 
 yeah  you  know  there's  a  lot  of  like  us
[25:48] like  those  phrases  which  just  reeks  of 
 like  a  lack  of  confidence  as  a  young  man
[25:53] this  is  the  time  now  to  start  developing 
 your  speech  and  your  personality  to  be 
 this  guy  who  speaks  like  I  am  today  like
[25:58] I'm  not  you  know  overly  doing  it  I'm  not 
 purposely  trying  to  you  know  act 
 confident  or  anything  now  sure  I'm
[26:03] speaking  a  little  bit  more  louder  than  I 
 normally  would  just  you  know  because 
 we're  recording  a  video  and  everything 
 but  if  you  can  speak  like  this  you'll  be
[26:08] able  to  convey  your  message  across  and 
 people  will  actually  be  able  to  listen 
 to  you  and  they'll  have  fun  listening  to
[26:13] you  no  one  likes  listening  to  a  guy  who 
 speaks  like  a  little  [ __ ]  and  I  don't 
 say  this  to  be  offensive  but  you  know  a 
 lot  of  guys  speak  so  timidly  like  they
[26:19] have  no  balls  and  they  just  speak  like 
 you  know  with  fleeting  eye  contact 
 speaking  to  the  ground  instead  of  to  you
[26:24] look  them  in  the  eye  and  speak  loud 
 enough  that  they  could  still  hear  you  if 
 they  were  stored  one  feet  further  the
[26:30] back  number  19  have  patience  for  a  lot 
 of  the  things  that  you  want  to  do 
 whether  it's  build  a  great  body  or  you
[26:36] know  try  and  start  some  businesses  make 
 some  money  or  get  some  good  grades  it 
 takes  quite  a  lot  of  time  to  do  this
[26:41] stuff  this  is  something  that  a  lot  of 
 guys  struggle  with  a  lot  of  guys  don't 
 have  the  ability  to  be  patient  and  so
[26:46] they  end  up  trying  something  not  seeing 
 the  results  fast  enough  and  then  just 
 giving  it  up  and  then  they  try  something 
 else  and  then  they  try  something  else
[26:51] they've  got  the  shiny  object  syndrome 
 that  stems  from  impatience  if  you  can  be 
 the  guy  who  sticks  to  something  that  you
[26:57] know  that  you'll  want  to  do  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life  and  you're  patient  with  it 
 you'll  get  the  results  for  me  that  was 
 weightlifting  and  building  a  muscular
[27:03] aesthetic  strong  body  I  started  at  age 
 17  and  literally  saw  myself  still  age  60
[27:08] age  70  being  muscular  and  strong  and 
 still  going  to  the  gym  I  had  this  level 
 of  patience  so  I  knew  that  okay  I  don't
[27:13] have  to  like  get  the  fastest  results 
 possible  nine  years  later  and  I'm  still 
 training  consistently  I  had  the  patience
[27:19] for  the  results  and  sure  like  you  know 
 my  progress  has  been  quite  slow  in  terms 
 of  the  gym  progress  but  I've  never  quit
[27:24] and  I  Foster  past  a  lot  of  people  who 
 had  better  genetics  than  me  or  higher 
 testosterone  or  started  in  like  a  better 
 place  or  trained  better  than  me  just
[27:30] because  I  was  patient  with  it  if  you're 
 patient  and  you  just  stick  to  something 
 for  the  long  term  you'll  often  get
[27:35] better  results  than  the  guy  who's  even 
 genetically  superior  but  he  just  hasn't 
 trained  for  that  long  life  lesson  number
[27:40] 20  start  learning  about  making  money  and 
 finances  right  now  when  I  was  a  teenager
[27:45] none  of  this  even  occurred  to  me 
 honestly  like  I  just  went  through  the 
 normal  school  system  just  thinking  yeah 
 well  you  know  right  now  we're  in  high
[27:50] school  then  we'll  go  to  college  or 
 university  and  you  know  I'll  get  a 
 degree  and  like  I  never  even  realized 
 that  even  when  I  was  a  teenager  and  I
[27:56] was  in  school  I  could  start  learning 
 about  these  things  right  now  in  the 
 single  greatest  way  to  do  this  is  to
[28:01] read  books  there's  absolutely  no  better 
 way  to  start  learning  about  how  to  make 
 money  than  to  literally  just  read  some 
 of  the  most  core  books  I  have  a  list  of
[28:07] all  of  the  self-help  books  that  I 
 recommend  which  is  in  the  description  of 
 this  video  number  21  develop  valuable
[28:12] skills  now  you  probably  heard  this 
 phrase  before  you've  probably  heard  a 
 bunch  of  YouTubers  tell  you  oh  yeah  I 
 develop  skills  but  they  never  go  into
[28:18] more  detail  than  that  and  so  you  just 
 hear  this  cool  sounding  phrase  okay  yeah 
 I  should  develop  skills  and  you  don't 
 even  know  what  the  [ __ ]  it  even  means  or
[28:24] what  to  do  so  skills  are  things  that  we 
 all  have  and  we  all  do  but  of  course 
 when  you  develop  a  skill  then  it  gets
[28:29] better  right  so  it's  almost  most  of  the 
 same  concept  as  skills  in  a  video  game 
 like  we  all  start  with  the  same  kind  of
[28:34] skills  that  we  all  have  you  know  the 
 attack  skill  the  strength  skill  the 
 magic  skill  the  the  hit  point  skill  we
[28:39] all  have  the  same  skills  but  then  of 
 course  what  you  focus  on  and  level  up 
 gets  better  and  you  get  more  rewards
[28:44] from  it  and  real  life  is  exactly  the 
 same  so  the  skills  that  we  have  for 
 example  are  communication  influence
[28:49] sales  dating  confidence  mental  strength 
 physical  strength  all  of  these  things 
 are  literally  the  skills  that  we  can
[28:54] develop  and  so  there's  some  valuable 
 skills  that  you  can  start  to  develop 
 right  now  and  I'd  say  the  one  that  I 
 would  just  recommend  to  you  is  social
[29:00] skills  so  social  skills  is  the  skill 
 that  you  use  when  you're  speaking  to 
 other  people  and  a  lot  of  young  guys  or
[29:05] just  a  lot  of  guys  or  a  lot  of  people  in 
 general  have  such  poor  social  skills 
 they've  got  weird  social  mannerism
[29:11] they're  just  like  not  confident  fleeting 
 eye  contact  weird  body  language  like 
 they're  just  AFK  or  something  they  just
[29:16] talk  weird  they  ask  weird  questions  like 
 they  don't  even  know  how  to  like  be  in  a 
 normal  conversation  and  then  they  just

 guys  watching  this  live  stream  his  name 
 is  the  board  teen  and  he  said  another
[30:37] life  lesson  is  figuring  out  how  to  look 
 better  now  your  looks  your  physical 
 looks  like  your  appearance  is  so  much
[30:43] more  important  than  you've  been  made  to 
 believe  because  there's  this  advice  that 
 feels  really  good  which  is  you  know 
 you're  so  you're  so  valuable  you're  such
[30:49] a  beautiful  young  man  like  you  know  your 
 mom's  saying  this  you're  like  oh  yeah 
 it's  a  you're  such  a  beautiful  young  man 
 you're  so  handsome  like  bro  chances  are
[30:54] you  you're  not  honestly  chances  are 
 you're  actually  not  that  attractive  if 
 you  are  attractive  right  now  you  would 
 know  you  would  literally  have  all  of  the
[31:00] girls  messaging  you  you  would  have  an 
 abundance  of  girls  who  were  interested 
 in  you  who  wanted  to  date  you  who  maybe 
 wanted  to  get  like  even  more  sexual  with
[31:06] you  if  you  were  attractive  chances  are 
 you're  just  not  that  physically 
 attractive  just  yet  too  many  guys 
 overlooked  this  with  this  attitude  of
[31:11] like  oh  but  I  don't  care  what  anyone 
 thinks  of  me  and  I've  always  found  that 
 so  weird  so  many  teenagers  are  adopting
[31:16] this  mindset  of  like  oh  I  don't  care 
 what  anyone  thinks  that's  so  so 
 unnatural  think  about  it  we're  tribal
[31:21] creatures  of  course  we  care  what  other 
 people  in  our  tribe  think  about  us  the 
 people  in  your  school  or  who  you've  got
[31:26] on  social  media  or  your  family  or  your 
 friends  their  opinions  of  you  should 
 actually  matter  like  I  know  like  I  know
[31:31] I'm  the  first  person  who's  ever  said 
 this  to  you  but  the  people  around  you 
 their  opinion  should  matter  to  you  you
[31:36] should  care  what  people  think  about  you 
 I'm  literally  the  only  person  on  the 
 internet  who  actually  says  this  everyone 
 else  is  giving  you  this  cringe  Sigma
[31:42] male  personality  like  oh  yeah  I  don't 
 care  what  anyone  thinks  I'll  just  die  of 
 loneliness  by  myself  I  don't  care  if  I
[31:47] don't  get  invited  to  parties  I  don't 
 care  if  I  don't  have  any  like  shut  up 
 what  a  sad  way  to  live  bro  like 
 literally  the  better  way  to  live  is  to
[31:53] care  what  the  most  valuable  the  most 
 like  upstanding  people  of  your  tribe 
 think  about  it's  normal  and  it's  good  to
[31:59] want  to  be  acknowledged  by  your  tribe  of 
 being  like  a  good  young  man  and 
 improving  your  looks  is  one  of  the  best
[32:04] ways  that  you  can  do  that  the  single 
 greatest  way  to  improve  your  looks  is  to 
 build  your  aesthetic  body  to  get  that 
 lean  [ __ ]  boy  Tick-Tock  boy  kind  of
[32:10] physique  again  those  three  workout 
 routines  are  linked  in  the  description 
 if  you  follow  those  routines  and  you 
 keep  going  to  the  gym  and  you  start
[32:16] eating  a  little  bit  cleaner  and  you 
 start  packing  onto  like  lean  muscle  mass 
 you're  gonna  significantly  improve  how
[32:21] hot  you  look  one  final  Life  Lesson  by 
 Clay  is  learn  to  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it
[32:27] there's  a  reason  why  I  end  every  single 
 one  of  my  videos  with  that  phrase  and 
 you  can  go  and  check  bro  you  can 
 literally  go  click  on  any  video  and  I've
[32:32] ended  the  video  by  saying  do  the  hard 
 work  especially  when  you  don't  feel  like 
 it  that  phrase  do  the  hard  work
[32:38] especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it 
 encapsulates  the  meaning  of  discipline 
 discipline  is  the  single  most  important
[32:44] thing  that  men  need  masculine  men  if  you 
 want  to  become  a  masculine  strong 
 successful  man  you  need  discipline  you
[32:51] need  to  go  and  do  the  work  that  is 
 required  of  you  even  when  you  don't  feel 
 like  doing  it  too  many  young  guys  are  so
[32:57] invested  in  their  emotions  and  their 
 feelings  and  I  don't  blame  you  because 
 you're  being  told  by  all  these  like 
 these  manipulative  people  that  young  men
[33:03] should  be  emotional  that  you  should  be 
 in  touch  with  oh  shut  up  you're  being 
 told  this  stuff  by  people  who  want  you
[33:08] to  be  weak  the  thing  is  the  girls  who 
 tell  you  like  oh  yeah  but  men  should  be 
 emotional  men  should  cry  bro  they're  not
[33:13] [ __ ]  guys  who  cry  simple  as  that 
 they're  not  [ __ ]  the  guys  who  are 
 like  being  little  [ __ ]  next  to  them 
 simple  as  that  bro  the  people  who  told
[33:18] you  like  oh  men  should  be  emotional 
 they're  not  going  to  respect  you  when 
 you  take  the  day  off  work  because  you 
 didn't  feel  like  it  they're  gonna 
 respect  the  strong  man  who's  built  a
[33:24] successful  business  and  become  rich 
 because  he  was  disciplined  they're  gonna 
 respect  the  athletes  who  goes  and  trains 
 in  the  rain  in  the  cold  when  doesn't
[33:30] feel  like  it  everyone  respects 
 discipline  but  in  the  modern  day  they're 
 trying  to  take  discipline  out  of  young 
 men  because  they  want  you  to  be  weak  and
[33:35] controllable  and  we  can  get  into  the 
 conspiracy  theories  there  but  that  was 
 why  23  life  lessons  for  teenagers  share

"
8_LXq-vn0_4,"[00:00] Jeffrey's  brought  her  back  to  his  place 
 but  he  doesn't  know  what  to  do  next 
 instead  of  escalating  and  becoming
[00:05] physical  Jeffrey  just  awkwardly  sits 
 down  next  to  her  so  uh  so  what  kind  of 
 music  do  you  like  how  should  I  go  in  for
[00:11] the  kiss  she  looks  bored  why  does  she 
 keep  checking  her  phone  can  you  relate 
 to  this  situation
[00:17] Adonis  like  a  true  gentleman  Adonis 
 opens  the  door  gets  her  a  drink  and  make
[00:22] sure  she's  comfortable  not  so 
 comfortable  inside  of  Anastasia's  mind 
 and  brain  there's  still  a  little  bit  of
[00:27] nervousness  which  is  always  a  good  sign 
 she's  flooded  with  emotions  which  is
[00:32] exactly  the  way  to  attract  girls 
 when  I  started  growing  up  going  through
[00:37] puberty  and  getting  horny  as  [ __ ]  I 
 started  looking  online  for  advice  on  how 
 to  attract  girls  how  to  flirt  with  girls
[00:43] how  to  text  girls  and  all  of  the  advice 
 that  was  available  was  trash  literally 
 all  of  it  was  trash  you  probably  heard
[00:48] the  exact  same  advice  and  that's  why  you 
 struggled  with  girls  they  told  us  that 
 the  keys  are  flirting  with  girls  was  to
[00:53] take  an  interest  in  them  to  ask  nice 
 questions  about  their  Hobbies  do  you 
 think  that's  what  those  top  tier  guys
[00:58] are  doing  you  see  we  stumbled  down  the 
 wrong  path  when  I  saw  this  advice  I 
 started  texting  girl  so  there's  one
[01:03] particular  girl  I'm  sexing  her  like  so 
 uh  well  what  are  you  doing  today  and  she 
 would  literally  reply  with  one  word  TV
[01:09] you  oh  that's  a  really  good  sign  isn't 
 it  all  these  [ __ ]  telling  me 
 that  that's  a  good  sign  because  you  know 
 if  she's  asked  you a  question  too  so  I
[01:15] was  like  yes  she's  asked  me  a  question 
 okay  I  took  a  lot  of  interest  in  her  do 
 you  think  I  got  her  obviously  not  you
[01:20] see  there's  a  lot  of  undesirable  guys 
 low  tier  guys  who  take  in  interesting 
 girls  who  ask  them  nice  questions  and
[01:26] they  don't  get  the  girl  do  they  that's  a 
 normal  experience  you've  seen  everywhere 
 you've  probably  been  through  this 
 yourself  you've  taken  an  interest  in  a
[01:32] girl  you've  asked  her  about  her  hobbies 
 and  you  still  didn't  get  her  so  clearly 
 that  advice  did  not  work  for  us  it's  not 
 going  to  work  for  us  because  it's  silly
[01:37] advice  and  it's  not  even  attractive 
 there  is  one  key  that  I've  found  that  no 
 one  has  really  explained  in  a  nice  way
[01:42] and  honestly  like  I'm  a  little  bit 
 hesitant  telling  you  because  this  is 
 literally  a  superpower  once  I've 
 explained  this  it's  like  you'll  be  as
[01:47] good  as  getting  girls  as  I  am  and  I'm 
 not  sure  if  we  should  share  the 
 superpowers  let's  keep  it  between 
 yourself  don't  share  this  video  but  make
[01:53] sure  you  watch  all  of  it  so  I  still  get 
 the  YouTube  retention 
 listen  closely  and  make  sure  you  stay 
 around  to  let  me  fully  explain  this  the
[01:59] key  to  flirting  with  girls  it's  not  to 
 ask  them  questions  not  to  ask  them  about 
 their  Hobbies  or  anything  like  this  it
[02:05] is  to  spike  all  of  their  emotions 
 imagine  as  a  man  we  have  like  seven
[02:11] emotions  there's  a  limited  spectrum  of 
 emotions  I  can't  it's  taken  me  a  while 
 to  even  listen  right  but  there's 
 probably  like  seven  and  footmen  right
[02:16] for  women  guess  how  many  there  are  guess 
 how  many  emotions  that  women  can  be  in 
 not  seven  not  ten  not  7c  not  25  but  bro
[02:23] hundreds  you  ever  see  like  those  color 
 palettes  where  there's  like  the  basic 
 colors  it's  probably  like  seven  ten
[02:28] basic  colors  but  then  there's  like  the 
 other  different  shades  it's  like 
 hundreds  of  shades  of  colors  and  that  is
[02:33] like  women's  emotions  and  guess  what  the 
 more  of  those  that  you  spike  the  more 
 that  she  will  be  attracted  to  you  it's
[02:38] as  simple  as  this  most  guys  don't 
 realize  this  like  this  is  so  [ __ ] 
 good  advice  just  trust  me  again  most 
 guys  make  this  mistake  that  you've  done
[02:44] so  many  times  you  think  that  the  way  to 
 attract  a  girl  is  that  just  Spike  one  or 
 two  emotions  of  her  which  is  like  love
[02:50] and  interest  and  it  doesn't  work  does  it 
 it  never  works  and  what's  so  interesting 
 you've  always  heard  of  the  stories  where
[02:55] the  girl  is  getting  around  by  the  guy 
 who's  an  [ __ ]  who  sometimes  stands 
 her  up  who  sometimes  like  whoa  this  like
[03:00] scares  her  and  [ __ ]  you've  always  heard 
 those  stories  why  because  that  guy  is 
 hitting  as  many  emotions  as  possible  you
[03:06] really  want  to  attract  this  girl  that 
 you're  currently  speaking  to  Bro 
 disappear  disappear  for  24  hours  and 
 that'll  be  a  different  emotion  that
[03:11] you've  not  spiked  yet  give  it  like  a 
 slight  roast  don't  don't  be  mean  but 
 roasts  are  about  something  that's  a
[03:16] different  emotion  you've  never  spiked 
 yet  all  of  the  soft  guys  who  don't  even 
 get  girls  will  disagree  with  us  but  they 
 don't  get  girls  who  can't  trust  them
[03:21] anyway  the  guys  who  get  girls  do  you 
 really  think  that  all  they're  doing  is 
 just  being  nice  to  the  girl  just  being
[03:26] nice  to  the  girl  doing  everything  that 
 she  wants  obviously  not  what  these  top 
 tier  guys  are  doing  who  find  it  easy  to 
 get  girls  they're  literally  just  living
[03:31] their  normal  life  you  know  they've  got 
 goals  and  missions  that  they're  working 
 on  and  by  nature  of  actually  being  busy
[03:36] as  a  man  as  a  disciplined  man  sometimes 
 they're  ignoring  her  they  don't  really 
 mean  to  but  sometimes  you  just  don't
[03:41] reply  to  your  phone  like  for  a  couple  of 
 hours  if  you're  busy  if  you're  like  a 
 little  spurg  and  you're  on  your  phone 
 every  hour  of  the  day  then  obviously
[03:46] you're  not  going  to  be  spiking  maneuver 
 emotions  and  that's  why  you're 
 struggling  I  will  say  this  again  so  that 
 you  truly  understand  the  most  common
[03:52] mistake  that  most  guys  make  is  that  they 
 only  think  about  spiking  the  pause 
 positive  happy  loving  emotion  in  a  woman
[03:58] whereas  the  guys  who  actually  get  the 
 girl  spike  a  variety  of  them  Yo  with 
 your  girl  when  was  the  last  time  that
[04:03] you  ever  like  like  you  ever  did  some 
 weird  [ __ ]  like  this  one  the  last  time 
 that  you  wrestled  her  and  actually
[04:08] physically  hurt  her  like  a  little  bit 
 and  I'm  not  talking  about  abuse  or 
 something  but  you  know  you  play  fire 
 then  she  ends  up  crying  because  you  just
[04:13] hit  her  too  hard  or  something  or  she's 
 oh  when  was  the  last  time  they  scared 
 when  was  the  last  time  that  you  made  her
[04:18] laugh  so  much  that  she's  literally  like 
 she  can't  like  you  know  she's  laughing 
 like  a  little  girl  when  was  the  last 
 time  that  you  did  something  so  silly  so
[04:23] weird  like  you  put  a  pistachio  in  her 
 belly  button  when  you  don't  do  these 
 things  you  are  this  one-dimensional  beta
[04:29] male  that  cannot  be  attractive  because 
 for  women  there's  no  such  thing  as  you 
 know  a  happy  loving  connection  women  are
[04:35] in  love  and  so  devoted  with  the  guy  that 
 is  in  her  mind  and  her  heart  that's  true
[04:40] you  know  that  right  not  so  much  that  the 
 guy  who's  the  most  positive  person  in 
 the  world  and  he's  just  compliments  her
[04:45] all  the  time  but  the  guy  who's  always  in 
 her  mind  so  think  about  this  right  now 
 what  could  you  do  to  be  in  her  mind  and
[04:50] heart  more  do  you  think  being  a 
 one-dimensional  Jeffrey's  gonna  help  you 
 with  this  just  message  her  the  same
[04:55] thing's  always  on  always  oh  you  know  oh 
 you're  really  interesting  what  are  you 
 doing  today  oh  I'm  taking  an  interest  on 
 your  hobbies  you're  really  cool  pretty
[05:00] like  just  positive  positive  positive 
 positive  compliments  boom  you  think 
 that's  exciting  you  think  she's  in  her
[05:05] mind  right  now  thinking  oh  my  God  yes 
 yes  he  just  gave  me  another  compliment 
 no  if  that's  all  you  are  which  most  guys
[05:11] are  most  guys  are  just  this  awkward  shy 
 timid  guy  who's  gonna  try  and  be  nice  to 
 try  and  give  her  a  compliment  I'm  not
[05:16] saying  to  be  an  [ __ ]  to  girls  but  I'm 
 giving  you  permission  to  not  always  be 
 like  that  positive  guy  who's  just  given
[05:22] a  compliment  it's  okay  sometimes  to  not 
 reply  to  a  message  fast  because  you're 
 busy  don't  be  a  little  spoke  don't  be
[05:27] sat  there  like  a  Jeffrey  on  your  phone 
 seeing  the  text  message  and  not  replying 
 because  yeah  yeah  because  the  red  pill 
 the  red  pill  YouTubers  told  me  not  to
[05:33] reply  so  I  won't  that's  cringe  anyone 
 who  desires  [ __ ]  cringe  when  you're 
 on  your  phone  you  can  reply  to  people  so 
 every  time  I'm  on  my  phone  there's  a
[05:39] list  of  people  to  reply  I'm  not  trying 
 to  sound  like  a  popular  [ __ ]  or 
 anything  maybe  I'll  choose  like  five  of 
 them  when  I'm  having  a  [ __ ]  and  I'll
[05:44] reply  every  time  right  but  that  being 
 said  I'm  not  on  my  phone  that  much  maybe 
 10  times  for  the  entire  day  maybe  20
[05:49] times  and  that's  still  quite  like  a  low 
 amount  for  most  guys  because  you  need 
 something  else  to  do  the  reason  why  you
[05:54] are  stuck  in  this  one-dimensional 
 Jeffrey  you  know  struggling  to  attract 
 this  girl  and  you're  trying  to  just 
 Spike  her  positive  emotion  because
[05:59] you've  got  nothing  else  to  do  how  can 
 you  disappear  and  leave  her  wondering 
 what  you're  doing  when  you're  always
[06:04] there  how  can  you  make  her  jealous  even 
 though  those  aren't  positive  emotions 
 and  every  Jeffrey  and  Jessica  will
[06:09] disagree  but  they're  not  trying  to  help 
 you  anyway  how  can  you  make  her  slightly 
 anxious  when  you  don't  even  get  other 
 girls  she  knows  for  a  fact  that  she's
[06:15] probably  the  only  girl  that's  interested 
 in  you  and  even  that  she's  almost  given 
 you  like  a  Pity  interest  of  like  some 
 cost  fallacy  like  oh  yeah  we've  already
[06:21] spoiled  for  a  bit  so  maybe  I'll  keep  the 
 beginning  how  can  she  feel  literal 
 sexual  desire  to  want  to  [ __ ]  you  when
[06:26] you  don't  have  a  six-pack  honestly  this 
 is  when  your  cope  will  start  if  you  have 
 a  predominant  Jeffrey  Brave  you  will
[06:32] start  coping  now  and  think  oh  yeah  this 
 video  is  [ __ ]  anyway  he's  wrong  why 
 would  you  want  to  make  a  woman  anxious
[06:37] compliments  yeah  the  six-pack  doesn't 
 matter  because  women  like  that  if  you're 
 coping  right  now  in  your  own  mind  bro
[06:42] you  know  you're  not  gonna  make  it  I'm 
 not  trying  to  be  horrible  or  anything 
 but  like  we  know  you're  not  gonna  make 
 it  but  you  may  have  the  Adonis  part  of
[06:48] your  brain  that's  lighting  up  that's 
 taking  some  accounts  of  your  failures 
 and  thinking  you  know  what  yeah  this 
 this  makes  sense  because  the  guy  who
[06:54] gets  the  girl  is  always  among 
 multi-dimensional  being  she  really 
 really  likes  him  she  lusts  after  him  she
[07:00] also  really  upset  by  this  other  thing 
 that  he  does  she  also  feels  a  bit 
 jealous  that's  the  guy  in  her  mind  and
[07:05] you  see  that  and  you  think  okay  well  you 
 know  what  that's  not  me  right  now  really 
 ask  yourself  don't  pick  yourself  up 
 falsely  why  would  you  be  in  a  girl's
[07:11] Mind  through  the  day  you  want  to  know 
 truthfully  the  best  way  to  be  in  her 
 mind  even  though  this  is  seen  as  toxic 
 but  this  is  the  real  natural  way  of
[07:17] things  because  she  knows  that  if  you  are 
 the  level  of  man  that  as  soon  as  you 
 walk  through  the  door  you  could  end  up 
 [ __ ]  a  girl  most  guys  can't  even
[07:22] believe  that  this  is  a  concept  of  like 
 no  no  one's  like  that  you  couldn't  do  no 
 no  the  guys  who  are  either  at  the  top  or
[07:28] going  there  know  that  this  is  just  a 
 normal  part  of  life  like  once  you  get  to 
 a  certain  level  of  man  you  literally 
 make  your  woman  anxious  by  just  leaving
[07:34] the  house  not  even  being  a  dog  not  even 
 cheating  like  she  finds  it  hard  to 
 believe  that  over  a  couple  of  weeks  you
[07:39] wouldn't  accidentally  [ __ ]  a  girl  as  you 
 just  go  to  the  gym  because  you  know 
 you'll  see  a  girl  on  the  way  there  or
[07:44] something  if  you're  that  level  of  guy 
 girls  find  that  difficult  I'm  a  woman 
 and  I'm  not  emotional  you're  a  woman  and
[07:49] you're  not  emotional  but  there's 
 feminine  masculine  energy  we  know  which 
 one  that  you  have  because  feminine  women 
 are  naturally  and  almost  holy  emotional
[07:55] of  course  they  are  that's  not  a  bad 
 thing  the  whole  point  of  a  feminine 
 woman's  emotions  is  for  us  as  a 
 masculine  man  to  tame  that  to  create
[08:01] order  inside  of  the  chaos  and  you  might 
 right  now  be  thinking  well  you  know  this 
 this  sounds  silly  anyway  because  they're 
 spiking  her  all  her  emotions  like  I
[08:06] don't  want  to  be  with  an  emotional  girl 
 I  want  to  be  with  a  girl  who's  really 
 sensible  and  works  hard  and  she's 
 disciplined  and  she's  got  goals  and
[08:12] she's  masculine  which  then  means  that 
 I'm  feminine  because  if  she's  masculine 
 you've  got  to  be  feminine  and  that  that
[08:17] can  be  okay 
 sometimes  maybe  the  truth  is  from  my 
 understanding  if  you  don't  want  a
[08:23] feminine  woman  who  has  these  normal  like 
 female  emotions  which  are  very  chaotic 
 compared  to  a  man's  you  might  be  a  lot
[08:29] more  feminine  than  you  think  because 
 I've  realized  that  the  more  masculine 
 you  become  the  more  ordered  and
[08:34] disciplined  you  become  you  just  you 
 shrug  your  shoulders  and  like  if  someone 
 asks  me  like  why  do  you  date  a  woman 
 who's  emotional  I  would  answer  like  why
[08:40] wouldn't  you  I  want  her  because  that's 
 the  whole  point  like  I'm  not  that 
 emotional  anymore  as  I've  become  more 
 masculine  what  else  I  like  that  she's
[08:46] got  a  whole  Spectrum  whole  color  palette 
 of  emotions  because  it's  fun  for  me  it's 
 like  yeah  sweet  that's  my  mission  like
[08:51] with  my  time  with  her  that's  my  mission 
 that's  like  let's  engage  some  of  these 
 emotions  today  let's  think  which  one  she 
 needs  today  okay  she  needs  a  bit  of
[08:57] excitement  maybe  she  needs  like  a  little 
 bit  of  a  scare  because  she's  been 
 getting  comfortable  so  I'll  just  stand 
 in  the  wardrobe
[09:02] does  that  does  that  make  sense  because 
 or  am  I  weird  for  that  no  that's  no  I'm 
 not  weird  you  the  other  people  are  bro  I
[09:08] fear  that  even  whilst  you've  watched 
 like  12  minutes  of  this  video  you  have 
 this  deep  rooted  conditioning  propaganda
[09:14] brainwashing  from  the  normal  society 
 around  us  has  conditioned  you  to  fear  a
[09:19] woman's  emotions  they've  conditioned 
 women  to  think  that  their  emotions  are  a 
 bad  thing  a  lot  of  women  these  days  are
[09:24] literally  giving  up  their  emotions  and 
 thinking  like  nah  like  I  don't  want  to 
 be  emotional  I  don't  cry  or  anything  but 
 that  scene  is  a  bad  thing  a  woman  being
[09:29] feminine  like  being  feminine  naturally 
 means  you  have  to  be  emotional  that's 
 two  and  two  together  women  are  literally
[09:35] abandoning  their  femininity  because  of 
 feminism  and  because  of  that  women  are 
 less  feminine  they've  had  to  get  into
[09:40] the  workplace  so  now  they've  got  to 
 develop  some  of  their  masculine  energy 
 and  so  when  women  become  more  masculine 
 men  become  more  feminine  and  I  think
[09:46] this  mess  up  of  our  sexual  energies  is 
 what's  causing  the  need  for  you  to  even
[09:51] watch  this  video  50  years  ago  you 
 wouldn't  have  needed  advice  like  this  we 
 wouldn't  have  even  been  speaking  about
[09:56] this  kind  of  topic  or  how  to  get  girls 
 because  it  would  have  been  simple  work 
 hard  get  a  good  job  be  a  masculine
[10:01] gentleman  it  was  literally  a  as  simple 
 as  that  and  the  complication  has  come 
 from  like  these  modern  movements  that
[10:07] have  destroyed  our  ability  to  even  make 
 relationships  through  this  video  there's 
 been  so  many  like  trigger  points  for
[10:12] like  the  modern  person  the  Modern  Woman 
 the  modern  man  to  think  like  nah  this 
 guy  in  the  bathrobe  is  wrong  now  I'm  a
[10:18] woman  I'm  not  emotional  not  I'm  a  man 
 and  I  don't  want  an  emotional  woman  if 
 you  really  want  to  find  out  what  kind  of 
 man  you  are  whether  you're  feminine  or
[10:24] masculine  just  analyze  your  thoughts 
 over  this  video  because  if  you  are  more 
 on  the  feminine  side  and  you've  been 
 watching  all  this  just  wanting  to  give
[10:30] up  and  thinking  like  no  this  is  all 
 pointless  I  don't  want  to  do  this  anyway 
 it's  not  going  to  be  going  to  work  and 
 like  now  a  woman  like  that  I  don't  even
[10:35] want  to  work  in  a  like  that  I  just  want 
 a  girl  who  likes  me  for  me  you're  not 
 supposed  to  be  feminine  I  don't  know  if 
 this  is  like  a  big  [ __ ]  controversial
[10:40] statement  but  as  a  man  you're  not 
 supposed  to  be  feminine  there's 
 countries  in  the  world  where  men  aren't 
 feminine  and  those  countries  are
[10:45] developing  at  a  very  fast  rate  you  are 
 not  supposed  to  be  feminine  and  now  if 
 you're  interested  in  this  topic  and  you
[10:50] really  want  to  go  face  your  real  energy 
 and  you  want  to  develop  that  core 
 masculine  energy  inside  of  you  you  want
[10:55] to  be  the  man  you  want  to  learn  how  to 
 dominate  women  click  and  watch  this  full 
 masculinity  guide  right  now  do  the  hard

[00:21] abusive  messages  to  your  girlfriend  or 
 your  sister  don't  be  like  jeffrey  when  i 
 was  a  little  younger  i  never  thought
[00:26] about  the  green  or  red  flags  to  look  out 
 for  i'm  not  gonna  lie  i  just  didn't  have
[00:31] standards  i  had  been  quite  unattractive 
 and  awkward  around  girls  that  when  i 
 finally  started  to  attract  some  women  i
[00:36] jumped  straight  in  but  this  is  a  huge 
 problem  that  a  lot  of  guys  face  you  have 
 to  have  respect  for  yourself  i'd
[00:42] literally  fall  in  love  with  girls  that  i 
 just  met  from  nightclubs  and  dirty 
 university  student  parties  let  me
[00:47] describe  these  parties  to  you  these 
 student  parties  just  so  you  know  what 
 kind  of  girl  i  was  meeting  as  well  as
[00:52] what  kind  of  guy  i  was  you  get  to  the 
 student  house  at  10  p.m  and  the  girl  who 
 invited  you  hugs  you  okay  so  far  so  good
[00:58] you  enter  the  kitchen  and  there's  around 
 12  people  here  straight  away  you  see  a 
 white  guy  smelling  his  keys  hmm  i  wonder
[01:04] why  he's  smelling  his  key  is  it  like  a 
 aftershave  thing  oh  there's  a  bunch  of 
 girls  here  and  they're  dressed  pretty
[01:09] [ __ ]  the  music  gets  louder  the  white 
 guys  are  dancing  to  house  music  the  one 
 black  guy  is  your  savior  he  doesn't  fit
[01:14] in  either  every  time  a  new  girl  comes  to 
 the  party  all  the  current  girls  scream 
 in  this  high  pitched  noise  oh  man  oh  my
[01:20] god  sarah  i  haven't  seen  you  since 
 yesterday  oh  did  you  get  the  cat  why  is
[01:25] everyone  smelling  their  keys 
 and  then  you  hear  it  that's  the  sound  of
[01:30] a  balloon  being  filled  up  with  laughing 
 gas  and  you  hear  the  metal  canister  fall 
 to  the  floor  it's  a  stampede  soon
[01:35] everyone  rushes  to  the  person  who's 
 handing  out  balloons  everyone's  his  best 
 friend  for  the  next  two  minutes  just
[01:40] like  everyone  becomes  your  friend  when 
 you  have  chewing  gum  in  school  you  make 
 eye  contact  with  one  of  the  girls  she'll 
 suck  your  dick  for  a  crumb  of  mdma  deal
[01:47] or  no  deal  that's  the  type  of  place  i 
 was  meeting  the  love  of  my  life  from 
 don't  make  the  same  mistake  as  me  bro
[01:53] understand  the  green  flags  of  high 
 quality  women  and  always  be  on  the 
 lookout  for  them  adonis  expects  only  the
[01:58] best  he  has  ultra  high  standards  for  the 
 women  who  enter  his  life  that  makes  him 
 even  more  attractive  but  it  wasn't
[02:04] always  like  that  adonis  thinks  back  to 
 his  early  adult  years  just  like  you  he 
 made  mistakes  he  didn't  have  the
[02:10] experience  or  the  wisdom  to  look  out  for 
 the  right  green  flags  but  over  time 
 adonis  became  a  fine  judge  of  character
[02:16] a  very  important  skill  indeed  knowing 
 what  green  flags  to  look  out  for  can 
 literally  save  you  years  of  your  life
[02:21] from  dating  the  wrong  girl  and  i  imagine 
 you  could  remember  a  bunch  of  these 
 green  flags  in  your  mind  you  could
[02:26] effortlessly  navigate  your  way  through 
 your  day  in  life  you'd  know  what  you 
 want  and  it's  so  important  for  young  men
[02:31] to  have  standards  you  all  seem  so 
 different  whilst  all  the  other  guys 
 ragdolled  themselves  at  girls  please
[02:36] please  please  just  a  crumb  of  [ __ ] 
 you'll  be  evaluating  her  just  like  she 
 is  with  you  you'll  be  taking  your  time
[02:42] you  won't  know  straight  away  whether  you 
 like  her  or  not  and  that  makes  you  so 
 much  more  attractive  to  girls  and  you
[02:47] might  be  thinking  right  now  that  this 
 isn't  that  important  because  you're  not 
 really  ready  to  start  dating  yet  fair 
 enough  focus  on  yourself  but  you  may  as
[02:53] well  keep  these  green  flags  in  mind  just 
 in  cases  you  come  across  any  women  green 
 flag  number  one  she  has  a  great
[02:58] relationship  with  her  father  her 
 relationship  with  her  father  is  almost 
 always  similar  to  her  relationship  with
[03:04] men  in  general  the  way  that  her  father 
 loved  her  as  a  child  is  the  same  type  of 
 love  that  she  craves  as  an  adult  so
[03:11] think  about  it  if  her  father  loved  her 
 in  a  healthy  happy  way  that's  what 
 she'll  want  from  you  but  if  her  father
[03:16] abused  her  or  if  her  father  left  the 
 home  generally  that's  similar  to  the 
 type  of  relationship  that  she  might  get
[03:21] into  as  an  adult  green  flag  number  two 
 her  parents  are  married  and  they're 
 still  in  a  loving  relationship  to  this
[03:27] day  marriage  in  the  modern  day  isn't  so 
 great  almost  like  half  of  marriages  end 
 in  divorce  but  if  her  parents  got
[03:33] together  like  20  years  ago  it's  a  really 
 good  sign  if  they're  still  married  and 
 they're  still  in  a  loving  relationship
[03:39] because  couples  can  stay  together  but 
 not  in  love  and  your  girl's 
 understanding  of  love  and  intimacy  comes
[03:44] from  her  parents  you  want  your  girl  to 
 have  seen  like  a  long  lasting  healthy 
 happy  love  green  flag  number  three  you
[03:50] see  a  lot  of  attractive  feminine  traits 
 in  her  mother  generally  if  you  wouldn't 
 date  her  mother  you  shouldn't  date  her
[03:56] most  people  end  up  very  similar  to  their 
 parents  that's  because  that's  how  they 
 were  raised  and  most  people  don't  go
[04:01] through  a  drastic  self-improvement 
 change  so  she  is  likely  to  end  up  pretty
[04:06] similar  to  how  her  mother  is  today  so 
 ask  yourself  would  you  date  her  mother 
 if  you  were  that  age  is  her  mother
[04:11] attractive  does  she  look  after  herself 
 by  going  to  the  gym  is  her  mother 
 feminine  is  she  intelligent  does  she
[04:16] read  books  and  does  she  grow  and  is  she 
 nice  is  she  a  kind  person  that's  an 
 awesome  sign  or  perhaps  is  her  mother
[04:21] undesirable  that's  not  a  great  sign 
 green  flag  number  four  and  an  obvious 
 one  she  has  a  nice  personality  ask
[04:26] yourself  is  this  a  kind  person  she  might 
 be  nice  to  you  right  now  but  see  how  she 
 interacts  with  other  people  is  she  rude
[04:32] to  some  people  does  she  gossip  about  her 
 friends  and  talk  badly  about  them 
 believe  me  when  i  say  that  she  will  do
[04:38] the  same  thing  to  you  or  does  she  talk 
 nicely  about  people  does  she  treat 
 everyone  with  respect  she'll  do  the  same
[04:43] to  you  green  flag  number  five  she's  had 
 none  or  very  limited  casual  sex
[04:48] experiences  the  number  of  hookups  that  a 
 girl  has  had  is  like  a  symptom  for  how 
 much  of  the  hugo  girl  blue  pill  feminist
[04:54] narrative  has  went  inside  of  her  most 
 men  find  that  unattractive  in  a  serious
[04:59] relationship  and  her  high  body  count 
 literally  increases  her  likelihood  to 
 cheat  on  you  or  to  split  up  if  she's  had
[05:04] a  very  limited  amount  of  casual  sex 
 experiences  like  hookups  and  one  night 
 stands  it  shows  that  she's  good  at
[05:10] delaying  gratification  also  that  she's 
 unlikely  to  have  spent  a  lot  of  time  in 
 like  the  low  quality  like  sex  orientated
[05:16] places  like  tinder  and  nightclubs  all 
 those  student  parties  that  we  just 
 talked  about  generally  if  she  has  a  low
[05:22] amount  of  hookups  she's  probably  come 
 from  a  pretty  good  family  with  great 
 values  green  flag  number  six  she  has
[05:27] high  quality  friends  if  her  friends 
 genuinely  seem  like  good  girls  that's  a
[05:32] huge  benefit  sometimes  you'll  date  a 
 girl  and  it  seems  like  her  friends  are 
 almost  like  a  threat  to  your 
 relationship  because  they're  always
[05:37] trying  to  like  encourage  her  to  do  bad 
 habits  she  of  course  has  to  be  very 
 similar  to  her  friends  to  be  friends
[05:43] with  them  if  her  friends  are  educated 
 with  great  values  that's  an  awesome  sign 
 if  they  seem  like  low-quality  party
[05:48] girls  who  take  a  lot  of  drugs  and  they 
 gossip  and  they're  quite  rude  and  they 
 cheat  on  their  boyfriends  what  does  that

 start  these  videos  I  give  you  the 
 Jeffrey  and  Adonis  intro  then  it'll  take
[00:40] some  time  to  think  of  a  story  where  I 
 have  done  the  mistake  so  I've  been 
 creepy  I've  just  sat  here  for  like  a
[00:46] minute  really  just  asking  myself  okay 
 when  have  I  been  really  really  creepy  to 
 a  girl  and  honestly  like  I  can't  really 
 think  of  one  at  least  for  me  like  I  was
[00:52] way  more  reserved  to  never  come  across 
 in  a  negative  way  to  a  girl  and  so  you
[00:57] know  for  example  if  there  was  a  girl 
 that  I  was  into  sure  you  know  I  might 
 like  stare  at her  you  know  a  little  bit 
 and  obsess  over  her  but  I  was  never  the
[01:02] guy  who  would  be  like  spamming  her  phone 
 when  she  didn't  reply  like  I  was  always 
 a  little  bit  too  scared  of  coming  across
[01:07] as  too  creepy  and  so  I  was  on  like  the 
 underside  of  this  but  I  have  seen  other 
 guys  who  have  been  far  too  creepy  and
[01:13] they've  followed  like  these  three  bad 
 habits  and  there's  been  so  many  times  so 
 for  example  when  I  used  to  go  to 
 nightclubs  when  I  was  about  18  19  you
[01:20] know  I  was  just  getting  into  like 
 partying  for  the  first  time  life  I  would 
 go  about  speaking  to  girls  in  more  of 
 like  a  cool  way  like  I  learned  from  this
[01:26] like  cool  black  guy  of  like  game  and  how 
 to  talk  to  girls  but  there  would  be 
 times  when  I  would  go  out  with  female
[01:31] friends  of  mine  and  they  would  run  over 
 to  our  groups  and  now  this  guy's  being 
 creepy  this  guy  won't  leave  me  alone 
 imagine  this  right  now  imagine  you're  in
[01:37] a  party  or  a  nightclub  or  something  and 
 a  female  friend  of  yours  runs  over  and 
 says  that  guy's  being  creepy  I  want  you
[01:42] to  visualize  that  guy  what  does  he  look 
 like  who  is  that  guy  if  you  visualize 
 that  guy  who's  being  creepy  right  now  I
[01:48] can  see  him  he's  pudgy  like  he's  got 
 like  higher  body  fat  he's  not  fat  butt 
 but  he's  got  like  probably  20  body  fat
[01:53] he's  holding  his  drink  like  his 
 alcoholic  drink  up  here  and  he's  already 
 like  drunk  like  stumbling  over  the  place
[01:58] anyway  oh  come  here  like  he  wants  like 
 speak  to  some  girl  he  just  has  no  social 
 mannerisms  he  probably  stinks  he's
[02:03] unhygienic  he's  got  like  you  know 
 alcohol  he's  in  the  party  environment 
 he's  like  drips  on  [ __ ]

[02:09] you  drop  some  alcohol  all  over  it's 
 still  making  stuff  you  know  all  over  his 
 shirt  and  he's  still  trying  to  like  go 
 and  approach  girls  now  I  mean  props  for
[02:15] his  confidence  I  guess  but  if  girls  are 
 literally  physically  running  away  from
[02:20] him  because  he's  being  obnoxiously 
 creepy  obnoxiously  just  weird  and  like 
 too  full  on  you  never  want  to  be  that
[02:26] guy  not  only  because  of  the  effect  that 
 you're  having  on  the  girl  that  you're 
 literally  scaring  her  and  she's  running 
 away  but  also  I'm  not  the  same  guy
[02:31] anymore  but  back  then  when  a  guy  would 
 have  this  effect  on  like  a  girl  that  I 
 actually  liked  you  know  we  were  just
[02:36] like  friends  or  whatever  like  it  would 
 piss  me  off  to  the  point  that  I  would 
 actually  like  start  on  this  guy  and  like 
 I'd  actually  get  aggressive  towards  him
[02:42] if  some  guy  like  didn't  get  this  social 
 cue  of  like  okay  leave  the  girl  if  she's 
 physically  running  away  from  you  bro  and
[02:47] he's  still  stumbling  over  trying  to 
 speak  to  her  some  like  trying  to  grab 
 her  and  stuff  I've  never  hit  a  guy  like 
 that  but  I've  been  very  close  to  him
[02:52] multiple  times  like  I'm  the  like  I  was 
 always  like  the  guy  who  the  girls  would 
 run  to  and  this  isn't  me  trying  to  oh
[02:57] I'm  so  strong  because  it's  stupid  as 
 [ __ ]  like  I  could  have  easily  been 
 knocked  out  I'm  so  surprised  that  I 
 never  once  got  sucker  punched  when  I  did
[03:03] this  but  anytime  I  would  see  this 
 happening  and  the  girl  would  come  and 
 tell  me  like  oh  this  guy's  been  creepy 
 you  won't  leave  me  alone  I'd  go  over  to 
 women  are  fully  like  [ __ ]
[03:09] intimidating  him  tell  him  like  turn 
 around  and  walk  like  walk  the  [ __ ]  away 
 right  now  it's  not  a  nice  situation  to 
 be  in  not  only  again  because  the  girls
[03:15] running  away  and  it's  going  to  hurt  your 
 self-esteem  to  think  that  you're  the 
 [ __ ]  weirdo  creep  that's  like 
 repelled  literally  repelled  the  girl
[03:20] away  but  also  because  then  she  is  gonna 
 go  and  like  tell  other  people  and  you 
 just  don't  want  that  you  do  not  want  to
[03:25] be  seen  as  the  creepy  guy  and  so  there's 
 three  bad  habits  that  will  make  you  seem 
 really  really  creepy  and  unfortunately
[03:30] I'm  gonna  do  something  a  little  bit 
 different  I'm  gonna  slightly  black  pill 
 you  and  if  you  don't  know  what  the  black 
 pill  is  it's  kind  of  like  this  belief
[03:36] that  attractiveness  is  the  only  thing 
 that  matters  when  it  comes  to  dating  as 
 a  guy  I'm  just  gonna  give  you  a  brutal
[03:42] truth  which  is  gonna  seem  really 
 negative  for  me  to  say  this  to  you  but 
 this  bad  habit  that  makes  you  really 
 [ __ ]  creepy  is  that  you  pursue  or  you
[03:48] really  want  to  have  sex  with  her  but 
 you're  just  not  that  attractive  you're 
 not  the  kind  of  guy  that  is  in  her  brain
[03:53] her  subconscious  brain  that  is  past  the 
 eligibility  line  to  have  sex  slash  data
[03:58] in  the  modern  day  with  these  like  really 
 [ __ ]  dating  standards  that  are 
 happening  right  now  like  this
[04:03] eligibility  line  in  women's  like  Supreme 
 you  know  like  they're  not  like 
 autistically  thinking  oh  this  is  this 
 eligible  ability  line  but  like  just
[04:08] imagine  like  their  standards  is  here 
 every  couple  of  months  it  keeps  going 
 higher  and  higher  and  higher  and  I  can
[04:13] you  know  do  a  full  50  minute  video 
 explaining  this  maybe  that'd  be 
 interesting  if  you  guys  want  me  to  like 
 do  a  video  of  explaining  why  exactly  in
[04:20] really  good  detail  why  standards  for 
 women  are  going  higher  and  white 
 standards  for  men  are  going  lower  but 
 essentially  her  standards  keep  going
[04:25] higher  and  now  the  issue  is  that  if  a 
 guy  who's  below  these  standards  which 
 are  in  her  brain  tries  to  pursue  having
[04:30] sex  with  her  he's  going  to  be  seen  as 
 repulsive  which  essentially  this  is  like 
 a  black  bill  because  essentially  this 
 just  means  you  need  to  be  hot  you  need
[04:36] to  be  attractive  you  you  cannot  navigate 
 this  normal  dating  world  now  without
[04:41] being  attractive  and  I've  never  once 
 told  you  that  the  opposite  of  this  is 
 true  I've  never  once  told  you  that  it's
[04:46] fine  to  be  ugly  I've  always  said  from 
 the  start  that  a  part  of  our 
 self-improvement  journey  should  be 
 improving  our  physical  attractiveness  so
[04:52] many  guys  you  don't  realize  how  much 
 criticism  in  my  face  because  of  this  so 
 many  guys  have  called  me  shadow  for  this
[04:57] so  many  like  little  intellectual  little 
 nerds  have  called  me  like  a  bad  person 
 for  telling  young  men  that  you  should
[05:02] try  to  improve  how  you  look  because 
 that's  seen  us  really  shallow  that  scene 
 is  like  you  know  so  vain  or  something 
 and  for  so  many  years  I  was  seen  as  the
[05:08] vain  guy  that  was  like  narcissistic  that 
 cared  too  much  about  how  he  looked 
 people  said  that  was  shallow  and  yet  it
[05:13] helped  me  to  cultivate  love  in  my  life 
 love  and  sex  are  literally  fundamental
[05:19] needs  for  humans  and  if  right  here  right 
 now  in  this  modern  day  in  world  the 
 thing  that's  gonna  get  you  you're  a  girl
[05:24] who's  interested  in  you  the  thing  that's 
 going  to  attract  your  future  wife  and 
 the  mother  of  your  children  is  for  you
[05:29] to  just  be  a  little  bit  more  in  shape 
 for  you  to  just  be  a  little  bit  more 
 well  groomed  and  more  handsome  is  that 
 really  shallow  I  don't  think  so  so  the
[05:35] first  bad  habit  that  makes  you  really 
 [ __ ]  creepy  which  seems  just  so  like 
 horrible  for  me  to  say  it's  just  you're
[05:40] not  attractive  because  this  is  this  is  a 
 brutal  black  pill  we  can  have  two  guys 
 who  do  the  exact  same  thing  to  a  girl  so
[05:46] you  know  two  guys  text  her  the  same 
 things  two  guys  act  in  exactly  the  same 
 way  but  one  guy's  more  attractive  and
[05:51] the  other  guy's  not  this  guy  is  going  to 
 be  seen  as  charming  and  this  guy's 
 actually  going  to  be  seen  as  creepy  even
[05:56] though  they  did  the  same  thing  simply 
 because  of  the  person  that  they  are  and 
 most  likely  because  of  how  attractive
[06:01] they  are  this  is  a  brutal  black  bill  but 
 it's  something  that  we  do  need  to  accept 
 because  I  think  it  is  like  just  the
[06:06] truth  and  it's  something  that  we  need  to 
 just  bring  in  into  our  self-improvement 
 journey  to  realize  the  more  attractive 
 that  you  become  physically  attractive
[06:12] but  also  you  know  like  attractive  in  the 
 social  charismatic  sense  and  also  the 
 attractiveness  that  comes  from  having
[06:17] clouds  and  having  followers  and  having 
 money  like  you're  not  just  attractive  in 
 general  the  more  attractive  that  you 
 actually  become  the  higher  the  barrier
[06:23] for  you  to  seem  creepy  let's  say  you're 
 a  grotesque  man  let's  say  you're  just 
 literally  a  one  out  of  ten  two  out  of
[06:28] ten  man  and  I  hate  using  this  phrase 
 like  one  out  of  ten  two  out  of  ten  but 
 like  I  think  it  you  know  it  helps  us 
 understand  what  we're  talking  about
[06:33] let's  say  you're  an  absolute  like  just 
 not  attractive  guy  at  all  you'd  smell 
 and  everything  you're  a  one  out  of  ten 
 guy  well  your  barrier  to  be  seeming  as
[06:39] creepy  is  going  to  be  very  low  isn't  it 
 so  a  one  out  of  ten  guy  could  literally 
 just  make  eye  contact  towards  a  girl  and
[06:44] she'd  actually  get  a  little  bit  repulsed 
 let's  say  that  one  out  of  ten  guy  you 
 know  he's  really  obese  or  something 
 let's  say  he  just  loses  all  the  way  and
[06:50] suddenly  he's  like  in  shape  he's  not 
 jacked  or  anything  he's  in  shape  and  now 
 he's  like  a  2.5  out  of  10.  so  you  know 
 he's  just  went  up  a  little  bit  he's
[06:56] still  not  attractive  but  you  know  a 
 little  bit  well  the  barrier  for  him 
 being  creepy  is  just  slightly  wet  a 
 little  bit  higher  let's  say  now  he
[07:02] dedicates  the  next  few  years  to 
 discipline  builds  up  an  aesthetic  body 
 builds  up  like  this  physique  that 
 actually  makes  him  look  like  a  [ __ ]
[07:08] fitness  model  maybe  his  face  isn't 
 attractive  but  he's  now  literally  shaped 
 like  a  [ __ ]  Greek  god  and  now  he
[07:13] takes  like  sexy  pictures  you  know  maybe 
 he  can  hide  his  face  a  little  bit  but 
 he's  like  literally  got  six  pack  abs  and 
 everything  now  he's  at  like  a  four  out
[07:18] of  ten  a  five  out  of  ten  him  being 
 creepy  now  it's  a  little  bit  higher  and 
 a  little  bit  higher  and  a  little  bit 
 higher  if  that  guy  now  goes  and  gets
[07:24] call  out  and  gets  a  level  of  Fame  gets 
 successful  gets  a  nice  car  Grooms 
 herself  now  he's  a  five  a  5.5  and  a  six
[07:30] his  barrier  to  being  creepy  is  just 
 increase  so  if  you're  really  scared  of 
 coming  across  as  being  creepy  this  is
[07:36] like  long-term  advice  and  I  know  it 
 seems  a  little  bit  like  sad  and  you  know 
 negative  that  the  world's  like  this  but
[07:41] how  creepy  you  are  is  quite  quite 
 heavily  correlated  to  simply  just  how
[07:46] attractive  you  are  become  more 
 attractive  and  also  become  more 
 confident  especially  sexually  with  girls
[07:51] and  you'll  be  seen  as  less  creepy  so 
 understand  and  remember  this  if  you  have 
 low  smv  sexual  market  value  like  the
[07:58] things  that  you  bring  to  the  table  that 
 are  attractive  if  you're  not  very 
 attractive  if  you're  not  very  confident
[08:03] especially  when  it  comes  to  the  sexual 
 stuff  honestly  especially  when  it  comes 
 to  bringing  her  into  the  bedroom  if
[08:09] you're  not  very  confident  or  experienced 
 and  you're  also  not  attractive  it  can 
 really  come  across  as  creepy  the  second
[08:14] bad  habit  that  will  make  you  seem  creepy 
 is  not  getting  the  subtle  signs  that 
 she's  not  interested  now  I  just  recently
[08:19] did  a  video  which  I'll  link  as  a  card 
 right  now  so  you  can  click  on  that  and  I 
 went  over  a  bunch  of  signs  that  she 
 doesn't  like  you  and  a  lot  of  guys  don't
[08:25] actually  pick  up  on  these  you  know 
 they're  just  not  very  clued  up  in  like 
 these  social  sexual  mannerisms  and  so
[08:30] they  don't  really  get  the  message  and  I 
 think  that  throws  perfectly  encapsulated 
 and  I  want  you  to  just  ask  yourself
[08:35] right  here  right  now  just  for  a  few 
 seconds  maybe  pause  the  video  and  just 
 ask  yourself  do  I  get  the  message  that 
 she's  not  into  me  has  there  been  a  time
[08:41] when  you've  somewhat  pursued  a  girl  who 
 seemed  like  she  was  into  you  not  really
[08:46] and  you  know  you  just  really  wanted  to 
 see  and  you  know  she  wasn't  like  being 
 very  direct  the  issue  with  me  asking  you 
 this  question  is  because  the  guys  who
[08:51] are  a  little  bit  more  experienced  in 
 this  will  be  able  to  look  back  with 
 humility  and  think  yeah  you  know  what
[08:56] like  there  was  a  bunch  of  times  when  it 
 was  kind  of  clear  that  girl  wasn't  into 
 me  but  I  didn't  really  see  the  sign  and 
 I  was  really  like  overly  invested  I
[09:01] really  really  wanted  to  get  her  so  I 
 just  didn't  really  pick  up  on  the  signs 
 the  issue  is  if  you  right  here  right  now
[09:06] need  to  hear  this  advice  probably  likely 
 that  your  brain  won't  accept  this  advice
[09:11] that  this  is  for  you  right  here  right 
 now  that  you're  probably  not  picking  up 
 on  the  signs  that  she  doesn't  like  you
[09:16] and  that's  what's  making  you  come  across 
 as  creepy  a  lot  of  girls  and  even  guys 
 don't  really  have  the  confidence  to
[09:21] reject  someone  in  a  very  upfront 
 straightforward  way  it's  quite  rare  for 
 a  girl  to  straight  up  look  at  you  or  you
[09:27] know  to  text  you  and  say  hey  sorry  I'm 
 not  interested  in  a  relationship  with 
 you  or  I  don't  want  to  have  sex  with  you
[09:32] wish  you  all  the  best  goodbye  it's  very 
 rare  that  a  girl  is  that  upfront  with  it 
 because  most  girls  and  even  most  guys
[09:38] doing  this  like  very  Smiley  way  where 
 they'll  just  start  like  ghosting  you  and 
 you  know  it  makes  you  like  paranoid  you 
 start  thinking  about  it  more  or  maybe
[09:43] they  start  sending  you  like  shorter 
 messages  or  maybe  they  tell  you  like  oh 
 they're  too  busy  most  people  will  just
[09:48] kind  of  string  you  along  mostly  because 
 they  don't  have  the  confidence  to  reject 
 you  in  a  very  secure  upfront  healthy  way
[09:53] and  also  because  they  kind  of  slightly 
 [ __ ]  in  the  head  and  they  kind  of  like 
 the  extra  you  know  the  game  of  you
[09:58] chasing  the  most  people  like  that  even 
 if  they're  not  interested  in  you  just 
 gives  them  a  feeling  of  importance  and 
 makes  them  feel  good  about  themselves
[10:03] and  I'm  bad  for  this  myself  I've  done 
 this  many  times  as  well  which  means  that 
 guys  often  I'm  not  getting  a  very  clear
[10:09] upfront  rejection  they're  getting  more 
 of  like  a  semi  small  rejection  which 
 most  guys  aren't  picking  up  after
[10:14] because  most  guys  are  simply  too  needy 
 and  too  desperate  and  too  too  clingy  to 
 realize  it  now  this  is  something  that  I
[10:20] really  improved  on  as  I  got  a  little  bit 
 older  I  have  this  attitude  that  if  it 
 isn't  extremely  clear  that  this  girl
[10:25] likes  me  then  I  just  take  that  as  a  no 
 for  me  personally  if  I'm  considering 
 like  you  know  dating  a  girl  or  something
[10:30] I  want  to  feel  like  in  her  mind  it's 
 like  absolutely  like  [ __ ]  yes  yes  hams 
 is  amazing  that's  like  the  standard  that
[10:35] I  have  if  she  doesn't  feel  that  way  and 
 it's  not  so  clear  that  she's  into  me 
 then  I'm  not  gonna  like  chase  after  some
[10:40] girl  who's  like  you  know  some  vague  oh 
 yeah  she  might  be  into  me  she  might  not 
 because  once  you  have  like  a  level  of
[10:45] respect  for  yourself  you  start  to 
 increase  the  standards  of  like  which  you 
 want  your  partners  to  be  able  to  show 
 affection  and  attraction  towards  you
[10:51] chances  are  right  now  you  might  not  be 
 at  that  level  of  you  know  security  and 
 abundance  and  so  any  attention  that  a
[10:56] girl  gives  you  and  you  know  she  replies 
 back  to  your  text  messages  kind  of  feels 
 like  oh  well  she  she  kind  of  likes  me
[11:01] she  must  like  to  me  no  no  Hamilton  is 
 not  talking  about  me  here  he  must  be 
 talking  about  someone  else  I'm  talking
[11:06] about  you  bro  I'm  talking  about  you  and 
 the  girl  that  you're  into  and  you  just 
 don't  realize  that  she's  already 
 rejected  you  because  she  gives  like  this
[11:12] subtle  rejection  you  need  to  have  this 
 kind  of  personality  going  forward  where 
 if  a  girl  isn't  very  clearly  into  you
[11:18] you  just  kind  of  take  that  as  a 
 rejection  as  it  is  but  not  like  a  bad 
 one  not  where  you  know  you're  getting 
 pissed  off or  something  but  just  like  if
[11:23] she's  not  very  forward  that  with  the 
 fact  that  she  likes  you  or  at  least 
 she's  interested  in  pursuing  something
[11:28] then  you  just  kind  of  take  that  as  like 
 okay  whatever  boom  so  many  guys  get  the 
 smallest  little  bait  Bros  like  you  know 
 they  carry  it  on  a  stick  analogy  it's
[11:34] like  girls  are  just  dangling  like  not 
 even  the  whole  carrot  broke  like  a  tiny 
 [ __ ]  little  like  the  [ __ ]  stem  of 
 a  carrot  girls  are  just  dangling  like
[11:40] [ __ ]  Karen  and  a  bunch  of  desperate 
 guys  are  still  trying  to  get  it  because 
 that's  the  most  carrot  that  they've  ever 
 been  able  to  get  it  so  far  no  go  for  the
[11:46] full  carrot  bro  you  deserve  the  [ __ ] 
 full  well  you  know  what  I  was  gonna  give 
 you  like  this  little  false  hype  so  maybe
[11:51] you'll  like  me  more  maybe  you'll 
 appreciate  my  videos  and  you  know  you'd 
 feel  good  about  this  video  so  hopefully 
 you  click  on  my  videos  more  after  this
[11:56] bro  I'm  not  gonna  falsely  hype  you  up  I 
 was  gonna  say  like  you  deserve  the  full 
 carrot  bro  chances  are  you  probably 
 don't  I'm  sorry  to  be  [ __ ]  horrible
[12:02] but  chances  are  you  probably  don't 
 deserve  the  [ __ ]  full  carrot  you'd 
 probably  don't  deserve  her  like  full 
 attention  and  admiration  just  yet  I
[12:09] don't  want  to  be  an  [ __ ]  but 
 sometimes  you  need  someone  to  just  look 
 at  you  like  almost  like  this  older 
 brother  figure  and  just  look  at  you  and
[12:14] say  bro  you're  not  that  great  you're  not 
 that  attractive  you're  not  that 
 confident  you  don't  bring  that  much  to 
 the  table  if  he  got  in  a  relationship
[12:19] with  you  you  wouldn't  even  improve  her 
 life  in  any  way  now  you  think  you  would 
 you  think  it'd  be  awesome  dating  you  the
[12:24] thing  is  like  you're  not  that  great  as  a 
 man  it  takes  some  time  to  build  up  and 
 show  you  know  some  little  Tick  Tock  boy 
 with  the  perfect  hair  and  little
[12:29] six-pack  sure  he  might  be  able  to  get 
 more  girls  than  you  because  he's  young 
 and  attractive  right  now  but  for  most
[12:34] men  we  don't  have  amazing  genetics  for 
 most  men  it  comes  from  how  we  build 
 ourselves  the  best  thing  things  you  can
[12:39] build  is  your  physique  because  that 
 leads  to  so  many  better  benefits  and 
 then  also  your  success  because  if  you
[12:44] build  your  physique  and  you're 
 Successful  by  success  I  mean  like  in  a 
 work  success  business  success  grades
[12:49] these  two  things  give  you  an 
 astronomical  amount  of  confidence  they 
 actually  make  you  feel  good  about
[12:55] yourself  and  then  your  standards  for  the 
 people  who  come  into  your  life  increase 
 the  fact  that  you're  watching  this  video
[13:00] right  now  and  you're  hooked  onto  my 
 words  and  that  analogy  of  like  you  know 
 she's  just  beating  the  [ __ ]  stem  of 
 the  carrot  actually  meant  something  to
[13:05] you  means  that  you're  not  ready  yet  you 
 don't  deserve  the  full  carrot  you  don't 
 deserve  her  attraction  yet  now  you  can
[13:11] get  sad  about  this  you  can  get  upset  you 
 can  get  nihilistic  and  depressed  and  you 
 can  go  over  to  some  black  pill  videos  if
[13:16] you  want  or  you  can  you  know  get  pissed 
 off  at  women  and  get  angry  and  get 
 better  or  you  can  get  better  you  can
[13:21] think  to  yourself  right  now  without  any 
 level  of  hatred  and  think  you  know  what 
 as  much  as  it  is  kind  of  you  know  sad
[13:26] and  frustrating  to  not  really  attract 
 any  girls  the  thing  is  like  I  can't 
 really  blame  them  because  of  course
[13:31] they're  gonna  choose  the  guy  that  they 
 really  want  they're  going  to  choose  the 
 guy  who's  the  best  and  I'm  not  the  best
[13:37] yet  I  haven't  built  myself  up  to  that 
 point  the  same  the  greatest  thing  you 
 can  do  which  it  is  hard  it  takes  some 
 time  but  like  get  into  the  top  10  of  men
[13:43] in  your  area  the  top  10  now  obviously 
 this  depends  on  the  city  you  live  in  how
[13:48] old  you  are  and  everything  but 
 relatively  if  you're  lean  and  you  have  a 
 pretty  good  body  and  you  also  a  little
[13:53] bit  more  successful  than  every  other  guy 
 around  you  and  you  also  don't  do  a  bunch 
 of  like  the  really  bad  habits  like
[13:58] you're  watching  porn  and  jacking  off 
 every  day  you're  probably  going  to  be  in 
 the  top  10  percent  now  chances  are 
 you're  probably  not  even  there  just  yet 
 to  get  into  the  top  10  percent  of  men
[14:04] only  take  honestly  only  takes  two  years 
 like  it  took  me  two  years  honestly  it 
 takes  two  years  and  that's  if  like  I  was
[14:10] already  you  know  like  20  uh  23  so  23  to 
 25  right  if  you're  broke  you're  like  if 
 you're  younger  than  me  if  you're  16  17
[14:15] 18  bro  for  you  to  be  better  than  the 
 guys  around  you  go  to  the  gym  really 
 hard  and  discipline  yourself  for  six
[14:20] months  stop  eating  all  this  [ __ ]  [ __ ] 
 Western  food  that's  [ __ ]  up  your 
 brain  and  your  diet  and  your  body  fat
[14:25] percentage  start  pursuing  a  business 
 start  learning  how  to  make  more  money  as 
 soon  as  you're  making  like  a  thousand 
 dollars  a  month  bro  you're  like  if
[14:31] you're  18  years  old  and  you're  making  it 
 online  from  like  a  nice  little  business 
 that  you've  built  in  the  top  10  take 
 some  good  shirtless  pictures  you'll  be
[14:36] getting  girls  on  on  Tinder  on  Instagram 
 or  even  in  real  life  you're  walking 
 around  and  you  know  your  fit  is  looking 
 like  nice  snug  shirt  on  your  biceps  boom
[14:43] I'm  not  going  to  sugarcoat  things  for 
 you  and  I  need  you  right  here  right  now 
 to  listen  to  my  words  carefully  if  you
[14:48] want  to  keep  subscribed  to  my  channel 
 this  is  not  the  place  that  you  come  to 
 to  feel  good  about  yourself  with  this 
 false  hype  that  you'll  see  from  like
[14:54] school  and  every  other  [ __ ]  YouTube 
 channel  that  you'll  see  out  there 
 because  I  care  about  you  I  will 
 criticize  you  it's  in  the  masculine  way
[15:00] of  men  to  criticize  each  other's 
 weaknesses  and  to  point  them  out  so  that 
 we  can  improve  if  that  hurts  your
[15:05] feelings  good  I'm  sorry  that  you're  so 
 sensitive  that's  another  thing  that  we 
 need  to  work  on  you  can  stick  around  if
[15:10] you  want  right  here  right  now  and  just 
 hold  your  hand  up  and  say  you  know  what 
 I  will  keep  coming  to  hamster's  videos 
 because  he  actually  criticizes  my
[15:16] weaknesses  and  that's  something  that  I 
 need  even  though  it  offends  me  and 
 pisses  me  off  slightly  and  if  you  don't 
 want  to  do  that  then  you  can  go  find
[15:21] another  [ __ ]  I  don't  even  know  you 
 can  go  back  to  school  and  listen  to  the 
 like  oh  yeah  participation  trophies  and
[15:26] we're  all  amazing  like  how's  that  been 
 for  you  bro  you  need  to  hear  sometimes 
 again  you're  not  that  great  you're
[15:31] really  not  that  great  you  need  to  get 
 exposed  to  someone  who's  50  times  more 
 successful  to  you  I  don't  want  to  be  a 
 dick  I  really  don't  want  to  be  a  dick
[15:36] okay  this  is  what  I'm  about  to  say  is 
 going  to  sound  really  bad  but  bro  you 
 monthly  income  I  make  it  whilst  I  sleep
[15:41] and  I  don't  say  this  like  big  me  up  I 
 say  this  in  a  really  weird  way  to 
 slightly  put  you  down  a  little  bit  to 
 expose  you  to  a  level  of  success  that
[15:47] you  haven't  seen  the  amount  of  matches 
 that  you  get  per  month  on  Tinder  I  get 
 in  the  first  two  hours  of  after  creating
[15:52] an  account  and  I'm  not  bro  I'm  not  even 
 that  that  amazing  these  guys  who  are 
 above  me  who  literally  like  you  know  my
[15:58] monthly  income  or  something  they  make 
 overnight  you  can  see  this  [ __ ]  like 
 levels  to  this  [ __ ]  you  need  to  be
[16:03] exposed  this  is  the  issue  with  like  you 
 know  me  kind  of  telling  you  about  my 
 success  to  show  it  relative  to  yours  so
[16:08] you  can  think  oh  [ __ ]  that  guy's  so  much 
 more  successful  than  me  so  I  want  to  be 
 more  like  that  all  of  the  weak  people 
 are  gonna  get  offended  of  this  you  know 
 the  clean  the  guys  who  wear  like  clean
[16:13] shirts  and  they'll  be  watching  this 
 thinking  oh  that's  a  very  intellectual 
 you  should  be  have  humidity  like 
 humility  is  a  [ __ ]  awesome  thing  but
[16:18] people  confuse  it  bro  humility  and 
 humbleness  are  not  the  same  thing  I  am 
 not  a  humble  man  I  don't  think  being
[16:23] humble  is  a  good  thing  I  don't  think 
 being  humble  is  a  masculine  trait  being 
 humble  is  you  just  downplaying  your  real
[16:28] objective  success  of  the  world  humility 
 is  an  awesome  thing  humility  is  just 
 having  this  mindset  of  knowing  that
[16:33] there's  a  lot  more  progress  you  can  make 
 to  stay  a  student  to  keep  learning  have 
 lots  of  humility  sometimes  you  need  a 
 little  slap  in  the  face  to  just  tell  you
[16:38] bro  like  there's  so  much  more  that  you 
 need  to  improve  on  if  you're  struggling 
 with  girls  right  now  it's  not  because  of
[16:43] any  [ __ ]  circumstances  that  you  want 
 to  say  it's  not  because  you  live  in 
 India  and  it's  just  like  this  here  it's
[16:48] not  because  of  this  like  random  [ __ ] 
 circumstance  or  whatever  like  traits  you 
 want  to  bring  it  down  to  it's  simply 
 that  you  haven't  worked  hard  enough  in
[16:54] two  main  things  your  physique  and  your 
 success  build  them  too  and  also  you  know 
 with  that  comes  confidence  that's  an
[17:00] important  thing  to  build  up  but  build 
 them  too  and  you'll  be  doing  just  fine 
 so  the  fact  that  you're  watching  this 
 video  shows  me  that  you  haven't  done
[17:06] them  too  another  third  habit  that's 
 making  you  creepy  is  just  staring  and 
 this  is  particularly  true  if  you  stare
[17:12] at  her  body  now  I  think  if  you  hold 
 their  eye  contact  I  don't  really  think 
 that's  staring  like  it  could  be  you  know
[17:17] if  you  just  like  just  look  at  her  this 
 is  how  brown  guys  look  at  me  when  I  walk 
 past  them  like 
 no  smile  or  nothing
[17:23] and  then  when  I  get  like  sometimes  I'll 
 remember  okay  let  me  smile  I  smile  and 
 then  they  go 
 like  this  then  they'll  get  all  happy
[17:28] like  stuff  like  some  guys  will  literally 
 just  [ __ ]  stare  the  thing  is  if 
 you're  just  holding  your  eye  contact
[17:33] that's  a  good  thing  but  staring  looking 
 too  much  at  her  body  that  is  when  it 
 gets  creepy  and  that's  when  like  your
[17:38] attraction  lowers  and  again  this  is  so 
 interesting  because  a  Chad  a  really 
 attractive  guy  can  stare  at  a  woman's
[17:43] body  and  it  can  be  really  sexual  if  you 
 imagine  like  this  child  in  like  the  club 
 right  now  he  sees  some  girl  that  he's 
 attracted  to  he'll  like  he'll  I  [ __ ]  her
[17:49] body  bro  this  is  what  I  used  to  do  to 
 like  attract  girls  and  clubs  if  there 
 was  a  girl  that  I  liked  and  she  was 
 dressed  in  like  you  know  in  a  dress  or
[17:54] something  you  you  literally  make  it 
 known  that  you're  like  looking  up  and 
 down  and  that  can  seem  as  creepy  for 
 like  you  know  some  unattractive  guy  but
[18:00] if  you're  the  guy  who  she's  attracted  to 
 and  you  do  that  and  you  give  like  a 
 certain  little  look  where  you're  showing 
 oh  yeah  she's  she's  hot  that  honestly
[18:06] melts  some  girls  I  don't  think  this 
 video  is  that  good  because  honestly  in 
 the  end  all  it  just  matters  is  just  how
[18:11] attractive  you  are  the  barrier  to  the 
 actions  that  you  do  being  perceived  is 
 creepy  it's  just  linear  to  how  much  more
[18:17] self-improvement  you've  done  and  also 
 just  how  much  of  like  a  Chad  that  you 
 become  and  you  don't  have  to  become  the 
 ultimate  total  charge  you  don't  have  to
[18:22] become  like  this  10  out  of  10  guy  but  as 
 you  improve  your  looks  as  you  build  your 
 body  as  you  get  more  like  successful
[18:27] more  confident  as  you  get  better  at  like 
 grooming  yourself  through  all  the  other 
 things  that  I've  talked  about  I've  done
[18:32] like  a  full  Lux  maxing  guide  as  well 
 that  I'll  have  uh  linked  as  a  card  so 
 I've  done  like  a  full  40  minute  video  on
[18:37] like  how  to  improve  your  looks  the  more 
 you  improve  your  looks  the  more  things 
 you  can  do  which  are  actually  seen  as 
 attractive  instead  of  creepy  and
[18:42] throughout  this  video  I've  mentioned  the 
 importance  of  building  your  aesthetic 
 physique  if  you  want  to  get  the  workout 
 routine  that  will  build  the  most  sexy
[18:48] attractive  physique  they're  Linked  In 
 the  description  too  quick  and  watch  this 
 video  right  now  do  the  hard  work 
 especially  when  you  don't  feel  like  it

E3821TXtUaE,"[00:00] hi  there  did  you  know  you  can  perfectly 
 legally 
 through  a  government  scheme  earn  1
[00:05] million  pounds  a  year 
 completely  tax-free  by  using  commercial 
 property
[00:10] i've  got  your  attention  didn't  it  my 
 name  is  paul  smith  founder  of  touchstone 
 education 
 i'm  the  uk's  leading  commercial  property
[00:16] trainer  i've  trained  more  people 
 to  make  more  money  than  anyone  else 
 you're  possibly  thinking
[00:22] i  would  like  to  be  able  to  retire  or  i'd 
 love  to  be  able  to  retire  but  i'm 
 already  you  know  i  should  be  retired 
 already  and  i'm  not
[00:27] what  can  i  do  well  if  you're  in  a 
 situation  where  you  want  to  plan  for 
 retirement
[00:32] commercial  property  is  the  perfect 
 vehicle 
 to  use  because  if  you've  got  some  form
[00:39] of  existing  pension 
 you  can  transfer  it  it's  called  a 
 transfer  value  so  you  can
[00:44] move  it  from  maybe  a  company  scheme  or 
 maybe  a  private  scheme  and  move  it  into 
 a  personal  scheme  so  let  me  tell  you
[00:49] what  i  did 
 years  ago  now  i  traded  in  what  would 
 have  been 
 my  company  pension  of  8  000  pounds  a
[00:55] year 
 and  instead  of  8  000  pounds  a  year  when 
 i  was  60
[01:00] 20  years  ahead  they  gave  me  a  lump  sum 
 of 
 396  000  pounds  boom  so
[01:06] maybe  you've  got  hundreds  of  thousands 
 of  pounds  you  don't  even  know  about  you 
 know 
 if  it's  only  a  hundred  thousand  pounds
[01:11] happy  days  well  what  you  can  do  with  it 
 now  is  you  can  buy  commercial  property 
 the  first  commercial  property  i  ever
[01:17] bought  quarter  of  a million  pounds 
 and  it  gave  me  2  000  pounds  a  month
[01:22] think  about  what  i  just  said  the  other 
 thing  that  i  love  about  personal 
 pensions  is  they  don't  die  with  you
[01:27] annuities  die  with  you  okay  what  you  do 
 now  is  just  click  on  the  link  below 
 and  register  and  what  we'll  do  is  we'll
[01:33] give  you  instant  access 
 to  our  four  video  series  on  commercial
[01:39] property  that's  really  important  when 
 you  get  access  that  you  watch  it  in 
 order  because 
 i  go  through  the  process  of  you  know  how
[01:45] do  you  find  them  and 
 how  do  you  fund  them  and  how  you  can  get 
 commercial  property  freedom  in  just  one
[01:50] deal  typically  it's  pretty  much  all  it 
 takes 
 and  it's  completely  free  so  all  you  need 
 to  do  click  on  the  link  below
[01:55] and  take  advantage  don't  miss  out  and 
 the  final  thing  that  i  want  to  say  to 
 you  thanks  for  listening  by  the  way
[02:00] is  this  you  have  got  so  many 
 distractions  in  your  life  whether  it's 
 this
[02:05] facebook  or  whether  it's  instagram  or 
 whether  it's  a  telly  or  whether  it's  the 
 kids  or  the  dog  or  whatever
[02:10] don't  lose  this  single  golden 
 opportunity  to  click  on  that  button 
 because  the  chances  of  you  finding  this
[02:15] again  if  you  go 
 pretty  much  zero  don't  kick  yourself  in 
 10  years  time  when  someone  says  oh
[02:21] commercial  property 
 oh  yeah  10  years  ago  i  had  the  chance 
 but  i  didn't  do  it
[02:26] it's  free  for  goodness  sake  you've  been 
 wonderful  i've  been  poor
[02:31] see  you  on  the  training
[02:37] [Music] 
 you
